Speaker:

Hon. THEomA&s

ViENi

Thursday, January 27, 1944.
The Parliament of Canada having been
summoned by Proclamation of the Governor
General f0 meet this day for the dispatch of
business:
The Senate met at 2.30 p.m., the Speaker
in the Chair.
Prayers.
OPENING 0F THE SESSION
The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that lic had received a communication
from the Governor General's Secrefary informmng him fliat Hie Exccllcncy the Governor
General would arrive af the Main Entrance
of fthc Houýses of Parliament af '3 p.m.. and,
wlien if had been signified that ahl was in
rcadiness, would proceed to the Senate Chamber f0 open the Fiffli Session of the Nineteenfh Parliament of Canada.
The Sonate adjourncd during pleasure.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
At fhîree o'clock His Excellency the Governor Genoral proceeded f0 flic Senafe Chamber
His
and took bis seat upon the Throne.
Excollency was pleased f0 command the
attendante of flic House of Commons, and
fliat House being tome, with their Speaker,
His Excellency was pleased f0 open the Fifth
Session of the Ninctecnth Parliament of
Canada wit hfle following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Membors of flic House of Commoîîe:
The war is nov, in ifs fiffli year. The coming
months ivill wifness decisive baffles. Thcy vl
demand a supreme effort on the part of al
nations uni'ted in the cause of freedom.
it is truc fliat flic military situation is better
flian if was a year ago, and that co-operaf ion
among the United Nations is dloser than at any
time in flic past. At Washington, at Quebec, at
Moseow, at Cairo and at Teberan, military
plans for the comi ng campaigns werc fuily coordinated. Foundations were also, laid for a
uaifed approach f0 the problcmns of transition
The improved mi]itary
fromn war f0 peace.

situation does not, bowever, necessarily mean an
early end of the war. flostilities may continue
for a long time in Europe, as well as in the
Far East.- The German army is still very strong.
There are no indications of any general deterioration of German resistance. Gerînany herseif
is profected by a vast oufwork of coniqucred
territory.
She bas been fortifying herseif
against invasion since the beginning of the war.
Unfil the German army bas been defeated, the
.Mlied nations cannot count upon an assured
viofory in Europe. Until the Allied naval forceý
have grappled ýsuccessfully with the main Japaliese fleef there can bie no assurance of an end fo
the war against Japan. Future operations will
involve bitter fighting and beavy losses.
The winning of the war clearly remains tbe
first of ail objectives. My ministers believe it
is their dufy to sec that Canada's war effort is
firmly maintained until the encmy is defeated in
Europe and in Asia. Tbcy be]ieve tbe Governmenf's primary task, and the primary duty of
the Canadian people, is to concentrate on the
prosecuf ion of the war. Our fighting men muet
be assured that there will be no diversion fromn
flue vital fask and no relaxation of Canada's
war effort. Till the war is won, the policies of
my Government will continue f0 be sbaped to
that end.
Our armed forces at sea, onl land and in the
air have added lustre to the naine of Canada.
The armed might of the United Nations bas been
strengthen-ed by Canadian inutual aid. In the
combined Allied assault upon the Nazi fortress.
ail branches of the arrned forces will have stili
lieavier responsibilities.
W/hile giving to flic neede of the war pre(e(lcnce over ail else. niy ministers arc resolved
that, so f ar as fthc future can bie foreseen.
Canadla wvill hoe in a position to meet thc difficult
sifuitions whicb will have to bie faced when
victory is won.
As occupied countries are liberaf cd from the
cnomy, it will be necessary f0 provide for the
relief of destitiite popmulatiuons, anîd for the
rehabilifation of (levastatod areas in those countries whicli have borne the bruint of the ferror
and destruction of war. A measure f0 exteîîd
flic principle of mutiial aid so as to provide for
relief, as well as for materials of war, wvill be
suhmitf cd for yoîîr approval.
Canada's prospcrity and the well-being of lier
people are bound up witb fhe restoration and
expansion of world frade. Export markets are

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
I deeply regret to inform this House that
during the adjournment, between July 24
last and our re-assembling here on January
26, four of our colleagues in this Chamber
have passed to the great beyond.
The first to go was the Honourable Senator
The
Prévost, who died on October 13.

He was 'born of French-Canadian
Iles.
parentage, was educated in Montreal and later
pursued his studies in Paris and Rome. By
profession he was a journalist. He interested
himself in municipal organizations and in
charitable and patriotic activities. He was
elected to the House of Commons in 1917,
and again in 1921, 1925 and 1926. He was
summoned to this Chamber on June 3, 1930.
Senator Prévost was punctilious in his
attendance in this Chamber. He was greatly
liked for his modesty, and for his ability to
express himself clearly in debate and in
committee.
Senator Blondin died on October 29, within
a few days of the passing of Senator Prévost.
Senator Blondin was born in the province of
Quebec, and educated at Laval University.
He took an interest in municipal affairs,
having at one time been an alderman of the
town of Grand'Mère. And for a period he
was clerk of the Circuit Court in the County
of Champlain. Our late colleague was elected
to the House of Commons in 1908, and re-

4

SENATE

elected in 1911; and at the 1911 session be was
elected Deputy Speaker of the House of
Commons. In 1914 he became a Privy Counciller, taking the portfolio then known as
Inland Revenue.
The next year he was
appointed Secretary of State; and, in 1917,
Postmaster-General.
Two or three months
after that appointment he asked to be relieved
of his ministerial d'uties in order that he might
go back to Quebec to raise a regiment; and
when he had succeeded in this objective he
took his regiment oversoas. He returned to
Canada in 1918. and in that year was summoned to the Senate. When the Meighen
Government assumed office, he once again
becane Postmaster-General.
As honourable
members well know, he served as Speaker of
thec Sonate from 1930 to 1935. fe will be long
remembered here for the courtesy and dignity
which he unfailingly displayed in that office.
Senator Little passed away on December 21.
He was born in London, Ontario. of EnglishCanadian parentage, and received his educatien at the London Collegiate Institute and
the University of Toronto. He engaged in
commercial and agricultural pursuits. In the
general election of 1925 he was a Liberal candidate for the city of London; and in 1928 he
was suinioned to the Senate.
The late
Stnator had a personality that made friends
of all with whomi he came in contact. This
probably is illustrated by the fact that alithough
ho was officially known as Senator Little, to
his friends be was Sidney or Sid. Little. We
on this side of the Chamber will remember him
for the proficiency and patience be exhibited
as Whip of our party%-. He was at all times
most attentive 'to the work of the Senate and
of the conmittees on which he was elected to
at-t.
Finally, J wisi to refer to tie passing of
Senator Creelman MacArthur, of Prince
Edward Island, who died on December 29.
He was born in 1874, of Scotch parentage. He
engaged in a numbor of mercantile enterprises,
and served for many years as a director of
the Central Trust Company of Canada, VicePresident of the M. F. Shurman Company.
Limited, and Prcsident of Brace McKay &
Company Limited. Our late colleague took
an active part in municipal and provincial
politics. He was elocted to the Logislature of
Prince Edwxard Island in 1919. and re-elected in
1923. Two years late-r he was summoned to
the Senate. Senator MacArthur had strong
views on matters portaining to his province,
and when occasion arose he did net hesitate to
express thein.
I have but briefky sketched some of the
activities of our departed friends; and I would
conclude by expressing on behalf of my fellowHon. Mr. KING.

members and myself our deep and sincere
sympathy to the bereaved widows and families.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, since Parliament adjourned a few
months ago, the Senate of Canada has sustained a severe loss through the demise of
four of our ouitstanding colleagues: Senators,
Blondin, Prevost, Little and MacArthur. Their
passing is greatly to be regretted.
Senator Blondin. early in life, took a keen
interest in public affairs not only in bis native
province of Quebec, but in the Dominion as
well. During bis long public career lie was
prominoent and effective in both Houses of
Parliament. He exhibited at all times a broad
tolerance and a keenm desire to promote
throughout the Dominion a spirit of good will,
irrespective of race or creed, and did mnuch
to make this Canada of ours a united nation.
Senator Blondin naturally was always proud
of his native province, but at -the same time
ho firmly believed that Canada should always
maintain ber attachment to the Crown and
ber prominent position as the senior Dominion.
within the Comnionxwealth of Nations, for
lie realized that such connection has given us
in the past and assures us for the future complete freedom.
Because of his oratorical gifts and charming
personality the late Senator Blondin was frequentlv sought after as a public speaker.
Everyone on this side of the Chamber joins
vith the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. King)
and those associated with him in expressing
oxr deepest sympathy to Madame Blondin and
her family in their great bereavement.
i was not as well acquainted with the late
SnatorPrévoest as I was with Senator Blondin.
but I lid a great admiraiion for hîim and was
impressd with his retiring manner and wide
culture. Senamor Prévost was born and spent
nost of is life in his home citv of St. Jtérôme,
whith nesles amidst the beautiful Laurentian
hills. The late senator, a gifted writer, edited
and published a well-known and widely read
French (anadian publication.
Diiring our late collecague's lifetiie ho did
nuitch to proinemote and further the interests

of not onv his native province, but of the
Dominion as wel.
His scholarly writings
always reflected is steiling character. and his
tolerance and good will towards his fellow
Canadians.
All on this side of the Chamber desire to be
associated with the honourable leader in conveying to his family our deepest sympathy.
I am sure that I am expressing the deep
sorrow of every honourable senator when I
say we were greatly shocked to learn that our
much esteemed colleague the late Senator
Little had passed away so suddenly, and at the

FEBRUARY 1, 1944
comparatively early age of 58 years. Sanator
Little, as the honourable leader bas pointed
out, was born and brought up in the city of
London. He came from a distinguished family, and occupied the bighest position that the
citizens of London could offer him, that of
mayor. H1e was active at nîl times in charitable and educational work in bis native city,
and did his utmost for the benafit of its people.
Senator Little occupied the important position of chief Libaral whip in this Charnber,
and bis relations with the wbip on this side
ware always moat.cordial. Ahl of us on this
side of the Chamber desire to be associated
with the bonourabla leader opposite in exprcssing: our deepast sympathy :to our lata
colleague's family.
The passing of the late Senator MacArthur
was quite unaxpected, I arn sure, by honourable sanators, as he had not yýet reached the
allottad span of life, threescore and tan.
The late sanator devotad many years to
important affairs, as c mambar of tbe flouse of
Commons and of this Chamber. Ha was
very successful in business, and did mucb for
bis nativa province, Prince Edward Island.
Urilika many men engagad in business, aftar
he- had made a succass in this sphare ha gava a
grat daal of bis time to furthering and promoting the interests of not only bis native
province, but of Canada as a whole.
AlI the membars on this sida of the Chambar
desire to ba associated witb the honourable
leader and the membars on the othar sida in
expressing our daapest sympathy to tba
bereaved family.
Hon. P. R. DuTREMBLAY (Translation):
I should lika to join in the tributes of sympat.hy se aptly voiced by those who hava
speken before me in connection witb the death
of our four colleagues, Honourable Senaters
Little, MacArthur, Blondin and Prévost. Each
of themn playad a prominent part in bis own
sphere; eaceh one, in bis respective environment. was useful to bis country, bis province,
and his tewn. The death of those distinguisbed
colleagues is a great loss teo the Senate as well
as to Canada.
1 should like to refer especially to Senator
Blondin and Senator Prévost, whom I knew
better, since they were senators from my own
province. I becamýe acquainted with Senator
Blondin in my collage days, in 1892 or 1893he was a few years older than I-and aven
then ha gave indications that ha would risc
te a bigb position. Later. I mat him in politics.
Ha was bis party's candidate in tbe constituancy of Champlain, where I was born. We
did not bold the same political viaws; indead,
on matters that were important at the time
lIWhad political opinions diamatrically opposed

to mine, but I must say that I believe the
honourable Mr. Blondin was smncere and feit
that the policies he advocated were in the best
interasts of his fellow citizens. He became a
minister and later, Mr. Speaker, ha occupied
the honourable and prominent position which
you now hold; and we ail know that'he fuifilled bais dutias with much credit to hjmself
and to the satisfaction of ail honourable
senators. France made him a Commander of
the Legion of Honour. I wish to avail myseif
of this opportunity to tender my haartfelt
sympathy to his family.
As regards the honourable Jules-Edouard
Prévost, my daskmate, 1 must say that he was
a great nawspaperman, an outstanding educator, a good member of Parliament and a
good senator. In his younger days he was
the editor of a newspaper at St. Jérôme. Ris
editorials on matters connected with Canadian polities in general wara read and
followed with much attention by the leaders of that period, and quoted by the great
newspapers of this country. For nearly fifty
years he playad a prominent part in the province of Quebec. He waged a brilliant fight
on behaif of public education in that province;
and, with many okhers, ha advocated compulsory education. Fortunately for him, a few
.months before his daath ha had at the public
education board the privilege of rnoving a proposal racommending compulsory education in
Quebec. H1e was a most prominent educator, a
friend of teachers, of the modest young women
who teach in rural schools, and in that connection I amn sure that the citizans of bis
province will ever treasure a most grateful
mamory. of Mr. Prévost. Our departed colleague, who, as I have said, was a great
aducator and a prominent newspaperman, was
also a good and devoted member of Parliament, and during many yeýars he upheld here
In this

Chamber, honourable members, you were
able to appreciate hlm as a senator; and we

to bis family, tell lis children and his near

Canada.
H-on. A. C. HA.RDY: Honourable senators,
iis very seldom that I rise to speak on occasions of this kind, but at tbis time I wish to
pay tribute in a few words te ýmy very dear
friend, Senator Little, who from the time ha
was appointed to the Senate was my roommate, and whom, with his family, I had known
for over forty yaars. As is natural, in my
very close association with Senator Little I

6

SENATE

got to know him intimately. I need not
repeat the incidents of his career. They have
been ably dealt with here to-night.
Senator Little was a strong party man, but
he never allowed himself to be carried away
by partisan feelings nor to harbour political
animosity. For a good many years, as honourable members know, he acted as whip on this
side of the House, and I do not think anyone
will question my statement that he lhad as
many friends on the other side of the House
as on this.
From bis early youth, along with other
members of bis family, Senator Little took a
great interest in all kinds of publie affairs. He
began, as was natural, in his native town, and
held several high offices, including the chairmanship of one public utility for many years.
Senator Little was generous to a fault.
During the last war he and the members of his
family made large contributions of time, and
in other ways forwarded the war effort. Since
then he and his brothers have done a great deal
to assist Western University, in the city of
London, an institution in which Be retained an
interest until the last.
Although Senator Little was a man of strong
feelings, I do not think I ever heard him say
an unkind word of his opponents or of any one
else. He was always more than generous with
bis ti.me. From the beginning of bis career in
the Senate I, as bis room-mate, never knew
him to fail to place himself at the disposal of
people who came to him wanting to be introduced to this department or that, to ministers
of the Crown or to others for purposes of business. No matter who these people might be,
he aways took them under bis wing and gave
them every assistance possible.
Senator Little was a very useful member in
committees, and I do not think any member
of the Senate worked harder than he did. As
the honourable the leader has said, he was
known to everybody as Sid Little. That, I
think, is a criterion of what people thought
of the man. It was with great grief that I
found him gone at the opening of this House.
Hon. EUGENE PAQUET (Translation):
Honourable senators, my first words will be
to pay tribute to the memory of our late
colleagues, the Honourable Senators Creelman MacArthur, Edgar S. Little, JulesEdouard Prévost and Pierre-Edouard Blondin.
I wish to express to their memory our
gratitude for the services which they rendered
to our institutions. The road to victory may
be a little brighter, but there is still a long way
to go and this will require all our energies.
No matter how long and difficult the road may
be, we have resolved, with the British people,
Hon. Mr. HARDY.

to reach our goal. For this purpose we have
pledged all our intellectual, industrial and
human resources.
The death of Senator Pierre-Edouard
Blondin, notary, who passed away at the
age of 68, puts an end to the career of a
prominent countryman who held several official
posts in Canadian politics.
He entered the federal field in 1908. He
joined the Borden cabinet in 1914 as Minister
of Internal Revenue; he was appointed Secretary of State in 1915 and Postmaster General
in 1917. Holding the rank of LieutenantColonel, ho organized the 258th Battalion for
overseas service. He was summoned to the
Senate in ,1918. He was Postmaster General
in the Meighen Government in 1920, and from
1930 to 1936 ho was Speaker of the Senate.
In bis own province Senator Blondin was a
well-known and universally esteemed speaker.
I had the opportunity to acquaint myself with
bis character and sterling qualities. His life
was well filled, and he wi'l go down in history
as one of the most distinguished citizens of
Canada.
He was deeply attached to the
ancestral traditions of his beloved race, of
which he was very proud. So I wish to pay
tribute to the memorv of the late Senator
Blondin, whom I knew for at least thirty-five
yeaIrs.
For eight long years, Senator Blondin, a
.courteous, energetic and forceful speaker,
suffered from a cruel illness, which finally
vanquished the valiant combatant.
Death laughs at plans and hopes and carries
away its victims at the most unexpected
moments. We recall the friendly clasp of the
band now stilled in death. These distinguished
and worthy colleagues should be an inspiration
to us.
Honourable
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, I feel that I should be false to my
friendship with Senator Little if I did not
pay tribute to Bis memory. I agree entirely
with what the honourable senator from
Brockville (Hon. Mr. Hardy) bas said about
him, but there is one aspect of Bis life which
I think is well worth mentioning at this time.
We sometimes think that men who are prominent in business and whose ambitions are
largely devoted to the welfare of their own
business, are neglectful of public affairs. The
Little family Bas set an example to the rest
of the country.
The senator's father, at
one time mayor of London, was one of
those who promoted and participated in the
building of the University of Western Ontario.
Our esteemed and loved colleague followed
in bis father's footsteps as mayor of the same
city, and a brother is to-day a member of
the Board of Governors of Western University.

FEBRUARY 1, 1944
I mention this only to emphasize the
point that if more of our citizens who are
engaged in business and professional life
would give as much attention to public affairs
and comrnunity improvement as was givon
by the Little farnily of London, Canada would
ho mucli better off.

THE GOVERNÔjR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senaite proceeded -te the consideration
of bis Excellency the Governor Genieral's
Speech at the openg of the session.
Hon. J. FREDERICK JOUNSTON meved
that an Address lie presenited te bis Excellency
the Governor Geqierai to offer the humble
tbanks of this bouse te His Excellency for the
gracious speech whieh lie has been pleased to
make to botli Houseýs of Parliament.
He said: bonourable senators, I appreciate
the honour of having my namne connected witb
this motion, and I offer my sincere thanks te
the hontourable leader of the bouse (Hon. Mr.
King). I appreciate aIso the kind recept ion

accorded me by members on both sides of the
Senatýe after rny introduction heýre a few days
ago. I realize that one in the position I arn
in ut 'thýis moment is but an instrument to he
used in passing on the honour. In this case
the honour is inte'nded for the great agrieultural province of Saskatchewan, £romn which I
corne, and Ühe good people of rny old constit-uency who, for so long gave 'to me their
loyal support. I arn particularly graitified at
the honour done the province of Saskatchewan
and its residenýts.
The basic industry of Saskatchiewan, as ail
honourable senators well know, is agriculture,
and the chief branch of this industry in the
province is the production of wheat. Thait
being so, Saskatchewan was harder hit in the
period of drought than eitlior of the other two
prairie provinces. As a consequence of loss of
crops in the years from 1929 to 1936 our
farrncrs became very liard up, and thousands
were forced to accept government assistance.
During this pe-riod the provincial Governmenýt
was not able to balance its budget. The
Governrnent did, however, get through. the depression without repudiating any of its obligations, and to-day it is again showing surpluses
irîstead of deficits in the public accounts.
If you wcre to go inito the province of
Saskatchewan to-day and talk to the local
merchaats, they would telî you that tihe
farmers out there have more cash in their
possession now than they ever had before.
Probably this would net bave been tnie to the
same extent were it not for the fact that many
commodities needed on tihe ferrns are not
available. War conditions have forced the
farmers of Saskatchewan to carry on witli
obsolete and, in many cases, almoet brokenPeople who can corne
down machinery.
vlirough such a terrifie depression as was
suffered in this province, and once again figlit
their way back and up, as these people have
done, are desetving of all honour.
Honiourable senaitors, we are now in the fifth
year of this war. I well remember the
solemnity of the heur when lionourable mernbers of thie House of Commons, of whomn
I was thon one, were callod upon to vote
Canada into the war. 'Phat is a grave rosponsibility for any one te assume-4tho responsibil:ity
for takiýng action that it is known will lead te
the sacrifice of the crearn of our young manhood and womnanheod, livos that -are dear tio
ail of us and that Canada can ilI afford te lose.
Canada did enter the war, and lias now been
prosecuting it for nearly four years and five
rnenths. In referenee to -the fur'ther prosedutien of the war we find this passge in the
Speech from the Thlrone:
The winning of the war clearly rernains the
first of all objectives. My ministers believe it

FEBRUARY 1, 1944
That beautiful and gifted lady from China,
Madame Chiang Kai-shek, who visited this
capital on June 16, 1943, declared:
The accumulated heroism of your commandos,
the large amount of foodstuffs and munitions
which your country has sent to England, the
manner in which you have utilized your air
bases for training of Allied, effort, and the fact
that Canada has produced more for the war
effort per capita than any other member of the
United Nations, are indicative of Canada's will
to victory.
Some tributes have been paid to the Prime
Minister of this country. In this regard I
desire to recall this paragraph from President
Roosevelt's speech of February 16, 1942:
Yours are the achievements of a great nation.
They require no praise from me-but they get
that praise from me nevertheless. I understate
the case when I say that we, in this country,
contemplating what you have donc and the
spirit in which you have done it, are proud to
be your neighbours.
And again:
Mr. King, my old friend, may I through you
thank the people of Canada for their hospitality
to all of us. Your course and mine have run
so closely and affectionately during these many
long years that this meeting adds another link
to that chain.
Prime Minister Churchill on March 8, 1943,
paid this tribute to our Chief Executive:
In the darkest days, Canada, under your
leadership, remained confident and truc. Now
the days are brighter, and when victory is won
yon will be able to look back with just pride
upon a record surpassed by none.
Having this testimony before us, I think
honourable members will agree with me that
we have every reason to be gratified with
C-anada's war effort and with the administration of that war effort up to the present time.
I pass now to the subject of inflation and
price control. In this connection I desire to
commend the Minister of Finance and the
Chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board for the work they have done. I consider it the duty of each one of us to assist in
maintaining the price ceiling. I believe that
inflation bits the farming community barder
than any other class. Invariably in time of
depression prices of farm commodities are the
first to go down and the last to rise. To ensure economic stability for agriculture, the
Speech from the Throne declares that provision
will be made for a price floor for staple farm
products. I am confident that this will assist
the farmer over the period of falling prices at
the conclusion of the war. It will be recalled
that there was an alarming period of that kind
at the close of the last war.
To maintain the price ceiling we have had to
put up with certain quotas and restrictions.
Our wartime experience in this respect may
wel cause us to wonder what would be the

9

condition in this country if our C.C.F. friends
were ever able to give effect to their so-called
planned economy. The few quotas and restrictions of to-day would sink into insignificance compared with the full measure of
control which they would put into effect.
Our farmers, .ike the members of our fighting forces and, the workers in our munition
factories and shipyards, are doing a grand job
on the production line, even though handicapped by insufficient help and lack of implements.
Family allowances would greatly benefit
large families, but of course the maximum
payable to any family should be limited. This
is as it should be. Government relief distributed in Saskatchewan dýuring the drought
period had a demoralizing effect on not only
the recipient, but on the whole populace.
A floor under the prices of farm products,
coupled with family allowances, would obviate
the necessity of again dispensing direct Government relief.
Reduction of tariffs and removal of restrictions on the free flow of trade would cheapen
our cost of production and ensure us wider
export markets.
Our first and all-important duty of the moment is to our armed forces. When the war
is won, our duty and responsibility to those
who have been in,the front line does not terminate, but rather takes on new significance.
To this end 'it is proposed to establish three
new departments of Government:
1. A Department of Veterans' Affairs, to have
charge of the rehabilitation and re-establishment of members of the armed forces, and the
administration of veterans' pensions and
allowances.
We should profit from the experience gained
in dealing with these matters following the
last war.
2. A Department of Reconstruction, to promote and co-ordinate planning for national
development and post-war employment.
The scope given here need only be measured
by our ability to pay.
3. A Department of Social Welfare, to
organize and to assist in administering activities
of the Federal Government in the fields of
health and social insurance.
The health of our people is a matter of prime
importance to all, and every effort should be
made to improve and safeguard it.
Post-war planning falls into three broad
fields. First, preparation for the demobilization, rehabilitation and re-establishment in
civil life of the men and women in the armed
forces; second, reconversion of the economic
life of the nation from a wartime to a peacetime basis, and its reconstruction in a manner
which will provide opportunities for useful

10

SENATE

employment for all who are willing and able to
work; and, third, the provision of insurance
against major economic and social hazards.
A broad programme has already been developed for the re-establishment of veterans
of the present war, and for the care of disabled
veterans and the dependents of our fighting
men and merchant seamen. The maintenance
of full employment in :the period of transition
from war to peace will require a rapid and
'fficient conversion of our war industries and
the enlargement of markets at home and
abroad.
We had recently a distinguished visitor
in the person of Lord Halifax. While here he
made a speech that stirred up considerable
comment. We had at the same time another
distinguished Englishman, Lord De La Warr,
Ohairman of the Agricultural Research Coun,il in Britain, who came for the purpose of get;ng first-hand information in regard to agri:ulture. Lord De La Warr addressed a joint
meeting of Canadian Clubs in the city of
Saskatoon, and in the course of his speech he
made this comment on what Lord Halifax had
said in Toronto:
We must all be thinking of Lord Halifax's
speech of Monday night. Few of us have yet
seen it in full, certainly I have not. All that I
would venture to say now therefore is that
when considering it we should bear in mind the
circumstances. present and future. of the world.
The British Commonwealth of Nations has
been a great experiment, an experiment in
human freedom.
It bas stoodi many tests,
including those of two world wars.
But, if it is decided that closer and more
definite contact on foreign policy and defence
is needed, we must not think only of what is
necessary to maintain or strengthen Britain or
the Commonwealth. The issues are far larger
than that. Indeed, the real and only issue is
how shall we all be able to make our maximum
contribution to world security.
That is Lord De La Warr's comment on and
answer to Lord Halifax's Toronto speech. I
leave it at that. Honourable senators, I hope
I have not tired you. Before resuming my
seat, I should like to refer to an old Greek
proverb-I will ask the Greek scholars to pardon my pronunciation--"To kalon katechete;"
or, in English, "Prove all things." St. Paul used
those words in one of his epistles. But he
added to them. He said: "Prove all things;
hold fast that which is good." That was good
philosophy in the days of Plato and Sophocles;
it was good gospel in the days of St. Paul, and
I think it is good politics to-day.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN (Translation): Honourable senators, of all the events that took
place during the prolonged recess of the Houses
of Parliament, the one that concerns us most is,
every one will admit, the Quebec conference.
Hon. Mc. JOHNSTON.

The Old Capital witnessed the meeting of
British Empire committees entrusted with the
care of rounding up the common programme
decided upon and implemented by all the
nations of the Commonwealth. There, also,
met President Roosevelt and Prime Minister
Churchill, two political leaders well deserving
the confidence and affection of every one.
The measures adopted on that occasion were
as momentous as the decisions arrived at in
the course of the pre- and post-conference
talks. If the citizens of the city of Quebec
have reasons to rejoice in the fact that they
have tendered hospitality to such illustrious
msen and their military and political advisers,
all of Canada may well be proud of the
honour conferred upon its citizens. Indeed, a
few days after the conference ended, both
Houses, together with the people of the capital
city, had the opportunity of welcoming here,
on Parliament Hill, the great American statesman who holds such a prominent place in
Canadian hearts. Not only was it the first
time that this President of the United States
paid a visit to Ottawa, but it was also the
first time that any head of the neighbouring
republic visited our capital city.
This is a good omen, for we have very much
in common with our neighbours, and we love
them. Therefore, such a visit can only draw
closer together the bonds of esteem and friendship uniting our two peoples. Our Prime
Minister bas often held conferences with the
President. This time it was the President who
came to us. Such an exchange of courtesies
is bound to have happy results for the future.
The Quebec conference and the visit of
President Roosevelt to Ottawa both took
place at a time when the turn of military
events was especially encouraging for the
United Nations. The decisions arrived at in.
August last must have favourably affected the
military operations that have taken place
snce. We may sometimes be tempted to
consider that victory lies at tbe end of a
long and arduous road.
However, let us
estimate the progress made since El Alamein
and the success of the Russians since Stalingrad; let us consider the effects of the aerial
onslaugbt against German towns on the morale
of the population of Germany; let us not
abstain from enumerating our successes after
baving staunchly faced the reverses inflicted
on our forces by enemies whose sole ambition,
for a number of years. bas been to take
advantage of our peaceful dispositions.
We must net forget the glorious part played
by England in the defence of Western civilization and human freedom; nor must we
forget the share of the other Dominions in
the common resistance; and we must pledge
immortal gratitude to the United States and

know I c-an opeak English as well as French.
In the Speech from the Tbrone we find an
intimation that many social measures will
be put un the Statute Book at this session
of Parliament.
1 think we aIl realize that
social measures are necessary for the postwar period; but no matter how much social
legislation we pass, oniess world peace is
establislied and world trade flows freely there
will ual be true prosperity in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, Hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The prosperîty of
Canada is lnrgely dependent on the kind of
peace we are going ta have after this war.
The contribution Canada bias made ta the
war is equal ta that of any of the Allied
nations. Take mutual aid, for instance. We
haveo given motual aid ta Russia, ta sister
Dominions, ta Great Britain and ta China.
When peace cornes and the prime ministers
and other leaders of the different nations sit
around the conference table, is there any man
in Canada wba will be able ta accornplish
more than the present Prime Minister? May
Cod spare himl
Sorne Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not want ta
talk polities bore, and I do not think anybody can accuse me of attempting political
propaganda in this Chamber; but I ask yau
in aIl sincerity wliat aur ýCanservative friends
could do, even with John Bracken as their
leader.
Alrnost froma time immemorial the
Conservative party bias stood for restriction
of trade. If you bave restriction of trade,
no matter how much social legislation yau
miay place on the Statute Book, you will flot
have prosperity. Take the C.C.F. The members of that party, naturally, ignore the international situation. They think that simply by
passing social legislation. without taking into
account world conditions, we shaîll seocure prosperity for Canada. 1 arn not an economist,
but my common sense tells mne tbat the prospority of Canada depends on international
tradte; and in my opinion only one party in
this country will ho able ta exert sufficient
pressure at the poaco conference ta bring about
an easy flow of trade, and that is the Liberal
party.
Honourable senators. I bave rnucb pleasure
in seconding the motion of the honourable
senator frorn Central Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Jobuston).

EXCESS

PROFITS TAX-CHARITABLE
DONATIONS
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are called,
there is a matter which I should like to draw
to the attention of the leader of the Government in this Chamber, who is also, I am sure
we are all pleased to know, not only a Privy
Councillor but a member of the Government.
In yesterday m'orning's Ottawa Journal, I
noticed an item which reads as follows:
Finance Minister Ilsley announced Monday
night that the Budget to be brought down at
this session will contain provision for limiting
the taxation advantage obtainable by business
firms making large donations to charitable
organizations.
Mr. Ilsley said evidence is devoloping that
business concerns subject to 100 per cent taxation on excess profits are being solicited to
make unusually large contributions to varions
non-profit organizations.
Up to a point, he said, these contributions
are allowed as deductions from profits. Under
100 per cent excess profits taxation, however,
the main burden of the gift obviously falls on
the Dominion Treasury and ultimately on the
taxpaying public generally.
This item, honourable senators, which was
evidently given out to the press by the
Finance Minister, refers to donations to charitable organizations. Ever since I can remember, charitable organizations throughout this
country, and in fact in every other country,
have been dependent to a very large extent
on the good will of well-wishers who, from
time to time and frorm year to year, were
willing to contribute moneys to these charities.
If people who have been in the habit of making
charitable donations of a hundred dollars or
one thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars,
as the case may be, to various institutions
all over this country-hospitals, churches.
orphanages, homes for the poor, colleges and
schools-if these people are not to be allowed
to deduet such donations from their business
profits, what is going to happen to the institutions? We hear a great deal to-day about
social service and social security, and in a few
weeks we are going to be asked to decide
whether we shall pay a certain sum per head
for every child in every family. Many of the
people who to-day support colleges and

13

schools were in their youth unable to get much
so called higher education, yet through their
brawn and brain built up successful business
enterprises that are a credit to this country.
Out of the profits received from their businesses they have made and are making contributions to colleges and schools in order
that poor children of to-day may find it easier
Surely, honourable
to acquire education.
senators, this is much better than giving poor
families a hand-out of $7 or $9 a week for
every one of their children.
Business profits provide the chief source from
which these charitable donations can come.
Under our excess profits tax law, some people
who have an income of more than $5,000 a
year find it necsesary, in order to pay their
taxes and other bills, to dig into their capital.
Otherwise they could not keep their businesses
and homes going. However, I am not going
to discuss our present tax system to-day, as
we shall have another opportunity of doing
that. What I want to do-this afternoon is to
call the attention of the honourable leader of
the House to my views upon this latest proposal of the Finance Minister, views which
I am sure are shared by thousands of people
all over Canada. The proposed amendment
to the excess profits tax will strike a blow at
educational institutions and charitable organizations from one end of this country to
the other.
To take 100 per cent of a man's profits is
bad enough, but surely it is even worse to
refuse to allow tax exemption with respect
to money gifts to institutions such as I have
mentioned. For instance, why should I have to
pay a tax on $100 that I give every year to a
coloured orphans' home outside Halifax? I am
not boasting about the gift at all; I merely
mention it as a small instance of the kind
of support that thousands of business men are
giving to institutions that are doing a good
work in this country. I ask the honourable
leader of this House, who is a member of the
Government, to say to his colleagues that in
my opinion this proposed amendment to the
excess profits tax would be mistaken legislation and contrary" to the best interests of this
great country.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
think no one realizes better than does the
honourable senator who bas just spoken, the
duties and responsibilities facing the Minister
of Finance at this time. We are at war, and in
order to prosecute that war it is necessary to
obtain large sums of money fron the public.
Under our present law, gifts made to certain
institutions, including universities, are exempt
from taxation. Within the last few months
certain universities have been soliciting large

14

SENATE

sums of money from sources where money is
to be had. The Minister, having learned of
this, took advantage of the first opportunity
to indicate, and I think very properly, that
his Budget will contain provision for limiting
the tax exemption on such gifts. But a certain
proportion of the amounts donated would still
be tax exempt. In a statement made in another place on January 31 the Minister said:
For example, in the case of the ordinary
commercial or industrial corporation the tax
advantage in respect of such contribution will
be limited to 40 per cent of such contribution,
even if the corporation is subject te tax at the
100 per cent rate on its excess profits.
I think that after the Minister learned that
certain universities were making a drive to
obtain large donations which, under the provisions of the present law, are exempt from
the excess profits tax, he would have been
remiss in lis duty if he had not advised
Parliament that he intended to have these
provisions modified. ýI am sure no one in
Canada is more desirous than the Minister
of Finance that our universities should be
provided with adequate funds; but, on the
other hand, his chief responsibility is the
securing of money for prosecuting the war.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I rise to a point of order. I submit
that this discussion is entirely out of order.
The business that should be before this
Chamber at the present time is the Address
in Reply te the Gracious Speech from the
Throne, and in my opinion it would not be
proper to continue this discussion.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL'S SPEECH
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Johnston for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, my first pleasant duty is to congratulate sincerely the mover of the Address
(Hon. Mr. Johnston) and the seconder (Hon.
A. L. Beaubien) upon -their informative and
interesting speeches. May I also be permitted
to say to the mover, who was introduced into
the Senate only last week, how pleased I
am to see him a member of this House? I
met hin first some twenty-seven years ago,
when we both became members of another
place. The Union Government was then in
office. His long parliamentary experience will
prove very useful in this honourable chamber.
In his speech yesterday my honourable friend
made one statement that seemed to me particularly significant, namely, that the farmers
Hon. Mr. KING.

of Saskatchewan never had as much cash in
their possession as they have at present. In
previous sessions we were accustomed to hear
of the dire conditions of the West, which
were attributed to the low price of grain, or
to soil drifting, or to damage done by hail,
grasshoppers, frosts, and so on. So it was
indeed cheering to hear what our new senator
from
Central
Saskatchewan
(Hon.
Mr.
Johnston) said about the present prosperity
in his province.
The seconder of the Address, my genial
friend from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), delivered in French a speech which
I am sure must have been enjoyed by every
honourable member who understands that
language. But when he spoke in English I
was surprised and disappointed te hear him
make the unwarranted statement that if Hon.
John Bracken came into power he would place
on the Statute Book restrictive measures that
would seriously impair not only the home
markets of Canada but also our export'trade.
It does not become my honourable friend to
make such an inaccurate statement, for I
know, as do many other honourable members
of this House, that during the twenty years
or so in which Mr. Bracken headed varions
political combinations in the province of
Manitoba, he never had a more faithful follower than the honourable gentleman from
St. Jean Baptiste. No one knows better than
my honourable friend that should our leader
come into power he would net impose a high
tariff or any other restrictive measure that
would in the slightest degree interfere with
either our home or foreign markets. On the
contrary, progressive man -that he is, and
better acquainted with agricultural conditions
than is the leader of any other political party,
his policy would probably lead to a great
expansion of trade both in Canada and
overseas.

Honourable senators, this may very well
prove to be the most momentous session in
the history of this country. It is within
the bounds of possibility that our arch enemy,
Germany, may be defeated before this year
is out. Our great leaders do not say that
.4he will be, but they do say that her end is in
sight. No one can make a definite forecast,
but let us hope and pray that our Allied forces
will achieve decisive victory during the current year. We have been greatly cheered
along the way by the wonderful successes of
our armed forces during the past year. We
cannot, however, close our eyes to the fact
that the road to final victory will involve tremendous casualties, and that great sacrifices
will have to be made, net only by those at
the battie front. but also by those on the
home front. The necessary combined effort

FEBRUARY 2, 1944

will, I am sure, be made. Once more may I
express -the hope that before this Parliament
adjourns we may be acclaiming the defeat of
Germany.
I come now, honourable

senators, to the

gracious Speech from the Throne.

It fore-

casts much important legislation. In order
that this session may not be too prolonged,

I would urge my honourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. King) and his associates in the

Government to bring down this legislation in
concrete form as speedily as possible.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE. It would be
impossible for me or any other member of
this Chamber to attempt to debate al the
important legislation set forth in the Speech.
Speaking for myself, I prefer to wait until
the bills are before us. Then no doubt they
will, as is usual, be given careful attention as
promptly as possible, so that the session may
not be unduly prolonged.
There are two reasons why I hope, though
it may be without much justification, that this
session will be a short one. First, should the

session not be too long it would enable the
Prime Minister and his cabinet to devote
full attention to vigorous prosecution of the
war. Secondly, the Prime Minister will likely

attend an Imperial Conference of great sigOf course, I cannot speak for
nificance.
the other place, but in so far as this Chamber

is concerned I assure the honourable leader
opposite that we on this side will do every-

thing we can to expedite the business of the
session. Let me once more urge him not to
delay the bringing down of these important
measures; let them be submitted to us at as
early a date as possible.
Two of the measures are urgent. The first
to which I wish to direct attention is the
one dealing with the housing problem.

Hon-

ourable members are aware that there is an
acute housing shortage throughout the entire
country, particularly in the large cities and
towns, but I want to refer more particularly
to my own city of Montreal. I think the
housing problem should be dealt with in two
parts; that is, there should be what may be
termed an emergency programme, as well as
a post-war programme. In my own city it is
almost impossible to rent either a house or
an apartment. Judging from the photographs
that have appeared in the Press, many working
people in that great commercial metropolis
are living under appalling conditions in houses

unfit for human habitation.
In order to convey to this Chamber how
appalling conditions are, I should like to quote
the following remarks of an alderman of the
city of Montreal:

City Councillor Dr. J. Stanley Allen, who
spoke at the Central branch meeting, admitted
that the recent amendment to Rentals Orders
294 will prevent a number of anticipated
evictions on May 1, but, he maintained, this
would solve Montreal's housing problem in very
small part only. He wanted to see additional
construction undertaken without delay.
In support of his views, Councillor Allen
told the meeting that at the present time over
1,400 Montreal families are living in stores,
sheds, cellars, and other places not intended for
human habitation and that, in addition, another
4,000 families are "doubling up" with friends
or relatives.
I am sure every honourable member will agree
with me that the conditions described by
Everyone
Alderman Allen are disgraceful.
wants to prevent unrest in this country and
preserve the fullest possible degree of unity,
but discontent is bound to prevail and be
followed by unrest if our working people are
forced to live under such conditions. I would
suggest to my honourable friend that at an
early date a-rrangements be made for a meeting here of representatives from each of the
provinces and from our larger cities, so that
they may sit down with our federal officials
and ascertain the immediate and post-war

stru.ction costs and, rental value, various types
of bouses should be considered, for what would
be suitable in British Columbia would not be
practical in eastern Canada. During the last
session or two we havq heard a number of
speeches on post-war housing, but surely,
honourable senators, the time has come when,
instead of listening to further theoretical suggestions, we should get down to hard pan
and apply ourselves 'to a solution of this
difficult and pressing problem.
I would also suggest that at the proposed
meeting the Dominion and provincial governments should decide among themselves what
would be a fair measure of assistance by way
of subsidies to encourage building. I am sure
they could come to an agreement. 'If my
suggestion is carried ttirough to its logical
conclusion, I sec no reason why it would not
be feasible to start immediately building
houses in Montreal and other large urban
centres, and so relieve the appalling conditions
which I have brought to your notice.
I desire now to draw the attention of honourable senators to the recent order for an

oniy a few weeks ago that, this home defence
force numbers 65,000 men. I do flot want to be
unfair, but I must say tihat; I neyer could see
why, during the last two yoars, the Government considered it neýcessary to ro-tain such a
large army in Canada, at great expense to the
country. The old miliýtia, now regarded as a
reserx-e force, would be quite capable of
looking af-ter peace, order and good govo-rnment, though let us hope the occasion will
neyer arise when the militia's services will be
rcquired for tihis purpose. To augment t-be
home defence army at, the present time is, I
submait, en.tirely wrong, yet I arn informed on

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: We know also
that when the rest of our forces, now in England, get into action, they will show themselves the equal of those who have already
been engaged in the countries I have mentioned. May I say also how proud we are of
our Canadians in the Air Force and in the
Navy. They have all played a splendid part
in the war, and I am confident that when
victory is eventually won Canada will have
reason to be proud of the part played by her
armed forces.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, Hear.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
before I proceed with the main portion of my
remarks, I should like to join with my honourable friend opposite in congratulating the
mover (Hon. Mr. Johnston) and seconder
(Hon. A. L. Beaubien) of the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne. Both of these
honourable senators have had a long experience
in parliamentary life, having served for many
years as members of the House of Commons.
It is gratifying to us to find that the honourable senator from Central Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Johnston) who, while in the other House,
served as Deputy Speaker, is now a member
of this Chamber, having been summoned here
within the last few months. I am sure that his
knowledge of agriculture and commerce in the
great province of Saskatchewan will be of real
benefit to this assembly. As far as our friend
from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. A. L. Beaubien)
is concerned, I do not need to say very much.
He was well known in the House of Commons,
and since 1940 has been a member of this
Chamber. I wish to thank him for the contribution he has made to the present debate.
My honourable friend opposite has been
very fair, as he usually is. He bas not been
severe in his criticism. He has brought to our
attention certain matters that are being discussed, not only in this Chamber, but throughout the country-side. The honourable gentleman referred to certain important questions,
and in mentioning them briefly, I am not
closing off inquiry.
Very properly, I think, he brought to our
attention one of the most important matters
mentioned in the Speech from the Throne. I
refer to housing. It is truc that in Canada
to-day there is a great lack of proper housing
facilities for our people. This is particularly
true in the large centres of population. It is
easy to understand the reason for this condition. The necessity of establishing huge
war plants and employing large bodies of
men and women in those plants bas resulted in overcrowding in our cities. It is
also truc that for the last four years-in
fact, it is going on five years now-there has
106-3

been very little home construction in Canada.
This bas been largely because our people have
been engaged in war production, which bas
absorbed a great proportion of the supply of
materials that ordinarily would go into the
construction of homes. I do not think it is
possible at this stage of the war to divert
large quantities of these materials-lumber, for
instance-froin war uses to home-construction
purposes. I understand that fifty per cent of
the lumber produced in this country to-day is
going to Great Britain, and ten per cent to
the United States, ma-inly for war purposes,
leaving us with only forty per cent, much of
which is used in war production.
It is suggested in the Speech from the
Throne that the Government will review the
housing situation and bring down a supplementary housing programme. As is well known
to honourable members of this Chamber, since
a number of years before the outbreak of war
the Government bas been advancing money to
assist people of little means to secure homes

of their own.

Over $60,000,000 lbas been ad-

vanced for that purpose, and operations have
been carried on in such a manner that there
bas been no loss to the Dominion treasury.
Thousands of people, owing to changes in
the requirements, have ceased work on the
production of war materials and have been
transferred to other occupations. It is true
that, as was bound to be the case, there has
been some dislocation, some inconvenience,
and in some cases even hardship; but I think
we should realize that up to the present the
situation bas been fairly well met. The Minister who has this matter in hand merits our
sympathy, for he bas one of the most difficult
and trying problems any minister could
have, and, the Department of Labour,
bas to make some regulations that our people
do not like. Canadians are not accustomed
to being regimented and told to go here and
there. But let us not forget that almost from
the first the complaint of this country bas been
that people were not being told to go here
and there, wherever they cou'ld best serve.
While to-day the department's regullations,
which I think are being carried out efficiently
and without favouritisme, may cause some inconvenience and hardship to individuals, this is
a condition that cannot be avoided in time of
war.
The policy of securing men for the forces
was debated and adopted in Parliament some
two years ago. My honourable friend conplains that men are drafted or taken under
the National Selective Service Act. But experience has shown that this bas created a
large manpower pool from which there bas

REVISED

SENATE

been a steady flow of recruits te the armed
forces overseas. There is no doubt about it
that many young men, after being drafted and
claimed, have volunteered for service anywhere in the world.
My honourable friend says that there are in
Canada some 60,000 soldiers. Well, many of
these men have been engaged in Newfound]and and Alaska. I do not think my honourable friend is serious when lie says we should
not keep a large body of men in Canada at
this time, and that this army should be discharged and put into industry.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will my honourable friend allow me to interrupt him a
moment? I have stated on previous occasions,
and I re-stated to-day, that I always favoured
our maintaining the necessary military forces
on our coasts, and also in Newfoundland and
the Aleutians. But why should we keep such
a large body of soldiers in the interior of
Canada?
Hon. Mr. KING: It is not difficult to
answer that question. In the development of
the training programme throughout Canada,
centres were established not only on the coasts,
but in the various provinces, and from these
centres trained men are moved to coastal
areas from time to time as required. Also it
has to be remembered that since the war
England, with the many thousands of
soldiers on active duty and in training there,
has been a very crowded country, and on that
account it was surely wise for us to train as
many men as possible in Canada, with its
abundant supply of food and ample room for
military exercises. Men are steadily going forward from our training centres to England as
required, and I have no doubt that within the
next few months many more will be transferred
overseas.
I should like to speak for a few moments
in a general way of the Speech from the
Throne and the Government's programme as
outlined therein. This is the fifth session of
the present Parliament, and the fifth year
of the war. I think that any one who reads
the Speech with care will conclude that the
Government was above all trying to impress
upon the people of Canada that -the winning
of the war is still our p.rimary objective, and
one that requires the full support of every
Canadian. But it was, thought that in the
fifth session of this Parliament there should
be presented legislation which would indicate
the Government's post-war policy and be
available if the war should cease before we
entered upon another session.
I believe honourable members will agroe
that it has been the desire of our public men

should be avoided. So in 1939, a few months
after the war began, the Prime ,Minister of
Canada suggested that certain men prominent
in the public service of the country should
immediately undertake a study of post-war
conditions. I believe that when war was declared very few people thought it would last
for five years, or six years, as it apparently
will. In any event, committees were set up
for the study of post-war conditions. Thon
prominent men from our universities and
from industry came forward and indicated
their desire to contribute their knowledge,
experienc" and ability to the making of these
studies.
Some two or three years ago the House
of Commons appointed a special committee
on reconstruction and re-establishment, and
last year we in this Chamber appointed a
similar committee. The idea in both cases
was that in this way Parliament might be
made familiar with all that had been learned
as a result of the various studies and inquiries
carried on since the war. The evidence given
before both committees is on record. At our
own committee last year we had interesting
material placed before us, not only by experts who had been engaged by the Government to make reports and prepare data with
respect to post-war problems, but also by
representatives of important outside groups,
such as chambers of commerce, labour organizations, veterans' associations and professional
bodies, particularly those interested in medicine, hospitalization and nursing. That was a
most encouraging and heartening feature of
our committee's work, and I think it indicates
an important trend, because I am satisfied
that if after the war, we can get from our
people the same co-operation they have
given during the war, the period of reconstruction may be one of great advantage to
our country.
In the Speech from the Throne the Government indicated its intention te set up a
Department of Reconstruction, which will be
headed by a responsible minister. The significance of that announcement is that matters
which for the last two or three years have
been more or less up in the clouds will become
subjects of administration by departmental
officials. It will be the duty of the minister
to assemble and correlate the various proposals
that have been made from time to time.
Now I should like, as my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) bas done, to
pay tribute to the men and women in our
armed forces. It is net my purpose te speak
at length to-day on the accomplishments of

FEBRUARY 2, 1944
our fighting services and -our war îndustry. I
think it is generally recognized, flot only in
t-his country but throughout the Allied nations,
and also in enerny caurâtries, that Canada has
played no mean part in this war. Speaking of
aur manpower, I merely wish ta give a 'few
figures. In the Army to-day there aTe 470,000
men, and in the Navy, 70,000.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would tihe honaurable
leader break down thýat 470,000, and tell us
how many are serving outside ýCanada?
H1on. Mr. KING- I cannot speak definiitely,
but I thinlc there are about 3W0,000 overseas.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That would leave about
170,000 in Canada.
Hon. Mr. KING: 1 think so, though 1 arn
not quite sure.
In the Air Force we have to-day 185,000 men.
Then, in the vairiaus armed services, there are
3,7,000 women. This makes a total of 762,000
men and women now enrolled in Canada's
armed services.
1 arn bappy to join my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) in paying
tribute ta, the men in our Naval Service. It
was gratifying to Canadians a few days ago
to bear the First Lord of the British Admiralty
express his admiration of the work of the
Canadian Navy. H1e said it was an amazing
thing that young men from the interior of
Canada could within a very short time accommodate themselves to service afloat. Canadian parents are proud to know that their
sons, from whatever section of the Dominion
they corne, are sa well qualified ta uphold the
great traditions of the Navy.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: It is not necessary for
me to speak at length on the Air Force.
When we read reports of the bombing raids
over B3erlin, Frankfurt, Brunswick and other
German centres, and note the increasing
number of R.C.A.F. bombers taking part, we
are proud of our airmen; 'but we realize to
the hazards when bomber lasses are announced
and we learn that out of fifty bombers missing
probably ten were Canadian. Our airmen are
taking a leading part in this global warfare,
and are helping ýto maintain air supremacy
for the UJnited Nations.
As to the women in the Canadian armed
services, the importance of their contribution
to the war effort can best be appreciated by
inquiring of those in charge of the 'Canadian
Wom-en's Army Corps, the Women's Royal
Naval Service, and the Women's Auxiliary
Air Force. Then only will a inyman realize
how helpful aur women have been ta the
Army, the Navy and the Air Farce.

In addition ta the 762,000 men and wamen
in the armed forces, thcre are more than
1,000,000 working in aur war plants, and
another 2,100,000 engaged in agriculture and
other civil occupations. There may be reason
for complaint here and there an the ground
of persanal inconvenience, but take it all in
aIl, with that proportion of aur population
of some 11,000,000 engaged in the war effart,
aur people have thown that they are prepared ta accept war conditions. I think
there will be general agreement when I say
that this attitude is due in large mensure ta
the fact that the Government brought about
the change from pcace ta war with the least
possible dislocation of civil life.
During the past year same notable conferences have taken place between the Allied
leaders, and, it is only right to refer ta theni,
because they illustrate the great changes
that have taken place in world travel. The
grent leaders of the Allied Gavernments, wit1b
their military advisers and tecbnicians, have
met in Washington, Quebec, Mýoscow, Cairo
and Teheran. At these meetings they developed and ca-ardinated plans far offensive
warfare flot only in the European theatri
but an the Pacific front as well. The meeting
in Moscow of Mr. Molotov, Mr. Cordell HulI
and Mr. Anthony Eden, representing their
respective cauntries -of Russia, the United
States and Great Britaîn, prepared the way
far the meeting at Teheran of Marshal Stalin,
President Roosevelt and Prime Minister
Churchill. It is interesting ta note that Marshal
Stalin, the remarkable leader of the Soviet
army and people, was present at Teheran, and
that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek conferred
with Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Churchill at
Caira. There can be little doubt that as a
result of the excbange of views at those conferences extensive plans were made for pressing the war against Germany and Japan with,
the utmast vigour.
We in Canada have resson, tQ be proxd that
one of these momentous conferenees took
place in the old and historie city of Quebec.
I think we may fairly assume that that conferenýce was beld in recognitiovn of the wsir
effort of ýthis country, and also, in appreciation
of the part that our Prime Minister, Right
Hon. Mir. King, bas played, not only ük
furthering our war effort, but also' in bringing:
about a fuller understnnding beitween Great
Britain, the United States and Canada-an
understnnding that bas made it possible for
these th-ree great counitries -tu po~ol their
resources and helýp bring about tihe striking.

RING.

FEBRUARY 2, 1944
that they as a party were going to do great
things. I claim that these men, if they are
honest in dealing with this problem and honest
with Parliament, should at least indicate the
legislation that has been passed for the benefit of the returned soldiers. This should not
be a political question. Every man in Parliament is interested in the problem of the
returned soldier. I am pleased to say that
during the past two or three years, when we
have had measures affecting returned soldiers
before us, there has been no division between
the parties in this Chamber, and very little in
the House of Commons.
In addition to providing for settling men on
the land, and employing them in the industry
in which they were previously engaged, there
is provision for training young men in various lines of activity upon their return. Only
the other day I noticed that in Edmonton
returned men were being trained to enter
various industries. I suppose the same thing
Then
is taking place throughout Canada.
there is provision to enable young men who
left university to go into the armed forces to
continue their studies at the expense of the
State. These things are important, and should
be known to the men overseas.
I have dealt briefly with the establishment of a Department of Reconstruction.
It is also proposed in the Speech from
the Throne-and I think it is a concession to
our veterans' organizations, who have been
working in that direction-that ýthere should
be a department to deal with veterans' affairs.
The activities of such a department will be
greatly increased as a result of the war. I
know from personal experience, having for
some four years been in charge of the Department of Health and Soldiers' Civil Re-Establishment, that there is no more trying department of government to administer. I think
the Government are well advised in seeing to
it that a department is set up which will
devote its whole time and energy to the affairs
of veterans and their families.
The programme before us indicates -that
the Government are prepared to consider and
introduce certain social security measures. I
cannot speak definitely, but I assume that
these measures and measures relating to health
would come under a department headed by a
responsible minister.
Like my honourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) I have no desire to discuss
many of the measures that are referred to
in the Speech from the Throne. They will
come before us in due course and will be
debated and considered on their merits. We
know that this is the year for the revision
of the Bank Act, which occurs every ten years.

21

I believe it is the intention of the Government
to bring down a measure dealing with this
subject.
There is also a suggestion in the Speech
from the Throne that steps will be taken to
assist in the return of industry from war production to civil activities. Financial aid may
be necessary, and arrangements will be made
in order to bring about the transformation.
Until I see the legislation I shall not know
just how far it is .to go or what the character
of it will be; but I think it is important
that industry should be assisted in this
conversion.
The programme presented in the Speech
from the Throne will provide us with plenty
of work this year. Like my honourable friend
opposite, I hope .the Government will be able
to proceed directly with its measures so that
they may come to us at an early date and
give us ample opportunity to consider them
carefully in this Chamber. It is -the duty of
the Government, of course, to facilitate business, but there is a lirnit to what it can do
in that direction. The temper of the House
of Commons and the stand to be taken by
those in opposition are matters beyond the
control of the Government. I know it is the
desire of +he Government that these measures
be proceeded with as expeditiously as possible, and tha.t Parliament conclude its duties
at an early date. A great responsibility rests
on not only the Ministers but the officials
of the Government. Undoubtedly they can
proceed with their work with greater facility
if Parliament is not in session. I am hoping,
tberefore, that the legislation to come before
us will not be delayed in any way, and that
we shall not be here late in the summer, as
we were last year.
I am afraid I have taken more time than
I should have done.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Go on!

Hon. Mr. KING: There are many matters
I could discuss, but I do not think any great
ad.vantage would be gained by my continuing.
I thank you for your attention.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mrs. IVA FALLIS: Honourable senators, of all the wealth of legislation which is
forecast in the Speech from the Throne, I suppose the interest of the average citizen is
centred to-day largely upon the proposed social
legislation. I know that in the heart of every
member of this Chamber there is a hope that
the Canada of to-morrow will be better than
the Canada of yesterday; and coupled with
the hope, there is deep in the inner consciousness of every one of us a strong determinaton,

22

SENATE

eac to do his or her part in hel-ping bring
about the fulfilment of that hope. But while
we are all agreed upon the objective to be
reacled, it is quite possible that we may differ
very much as to the method, of reaching it.
If I may for a moment, I sbould like to
adopt the position taken last night by the honourable senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon.
A. L. Beaubien), and say that much as I dislike
having to interject a political thought into a
non-political address, I sincerely believe it to
be my duty to call to the attention of honourable members of this Chamber the fact that
the Progressive-Conservative party in convention assembled at Winnipeg was the first of
the two old parties to give to this country a
comprehensive policy of social legislation.
All political parties are agreed to-day on the
need. We feel that Canada bas long lagged
behind Britain and other countries in the
:matter of social legislation. Speaking for my-self, while I am in accord with very much of
'what was said in the Speech from the Throne,
I differ in this respect: I cannot honestly and
whole-heartedly subscribe to any policy which
lays such great emphasis on what the Government is going to do for the individual and says
nothing at all about the part the individual
hisself should play. I expect I arn just one
of tihose old-fashioned people who still think
that the 'measure of a country's greatness is in
very marked degree the measure of the thrift,
initiative and enterprise of the individual
citizen.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Personally, I take pride
in the fact that the development of this
country was made possible because your forefathers and mine excrcised individual initiative; that thcy had within themselves always
a desire te achieve something. That is why
w-e have the Canada of to-day.
We are all agreed that the time bas come
when we as a country must do all we can to
mauke life better in the future for those who
hiave net been too fortunate in the past, for
those who, because of misfortune, lack of
opportunity or lack of ability, perhaps, have
net been able to provide adequately for themseives and their families. At the same time,
I would rather that more emphasis were plaecd
upon the remedying of unfavoîurable conditions in such a way as to enable tbe individual
to help himself than that a beneficient government should be called upon te assume the
entire responsibility of playing the role of
Santa Claus, and of saying to all and sundry:
"Hang up our stockings; you will be surprised
at whiat you find in then in the morning."
Canada, having laggcd bchind Britain and
.otbher countries for mnany years in this matter
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS.

of social legislation, now appears to have
swung to the other extreme, and in one swoop
the Government bas forecast all the social
legisiation that could be thought of. I wonder
if some honourable senators tbink, as I do,
that there may be a danger of going so far in
this direction that paternal legislation may
destroy much of the individual initiative of
this country.
We all appreciate the fact that there are
certain cases and certain conditions calling for
the payment of cash grants to individuals.
But personally I should like to sec the
emphasis placed upon services first, and cash
grants made supplementary to those services.
For example, in our borne and community
life, if we spend public money on such things
as better educational facilities, better housing,
and the bringing of adequate medical and
health services to the people, we have tangible
proof of what we are getting for the money.
But if we band money to individuals, or to
the heads of individual families, it may or
may not be used for the purpose of seeing
that the children are properly nourished,
educated, -and given sufficient medical care.
I can think of no better example te illustrate
this point than the work of the Victorian Order
of Nurses in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I believe that there is
no otber service in Canada from which yeu get
the maximum return for the minimum outlay
as you do from the work of the Victorian
Order of Nurses. If the money that is contributed to that organization were paid in
cash grants direct to individuals. with the
advice to "get yourself some nursing services,"
the results would net be in any respect comparable with those obtained for the same
money through the Victorian Order of Nurses.
I give this as just one example.
As one of the two representatives of the
wometn of Canada in this Chamber, I should
like to discuss a question of very deep intercst
net only to Canadian women froin coast to
eoast, but also to emuployers and male workers.
That is, the position of women in the post-war
worild, espcially in post-war industry. Last
week tbere was tabled in another place a report
on a survey conducted by a committee that
had been set up to inquire into post-war problems conecrning women, and in that report
thsere were some figures which will perhaps give
us cause to think. It is shown there, for instance, that in June of 1939 the number of
women ernployed in Canada outside of their
own homes was 600,000, and that by November,
1943, that number had increased to 1,200,000.
Of these, 260,000 are employed in w-ar industry, and 73 per cent of them are unmarried.

FEBRUAB.Y 2, 1944
These figures do not include the 38,000 women
in the armed services. Granted that the postwar period will be able ta absorb without
difflculty as many womnen as were employed
in June of 1939, that is, 600,000, and making
allowance for the fact that among those now
working are many married women wha wil
gladly ratura ta their homes when the war is
over, and that there are also many single
girls who will marry, there etill remaina a
substantial number of women ta be looked
after at that time.
It is avident that under post-war conditions
thera will be a vast number of women competing with men ini industry, if jobs are not
too plentiful. In a private survey that was
made in, a few Ontario factories, 50 to 80
par cent of the women working there declared
that they wished ta continue in industry or in
other work outside of the home after the war.
This is a problem which bas ta be considered
in aur post-war planning. It is nlot ane that
can ba dismissed lightly with a shrug of the
shoulders, for it involves hundreds of thousands of woman. "Balieva it or not," thera still
are some prominent men in Canada to-day
who believe the problam can be, solved by
shrugging their shouldars and saying, "Let
thema go back ta the kitchan; that is where
they belong."
I should lîke ta remiod any who shara that
sentiment that women in the first place did
not choose ta enter industry. They ware forced
into it as an alternative ta starvation for
thamselves or their depandants. Long years
ago, whan civilization was only a flara-up on a
few square yards of bricks and mortar, when,
bacausa of lack of means of transportation and
communication, rural communities ware antiraly isolated, each rural home was an industrial centre in itsalf. The daughters of the
household busied thamsalves with spinning,
weaving, knitting, and sa an, and were selfsupporting. But then came man-built. factories,
with their mass production, which. wera able
ta put goods on the market at cheaper prices.
And so, having had thair means of Iivelihood
taken fromn them, wamen were forced ta seak
jobs in factories. That was the beginning of
women in industry; and the figures I gave a
few moments ago show what the developmant
bas been since that tima. Spaaking recently
ta a meeting of industrial women workers,
Mr. Ernest Bevin, Britain's Minister of Labour,
made this very pertinent statement:
The Governmant called women from their
homes and other occupations ta war industry.
Wa shall fot forsaka them when the war is
over.
The sub-committea that eondueted the survey ta which I have referred, made this racomniendation:

23

Women workers.of ail kinds should have the
riglit to choose their work and have equal
remuneration, working conditionsR and opportunity for advancernent with men.
At this point 1 should lika to state
emphaticalýly my own view, which of course
is the viaw of every -one in this House, and the
consensus of opinion throughout the country,
that after the war the men who served in our
armed forces should have priority in obtaining amployment. But, with that exception,
I think there should be no sex discrimination
in the providing of post-war jobs. We have
ta bear in mnd. that many women ýnow working also have dependants; and to this number will ha added after the war, soldiars
wives, with added, cares, and war widows who
have to support themselv s and, in many
cases, smail children as wall.'
The rîght of these women to employment
is equal ta that of any man, with the above
mentioned axception-those who have served
in the armed forces. I feel that if there is
not enough employment for everyhody, only
two conditions should ba axacted of applicants:
first, the ability ta do the job; and, second,
the need for remunaration. There are many
women working to-day who do not nead the
money they earn. I mean that there are womeu
who froma a patriatie sense of duty went into
war plants or other lines of war work ta help
relieve the labour situation. I arn not for a
moment saying tha.t these woman should be
allowed to continue in this work after peace
returns, unless in the meantime they get into
difficult financial circumstances and have need
of the remuneration. Also, it is well known, that
there are in industry women who should be
at home looking after smaîl children. Where
no adequate nursery facilitias are available to,
care for child>ren, the mothers should fnot be
permitted to continue working in industrial
occupations. I stress that the only two conditions which women applicants for work
should be required ta meat, after ex-servicemen have been taken care of, are thesa: the'
ability ta do the job and. the need of ramunaratien. And what applies ta women in industry
applies also in the wider fields of business,
professional, life and public service.
Let us not forget that women, no less than
men, have vvorked and sacrificed ta win this
war. More than that, they have shown themsalves capable of assuming and faithfully discharging naw and important rasponsibilities.
By aIl these thîngs they have earned the
right ta a voice in the counsels of peace. It
seems ta me that ta ignore a person's capabilîties because of sex prel udice is not only
unjust discrimination, but it is not in the best
interests of the development of aur country
as a whole. In the solving of her post-war
problems Canada will naed all the ability and

SENATE
talent available in this country. and these
should be used, irrespective of their source.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Hayden the debate
was adjourned.

RIGHT HON. LORD SEMPILL
GUEST OF THE SENATE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it has been brought to my notice tat
we are greatly honoured by the presence in
our midst to-day of one of the noble peers of
the House of Lords-His Lordship the Master
of S-empill. He is the holder of one of the
oldest Scottish titles, dating from 1489. He can
also claim te be a Canadian, since he is the
successor in title to one of the twelve baronetcies which Charles I created in Nova Scotia.
I may add that Lord Sempill had a very
distinguished record in the Iast war. I am
sure that all honourable senators will approve
my action in extending to His Lordship the
privilege of a seat on the floor. I should like
on y'our behalf to assure him that he is a
most welcome guest of honour.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, we
are indebted to His Honour the Speaker for
having invited His Lordship to take a seat in
this Chamber to-day. It is gratifying :to know
that His Lordship's visit to Canada bas made
it possible for him toe wit'h us this afternoon.

Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:

Honourable

senators, I am glad to add my word of
welcome to the distinguished lord who bas
honoured us with bis presence. He is doubly
welcome, for, as the honourable the Speaker
bas told us, not on-ly is he desconded from a
very distinguished Scottish family, but he
has had a remarkable war career, aithough,
judging froin appearances, he is still a young
man.
We are indeed honoured, my lord, by having
you with us this afternoon. Though we have
all the powers of the House of Lords, and in
some respects perhaps a little more, we try to
Ileal fairly with all legislation that comes to
us from the other House.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.

THE SENATE

statement regarding adjourmnenit.
I know
that many neinbers would like to know something as to the time and length of the coming
recess.
After having conferred with my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballant yne), I nay say that at the conclusion of the
debate on the Address it is my purpose to
move that when the Senate adjourns it (o
stand adjourned until Tuesday evening,
March 7.
It is very ditficult to decide upon the date
when we should reassemble. Last year during
adjournment we were advised that a supplementary war estimate was required, and we
had to re-summon the Senate within a week
or two after it had adjourned. Later on otier
bills came up requiring attention. At the
moment, hoe-ver, as far as one can judge, the
debate on the Address in the other House
will continue for some days. The Prime
Minister indicated yesterday, that at the
conclusion of that debate resolutions relating to var expenditure would be placed on
the Order Paper. These. no doubt, will require
long discussion, so I think we shall bo safe in
adjourning until the 7th of March.
THE

GOVERNOR GENERAL'S
ADDRESS

IN

SPEECH

RIEPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the consideration of lis Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Johnston for an
Address in reply thereto.

Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, I desire first of all to congratulate
the mover (Hon. Mr. Johnston) and the seconder (Hon. A. L. Beaubien) of the Address
upon the high standard which they set in this
debate, a standard which was maintained by
the speakers who followed them. I cannot,
however, pass entirely over what they said
without making one or two observations. In
one of these I think possibly the leader opposite will join. The mover of the Address called
attention to the fact that there is now money
in bis province, Saskatchewan.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Thursday, February 3, 1944.

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
think it would be wise for me to make a
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I felt happy over that,
because for a long time the cities of Toronto
and Montreal have been accused of all the sins
which follow the possession of money. Now
Saskatchewan can be added to the list, and so
in some ways share in the criticism. I was
struck too, by the rather naive statement of
the seconder (Hon. A. L. Beaubien). He said,
in English, that he was net making a poli-

FEBRUARY 3, 1944
tical speech. I feel, therefore, that I have tc
describe his speech as a non-political political
speechSeme Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
beHon. Mr. HAYDEN: -non-political,
cause he said he was not talking politics; and
political, because he did appear ta take sides
in a matter of political controversy.
After these remarks of a lighter nature,
I must say that the information conveyed
by both the mover and the seconder was of
great informative value ta the Senate, and will
be of assistance tc us in our consideration
of the programme outlined in the Speech from
the Throne.
I should like to refer te ·one or two matters
arising out of a consideration of what the
Speech from the Throne contemplates. I must
say, in beginning, that a true picture of
Canada to-day must have in the foreground
a reflection of the full concentrated effort of
the people of Canada te win this war. In
everything we say and do we must emphasize
that purpose. We must not, in anything we
say or in anything we do, encourage or suggest any relaxation of the effort towards the
successful termination of the war in favour of
the Allied Nations. In that connection we
must remember that our enemies are still
strong. Truc, we are to-day in the ascendancy,
but between us and utimate victory lie great
trials and much suffering. If we would share
in the victory, the zeal and the drive and the
indomitable courage which carried us over
perilous roads and through the bitterest attacks
of the enemy must continue te inspire our
efforts. For that reason, I must accord my
full support te all such things mentioned in
the Speech from the Throne as may be necessary te meet the requirements of war: for
instance, price controls, wage controls, mutual
aid and lend-lease. But in order te be true
te the views I have always held, I must say
'that as soon as restrictive measures and controls become unnecessary in any respect to the
prosecution of the war, they should be
lifted immediately. The Canadian people, in
view of the loyal support and co-operation
which they have given in order te make price
controls and other controls effective, are entitled te have that consideration extended te
them as carly and often as possible.
I think that in the background of the pieturc the post-war policy and plans of the
Government must be sketched plainly and
clearly for the people of Canada-so plainly
and clearly that every person, no matter
what his occupation or calling in life, will
be able te understand and appreciate their
full force and effect. In that background
106-4

there niust also be sketched the Government's
policy and plans for our fighting men on
their return from overseas, for business and
post-war production, and for national security.
When I refer to national security, I mean as
it applies both to Canada and the larger
field where it can be attained only by the
putting into effect of measures that will guarantee world peace. For, whether we are in
favour of it or not, Canada and every other
country is to-day on a world highway. The
throb of the war drum anywhere in the world
has its reverberations in Canada and every
other country. Likewise, in peace-time, suffering and the lack of economic sufficiency in
any part of the world will sooner or later
have an effect upon the economic life of every
other part of the world. So no matter what
plans and policies we may lay down and be
able to put into force in Canada, in relation
to business and to the welfare of veterans, we
shall fall short of the required goal unless
these plans and policies are in tune with an
external policy that will assure to Canada a
continuance of security within and without
our country for generations to come.
On that point, may I, at the risk of wearying you, honourable senators, direct your
attention first of aill to the position of the
veterans, as I have called them. The
Speech from the Throne intimates that
the fighting men, on their return, will receive certain benefits in addition to those
for which Parliament has already provided
in the Reinstatement in Civil Employment
Act and through vocational training schemes
and other such schemes. The Speech also
contemplates a war gratuity, which I think
might more properly be regarded as a mustering-out pay or remuneration designed to
bridge the gap between the service man's
wartime and peacetime activities. I regard
that as most important from the point of
view of our obligation to returning veterans.
For when we reflect upon what the men of
our fighting forces have done for Canada we
realize that whatever we can give them, within
reason and having regard to our country's
resources, cannot be too much. They have
placed at the service of their country all the
skill and talent of their hands and minds.
They have brought te the effort which they
are making daily on behalf of Canada and
the other Allied nations all the training and
education which they received in their youth
and early manhood. They have laid aside
all theiir ambitions, all their plans and hopes
of happiness in the future-some, unfortunately, for ever. They have changed the
course of their lives; they have given up their
families, homes and friends and their way

EVIBED EDITION

of life, in order to overcome the threatened
destruction of all they love and cherish and
desire to preserve.
For some of them that was a final and
fatal step. Of those who come back, some
will be changed completely by the action of
war, so that new prospects must be opened up
for them. Some will have become sobered
much beyond their years and will require
treatment in the light of their condition.
Others will return with undiminished ambition, ready to pick up the broken threads of
their business, their education or their training, or to re-assemble their plans and aspirations. Still others will have acquired new
knowledge and new skills, which they will
desire to adapt as soon as possible to civilian
enterprise. For all these men we must be
ready, because they gave their service and
risked their lives without thought of gain,
and on land and sea and in the air have
written an amazing story of courage and
accomplishment.
Shall we permit it to be said that when
these men return we will net accord to them,
to fit them for resumption of peacetime occu-

pations, as much at least training and education as we gave to them when they joined
the fighting forces of this country? Shall we
permit it to be said that we are less eager to
train and fit them for absorption into peacetime occupations than we were to train and
fit them for the art of war? I think in the
Speech from the Throne we find evidence of
a firm desire on the part of the Government,
and I may say of the country, te accord to the
fighting men of Canada every consideration
possible, so that they may be fitted to resume
their peacetime occupations. We have borrowed from them a peried of their lives which
bas gone forever, and we owe them at least
the same care and attention as we propose to
give to the conversion of wartime industry te
peacetime production. Surely as much effort
and consideration as will be given to that
conversion, which is so necessary for the con-

tinued prosperity of Canada, should be extended to the changing over of the man-

power of our country from wartime pursuits
to proper peacetime occupations.
So I say the most important measures in the
programme envisaged by the Speech from the
Throne are those which relate te the care and
attention, and the opportunities for training
and education, to be given to the men of our
armed forces on their return to Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: May I say, secondly,
that in the interests of our national economy
business is aIso entitled to know as early and
as definitcly as possible what is to be its
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

position in our post-war economy, particularly
as regards taxes. I am glad to note that the
Speech from the Throne forecasts an ,early
clarification of this. Industry cannot plan
freely for the years to come without having a
clear understanding of what tax burden it
will have to bear. Some indication of how
large this may be was given in a statement
made the other day by Mr. Mackintosh, special
assistant to the Deputy Minister of Finance.
He suggested that in peacetime years Canada's
national income might well be between the
total of our pre-war income and the national
income of war-time, or somewhere in, the
vicinity of 6à billion dollars a year. He also
indicated that in order to meet our debt
charges and give full effect to our social
programme and our programme in relation to
veterans we should have te consider a Government income from taxation of between a
billion and a half and two billion dollars a
year.
That would be a tremendous burden of
taxation for Canada in peacetime.
There-

fore it becomes doubly important that we
should consider with great care just how
and to what extent we shall impose a pro-

gramme of social reform upon industry and
the people of this Dominion. I think, how-

ever, that the programme of social reform outlined in the Speech from the Throne is fair and
progressive, and that with proper administration both industry and the people can support
such a programme at this time.
But I have to sound a note of caution. If
we adopt what is termed "planned economy"
or "economic nationalism"-wlich I regard as
another term for rationed poverty-we cannot
carry out this programme. In order to maintain the national inicome at the standard indicated by Dr. Mackintosh, we must be in a
position to deal with the other countries of the
world. And, remember, we have to face the
prospect that they will want to revive their
own national economies, and will be without
the means of exchange to pay for our goods.
This being so, we shall have te evolve some
system of promoting trade. Therefore it is
highly important-and I do net think the
people of Canada can be told too often just
how serious and important it is-that in the
years which immediately follow the war we
have in control of the Government of Canada

people who, in the economic sense, are rightthinking people.

The success or failure of

Canada after the war will depend on what
policies are laid down and how negotiations
are carried on for trade agreements with other
countries.
That brings me to a consideration of some
of the statements made recently by-shall I
call them-state socialists, reflecting in some

FEBRUARY 3, 1944
degree upon this body. We have been told
that unless the Senate supports the policies
of the state socialists it will be abolished.
Industry and finance have been told that if
they oppose those policies they will be prose.cuted and jailed. I wonder what is meant
by "oppose," for to-day it is no crime for
the state socialists to oppose governmental
policies. They are doing so to-day, yet they
have not been denied free speech. From my
knowledge of the history of this body I can
recall that there have been times when notwithstanding a Conservative majority in the
Senate, policies of a Liberal government were
permitted to become the law of the land.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I can recall also
when that situation bas been reversed. So
when we are told, "Unless you support our
policies you will be abolished," I think the
threat indicates something more than what
one ordinarily might take out of those words.
To me it indicates the mental attitude of the
persans who make those statements; it indicates a lack of any such sense of responsibility
as should be in the minds of those who are
attempting to assume the administration of
ou'r national affairs.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It also indicates either
a lack of understanding or a blatant disregard
of our Constitution, which came into effect
at Confederation as a result of an agreement
or compact made between the vanious provinces of Canada. The representatives from
New Brunswick were the first to insist that
there should be a second chamber and that
it should be non-elective; they also insisted
that the number of senators should not be
subject to change, and they stated the reasons
for their stand. They wanted ta protect the
rights which, as a minority, New Brunswick
then enjoyed, and they did net want those
rights to be subject to the whim and fancy of
any group that might come into office at any
future time. They insisted on the understanding that the members of any such group
should not be in a position to swamp the
Senate in order te enforce their own will at
any particular time. The representatives of
New Brunswick laid that down as a term of
Confederation, and the representatives of Nova
Scotia and Quebec joined them in that stand.
As a result you have certain specific provisions
in the British North America Act.
Now, to those people who make the statement, "If you do not support -our policies we
will abolish you," I say: Do you propose to
abolish the Senate by constitutional means or
106-44

otherwise? If by constitutional means, it
must be by consent of those provinces which
made the condition I have mentioned a term
of their entry into Confederation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: So long as the Constitution remains what it is I shall feel bound,
as I am satisfied all my fellow members will,
when considering any measure that cames to
this House-whether from a state socialist or
any other government-to apply first of
all the tests: Is it within the provision@
of our Constitution? Does it do violence to
the rights of minorities? And, lastly: Is it
for the benefit and advantage and in the
best interests of the people of Canada as a
whole? I submit that that is a fair position
for this body to take, and it is a position
I will take, notwithsbanding any threats that
may be made, because I refuse to surrender
my functions and authority as a member of
this Chamber in order to further the purposes
which any group temporarily in authority may
desire to effect.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But the state socialists
go a little further than I have yet indicated.
Their statements point, not to democracy, but
to the very negation of democracy. To say,
"You must not oppose the policies of the party
in power, otherwise you will be jailed," is not
democracy, but totalitarianism; that is, national socialism. Hitler took that stand when
he came to power, and we all know what
happened to anti-Nazi parties in Germany.
If we are to develop Canada as a country
where there is to be but one opinion, that
is the sort of statement we should make. We
should not brook any opposition. That statement reflects the kind of mentality behind it.
Yet a system under which "there must be no
opposition" is what we are heading for, if we
are to draw the obvious conclusion from statements that have been made in a general way
by the advocates of state socialism.
Let me got a little further. In the programme envisaged in the Speech from the
Throne there is a message of social reform
which takes us a long way on the road to
considering the human relationships of our
people as more than a mere something to
be weighed in the balance and paid for on
a poundage basis. We put a higher value
than that upon human relationships and
human rights. In order that my position may
not be misunderstood, may I state emphatically my views with regard to the wageearner who has to obtain his living either by
the skill of his hands or mind. I think every

fear of want? That certainly cannot be based
on a planned economy which would put
barriers around our eountry. Lt cannot be accomplished by taking over the AlurninurnCernpany, 95 per cent of whose business is export,
and other large concerns the bulk of whose
produets are sold in the markets of the world
at prices governed by world conditions. Whoever operates -these businesses rnust operate
thern on a basis which will permit the goods to
go into world markets in competition with the
products of other countries. It is only in that
way that we can maintain our position in world
markets. 1 say that Qtate socialisrn and world
trade extensions aré incongruous or contradietory ternis.
Again I corne back to this point, and 1 arn
through.
When these people asIc what is
wrong with Canada, eue is inclined to look
back at our past history. On doing this, 1
for one arn inclined to say there is nothing
wrong with Canada; that if there is anything
wrong in Canada it is in the thinkiug of some
of its people. This country bas developed
greatly, both iudustrially and in the matter
of standards of living, and I tbink we enjoy
one of the highest standards of living to be
found in the world. Yet we are told there is
something wreng with Canada, and that the
only way f0 correct it is to disregard past
experience and principles, to start ail over
again on sorne new and untried theories which
involve as part of their operations the tearing down of ail large industrial couceruis ie
this country. To my mind this indicates
only a desire on the part of some people to

becorne bosses.
Whiere have we got in Canada to-day and
how have we reacbed that point? We have
got to our present position not tbrougb froc
enterprise, but through private enterprise.
According to my dofinition, there is no such
thing as free enterprise. It is private enterprise, subi ect to such rules and regulations,
legislative and administrative, as bave resulted
frorn the experience of generations. By trial
and error over many years regulations have
been evolved in the interests of and for the
protection of the people and the communal

life of the country.

We have built up a

systemn under whicb private, municipal, provincial and federal enterprise juin in the
development of power and otber industrial
uudertakings in this country. Whenever it
has been settled that something whýich is
useful and necessary to the best intereats of
the peuple cannot be uindertaken by private
enterprise, the federal or a provincial or municipal governrnent bas stepped into the field
and operated the undertaking in the best
interests ,of
the community.
We have

included the best features of private enterprise and of public ownersbip.

To say that

the cause of all our trouble and difllculty
to-day is the continuance of private enterprise
'n îndustry is to say something that cannot
stand reasouablo oxarnination, because private
enferprise bas been subject to coutrol in the
the interests of the peuple, subject -te taxation
in the int.erests of the peuple, and, during wartirne, subject te such taxes that it is not. permitfed to accumoulafe profits resulting froni
war production. One bundrèd per cent of any
exceas earnings or profits of war industry,
based on average earnings for four years prier
te the war, are taken away, with the previse
that there will bo a refund of 20 per cent
affer the war. The object of this is ýte prevent any one frorn profiting hy tlie war. Yet,
despite ail the restriction and ahl the regimeutation te which we have been subjeet, we
are now told the whole systern is wreug; and
iu the next breath we are told that the only
t.hing that would revive industry is deflnitely
more regimentation, which is the essence of
state socialism.
We in this Bouse bave a very seriougs
responsibility, not only te ourselves, but to.
the peuple of Canada at large, and 1 for one
arn satisfied that bonourable members will'
discbarge that responsibility witbout fear or
faveur. 1 am net pre-judging the case for
state se-cialism, but I amn stating wbat appear
te me te be sorne strong objections te the
working eut of any such policy. If reasonable
argument can ho presented to support sucb a
principle in gevernment, notwitbstanding what.
I have said bere, I arn prepared, as te the
subjeets and principles te wbich I have referred, and others with wbich I have not

dealt,, te give censideratien te this argument
wben it cornes before this Bouse; but whatever geverument rnay ho in office or whatever
policy rnay ho propounded in another Bouse,.
su long as I bave the bealtb and the autbority
te do se, I shaîl exercise my own judgrnent

on aIl questions coming befere this Blouse,.

health and good spirits 'te the duty of guidingý
the deliberations of this Chamber. I aIse,
wish te cengratulate the leader of tbe Goverament (Bon. Mr. King) and the leader on this
aide (Bon. Mr. Ballantyne) upon being back
in their places witb renewed vigour for takingpart in our deliberations.

Like my bhonourable friend fromn Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Bayden), I was deligbted te bear-

SENATE

from the honourable gentleman from Central
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Johnston) that gold
was flowing down the streets in his province.
Well, it has not reached Manitoba yet, but
as the watershed is towards our province I
hope we may get some of that gold before
the year is out.

pective Liberal candidate in any part of
Canada, I should regard it as a pretty good
document. If ·here was any hope of my
t
getting elected as a Liberal candidate, I should
th-ink I had a botter chance on that document
than on any other of which I know.

Hon. Mr. STEVENSON: You get most of
it, anyway.

Honý. Mr. HORNER: But the honourable
gentleman would not think there was any
hope, would ho?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: In seconding the Address,
the honourable senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) made some criticism of the leader of the Progressive Conservative party.
My memory of political
affairs in Manitoba goes back some twentytwo years, and I cannot recall that the honourable gentleman ever before criticized any
action of Hon. John Bracken.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
in a different camp.

He used te be

iIon. Mr. HAIG: Surely my honourable
friend will not say that the camp makes any
difference. A man is himself, wha'tever camp
bc may be in. If he is a good man in one
camp, he canniot change over night and become
a bad man in another camp.
I understood the honourable gentleman from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) 'to say that his
speech of this afternoon was not a political
one. It may be that with my limited experience
in politics I am not a good judge of a thing
like that, for I certainly thought it sounded
like a strong political speech against one of
the parties in this country. Of course, ho
may not have intended to make a political
speech at al]. I hope to deal with his remarks
a little more fully before I finish, but just here
nay I suggest to honourable members that
the approaeh ho made to socialism was the
same as that of most men or women who have
not had a long experience with the socialist
party. It happens that no other province
bas had as long experience with socialism as
Manitoba. The first socialist was elected to
our legislature thirty years ago, and there has
been at least one member of that party there
ever since. In 1920, ten of the fifty-five members were socialiss, and to-day there are five
socialist members. In addition, we have had
socialists on our school boards and municipal
councils. And the first socialist elected to
another place was from Manitoba.
As to the Speech from the Throne, if I were
talking in a political way this afternoon I
should say it was a good campaign speech.
Seme Hon. SEXATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I should say it was a firstAass campaign specch. If I were a Liberal
rember of the louse of Commons, or a prosHon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I did not suggest there
would be any hope.
I am very glad to hear that there is going
to be a conference with provincial representatives. Every one of us, whether formerly
Conservative, Liberal or Independent, thinks
the world of this Canada of ours, and we want
to do everything we can to make it a fit
country for the men and women of the armed
services and of war industry to live in after
the war is over. But let us not build castles
in the air. I congratulate the Government upon
its intention to have a Dominion-provincial
conference, because under our constitutional
system it is impossible to handle some problems in an equitable way without first
consulting the provinces.
I want to say to the honourable leader of
the Government in this House (Hon. Mr.
King) that the Government of the day must
show a greater willingness than it has ever
shown before to participate in the burdens now
being borne by the provinces and municipalitics.
I am sure that the provinces of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
-I cannot speak as to the others-are unable
to undertake a reasonable policy of reconstruction without proper assistance from the
Dominion treasury. The radio programme
entitled "Of Things to Come" always ends up
with a suggestion that the Dominion Government pay the cost of a suggested project. I
am net advocating that kind of thing. What I
should like to sec is a well-considered policy
of reconstruction, agreed to by the federal and
provincial governments. I am willing to have
the necessary legal powers placed in the hands
of the Dominion, but I should not expect it to
assume the cost of whatever schemes may be.
suggested, no matter how fantastic. For
example, if Manitoba proposed the building of
a canal from Winnipeg to Fort William, I
should not consider that a very wise proposal
and should not blame the Dominion for
vetoing it. But Manitoba ought to be given
aid towards the cost of constructing highways,
extending the hydro-electric system throughout the province and carrying out a proper
housing schemue. After the war the people of
the West will be demanding botter highways,

FEBRUAIRY 3, 1944
increased liydro-electric facilities and up-todate liousing, and the Dominion should flot
adopt a niggardly attitude in respect to its
proportion of tlie cost of any of these thîngs.
I agree entirely witli wliat was said by the
honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) as to the need of more liousing
accommodation. A long-range policy sliould
be adopted now. What is chiefly responsible
for the present housing shortage is, flot so
mucli lack of Government assistance as the
inability of contractors to obtain building
materials. 1 arn tliinking at the moment particularly of liouses that would sell frorn $3,000
to 86,000. In Winnipeg, and 1 believe in most
other cihies, private contractors who are more
efficient at house-building than at, any other
occupation would provide a great deal of the
lacking accommodation if they were able to
get supplies. I arn not blgrning the Government, but I hope that materials will be
released just as soon as it is possible to do
so without injury to the war effort.
The honourable leader on this side yesterday
described the 'lousing conditions in Montreal
as aippalling. I could relate some unpleasant
facto about Winnipeg. A recent survey by the
Housing Commissioner of that city showed

deplorable instances of overcrowding.
instance-I liardly like to. mention tliis in the
presence of our lady menibers-one bouse, with
a single bathroorn, was occupied by mne men
and eight wornen. That is intolerable. Are
aur boys fighting 'to preserve a state of society
in which that kind of 'thing will continue ta be
possible? Honourable senators, 'that is barbarism-in fact, it is worse than barbarismn.
T'he proper liousing of our citizens in the low
incarne groups is a prableým that must be
solved. 1 do not like the giving of band-outs
ta people, believing as I do tliat it is better
for men and wornen ta carn their own living.
Yet, we aIl know that in Canada, as in every
other country, ýthere are some wha, because of
poor healûhl or other handicap, are financially
unable 'to bouse theïmselves properly.
Consider the position of a man eamring 8100

clathing and goad food for limrself and a

of state aid if people in tli't tlass are to live
in decent bouses. But the cities alone cannot
bear the burden. The higli costs of relief in
the depression period from 1931, say, ta 1938
were appartianed arnong the Dominion, provincial and municipal gavernments, and it was
faund that anme cities could not sustain tlieir
share. Wliy should the people who happen

31

to live in cities that are in good financial
condition be better treated than their fellow
Canadians in some other cities?
I want to, make one or two criticisme of the
Governrnent. First, let me say something
about -the mail service to the men in our
airned services overseas. That service is
rotten. On the 21st of December a young man
ir. England gent a letter by air mail to bis
motiher in Winniipeg, and it did not reaoh her
until twenty-'bhree days later. Another letter,
wTitten on the 28th of December, also sent by
air mail, required thirty-one d"~y for delivery.
Letters from his mother are not received by
hir in England until twen'ty or twenty-two
days after being posted. Honourable senators,
that state of affairs ought not to be permitted
to conitiniue. You -have only to read letters
f rom -the boys and girls overseas-whether in
England, I'taly or Africa-to realize that
nothing does tem so much good as news from
'home. The delivery of this overseas mail is
as important as the delivery of srmunition.
A boy whom iI know very well asked, in a letter
to bis motiher, "W'hat, is dad doinig?" Before
he lef't home that boy neyer iniquired what
bis dad or hîs mother was doing, but now that
'le is over there 'le is eager to know about
'these things. Why should it be impossible to
get a letter ta im within two weeks? An
airman ia Winnipeg told me there was going
ta be an improvernent in the service. Wliether
that is so, I do not knaýw. What I do know
is that at present the delivery service is downriglit 'rotten.
Hon. Mr. FARRLIS: May I asic the honourable gentleman if 'le was able to get any
explanation as to -the cause of the delay in
delivery?
Hon. Mr. HAIO: That kind of thing 'has
been going on for a year. Sometimes it'takes
three months for delivery of a paper over
there, and six or seven weeks for a small parcel.
If yau have a boy 'aver there you know
sonetihing about it.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am not critîcizing
my honaurable friend; I arn just wondering
whetlicr lie was able to get any explanation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I made aIl the inquiries
I could from airmen in Winnipeg, and was told
there would be a better service.
Now I pass to another subjeet. 1 want to
comrnend the Governrnent for the steps it lias
taken to prevent inflation. This is a policy
that I support wholeheartedly, and I liope it
will be maintained. Some little things in
cannection wit.h its administration have caused
a good deal of annoyance, and while in a
political sense this is a good thing for the

SENATE
Opposition, I an nut going to deal wiih it
from that point of view. The situation is not
quite as Lad as it was, because after the
Liberals had a conference in Ottawa Last
September a few regulations were modified.
I rather suzptect that somebody told the
Goseirnent a thing or two in pretty plain
words. But there is still mutch ground for
criticism. For instance, a recent order provides that my barber may net charge me
more than thirty-five cents for a hair-cut.
Now, wbat has the price of a hair-cut got to
tIo with inflation? In Winnipeg some barbers,
who charged fifty cents, were even brought
into court and fined. WelI, have paid my
J
barber fifty cents for the last twenty-fiv e ycars.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Th- honourable
gentleman lias a lot of hair te eut.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I Lad as much hair
as my honourable friend, the bacber would
certainly earn fifty cents. Those are irritating
little things that make it liard to administer
the policy.
Therefore I suggest that the
Covernment seek the advice of three or four
politiciatns.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Htar, he-ar.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They will tell the Government not te do those silly things, whicih irritate
the public and offset any good results of the
policy.
A word or to-o on incoine tax. In many
cases it aniotints te double taxation. We
h-se taxation where there should be none at
all. Recently an editorial writer in the Frce
Press pointed out that a conipany is taxed on
its profits, but a shareholder with a small
mtorne pays no tax at all. How industryand, bear in minud, I am net a champion of
indsttty-can hope to reconstruct itself after
the war with 100 per cent tax on its profits,
is beyond my ken.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mc. HAIG: I do nut see how it can
do se. I do net like te pay taxes, but as long
as the war lasts the Government needs the
money, and I an quite willing to pay my
share. After al, it is net a hundredth part
as mut-h as the boys are paying for us at
the fighting front. But after the war is over
taxes will have to be reduced if we are to
carry on in this country. The income tax
situation should be carefully studied and so
dealt
-with to give maximum encourageas
ment to people earning under $3,000. In my
opinion the initial tax at 30 per cent, plus 7
per cent, is far too high.
My next criticism is directed to the carrying
out of the Selective Service regulations. In
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Winniipeg the officials arc doing their best,
but tieir work lias increased considerably
since recent lay-offs from some kinds of
eimplovinent.
Personally I think there are
more jobs under the control of the Selective

class, should
all.

HAIG: I do not see why the
brigade, such as accountants,
stenographers and other. of that
come under the regulations at

An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I quite understand that
when men come within the age category of
18 to 40 -cars they should be subIject to
control for war purposes. But take the case
of an accountant, 45 years of age, who desires
to get a job with another firm. I presume
lionourable members know what happons.
Suppose I, wanting an accountant, hear that
Mr. So-aniSo is available. We must net
conmunicate with each other. So I send ny
auditor to the accountant. He says te him:
"The Haig firm want an accountant. Their
application is No. 42." The accountant goes
te the Selective Service office, runs through
th list and savs, "I will try No. 42." An
oflicial asks iimn, "Have yen consulted with
Mr. Haig?" He answers, "No, not at aill."
In a sense that is the truth, but really it is
just camouflage. Of course, ie gets the job.
I do net think that procedure should be
necessary in relation to ptrtons over military
age. I repeat, in my opinion the white-collar
brigade should not come under this control.
We are told that from 60,000 to 70,000 men
have been called up under the Selective Service
regulations to become members of our home
defence army. They remain in that army
btcause they have refused to go overseas.
Of cours I arn net forgetful that Kiska and
Newxfoundland are regarded as being within
the boundarits set for home defence. Many
of the men assigned te this home defence
aciy might bc much more usefully employed.
In support of my statement let me give
ionourable senators one out of a dozen cases
that have come te my notice.
I know a
farmer in ouri province with a section of land,

all under cultivation. He is 65 years of age
and has been under the doctor's care for two
or three years. He has two boys. He owns
fifteen head of cattle, including nine milch
cows and ten brood sows. Last year he raised
7.000 bushels of wheat, 1,000 bushels of oats,
barley, clover, and se on. Selective Service
takes one of his boys into Winnipeg, where
about aI lie does is to go through a certain
amount of drilling. Now, if the Government

FEBRUARY 3, 1944
says, "That man is needed overseas," I arn
wiiling that Lie should Le taken off the farm;
but for the life of me I do not understand
why Lie shouid spend Lis time performing
drill exercises. Application was made to get
Lima hack on the farm, but the authorities
would flot release him. We want greater
farma production. But what is that farmer
going to do? Hie will seil ail Lis cows Lut
one, as well as ail Lis hogs, and raise grain.
I migbt cite another case, of a farmer with
a famiiy of two girls, one 13 years nid, and
the other 11, and a boy of 9. That man,
being of miiitary age, Las Leen cailed Up.
Speaking frein memnory-I Lave the particulars in my office-iast year Lie raised about
12,000 Lusheis of grain, Hie Las thirty Lead
of cattie and fifteen miieh cows. I tried to
get him off, but was toid, "OL, nu, yu
cannot." Now, until that man is sent overseas
I wouid urge that Lie Le given leave of
absence tu operate Lis farm.
When tLe war is over farrn products will be
as important as guns are to-day, for uniess we
feed the peuple of the countries 110w under
German domination there will Le a revolution.
We cannot feed those people if we discourage
farrn production. Du not Le persuaded that we
have an inexLaustible suppiy of grain in the
present carry-over. TLat grain will slip away
very soun; this year alune 100,000,000 LusLels
will Le needed for expert. There Las been nu rain
or snow t.o speak of-this is the driest winter
we ever had-and we are faced with prospects
of pour crops. In fact, we may Lave a crop
failure. In Alberta they Lave ramn or snow in
season, Lut tLat condition dues nut apply to
Manitoba. I arn nut pieading for these young
men to Le let off. If they are to Le sent
overseas, I hold up Luth Lands in approval;
but if you do nut need tLem uverseas, tLen
for Cod's sake take thern out of the Manitoba
University grounds andi send tLema back to the
farm. One of the young men wLorn I know
told me, after Laving Leen in Winnipeg for a
few weeks: "TLis life is a snap tu wLat Dad
wouid make me do at home. Every second or
third night I can go down town. I get three
goud meais a day, and just enough exercise
tu give me an appetite."
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I ask if that
man made application for postponement?
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: It went Lefore the
board?
Hon. Mr. HAIG- Certainiy.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: And the boy was
wiliing to stay at home?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Then the fault is
with the board. That criticism is nlot applicable to boards in other parts of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have given you a case

where the application was refused.
policy as a whole should not be to take
farmers' sons unless it is intended to send
thern overseas. As the honourable leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) said yesterday, these men should be given leave of absence. They can always be recalled to the
army when the need arises. I do not suppose
the Goveroment knows anything about this
situation; Lut, uniess it is changed, farma production wiil not Le mainitained. In the circumstances I have mentioned, farme:rs will
seil their cattie and hogs andL cut down on
their production of grain.
I corne now to the question of labour. We
have tu recognize that labour is entitied to
representation on ail public bodies dealing
with labour problems, and to the opportunity
of presenting its views on such problems. At
the same time it must Le remembered that
with privileges go duties. Ronourabie niemabers will recail a strike in Montreal which
the Minister of Labour and the officers of the
union concerned deciared to be illegai; but
the men waiked out notwithstanding. That
kind of probiern is one that we have to deal
wit.h.
Let me say a word or two to my friends of
the C.C.F. The Lonourable member froma
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) caiied them state
socialists, but I prefer tu use the old naine Ly
which we know them. The C. C. F. have told
us that when they get into power they will
abolish the Senate. If they cannot do it Ly
fair means they wiil resort to, foui. The threat
does not worry ine, for I think that if the
whole ninety-six of us were reiieved of our
duties here Canada would go on just as usual.
But I do not believe the abolition of the
Senate would solve nny of our probiems. If
honourabie members will look up the record
of this Chamber they wiil find that from 1896
to 1904 the Senate was controlied by the Conservative party, whiie from 1904 to 1916 it was
controiied by the Liberal party. The oniy conclusion to be drawn is that just. as soon as cither
party gut control of the Senate it lest control of
the Huse of Commons. "You pays your money
and takes your choice." From 1917 to 1936
the Conservatives were again in control of
this Chamber. Now control Las passed to the
present Governnuent. With ail due respect to,
my honourabie friends opposite, let me say
to them: "When the next election corne you
are going to have an awful struggle; you may
not Le defeated, but you will know you are
ini a battle, and your mai ority, if any, will be

34

an indication of what is going forward." No
doubt one of the purposes of the Fathers of
Confederation in establishing the Senate was
to protect certain minority rights, but their
primary purpose was to prevent the passing
of hasty legislation. As Sir John A. Macdonald said, "There may arise in this country
some parties that will want to do away with
property rights." Does that not sound familiar
to us?
An Hon. SENATOR: It does just now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Suppose the C. C. F. were
to carry the country 'to-morrow and bring in
radical legislation, which we rejected, and a
few years later made that proposed legislation
an election issue, and were again returned to
office.
This House would then have to
accept the legislation.
The Conservative
Government under Bennett introduced legislation for the purpose of appointing a commission to manage the National Railways. In
1936 the present Government brought in a
bill for the appointment of directors by
Order in Council. The Canadian National
Railway System was going behind to the
extent of twenty, thirty, forty million dollars
a year. Mr. King promised, in the 1935 campaign, "If I am returned to power I will
solve that problem." On assuming office he
came forward with bis bill and said, "That
is our solution of the problem." Did this
House reject that bill? We on this side had
a majority and could have rejected it, but
because that bill had been an election issue
we did not reject it.
I would not vote for legislation to put
people in jail because of their opposition
to the government of the day; but if the
C. C. F. were returned to power a second time,
I for one should feel bound to vote in favour
of sucb legislation. In short, the Senate is
net supreme; it must obey the will of the
people as expressed at the polls. If after
proper consultation the people want us to do
a certain thing, we are in duty bound to do it.
The next item I shall refer to is the financial
institutions. We hear that the banks would
be taken over. In that connection I agree
with every word the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) has said. The
men and women who ad-vocate the taking over
of the banks by the Government have to show
us, first, that it would be satisfactory to the
people, and then how it would be done.
The four million depositors in the banks will
want to know what is going te become of
their money. Any party that advocates taking
over the banks should say just what it intends
to do.
Then comes the question of insurance. I was
surprised wlien the C.C.F., through their chief
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

statistical man in Halifax, made the announcement that they were going to do terrible things
to the insurance companies of this country.
I am advised that there are about four million
policyholders in Canada. I am not particularly
interested in the shareholders or the companies
themselves, but I am interested in the policyholders. True, I am a shareholder and director
in one small company, but my main interest
in insurance is due to policies which I have
with several companies. If I should pass on
before my wife, I want her to have that insurance; I want to know that those policies
are all right. I think the other 3,999,999
people who own insurance policies have
similar sentiments.
As a practising lawyer, in the administration
of estates there have come to my attention
numerous cases in which the only assets consisted of a bouse and one or two policies of
insurance. The very fact that the companies
issuing policies have been challenged makes
thousands of people uneasy as to what their
position may be. I do not think it is necessary
to ask for an investigation of the insurance
companies; I do net think the policy holders
have the slightest doubt about the soundness
of the companies. Furthermore, it must be
remembered that in the case of the mutual
companies, of which there are many, 95 per
cent of the profits go to the policyholders. A
number of things combine to make a life
insurance policy one of the best assets it is
possible to have. One puts money into life
insurance, not to make a profit, but to provide
that if something should happen to bim someone else will be protected. It is quite true
that if I should live to be 75 the insurance
companies will make a fat thing out of my
policies, but if I had died at 45 my wife
would have been protected for life. Life insurance makes for stability. I know of women
who have struggled for years to pay premiums
and keop policies alive just for the sake of
protection; and I may tell honourable gentlemen it is heartening to see their satisfaction
when, upon the death of their husbands, they
realize that the policies have been preserved.
Any challenge with respect to the companies
upsets the equilibrium of the policyholders,
and I say no party bas a right to make such
a challenge unless it is accompanied by a complete statement as to what that party is going
to do and how it is going to do it.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: With old age pensions, why- worry about life insurance?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: People would net be very
happy on pensions. Twenty dollars a month
is a pretty slim pittance.

FEBRUAIRY 3, 1944

Hon. Mr. HAI'G: I hope so, but I doubt it.
Another peculiarity of the C.C.F. is this. Ini
the cities, they say they should have the support of Labour, and they say that if they are
elected Labour -will secure better wagee. On
the othier hand, what do -they say to the
farmer? They telýl him: "You are downtrodden
by the capitalists. Corne in with us and we
will proteet you." But what are the facts?
In 1884 my father bought a binder fýrom the
Massey-Harris Company for $175. To-day,
although -the dividends of the Massey-Harris
Company are about the samne as Vhey were in
1884, a similar binder would cost the fariner
$250 or more.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: $350.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Around $265 or $275. The
additio>nal eost Vo the farmer is the et of
labour. How the farmer, who is a eapitalist
of the capitalists, can combine with -the C.C.F.
and Labour, I do noV know; and. how the
C.C.F. can go Vo thie farmer, who has Vo sell
in the world market, and expeet hum Vo pay
a higher price for the 'tbings hie needs, is
beyocnd me. So much for Vhe C.C.F.
Wbat of the future? Thie Speech fromn the
TAirone makes reference Vo healbh insurance,
social seceurity, education for returned soldiers,
and so on. To my mind we in this Dominion
are very backward in the matter ýof education.
To begin witih, our teachers throughout thie
country are nýoV paid enough for thie services
they are expected Vo render. JusV thiýnk of a
yo-ung woman of 24, graduate of a university
anid holder ýof a certificate granted to bier
upon -the tompletion of a yeaýr's course in
teaching, being called upon to take charge of
a class of 44 children for thie inagnificent sum
of $75 a montAi. I do noV know how parents
expect their ch.ildren Vo secure an education
under such circumstances. If thaV young woman
is capable (>f teaching 44 ehildren, she is worth
a lot more than she gets. Thie situation in our
rural schools is positively outrageous. Neyer-'
theless, education is absolu Vely essential if
tAis Canada of -ours is Vo make the progress it
should make. I amn noV interested in the
teaching of English in Quebec or of French
inOntarin, but 1 amn interested in the problem
of providing our people with a decent education. That problemi is one whioh the provinces
cannot solve without the assistance of thie
Dominion, and some standardization of
teachers' salaries should be the first consideration oyf any governnient of this country.
Education is one of thie fundamental things of
if e. Home training and religious training are

35

ail to, the good; but Vo give boys and girls a
chance in the struggle for a living you must
educate them, and they should be educated
along lines that will make them more useful
in. the eommunity. Until five years ago subnormal children in the city of Winnipeg were
taught in the general classes, and learned
nothing. To-day there are special classes for
these ebjîdren. Education is most important
in its influence upon the welfare of our people.
Another matter that should be considered
is the extension of rural electrification throughout the Dominion. Rural electrification is
progressing in Manitoba. When it started
it was said we should lose money, but last year
the sytem made the largest profit it has ever
made. Electricity is going inrto faim homes,
wbere it lightens thie labour of all conicernied,
particularly of thie womýen.
Highways also are tremendously important.
After the war jour American cousins will want
Vo corne and see this country. In Winnipeg
to-day we have, 1 suppose, 500 American
soldiers; and there are many in Edmonton,
Calgary, Regina and oCher cities throughout
the country. They will want to. corne back,
and their families will want Vo see "the town
Dad lived in when hie was a soldier." If we
provide the necessary facilities they will return,
and constitute a paying traffie. So much for
that.
As was very well said by the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
and the honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis), our first duty is teo the
men who corne back from overseas. Whether
they have been wounded or noV, they should
be our first care. We have got Vo put them
back into, jobs, so that they may know not
only that we have done oui duty in providing
them with the munitions of war, but ýalso that
wve recognize the tremendous sacrifices they
have made. Nor must we forget the women
who went into the services, nor the men
and women who served in war industries.
1
In the meantime, leV us carry on thle war
with aIl our might and bring nearer the day
when Europe will be liberated. I hope the
day is near at hand when those parts of
China, India and other eastern countries that
are now under enemy control will be free,
and that we as Canadians will then do our
part in helping Vo get their affairs ini good
working order. The task will be a difficult one,
*and we shail have Vo support our Government in whatever efforts it makes along that
line, for we ought neyer Vo forget the terrible
sufferings of those people of the Far East,
and how relatively light our sacrifices have
been.

disease have decreased from 87 to 47 per 100,000, a reduction of 46 per cent. In Ontario
the decrease in deaths has been from 71 to 26

per 100,000, or 63 per cent; in Quebec, from
122 to 80, or 34 per cent; and in New Brunswick from 106 to 67, or 37 per cent.
It is very gratifying to know that the tuberculosis problem is now being carefully considered by the government of Quebec, which
plans to put more effective methods of
treatment into operation. It is well known
that important factors in reducing the spread
of the disease are early diagnosis and treatment. As a rule these result in shortening the
time 'spent in a sanatorium. X-ray examination of our young people who volunteered or
were called up for active service resulted in the
rejection of 8,000 suffering from tuberculosis in
a more or less advanced stage. Many of these
were sent to sanatoria, where the length of
time required to effect a cure would depend in
each case upon how far the disease had progressed. But in any event these sources of
infection were checked, and this will undoubtedly mean a reduction in the spread of the
disease. In Great Britain, after the outbreak
of war, some 12,000 patients were returned
from sanatoria to their homes, in order that
the beds in these institutions might be made
available for war casualties. Some of these
people undoubtedly spread tubercular infection, not only in their own homes, but also in
air-raid shelters and factories, and in consequence there was an immediate rise in the
rate of deaths from the disease.
The situation regarding mental diseases is
grave and depressing. Our number of mentally
ill persons is on the increase, and there is at
present not only a shortage of 10,000 beds for
these people, but a serious lack of physicians
and nurses. The Canadian Medical Association bas listed as urgent needs today: (1) more
institutional accommodation; (2) more and
better trained personnel; (3) facilities for
earlier diagnosis, and (4) semi-sheltered employment for persons suffering from the disease.
And, on the side of prevention, these are listed
as necessary: (1) a thoroughgoing educational
programme; (2) a system of clinics throughout
the country for diagnosis and advice; (3) the
integration of the mental hygiene programme
with the educational and welfare programme;
(4) a programme of vocational guidance and
training for mental defectives, along with the
early diagnosis made possible by the clinics,
and (5) organized community care for certain
kinds of mental defectives.
We know that another grave problem is preCanada is
sented by venereal diseases.
fortunate in having an internationally recognized aut'hority on this subject, in Colonel

37

Williams, who is attached to the Department
of National Defence. It is stated by Colonel
Williams and other experts on this subject
that a programme for coping with the spread
of venereal diseases should include: (1) widespread education regarding the nature of
venereal diseases; (2) additional clinics, with
increased personnel; (3) adequate remuneration for 'the medical personnel of the clinics;
(4) extension of hours in elinies, to enable
people to obtain treatment when off duty;
(5) the provision of treatment by physicians
in sparsely settled areas of the country, and
(6) greater attention to reporting and followup of cases.
Still another problem that faces us is our
high rate of maternal mortality. That it is
unnecessarily ihigh is shown by statistics. In
Manitoba, for instance, where 'the services of
municipal physicians are available to expectant
mothers, the death rate has been lowered by
fifty per cent. I may say that the Victonian
Order of Nurses is able to claim the saine good
record where its services have been used. Every
year more than nine hundred Canadian women
die in childbirth; and besides, the death rate of
mnotherless children is three or four times as
high as that of children whose mothers survive.
At the present time not more than forty per
cent of expectant mothers are given adequate
prenatal supervision. During the last ten years
Canada bas lost an annual average of 15,000
children under one year old. These deaths
were largely preventible. It is interesting to
note the progressive improvement in the infant
mortality rate in 'the United States. As
recently as 1900, one out of every six children
born alive in that country died during its first
year. By 1920 the ratio 'had improved to one
out of every thirteen; and, by 1940, to one
out of every eighteen. The experience in
England and Wales 'bas been similar. Figures
for Canada, I regret to say, were not given.
It is interesting to recalil that although Queen
Anne gave birth to eighteen or nineteen
children, only one survived as long as eleven
years.
Honourable members from Montreal are
familiar with the fact that since it was 'made
compulsory to pasteurize the milk sold in that
city, the infant mortality rate there bas decreased amazingly. Formerly some 1,800 infants died in Montreal every year from discases directly attributable to impure milk,
whereas to-day the number of deaths from
this cause is about 200. The rate is still too
high. It is generally known that New Zealand
has the most enviable record of maternal and
infant mortality. I was interested to learn
that, in 1905, out of every thousand infants
born alive in that country 68 died, and that by

38

SENATE

1936 the number had been reduced to 31. Iceland is in second place, with a death rate of
32 per thousand.
Unfortunately, the diseases of middle age are
on the increase. This may be due in some
measure to the greater longevity of our people,
although in this respect I am afraid the Senate
has not such a high record as it once had'.
Communicable diseases are still taking too
large a toll of human life, and one of our
greatest needs is the establishment, maintenance and extension of local health services.
The death rate in Ontario from tuberculosis
bas been reduced to less than one-fifth of the
1900 rate; from typhoid fever, to one-fiftieth;
and fron diphtheria, to one eighty-fifth. We
are slowly learning that preventive measures
cost less than treatment services. In support
of this let me quote the figures on diphtheria.
In Ontario during 1924, 3,075 cases were reported; of these 322 were fatal. The cost of
medical care is estimated at $300,000; but the
cost of giving preventive treatment in the form
of diphtheria toxoid to all pre-school and
school children was less than one-third, of the
total for medical care.
The Canadian Public Health Association and
the Canadian Medical Association visualize a
system of health insurance which will be more
inclusive, efficient and sound than anything
that has hitherto been devised and operated
elsewhere. Such a system should place much
emphasis on the prevention of disease and the
development of a high degree of physical fitness, and should include modern diagnostic and
curative services.
A friend of mine, a nurse, followed ber profession in Saskatchewan during the drought
years. I remember calling with her on the
Deputy Minister of Health, Dr. Wodehouse,
when she asked this very pertinent question:
"Why is money always available for hopeless
cases, while so little is spent on sick child'ren
whose mother may be dependent on her needle
for a livelihood?" I think we have never laid
sufficient emphasis on preventive treatment,
nor considered that the expenditure of money
on hospitalization might have been rendered
unnecessary by earlier treatment.
The cost of modern equipment bas increased
enormously, and the medical student bas to
devote more years to study in order to become
a properly qualified doctor. But despite this
the cost of some diseases bas not increased,
for the reason that through enlarged knowledge
of the proper mode of treatment the period
of hospitalization is now much shortened.
I may say that both the Canadian Public
Realth Association and the Canadian Medical
Association agree that the family physician
should occupy an even more important posiHon. Mirs. WILSON.

tion than he does at the present time. He
should feel at liberty to advise preventive
measures for the family under his care. At
present the average doctor would hesitate
to volunteer such advice lest he be suspected
of mercenary motives; whereas if be received
stipulated remuneration for keeping the family
well, be would not neglect to advise its members to use preventive measures whenever
necessary. The Chinese, I think, show their
wisdom when they say that doctors should be
paid, for keeping people well and not for
curing them.
The submission of the Canadian MedicaI
Association is, in part, as follows:
Our major emphasis in the past bas been on
the cure of disease, on negative health, as it
were. There should be more emphasis in the
future on positive health, on preventive
medicine and publie health. It is less costly
to prevent disease than to cure it, yet our
progress in this direction, although steady and
gratifying, has been far too slow.
The Canadian Medical Association, after a
prolonged study of plans for the securing of
health services, passed this resolution:
1. The Canadian Medical Association approves
the adoption of the principle of health insurance.
2. The Canadian Medical Association favours
a plan of health insurance which will secure
the developusent and provision of the higiest
standard of health services, preventive and
curative, if such plan be fair both to the insured
and to all those rendering the services.
It is obvions, too, that any plan of health
insurance whici is not supplenented by a
programme ta ensure better nutrition, better
housing and the reduction of worry and anxiety,
particularly for those of low and uncertain
income, will fail of its objective.
It is generally agreed that periodic examinations at suitable intervals should be available
to all. Early recognition of disease is the
greatest weapon in its mastery.
Fifty thousand Canadians are now suffering
from cancer; twelve thousand die annually.
Yet many, if treated early, can b cured.
Tuberculosis in Canada might be eradicated
in twenty-five years, if facilities were provided
for its early recognition and efficient control.
Naturally as the years pass and the advantage of preventive treatment becomes more
and more recognized, the expenditure for
curative services will be very much decreased,
and we shall not suffer the tremendous loss
now due ta absenteeism and lack of productive
power.
The different group insurance and private
plans in the British scheme have not proved
an advantage, and have made the scheme very
much more difficult of operation. Therefore
the Medical Association recommends that any
plan for Canada should be national in scope

FEBRUIRY 3, 1944
and s0 adapted as to be satisfactory ta the
provinces, which will be responsible for the
carryilg out of the plan.
I was impressed yesterday when the honourable leader on the other side (Han. Mr.
Ballantyne) spoke of the deplorable housing
conditions in Montreal. I shauld like ta see
something done for parents with young
children. It is exceedingly difficuit for them
ta be welcome anywhere. Although we are
asked ta become sentimental over the raIe af
the mother, motherhood is nat yet recognized
as an essential occupation, nor do we in aur
communities give the parents as much assistance as we might in appreciation of their services ta Canada in bringing up children who,
we hope, will be a credit ta aur country.
I have given some attention lately ta the
problem of juvenile delinquency. I realize
that we could do very much mare ta prevent
its increase, by takîng these young people in
hand and helping them te become good citizens. We owe a duty ta lads who have comnmitted some youthful indiscretion; we should
help themn and not punish them too severely.
I was very much impressed by what my boy
told me of one young man in his unit. He
had been in a reformn school, and my son
said, "Everyone is picking on him, and hie is
going to jump." Now, that is not righlt. Instead of that young man being helped to became a glood citizen, hie was being deliberately
sent ta destruction.
As a supporter of the League of Nations
and its ideals as embodied in the Covenant,
I should like ta express my satisfaction with
the sentiments expressed in this paragraph
in the Speech from the Throne:
The dangers of future aggression can be
removed-, and world security attained, only by
a general international organization of peace-

loving nations. You will accordingly be invited
to approve of Canadian participation in the
establishment of an international organization
to further national security through international co-operation.
Ail our plans for the future will cme -to
naught unless we ean have some degree of
international security. Every country must
realize that it is part of a world community.
I have in my hand a booklet which sets forth
some of the achievements of the League of
Nations. There is a tendency ta dwell on the
failures rather than the accamplishments of
the League whose comparatively short existence of less than ýtwenty years was surrounded
by many difficulties. It has been said that
the great leaders of the Allies at VersaillesPresident Wilson, Lloyd George, Clemeneeau
and others-failed humanity at that time. But
let me say this: The League did not fail
humanity.

The Scnate resund frorn yestorday the
consideration of lis Excellency the Governor
General*s Spoeohl at the opening of the session,
and the motion cf Hon. M.Johaston for an
Address iii roplv thiereto.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable scuators,
in boginning the few remarks that I intend te

Chamber, and probably they feel that for
favours received they should give a receipt in
the form of strong commendation of the party
that appointed them.
I was much interested in what the mover of
the Addrcss said, and also to note what hie left
unsaid. He gave the Government and the
Prime Minister a great deal of credit for
Canada's war effort. In fact, he went far
aficld in bis search for commendation. For
exemple. hie quoted, and properly so, the
Prime Minister of Britain. But we know that
if Mr. Churchill ware dissatisfied with what
Canada has donc, hie could nlot say so. It
would be quite impolitic and unjust for him
to criticize the Canadian Govarnment; so any
remarks that hie makes about us are necassarily
Then my honourabla friand
favourable.
quoted something that was said hy the President of the United States after that country
had corne into the war. By that time Canada,
having been a bellig-erent for eighteen months
or longer, had got into her stride, andi the
President expressed appropriate recognition of
whiat had been donc by our people. My hionourable friend next went to Madame Chiang
Kai-shek of China for further commendation.
Well, when that charming lady was here as a
representative of hier country she probably did
not know much about our war effort, but even
if she had found things to eriticize she would
not have said so. My point is simply this.
that commendations made in other countries
of Canada's war effort are nlot worth much. I
think my honourable friend might have stayed
dloser to home when trying to get opinions
about our war effort. So far as 1 recaîl, with
the possible exception of some members of
Parliament he did not quote one prominent
Canadian or one important Canadian newspaper in support of what bas been donc by the
present Administration. As a matter of fact,
a number of our most influentiel newspapers
whicb at one time supported the Govarnment
do not support it to-day, end three or four
of them are opposed to it. The Prime
Minister's supporters cannot make out a convincing case for the Government's war record
by quoting what prominent figures in the
public life of Englend, China or the United
States have said.
Neither in the Speech from the Throne
at the recent prorogation of Parliemient nor
in the Speech from the Throne et the opening
of this session did I observe whet 1 think
should have been thare, and that is generous
appreciation of the war effort of the Canadien
people. Our young men in the Navy and
Merchant Marine, in the Army and in the
Air Force are doing a job of which every
Canadian and every individual in the Empire
and in the nations associated with us should

41

be proud. The men and women on our farms
and in our factorias, offices and commercial
bouses, and our bousewives have by and large
put their shoulders to the whael and establishad an impressiva record for Canada and
the Empire. Tbay should be first in our
thoughts when we commend Cenada's war
effort.
Lest session I criticized the Government
for its lack of cnargy at the beginning of the
war. Some time ego on the outskirts of a
village in the South I came upon a darky
pushing at the back of a catrt in a vain
attampt to persuade bis stubborn mule to
get going. I asked whet was the trouble.
The derky answered, "This mule won't go"
When I off crad to help pusb the cart hie
seid: "No, suh, it ein't no use. Thare are
Just two tbings that will make this mu-le go."
I inquîred, "Wbat are they?" He replied, "If
thera are a numbar of people around who
hae thinks will get behind and push, hie will
make a start; and hae will also get going if
hae secs a lot of othar mules going past him.
Lt seemed to me thet that mule was plebiscite'minded-he wanted many people or mules to
go ahead bafore hae would bestir himaself. That
was the attitude of the Government at the
beginnîng of the war; it was disinclined tomova until it fait the weight of public opinion
pushing it into action.
The Spe.ech from the Throne et the opening of this session forecasts a considerebla
amount of social legislation. I shall reserve
criticism until the verious bills ara bafore us,
and content myscîf with a few commants,
which parbaps may evoke an enlightening
answer from the Govarnment. The social
services outlined will involve a good deal ofaxpanditura. The question in my mind a.nd,
I believa, in the minds of many other
Canadiens, is: whara is the moncy to coma
from ?
The estimatas made by the Department of
Finance, and also, I think, by the Prime
Ministar's Dapartmant, are about as follows.
First, for war veterans, $300,000,000. 1 think
we all subseribe to the propriety of makingprovision for every man who comas back.
especially those who have bean wounded.
We agree also that praparations should ha
made for giving those men proper homesand proper jobs, and an opportunity, if naaded,
of securing an education. Thera sbould be
provision also for taking care of the dependents of men who have lost their lives.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

That is a large amount of monay, but r

anticipate that it is not too large. That is
the departmental estimate, though others put
it at a higher figure.
For family allowances the departmental
estimate is $150,000,000.
I have seen other
estimates which greatly exceed that, the most
conservative of them being $400,000,000 a
year.
Hon. Mr. KING: There is a great difference
between the two estimates.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: A very great difference.
I am not saying which is right; I am only
giving you the figures. One newspaper estimated that half a billion would be required.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Not half a million, half
a billion.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Half a billion dollars.
There is a great deal of controversy and
doubt as to whether family allowances as
suggested in this forecast are a good thing.
I am not convinced, either that they are
or are not. If the object of the Government
is to increase the population of our country,
that would be one thing-and it might be a
-very reasonable object; but after ail I do
not think that is the real purpose. I think
that what is in view is a social service scheme
to help large families. Of course, bonuses to
families are nothing new. France bas used
that method of increasing the population for
two and a half centuries or more. Other
European countries also have made use of
the same principle.
But the granting of
bonuses to large families can hardly be
regarded as a social service; neither is social
service embodied in the method used by
France in times past; therefore what bas
been donc in -that country does net enter
into the picture here, which I assume is
entirely a social-service picture.
Now, if there is an expenditure of $150.000,000 or $400,000,000 on bonuses to large families
in this country, I fear it will have bad results.
Some of the labour unions are said to be
strongly opposed te the proposal. When I
asked one labour leader why this was, be
replied to this effect: "It will inevitably cause
a tendency towards a lower wage scale." I
inquired why, and be argued that after ail the
pay which a man earns in a factory is in sorne
measure based on his need. Probably that
is partially true. It was his opinion that just
as soon as the average employer found that
a man working for him was getting 810, $20,
S30. $40 or S50 a month in family allowances,
be would no longer think it necessary to pay
higb wages. I suggested to the labour leader
that he bad in mind one employer; but he
said no, that the idea impregnates the whole
Hon. Mr. BLAU.

country, and the effect of family allowances
is to lower wages. As to that I expressed no
opinion. He went on to say that a family
allowance loads to delinquency and laziness;
and that a man who lacks initiative and
energy, who does nut want to make a home
for himself and become a real citizen, is very
apt to sit down on the job and let his children
support him.
There is something to be said for this last
argument. I could net agree with it, because
at the time I was not sufficiently informed. I
am now of the opinion that most of our citizens want to work and earn good wages and
build up a place in the community for themselves and their families. On the other hand, a
relatively small number of people here, as in
every country the world over, have no desire to
exert any effort or initiative in order to become useful citizens, but are quite content to
sit back and let somebody else keep them. I
am quite sure, therefore, that Parliament will
consider this question thoroughly.
At the present time I am inclined to think
that this money, instead of being devoted to
family allowances could be used to better
advantage for educational purposes, health and
sanitation or home building. An expenditure
of even $150,000,000, if applied throughout the
country to improving the homes of those who
cannot provide proper homes for themselves,
would go very far, and on the information that
I have at the present time it would seem to me
that the Government would be well advised
to use this money for such purposes. If it is
necessary te pay bonuses to increase the population, which might be a very desirable thing
to do, that should be dealt with separately.
Another item in this social services bill of
costs which I am building up just to see
where we stand, is $75,000,000 for health
insurance. I have no reason to question that
figure. It is the department's estimate, although
some social service people say the figure is too
low and should he increased to at least
$200,000,000. In any eveft, we have $75,000,000
for health insurance. We do not know yet what
plan may be adopted.
Hon. Mr. KING: Is my honourable friend
giving that figure as an estimate made by the
department?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Yes, that is the estimate,

$75,000.000.
Hon. Mr. KING:. I do net think so.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I cannot discuss this
with any degree of intelligence except as a
round figure, because I know nothing of the
plan involved or the method by which the
public hcalth is to be insured. That is something about which we shall have no knowledge

FEBRUJARY, 1944
until tbe legisiation cornes before Parliament.
But takîng this as the figure, if the money is
well and practiýcally applied I believe the expenditure will be of great benefit to Canada.
I think it is necessary for the State to step ini
and give assistance to needy families, especially during the infancy of their children, at
which. time the mortaiity rate is higher than
at any other period of life, but in making eny
expenditure by way of bonuses to large families, we must exercise every precaution to bold
the parents accountable, so that after the child
is brought into the world its if e will be
protected.
The next item is a departmental estimate
of 825,000,000 for housing. If the provinces
enter into this project-and they muet cooperate or they wilýl not secure the benefit
of any part of this appropriation-they will
have ta implement that sum. If they put in
an equal sum there will be a total of $50,000,000 available for housing purposes. I presume
this bousing scheme will follow pretty well
the hune of the present housing scheme and of
the one we had aftcr the lest war, and in the
ligbt of experience we should gel much better
resuits than we got from the nid scheme.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do flot wisb bo interrupt
my honourable friend, but 1 understood him,
to say he is giving estimates made by government departmnents, and that tbey have been
published.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: They have been in
print.
Hon. Mr. K.ING: Wherc?
Hon. Mr. *BLACK: I amn speaking from
reports.
Hon. Mr. KING: Government reporta?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No; reports that have
appeared in newspapers.
Hon. Mr. K ING: I should not like to have
the impression go abroad that my bonourable
fricnd is gîvîng authentie government estimates, if that is not the case.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I amn giving the estimates as they appeared in a num-ber of
Canadian newspapers.
Hon. Mr. KING: Thet is a different
mattcr.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The newspapers
described these as estimates emanating from
the Departmaent of Finance and the Prime
Minister's offce.
Hon. Mr. KING: With that qualification,
I think the figures cen be accepted.
Hon. Mr'. BLACK: That is where the
newspapers said the estimates came from.

4

I may remark that the pubiished statement
doce not commit the Government to anything.
Hon. Mr. KING: No. 1 understand that.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I assume that unless
these figures were approximately correct the
Government would flot bave permitted themn
to get to the newspapers as departmental
estimates. 0f course, I realize that the figures
are subject to any modification that, the
Government or Parliament may desire to
make.
1 mentioned the item of $25,000,000 for
housing. Then there was 840,000,000 for old
age pensions. That is in addition to the
present outlay for these pensions. The grand
total of these estimates is about $750,000,000.
I have seen in newspapers ot-her estimates,
made by people who so far as I know are
not in Parliament, wh'ich indicate that at
ieast one billion dollars will 'be required for
the schemes outlined in the Speech from tbe
Throne.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? In arriving
at the total of $750,000,000, which figure is
hie using for children's allowances, $150,000,000
or $400,000,000?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: 1 am using the estimate
of 8150,000,000, whicb purported to come from
the department. If you change this to
$400,000,000, you w'ill bave to increase your
total by $250,000,000.
The size of these estimates makes us asic
ourseives how we are going to meet our expenditures in future years. I tbink il is fair
to assume that social service programmes as
now outlined would, cost the Dominion Govta oi4e billion dollars
erninent from $7650,0pff0
or more. We alreadly have a tremendous debt,
so large that our present revenue from taxation is only about -hall our current expenditures. 0f course, I speak subject to correction.
We are borrowing twice a year, and so long
as this war lasts we shaîl continue to borrow, I
assume, at 1east twice a year, from our own
people while they bave the rnoney, and perhaps then we shahl have ta look for funds
abroad. The interest on oui' huge war debts
will be, a burden to not only this generation
and tbe next one, but perbaps to several later
generations. None of us here, I suppose, expect to get much relief from taxation in aur
lifetime. I personally bave aband-oned ail hope
of any material relief. Wby? Simply because
we shaîl be faced with a growing need to look
after our under-p-rivileged) people until. this

FEBRUARY 4,1944
This is bad both for the country and for
labour, and very much complicates our social
problems.
I was pleased to notice that the transition
of our industrial life from war to peace is to
be helped forward by suitable modifications in
taxation. When I heard His Excellency the
Governor General read the relevant paragraph, I said to myself:- That is an aid to
business anyway; if only a friendly nod, it is
something.
But I do not understand why we need
another bank as a subsidiary of the Bank of
Canada to provide additional credit facilities
for the establishment of industrial development. I am not at all clear on that proposal.
Our banking institutions are second to none.
I am wondering whether they are not able
to take care of our industrial transition from
war to peace. I should like to say a word
about our banks. I know nothing about banks
from the inside; I am not a director; I have
never held a dollar's worth of bank stock;
I have always been outside the counter. But
I have always found our bankers more than
reasonable. In the Gospel according to
St. Matthew it says: "If a man ask you to go
with him a mile, go with him twain." My
experience bas been that if there are any
institutions in this country willing to go the
two miles with our industrial people it is the
banks. I repeat, I have always found them
more than reasonable. I have never gone to a
bank with anything but a business proposition,
and no influence of any kind has been
exerted, yet I have never been refused accommodation. I must confess that I cannot quite
understand why, if our chartered banks are
able to take care of the demands of industry
in the transition period, there should be need
for another Government bank. I am suspicious of Government banks, of Government
loans, and of anything in which political
influence can be brought to bear, because,
whether we like it or not, political influence
will be exerted where Government money is
available. We have seen that to be the case
in some of our loan institutions connected
with our governments. In our Victory bond
campaigns I do not know of any army of men
who did more to ensure success than the
managers of our chartered banks. If this
subsidiary bank is to be operated in competition with the chartered banks, I do not
think it is an entirely wise step.
In regard to much of the proposed legislation I am quite favourable. I am particularly
favourable to legislation for the benefit of our
returned men from the Army and Navy and
the Air Force, for their wives and families
and especially their widows and orphans-and,

45

I am sorry to say, there will be quite a number
of these before the war is over. I concur in
everything that bas been said about the
gallant men of our fighting services, and I
agree with those honourable senators who
have preceded me that everything should be
done to see that they are properly taken
care of.
With regard to social legislation, I am in
accord to some extent with the honourable
senator from Peterborougb (Hon. Senator
Fallis) that there is a danger of the Government becoming a Santa Claus. We Ynust avoid
that as far as possible; we must not discourage
thrift and initiative. Probably those of us
who have been fairly intimately concerned with
welfare work are a little more apprehensive
of what may happen than those who have
not been. In all social welfare work it is
sometimes pretty difficult to separate the
honest from the dishonest, and for that reason
I think we should proceed carefully.
The other day I was much impressed by a
clipping from the San Francisco Argonaut
setting forth some profound truths. Here
they are:
You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift.
You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening
the strong.
You cannot help small men by tearing down
big men.
You cannot help the poor by destroying the
rich.
You cannot lift the wage-earner by pulling
down the wage-payer.
You cannot keep out of trouble by spending
more than your income.
You cannot further the brotherhood of man
by inciting elass hatred.
I think all honourable senators will endorse
the soundness of those maxims.
Yesterday afternoon I listened with keen
interest to the honourable senator from
Rockcliffe (Hon. Senator Wilson), and I was
amazed to hear that there is a shortage of
10,000 beds for our tuberculosis and mental
cases. I am sorry she is not in ber seat, for
I should like to know whether the shortage
is not due to the fact that some of our large
mental hospitals have been handed over to
the Department of National Defence for the
duration; and whether, if those hospitals were
available, there would be anything like such
a serious shortage.
The honourable senator also dealt with
housing conditions, a subject also mentioned
by the honourable senator from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne). I do not know what steps
have been taken in Montreal or in Ottawa
to mitigate those conditions, but I think
honourable members will be interested to know

16

SENATE

wlat we have accomplished in Kingston.
During the past four years we have built
428 new homes, at an average cost of 84,500.
We liave also turned a number of large oldfashioncd houses into two- and thrce-family
partmients. In this wvay we have provided
accommodation for about 800 more families
tlan we Lad room for in 1940. That is a step
in the right direction. In addition, the federal
Government lias built more than 300 wartime louses at Kingston Heights on the edge
of our city. I understand that the Government lias taken similar action in a number of
other industrial ciies. It will be seen that
something is being done to relieve the housing
shortage, and as a result the picture is not
quite as bad as iight appear at first sight.
I should add that the Government bas built in
Kingston a large hostel to accommodate 422
girl war-workers. Similar structures have been
crected in other cities. On inspecting some
of those buildings I was favourably impressed
with the accommodation provided.
While li:stening to the remarks of the bonourable senator from Rockcliffe with respect to
housing, it occurred to me that one practical
difficulty is that many people do nlot want to
move into new homes. During the depression
the Welfare Board of Kingston made an
attempt to improve housing conditions, but the
results were disappointing. For instance, a
few benevolent persons tried an interesting
experiment. Three houses were secured and
a famnily installed in each. In one particular
family there were half a dozen boys, and it was
feared they might become juvenile delinquents
unless moved from their old home to surroundings more conducive to their moral and
physical welfare. Unhappily the experiment
failed. Doors and baseboards were torn off
and burned, and other wanton damage was
donc. I am sorry to say that in spite of all
efforts to build up their character several
of them have already been in trouble two or
three times. I am afraid very little can be
done to lift up that sort of people. Several
schemes on a larger scale have been undertaken in the Old Country. One of the main
difficulties in operating them is to overcome
the reluctance of people living in "closes" or
"shuts," that is, groups of small, badly lighted
and hopelessly dilapidated bouses in the worst
sections of a city. I shall never forget the
evidence of one man, 79 years old, who
appeared before a board at a meeting which I
was invited to attend. He did not want to
move from his home into the new Government-built house for two reasons: first, his
old rent of 2s. 6d. would be increased to 7s.
6d., and, secondly, his father, born in the old
place, had lived there to the ripe old age of
Hon. Mr. DAVIES.

S4. I was shown the apology for a home, and
I am frce to confcss that I should not want a
family to live in such a place. That tenant's
attitude is characteristic of a t ype of people,
who ask, "Why should we be disturbed?"
Whe n I addressed this Chamber laSt Julv
I said I was in favour of family allowances. I
ain sill. But I am not in favour of familv
allowances if at the outset they are to cost
the tremendous sum of $400,000,000 umentioned
by the honourable senator froni Westmuorland
(Hon. Mr. Black). Miss Charlotte Whitton, a
friend of mine and a noted authority on welfare work, speaking last week at a meeting of
the Women's Progressive Conservative Association in the Clhateau Laurier. also gave the
same figure, but I think she bascd it ou an
allowance of 89 for each child. I have bad a
talk with one of the members of the James
Committee and J told him that I thought an
expenditure of $400,000,000 was more than the
country could afford. He told me that so far
as be w-as concerned lie felt, and he believed
other members of the committee felt, that any
scheme of family allowances should be tried
out in a small way, rather than on a scale
requiring the heavy expenditure which certain
publie speakers and newspapers have been
indicating.
I was surprised to hear the honourable
senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
say, as I believe he did, that those were the
figures given out by the departme.nt. I have
not seen any such figures. I must have missed
them. I did not know that any figures had
been given out. But we cannot afford any
such sum as threc hundred million or four
hundred million dollars a year, because. while
we are all anxious to do what we can, we
have to face facts. We are only a small
country, a country with less than twelve
million people. We have very heavy taxation
at the present time, and some of the money
received in taxes bas got to be paid back. I
estimate that for several years the Department of Finance will have to pay back about
a hundred million dollars a year of the money
tfcy have taken from the corporations of this
country by way of excess profit tax, twenty
per cent of which is returnable some time after
the war. One hundred million dollars is about
twenty-five per cent of what it was costing to
run this country before the war, and I think
it behoves us to be careful.
The honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) made some references to the
Government.
He blamed it for a lot of
things for which I do not think it can properly
be blamed. I have been just as much irritated
as the honourable senator from Winnipeg at
the way the bureaucracy
under which

FEBRUARY 4, 1944
we are living lias operated. The honourahle
senator is a lawyer. 1 arn in business, and
probably I have suffered a good deal more
than lie bas from somne of these bureaucrats.
But we cannot blame the Government for this.
I do flot think any goverfiment operating
under conditions sucli as this Government is operating under at the preseait
time could do any better. We are figliting
a terriflo war. At the same time we are doing
our licst to keep down inflation, and no matter
wliat we may suifer in the meantime, if we
are. successful in this effort and in preventing
the catastrophies which followed the last war,
that will lie worth whilc.
I could kccp you here until six o'clock telling
of my personal experiences witli the bureaucrats. The flower of the young manhood of
this country wcnt away to the war; many of
aur intelligent young men wcrc ini the figliting
services, and we had littie choiee. We just had
to take the men who were left and put them
into jolis, and trust to God that tliey would
do the liest tlicy could-the best, in some
instances, lieing very bad indeed. As far as
I can find aut there lias been nothing of
polities in this. 1 know only one man in the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board group in
Kingston. I do flot know wliat bis polities
are. I lielieve lie lias been practically everything but C.C.F. I do flot imagine lie lias
corne to that yet. Wlien it came to setting
up a brandi of the Board in Kingston, what
liappencd was this: two. men arrived, one from
Toronto, I think, and one from Brockville.
Tliey went about tlie joli in a business-like,
systemnatie manner. Tliey asked tlie Chairman of the Cliamber of Commerce to eall
his executive together, saying, "We want -a
man to set up an office of the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board liere." So the Cliairman
called bis executive together, and .they said
they would do the bcst they could. In tlie
end they furnislied six names. The next day
at about five o'clock I received a telephone
eall from one of the representatives of the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, asking if
lie and lis confrere, could sec me. 1 was flot
then a senator and was flot particularly interested in polities. When these gentlemen
came to see me they said, "We have interviewed the men named by the Cliamber of
Commerce, and the choice lia been simmered down to two. Whicli of the two
would you suggest?" I informed them that
I did flot know eitlier. Then what did
tliey do? Tliey appointed some fellow I liad
neyer heard of before; I d.id not even know
wbether lie came from Kingston. Notwitlistanding tliis, in t.le main, I think, the Wartime Prices and Trade Board functions fairly

47

well. 0f course, if I were to go by tlie letters
tliat appear in our paper, I sliould say they
are functioning very liadly. But I do flot go
liy them. Tie liousewives are upset as a
resuit of somne commodities being rationed and
others eut off altogether. On the wholc, I
tliink tic Board is flot doing a bad job.
My main contact bas been witi Selective
Service, whici at times lias licen pretty bad
and very irritating. But it is improving now.
I think what tlie lionourable senator from
Win.nipeg (Ho-n. Mr. Haig) said is quite correct, tiat the regulations are lieing circumvented. But tiat is something that al'ways
takes place. For instance, we bave certain
unscrupuloýus people in Toronto chisellîng on
gasoline and buying ration coupon biooks at
$1,5. That is one of tie things we have to put
up witli, one of our crosses, but I do flot sec
liow tie Government can lie blamed for it.
I just mention these things because it is really
bureaucracy that is ta blame; and, taking the
long vicw, I tliink it is a good thing that tlie
people of the country siould. have a taste of
State control, for the incoflvetnience tliey suifer
will make tliem realize wliat tlie situation
would lie if we were ta liave a socialist goverfiment in this country.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I was going to refer
ta the taxi situation in Kingston, but I shaîl
flot do so at iengtli. The Police Commission
met and dccided to do a certain tliing in
regard to taxis, but somie man in Toronto decided that these tliings could not lie donc, and
the resuit was a threatened strike. I pass an.
Business was given a fricndiy nod in the
Speech from the Tiýrone, but I was glad, ta
sec tiat tic James report gave it a clieery
smilc and a wavc of the liand. The lionourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Black) says -lic does flot look for any reduction
of taxation. That is a pretty gloomy view.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Not in the immediate
future. I did not say tiere would neyer lie a
change.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Wellý, the James report
says:
To encourage private enterprise the cammittee urgcd the elimination of the exces
profits tax as soon as possiblle. To equalize
taxation it proposed reduetion of the corporation profits tax, reconsideration of sales tax
paid by consumers, and reliance on the
individual income tax for revenue.
I týhink that is very encouraging. As a
matter of fact, I arn convinced that if the small
businesses ai this -country are to survive, there
*has got to lie in the immediate future a vcry

FEBRUARY 4, 1944
Dame Margaret Lloyd George once told me
that Welsh people could not express themselves properly in English, because it lacks
certain words. To those honourable senators
who do not understand the Welsh language, I may say that a free interpretation
of this adage is, "He who works hard shall
succeed." I know of no country in the world
where people willing to work and to save can
succeed as well as in Canada. It is indeed a
splendid country for the young man and the
young woman.
The Speech from the Throne, which we have
been considering these last three or four days,
is a great human document. We may or we
may not implement some of the schemes proposed therein, and we may implement others
in part only. But whether we implement them
in whole or in part, honourable senators, we
shall have moved another mile up the mountain of social progress and have done something to ameliorate conditions for the underprivileged, the mentally and physically ill,
and all who are in the evening of life.
Hon. J. J. DUFFUS: Honourable senators,
I will not attempt to answer my honourable
friend from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black),
but may I just say this to him: I am definitely
of the opinion that in due course, after these
proposed measures have received the consideration they deserve, he wil:l be fairly well
satisfied.
Like honourable senators who have preceded me in this debate, I desire to
extend congratulations to my honourable
friend from Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Johnston) upon the excellence of his maiden
speech here, which he made in support of the
motion for an Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne; and also to my honourable
friend from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), upon his splendid speech in seconding that motion. All honourable members of
this House are familiar with the abilities of
the honourable gentleman from St. Jean
Baptiste. As to the honourable gentleman
from Central Saskatchewan, who was introduced here a little over a week ago, I feel
sure he will prove to be a very useful and
popular member of the Senate. Both the
mover and seconder are old parliamentarians;
for a number of sessions they were colleagues
of mine in another place.
I rise to speak at this time to state
that in my humble opinion the Speech
from the Throne is exceptionally timely and
most appropriate in view of present conditions
in Canada and throughout the British Empire.
I was especially impressed by the social welfare
proposals contained therein, because of their
106-5

49

humanitarian content and their realistic
approach to the problem of employment. And
I was particularly pleased with the fresh assurance which those proposals bring to every
Canadian citizen who desires that our breaking
of new ground in social planning and betterment, and the ploughing of additional furrows.
shall be carefully planned and well ordered.
Since the publication of the Speech I have
been delighted to meet many persons who
reacted to it in much the same way that I
have, men and women here and elsewhere who
sensed the courage and vigour behind these
social projects. These people told me frankly
that the Government's policies as outlined .in
the proposed measures renewed and confirmed
their confidence that the Canadian people can
attend to the improvement of their household
without tearing down their house. In general,
that has been the opinion of people whom I
met whide travelling across Ontario recently.
A good number of them told me they were
convinced that the lessons learned from the
depression of the 1930's could be applied to
our way of life without involving our country
in the extreme experiment of socialism.
I believe that brief summary of opinion
reflects the general thought of our people since
the Government's comprehensive programme
for social welfare was announced at the opening of Parliament. There was at once a new
feeling of confidence that in our people and
their institutions we have the heart, the will and
the intelligence to continue on our Canadian
way of progress from precedent to precedent
without uprooting the edifice that we and our
Forefathers have erected here in substantially
less than one hundred years. I cannot refrain
from paying a brief tribute to those pioneers
who came from lands across the sea, and, with
little but their hopes, their hearts and their
hands, built for themselves primitive homes in
the woods, rolled back the forests, fought the
battle of life in this new country and left to us
who followed the opportunity of developing
Canada to the extent of ber unbounded
possibilities.
In the last few days I have recalled that this
very question we are now discussing, the expanding and buttressing of our agencies of
social security, was raised,-and in much the same
words as have been used here, at a conference
of Liberals held at Port Hope in September,
1933. That was ten and a half years ago. We
all have been moving towards this need and
challenge. They have grown up out of the
economic conditions under which we have been
living and working; and I feel confident that
we should have accomplished more and come
closer to a solution of the question by this
time if the war had not exploded in the midst

of our peaceful pursuits. The responsibility
that was aeknowledged by the Goveroiment at
the opening of Parliament was foresbadowod
at thoso Port Hope sessions, which were
attendod by corne present leaders of the Governiment, inciuding the Jlight Honourable the
Prime Minister.
The question that bas beon in the minds cf
or people whc are attached to the political
institutions
we
have
developed-nane]y,
whether we are capable and desircus cf
enlarging cur social security provisions upon
the hasis we have already establisbed-was
frarned by Francis Hankin, one of the speakers
at that very significant and virtualiy directive
conference, in these wcrds:
Shahl ail the iinstitotionis inder whidi aVe

The rerurrent question in that passage is

arn certain tbat if can. And rny opinion bas

and women tc whcrn tbe rei-olutionary politicai

things. But gradually the state has been forced
to turn its attention to the economie field.
Early approaches took place in England when
the great programme of social legisiation was
launched before the war.
That is, the war of 1914-1918.
To neglect the realm of economies as beingl
beyond government, and to restrict political
activity to the narrower fleld whieh prevailed
in the nineteentb century, is to pursue a policy
that is merely antiquarian.
If civilization means anything, men and
women must have the assurance of security
against those material evils from. whieh the
state can protect them; and they must enjoy
the guarantee of minimum standards of lit e.
This is no side issue; it is a major objective.
Whether we discuss the railways or the
budget or a central bank or company law, it
is essential to keep in mind the end and object
of alI such machinery, human security and
buman welfare.
The proper disebarge of social responsibility
involves of courge au extension of the task af
government, and it may be honestly feared that
fromn the new functions which it is asked to
In
assume individual freedom may suifer.
answer, however, it may be said that wbile
freedom fromn
freedom at one time meant
government interference, it must now mean
freedom by goverument regulation. Individualism, bowever "rugged" it may be, can no longer
be lef t to itself. It can in fact be safeguarded
only by means of the control wbich the state
provides.
investigations inl
and economaie
Social
Canada and other countries have provided us
with valuable information. For example, we
have the advantage of t4he Rowell-Sirois report, the Beveridge plan of Great Britain,
the Social Security Act of the United States,
and the social security soheme of New
Zealand. I should also mention that deciaratien of the Atlantic Charter assuring mankind
freedom, fram fear of privation, want and insecurity. That is merely a brief reference ta
the wide territory covered by these inquires
inta problemns of our own day. The reports
and recommendations indicate a resolve to
find satisfactory solutions of those problemns
by adapting aur political structure ta aur
economie needs.
,In Canada we bave added unenipînyment
insurance ýto the social enactmnents providing
for old age pensions, ýmothers' allawances,
workmen's compensation, extension of public
health services, pensions ta tihe bliud, hospitalization assistance and other institutional
care, the National Housing Act of 1938, the
Prairie Farmi Assistance Act of 1939, the
Youth Traiuing Act of 1939, temparary measures of uuemploymient relief, and s0 an.
The Speech from the Throne foreeasts
fam'ily allowances, a national health insurance bill, an increased measure of contributory
old age pensions, and the establishment of
three new departments, includiug a Department of Social Welfare.

Sa far I have confined my remarks ta the
Governmeut's domnestic policy for the furtherance of buman welfare and social security as
our country emierges from. the war. I have
referred ta the approval of that policy whieh
individual citizens have expressed . ta me.
Newspaper comment also bas heen favourable
ta the Gavernment's social security praposals.
Let me quote, in part, this edItarial, fromn the
Montreal Gazette, an ail--out Conservative
paper:
By and large it may be said that the general
objectives of the prospective bills announced
indicate sound moves along desirable hunes.
Some are so obviously desirable, if not necessary, as te be unavoidable for the Government,
such as the propased macbinery ta look after
veteraus, reconstruction and social welfare
nicasures. Others can be tentatively accepted,
in a broaýd way anly with reservations. pending
close study of actual plans; this applies especially ta sucb items as family allowances and
the industrial employment bank. Indeed. final
judgment on virtually aIl of the proposals must
properly he deferred until the special draft
bills are braught before Parliament and discussed and desît witb by the members, who,
we trust, will nat be unduly infiuenced by the
fact that this is an expected election year. But,
on the whole, the Government is ta be coinmended for striking out in the right direction
and setting objectives which. if soundly impIemented, should wark for the benefit of this
country and its people.
The Brantford Expositor may 'be regarded as
a supporter of the Progressive Conservative
pýarty. Hence my selecting this editorial from
a recent issue:
The Speech fromn the Throne foreshadows
some of the most important sud-, in many
respects, most advanced legislation in the
Dominion's history. Most far-reaching of the
praposals are those relating ta the social structure, and outstanding in this category is the
outline of a measure for f amily allowances,
"ta aid in ensuring a minimum of welI-being
for the children . . . and ta help gain for
them a dloser appraach ta equality o oppartunity in the battie of life." Clearly derived
f romn the Marsh report, Canada's counterpart
of iBritain's Beveridge plan, there will be wide
sympathy and general concurrence in the
principle involved.
Closely allied ta the f amily allowancê scheme
are those calling for an extensive and, indeed,
nation-wide systemi of health and unemployment insurance, designed ta protect the citizenry
tramn privation.
Similarly intended is the
recommendation that aid age pensions be
advanced- ta "a mare generous basis than at
present in operation." This last represents an
urgently needed and long overdue improvement.
The Goverument is wise in thus oifering bIneprints for the post-war rehabilitation of Canada. Now is the time ta lay snch plans, to
examine them and ta set them in working
order.
Shrewd observers are likely ta see in this
remarkable series of recommenclations certain
political portents.
They may even take it as an indication
that a federal election will not be long post-

city, who will address himself to the orderly
arrangement of projects that may be undertaken in this country in the future, if possible
and as far as possible, on a self-liquidating
basis. The problems of reconstruction are so
tremendous in their prospect that we can only
classify themn roughly into ýtwo groupe: one
relating to the importance of a decent international arrangement at the end of the war
for the purpoee of dieveloping processes of, exchange and the circulation, of trade thro-ughout
the world, thus helping our very important
basic industries; and the othýer, relating to
those domestic improvements and developments that would demand supervision by
the type of administrator I have described.
We must also keep in mmnd the large financial obligation that is being incurred by ýthîs
country during the war. The prospective
heavy budgets for ordinary purposes that we
shaîl have to face, plus the maintenance of
those services which have bçen mentioned in
the Speech from the Throne and of the three
important branches of the defence service
which Canada is bound to maintain if she is
to take a respectcd position in the world,
make it difficult to see how measures of control and rationing can ho avoided for some
time in the future. That being a possibility,
almost a certaînty, the task ahead of the
minister in charge of the proposed Reconstruction Dep.artment becomes ail the greater
because the projects he must supervise will be
subjected te the saine limitations of scarcity

of materials. planned financing and controls,
prinrities and ratîoning which have beýen placed
upon ahl projects during the war. The peril
of inflation will ho greater even than it is
to-day.
In short, and in conclusion, the problems
which confront the demnocratic nations in their
desire to preserve the liberty and freedom of
their peoplcs after the war will he, in my opinion. even more difficuit than those they have
had to deal with in defeating the enemy.
Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

The Address was adopted.
RIGHT HON. LORD SEMPILL
LETTER 0F THANTS

TO THE SENATE

Hon. C. W. ROBINSON (Acting Speaker):
Honourable members. it will be recalled that
on Wednesday we had the pleasure and honour
of a visit from Lord Sempili. His lordshîp has
addressed t0 the Honourable the Speaker the
following letter:
To the Honourable the Spéaker of the Senate:
Fromr the Right Honourable Lord Sempili:
Mr. Speaker, 1 pay te you, Sir, and through
you to the honourable members of the Senate

53

of the Kingdom of Canada, my humble duty,
and pray you to receive this expression of my
deepest thanks. The second day of February
in the year of Our Lord 1944 wilI rank as the
proudest ini my lit e, since I had the high
privilege of being called by Mr. Speaker to a
seat on the steps of the Throne.
That honour was crowned when Mr. Speaker,
betore the Senate dissolved, expressed on behait
of honourable senators a gracions and cordial
welcome that was supported by the Honourable
Sen'ator J. H. King and the Honourable Senator

C. C. Bailantyne, te which customn very properly
allowed of no reply.

Every Scot in Canada is at home surrounded
always by those ef the blood. The Elected
Scots Representative Peer whomn Mr. Speaker
welcomed was most consejous et this warmth of
The head ot a family-Forbes of

been Nova Scotian and Baronets of this first

in the field. Ab-out him are many Scots, among
them Forbes-feliow clansmen and Sempilîs (or
Semples).
The Royal House of Stuart had great prevision when they establishefi a settiement on
the North American continent that ultimately
grew into the Kingdom of to-day. The plan
did flot develop as rapidIy as hoped. but the
influence of the Scot was f rom those pioneering

recounts--anfi se, will it be.
The customs ot the Gael are handed down te
those who will shape the to-morrow: may it be
urged t rom the heart that our ancient tongue
that was once spoken over Europe should be
vigorously encouragefi. We Scots are a bîlingual
people; the Gaelic for the home, English for
the market place.
Mr. Speaker and honourable senators have
in exercisieg the privileges of their high position reaffirmed that the King et Canada cumnbers
the-Baronets of Nova Scotia arnong his subjects,
so he who is privileged te submit this letter et
thanks will say:
This is my country
The land that begat me
And these great spaces
Are surely my own
Aid those ivho there toi]
Ini the sweat of their faces
Are flesh of my fiesh
And bone et my bore.
(Translation):
Mr. Speaker of the Senate:
Honouraijie French Canadian Senators:
I appreciate with all my heart the honour
you have bestowed on me, the more se hecause,
as a Scoteinan, I have the feeling of an indissoluble bond with France, of a union of ceoperation and deep friendship developed and
strengthened in the course et se many centuries.
Yen may be sure, Mr. Speaker and Honourable Senators that mine is a voice that springs
from the heart-which is the only voice that
reaches the heart.

MARCH 7, 1944
Canadian Senate. One month ago we had to
lay the tribute of our grief over four new
graves. To-day we stili have the painful duty
of speaking words of remembrance and farewell concerning an esteemed colleague whose
voice will no longe~r be heard in this Huse.
Hon. Arthur Sauvé was for many years one
of the outstanding political representatives of
the province of Quebec. Born in the historic
county of Two Mountains, he acquired a
thorough education at Sainte Thérèse Seminary
and at the University of Montreal. Afterwards,
yiclding to a powerful attraction, he turned to
public if e, coming to it, as many others had
donc before him, after spending some time in
newspaper work. Employed first on the cditonial staff of La Patrie, wbere he served under
that doughty fighter, Mr. Israël Tarte,' he
later became the editor, first, of the Canadian
and then of the Nation. From that time on
he but up that fund of knowledge whicb
was to be so valuable for the appreciation of
men and actions and so helpful to him in his
later cancer. Then, proving once more the
truth of the stock saying that "a newspaper career leads to everything, provided
onc gets out of it," he left that field to become
the member for his native constituency. First
elected in 1908 as the nepresentativo of Two
Mountains in the Legisiativ-e Assembly, he was
given by his fellow citizens a similar tnibute
'of confidence in six consocutive general electiens. In 1930 he resigued his seat in the
Legislature to run in the combined constituMountains at the
encies of Laval-Two
Dominion election, and was returncd as a
member of the House of Comnmous. Finally,
in 1935, he was called to the Senate. H1e had
for tweuty-seven years been the representativo
of his native constituency, enjoying the confidence of the electors ta a rathen unusual
degree in our political history.
The most important and remarkable stage in
that long career was certainly the periad in
which he led the Opposition in the Quebec
Legisiative Assembly. The party to which
Mr. Sauvé belonged had in rapid succession
met crushing defeats. A period of militant
and bnilliant vitality-fromn 1912 to 1916-had
been followed by a new and more crushing
rout in the 1916 general electian. The small
group of six Conservative membors who had
managed to stave off defeat nequested Mr.
Sauvé to assume the leadership of that Opposition, reduced to pitiable impotence. With the
greatest courage and the most praiseworthy
seif-denial, he acceptod that, thankless task.
For ten years, entertaiuing no illusions and
seeing no prospect of success, almost alone
against a buge majority, ho led the parliamentary battie with'truly admirable steadfast-

55

ness, courage and valour. H1e then made good
use of the kuowledge he had acquirod over a
long period, and his extensive political
experience stood him. in good stead. Watchful
and industrious, ever in the thick of the fighting, ever overwhclmcd in the vote, and ever
ready, to rosumo the attack, he compollod the
respect even of bis opponents through bis
fearlcss tcnacity. At that stage of bis career
the wcll-known verse of the Latin poet could
qiite appropriately have been applied ta him:
justum et tenacemn propositi virum. I used
the word "teuacity." In its botter moauing,
it was perhaps the main feature of the moral
character of our lamentod colleague.
Howover, a com.bination of now circumstances finally opened to Mr. Sauvé the doon
of Dominion politics. As 1 have said, the
eleetors of his staunch county of Two Mountains joined, in 1930, with those of Laval in
returning him as their represeutative in the
bouse of Commons. Fortune having smiled,
on bon. R1.B. Bennett and put him in power,
Mr. Sauvé was appointed to the position of
Postmaster General, in which capacity he
sorved with diligence and wisdom, until 1935.
Then, as the crowning of bis long and. active
career, he was called to this House.
lu the Senato bon. Mr. Sauvé showed special
fonduess for matters affecting the farm.ing communnity. Born in. a rural district, having representcd for many years a constituency where
the basic industry was agriculture, he rightly
con.sidered it the most secure found-ation of
national prosperity. And on many occasions
ho gave evideuce of this interest through bis
timnely participation in. the debates of this
buse.
At the beginning of this session there was
notbing to give us a premonition tbat our colleague was soon to dopant this life. But,
latterly, it seoma that he had silently been
suffering from a painful dopression. bis son,
Major Paul Sauvé, who had succeeded him as
the membor for the constitutency of Two
Mountains in the Qucbec Legislature, who was
already an outstanding political man, and who
had been Speaker of the Logislative Assembly
fnomn 1936 to 1939, had enlisted in the Canadian army at the beginning of the Great War.
A few months ago, like many others, he had
gone overseas on active service. It would soem
that our colleague had beon saroly affected by
this departure. The con.flict of emotions in the
heart of the fathen and citizen had no doubt
impaired bis usual vitality. 1 am sure I voice
the feelings of every memnber of this blouse in
conveying to Major Sauvé, across the ocean,
the expression of our heart-felt sympathy.
Honaurable members of the Sonate, before
the grave of one of our colleagues, we eau only

bow our heads, and offer his widow and the
bereaved family the tribute of our sincere
condolence.
Han. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the French-speaking colleagues of
aur late nîemîber fromn Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Sauvé) I wish to associate myself witb the
honourable senator from Grandville (Sir
Thomas Chapais) ini bis expression of aur
great sorrow on this sad occasion.
Our late colleague was indeed a very goad
representative of the rural class, for hie always
showed deep intercst in everything concerning
agriculture. Again and again hie rose from bis
seat ta defend the rights of aur farmers.
As bias just been recalled, hie began bis public
life in the Legislature of Quebec. Wbile leader
of the Opposition there hie was the appanent
of my late father, Sir Lamer Ganini. Tbey sat
on opposite sides of tbe Hanse, but, thougli
political opponents, thoy were at tbe samne time
personal friends. In dealing wîtb those wba
diffored from him in opinion aur lato colleague
was invariably tolerant and sympathetie. I
shaîl neyer forget tbe warmn friendship hie constantly extended ta myself.
His son, as stated by the bonourable gentleman from Grandville, is on active service overseas. He is a member of tbe Legislative
Assembly for the constituency of Two Mountains, and hie continues in Quehec the tradition
of bis father. Major Sauvé is in peace-time
a distingîis-rd membe'r of aur Montroal Bar.
He is indoed an excellent friend of mine. To
him and ta aIl bis family I wish ta express
my most sîncere condolence.

for he had a sincere love of his native land,

tears. His son was hastening to meet danger

old age is fraught with dangers greater than

age leads to the grave. He did not see his

BUSINESS OF THE SENATEADJOURNMENT
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, in
order tliat honourable members may be advised before planning their leave from Ottawa
to-morrow, I think I should state that this
morning it was intimated to me that the consideration of the War Appropriation Bill in
another place will probably be concluded before the Easter adjournment, and it is the
hope that the Bill will be asscnted to before
Easter. Tiat being so, I think it wise that
to-morrow we shiould adjourn to the 21st of
March, so that we mav have time to deal
with the Bill before the Easter recess and
have it in readiness for ther Royal assent.

political campaign divoresd from any parliamentary duties or responsibilities, and will submit for the consideration of honourable senators
that this procedure is a departure fron the best
constitutional procedure, is subversive of parliamentary government, and is not in the public
interest.
And further take notice that at such time I
shall inquire about the foregoing matters.
He said: Honourable senators, I gave notice
to this House of an inquiry and submission
wLich I purpose making to-day, based on the
fact that Mr. John Bracken has assumed the
political leadership of the Progressive Conservative party and is actively functioning in
that capacity, and that Le las net made any
attempt, as part of the duties of that position,
to seek a seat in Parliament and to assume,
what I believe is an essential part of such
duties, the leadership of the Opposition. And
I stated that I would submit for the consideration of honourable senators that this procedure
is a departure from the best constitutional
procedure, is subversive of parliamentary government and is not in the public interest.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the honourable senator a question?
What does he
propose to do about it? Or what does Le
propose that this Ciamber should do?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I propose to discuss the
matter.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: What for?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not suppose that
I can control the actions of an honourable
gentleman who is net in Parliament, but I
take it that this is a public matter of interest
whici is properly a subject for discussion in

this Chamber.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: May I ask the ionourable gentleman a question?
He las just
stated that Mr. John Bracken is the Leader
of the Opposition.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, I did not say that.

LEADER OF PROGRESSIVE CONSERVATIVE PARTY-ABSENCE FROM
PARLIAMENT
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. J. W. deB. FARRIS rose in accordance with the following notice:
That lie will cal] the attention of the Senate
to the conventions of the Constitution under our
parlianientary system of responsible government,
with particular reference to the established
custom o.f the Leader of the Opposition having a
seat in either House of Parliaient, and vill
further call attention to the fact that the leader
of the Progressive Conservative party, now the
official Opposition, bas made no effort since his
selection as leader to secure a seat in Parliament, on the contrary, is conducting an active
lion. Mr. ROBINSON.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: I understood him to say
that. I just wanted to point out that Mr.
Bracken is not the Leader of the Opposition.
Mr. Gordon Graydon is the Leader of the
Opposition.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If my honourable friend
liad listened lie would have heard me say that
Mr. John Bracken had assumed the active
political leadership of the Progressive Conservative party, but had net taken on the
duties of the Leader of the Opposition. I said
quite the contrary to what my honourable
friend has suggested.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I am sorry.

MARCH 9, 1944
lion. Mr. FARRIS: Having given this
notice, whicli I understood was a proper procedure in this House, I was much surprised this
morning to read in an Ottawa morning paper
a somewhat violent attack on my proposed
discussion.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: No wonder.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Perhaps my honourable
friend's observation wjll fit in very well with
wbat I arn about to say. It would appear that
1 have touched something rather sacred, or
perbaps something that is a very tender spot.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: No, no, not at
ail.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know. The
suggestion lias been made that what I said in
my notice was chuldish. It would appear to
me that the only thing that is chuldish is the
unreasoned judgment rendered by the paper
before hearing the argument. Perhaps it is to
my advantage, to this extent: that after I have
made my argument, if there is further criticisma from the same source, it will be largely
discounted, because the paper lias disqualified
itself in advance. I arn condemned because
there are other alleged parliamentary abuses
which, the paper sas I bave flot spoken
about. One pointed out is that the Government lias not provided more work for this
Chamber. Well, I recaîl very distinctly at the
last session expressing my deep regret that
that was the fact. and I repeat it to-day.
There may be other abuses not germane to
this discussion. But I bave this to say, that,
if it be admitted there are other abuses, that
is no reason why I sliould be muzzled or
intimidated.
It is suggested that thîs is petty polities.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My friend places himself in the class of the newspaper and passes
judgment hefore he hears the argument.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Ail riglit.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It is suggested that it
is poor tactics. Well, I ar n ot bere to discuss
this on a hasis on tacties, and I can assure my
honourable friend that in no way was the
Government conversant witb wbat I intended
doing until I gave notice of it in this House.
1 do not regard it as petty politics to discuss
in this House a public question of public
importance.
I notice there bas been a Gallup poil in
-wbich
flfty per cent of those who expressed
an opinion held the view that Mr. Bracken
should lie in Parliament. In those circumstances it is liard for me to understand wby
106-6j

59

the lionourable leader opposite (lion. Mr.
Ballantyne) should say that a proposal to
discuss this question is petty polities.
As I say, I have outlined in my notice what
I intend to discusa. I propose first, honourable senators, to subrmit to your consideration,
quite dispassionately, I hope, and as a reasonable view of a public question, my opinion
that this procedure is flot the best constitutional procedure; and I put some empliasis on
the word "best" for reasons which will appear
later. I would caîl your attention to the fact
that under the Britishi parliamentary system of
government, wbich we enjoy in Canada, we
have both representative and responsible government, and I would point out that there is
a fundamental difference between the two.
Every democracy, so far as I know, enjoys
representative government; but responsible
government, as I understand it, is peculiar to
the British parliamentary system.
As an
illustration ]et me point to, the United States.
That country lias representative government,
but in no sense of the word does it have
responsible government as we understand it
in this country. Tbe President of the United
States is not responsible to Congress, and it
may well happen, and I tbink it bas bappened
more than once, that there will lie, say, a
Democratic President and a Republican Congress, or vice versa; and if at any time the
President and his administration sbould meet
witli an adverse vote in Congress, it would not
in any way affect bis term. of office, whicb
would continue for the full four years.
Now, the British system operates on an
entirely different principle. Under tbe British
systemn the executive brandi of government
and the parliamentary or legisiative brandi are
so closely tied in together that it is necessary
at ail times for the Government to have the
support of the House of Commons.. Wbenever
the Government is defeated, the Prime Minister must resign or seek immediate re-election.
The essence of responsible government is that
the Government is at aIl times responsible
to the elected representatives of the people.
It is this principle whicli makes Parliament
the supreme representative of the people, both
in legislation and administration. Parliament
is representative of the people, and the Goveroment is responsible to Parliament.
There is a necessary corollary to tbis form
of responsible government. It is that the
Prime Minister and the responsible heads of
government shall serve in Parliament. There
have been many instances in whicb a Prime
Minister has been defeated, but there are no
instances in which, having been defeated, lie
did not at once either resign or seek anotbpr
constituency. Under the conventions of our
Constitution, if a Prime Minister or any of
bis colleagues in the Government sbould

though it may be legal for him to do so, should,

except under very unusual circurnstances, seek
to be Prime Minister without submitting himself to the spotlight of the nation's Parliament.
I can think of no more striking contrast in
methods of leadership than to visualize on
the one hand a man exercising leadership in
Parliament, and, on the other, a man exercising
leadership exclusively in banquet halls and
ex parte political gatheriings or other public
meetings. I have no criticism to make of that
procedure under proper circumstances. All I
say is that no substitute for the full measure
of leadership that is proper under our parliamentary system of government is in the best
interest of the public. You will note that
again I have used the word "best." I am not
unmindful that illustrations may be given,
-though I do not recall any frbom this Parliament-in which there has not been a strict
compliance with the rde which I am submitting for your considera)tion.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: There are no rules laid
down.
Hon. Mm. FARRIS: Oh, well, there are the
rules of the conventions which, as I said
before, have become understood and accepted,
and which are well defined by the expression,
"It is not done."
Hon. Mr. BLACK: They are not rules.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: They are rules in the
limited sense in which I am using the term.
It has been said that Mr. Mitchell Hepburn
served as leader of his party in Ontario while
he remained outside of the Legislature and
sat in the Parliament of Canada. As I do
not come from Ontario, it would not be fitting
for me to say whether or not Mr. Hepburn
is a good example. I would, however, point
out that Mr. Hepburn was following a precedent established by Dr. Tolmie, who was the
member of Parliament for Victoria, British
Columbia, and who accepted the leadership of
his party in that province. He stayed in
Parliament, and I am told-perhaps honourable members will know better than I do
whether this is true or not-that the then
Prime Minister of this country, Mr. R. B.
Bennett, highly disapproved of Dr. Tolmie's
action at that time. The point I want to
make is this. In the first place the people
of British Columbia knew Dr. Tolmie personally as one of the nicest and finest gentlemen
British Columbia ever produced-and I am
glad to say that about him-but they did not
know anything about his capacity to be the
leader of a party in Parliament. Consequently
they elected him; but at the very next election they rejected him by a large majority.
When you cite to me the cases of Mr.

61

Hepburn and Dr. Tolmie, you are simply
citing cases which, if there should be one or
two more, may affect the conventions of the
Constitution and result in the establishment
of an entirely new system. Now, I say that
I do not think that is a good thing. That
is my answer on that point.
Let me give two illustrations that I think
have far greater application, and that apply
to this Parliament. One is the present Prime
Minister. It was, I think, in August of 1919
that, at a convention here in Ottawa, he was
appointed leader of the Liberal party in
opposition. Now, I do not think it ever
entered the mind of Mr. Mackenzie King to
stay out of Parliament and carry on an active
political campaign without assuming his
responsibilities. At the very earliest moment
he sought and secured a seat in Parliament,
representing a constituency in Prince Edward
Island. That, I submit, is in accordance with
the best constitutional procedure.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Can the honourable
gentleman cite some other cases?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes, I have another
one. I am very glad to give my honourable
friend the illustration of Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen. Before Mr. Bracken was selected,
Mr. Meighen was chosen as leader of the
Conservative party. Now, honourable senators,
he did have a seat in Parliament, for he was
Leader of the Opposition in this Chamber, the
Senate. But Mr. Meighen had too high a
conception of his duties as an active leader to
be content with that. I think he had more.
I think he had in him too strong a determination to be in the thick of the fight and to
confront his political opponents across the
floor of the other House, to be ever satisfied
with the position he held here. Eo he resigned
his seat in the Senate. And I wish to say that
in my judgment, with all deference to the very
efficient leadership that we have on the opposite side here to-day, it was a great loss to
the Senate when Mr. Meighen left this
Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: And I want to say,
honourable senators, that, in my judgment,
when he was defeated in his attempt to obtain
a seat in the House of Commons, that was a
great loss to the public life of Canada. I have
never been in agreement with Mr. Meighen's
political view-point, but I have always had
the highest admiration and the greatest of
respect for his ability and for his courageous
outspoken attitude on every public question.
It was suggested by the Ottawa paper to which
I have referred that the only way to treat my
notice was with laughter. Well, perhaps the

SENATE
learned editor knows more about this subject
than I do, perhaps he was right when he said
it is to laugh to think that Mr. Bracken is to
come into Parliament now. But I put this to
you, honourable senators, that if any man bad
suggested to Mr. Meighen that he should spend
fourteen months outside Parliament as leader
of his party and then go on for an indefinite
period actively leading his party and allowing
the Prime Minister and the Government to
continue without his facing them and criticizing
them from across the floor, the laugh on Mr.
Meighen's part would have been that any such
suggestion should have been made to him.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Would the honourable
gentleman allow me? Will he now cite the
case of the Hon. Angus Macdonald in Nova
Scotia?
I am not concerned
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
with Mr. Macdonald. I say that in provincial
politics there have been instances of this thing.
And I say it is wrong. It bas never been done
before in so far as the Parliament of Canada
is concerned. My honourable friendi's anxiety
to bring up the Nova Scotia instance shows
that there is a desire to bolster up by repeated
cases a series of precedents which will make
Mr. Bracken's action a justifiable procedure.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:
offender.

Your party is the worst

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: So far, honourable
senators, I have confined my remarks to what
I term the conventions of the constitution as
a matter of principle. Now I would ask consideration of the same subject-matter in more
detail and with particular application to the
preset situation in Canada, baving regard to
the fact that Mr. Bracken is actively performing all the duties of the leadership of his
party except those vital and necessary ones as
leader in Parliament.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Just the same as Angus
Macdonald did.
Hou. Mr. FARRIS: And I desire to direct
your special attention, and the attention of
any others who may be interested in reading
thee debates, to two speeches which Mr.
Brackcn recently made: one in Quebec, and
the other in the Chateau Laurier at Ottawa,
this latest one made only last Friday night.
In my examination of certain statements in
those speeches.1 will use his text te support
my argument that there are strong reasons
wlhy he should b performing the full measure
of his responsible duties as the actual Leader
of the Opposition in Parliament.
Hon. B. F. SMITH: Give him time.

Hon. Mr. FAR RIS.

He

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Perhaps he will. Dr.
Tolmie got in the Legislature, but I do not
know that it was to the public interest that
he did get in.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: They all get in, in time.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am not saying whether
it would be a good thing for this country to
have Mr. Bracken in Parliament. What I
am saying is this, that if there is any truth
in the newspaper statement that there is
apparently a panie because Mr. Bracken made
tvo speeches, I an wondering why he does
not cone into Parliament and create a complete annihilation. I do net want to be forced
into making remarks of tîat kind, but interruptions provoke them. I want to consider
certain excerpts fîero
these two speeches of
Mr. Bracken, under three headings: first, statements with which I am in disagreement;
secondly, statements of principles and policy
with which I agree; and, thirdly, some matters
that do net appear at all in those speeches.
First, I will deal with Mr. Bracken's statements with which I disagree. I would net
wish to appear egotistical, honourable senators,
bv parading the fact of my disagreement. I
believe there are in Canada a considerable
number of people who will agree with my
di.-agreeient. The first statement to which
I direct your attention was made in Mr.
Bracken's speech at Quebec, where, as reported
by the Gazette, he said this:
I aie told that the presrit Goverireit ii
Ottawa Las a seIirate face, a separatie voice
and a different ailvocate for each sectioni of this

It is a
eir serions charge. If these charges
are trure, I say this Senate has no right to
sit idly by and say nothing. We have no

public rigit to sit here and fiddle while Roie
burns.
On the other hand, if these charges are
not tirue-charges made by the responsible
leader of the Progressive Conservative party-

the situation is almost equally serious and,
I surbmîit, calls for consideration hy ris as
menbe rs of the Senate of Canada. It is our
duty to insist tliat the leader who saxs these
things shall couie into Parlianent and confront

MARCH 9, 1944
those whom he accuses of these grave public
offences. I am satisfied that if Mr. Bracken
were sitting in the House of Commons, face
to face with the Prime Minister, he would
have learned that there was no justification or foundation for such charges, and would have
refrained from making them. The time has
come when Mr. Bracken should realize that
the fountain head of information on public
affairs is the people's parliament.
Hon. Mr. SMITH: He has had quite an
experience in parliament, and he has made
good.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: He has had quite an
experience in a small parliament, a provincial
legislature. He has never had any experience
as the leader of a party in a national parliament, opposed to a man of standing and
experience such as the Prime Minister of this
country.
Hon. Mr. COPP: And probably never will.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I think, honourable
senators, that if Mr. Bracken were a member
of Parliament he would soon learn-he should
have learned it already-something about the
principles for which the present Prime
Minister's stands. Will honourable senators
permit me to make this statement? It was
my great privilege, as I have said once before
in this House, to visit Sir Wilfrid Laurier at
the time the Unionist Government was formed,
and to have with him a discussion in which he
told me of his ideal and his purpose in public
life. He showed no interest in winning that
wartime election; I think he had no idea that
he would win it. He said that his life had
been devoted to a mission, the unity of
Canada, and that he intended to continue in
that mission so long as he remained in public
life. Sir Wilfrid, before his death, gave his
blessing to Mackenzie King as his prospective
successor to carry on this great mission. And
it is my belief, honourable senators, that if
one thing more than another has dominated
the public life of the Prime Minister it has
been the inspiration of Laurier's blessing and
bis own desire to promote Canadian unity.
Mr. Mackenzie King has devoted his life to
the cause of Canadian unity, and, with all
deference to honourable senators who have
interrupted me, I think he has done a mighty
good job for that cause.
The next statement of Mr. Bracken's with
which I disagree-of course, honourable senators will understand that I am solecting just
a few instances from his speeches, to illustrate
my point--was made last Friday niglt in the
Chateau Laurier at Ottawa. Referring to the
date of the election, he said:

63

It rested with one whose temper is rather
uncertain these days and whose moods are quite
unpredictable.
How does Mr. Bracken know what the Prime
Minister's temper is like? I do not accept
Mr. Bracken's statement that there is anything
wrong with the Prime Ministers temper. I
lkave sat in the gallery provided for honourable
senators in another place, and there, I think,
I was closer to the Prime Minister than
Mr. Bracken has been for some years. Therefore it seems to me that this statement is
based entirely on hearsay evidence, because he
was not present to know. My observation is
that the Prime Minister has had his temper
under good control. He is standing the strain
of the greatest responsibility any Prime Minister has ever endured since Confederation. He
is showing self-control. He has been patient
and courteous in the face of opposition that
sometimes was petty and provocative. I doubt
very much that even in the lesser role of
Leader of the Opposition Mr. Bracken could
control his temper any better.
But let us assume for argument's sake that
this hearsay evidence is correct, and that
sometimes the Prime Minister does show
momentary irritation under the strain of the
job. I predict that were Mr. Bracken in
Parliament, and could he get the full measure
of what the Prime Minister is doing there, he
would remain to praise rather than to scoff.
I submit it did not well become Mr. Bracken,
standing where he wa's, in a banquet hall, to
refer, as he did, to Mr. King sitting where he
was, in the House of Commons.
I point to you a striking contrast, which I
think illustrates the point I am making. I
picture to you in the late evening of last
Friday the Prime Minister sitting in Parliament at the end of a long day's work dealing
with serious domestic problems and the great
problems of the war. If his temper was
frayed it was because of the heavy burdens
of a Prime Minister leading a nation in time
of war. Then lot us get a contrast for the
purpose for which I wish to use it. We have
Mr. Bracken speaking in the banquet room
of a luxury hotel arnid the plaudits of his
friends in a sheltered and carefree position,
consulting the faithful, with no parliamentary
responsibilities and confronted by none of his
opponents. I do not think that was a fit
occasion to comment on the fact that the
Prime Minister of this country was sometimes
showing the strain of the tremendous responsibilities which are his. Mr. Bracken's speeches
are not very difficult to make in the circumstances in which he is delivering them. I am
not offering criticism of his speech of the
other night; of course, that is part of his

64

SENATE

duty. But I hring it up to show the need for
his present activitios to ho sopplemented by
his prosence in Parliainent. In his speech Mr.
Bracken lias assurned that Mr. King's irritation-if such thore is lias beon the resoit of
Consrxative headxxay in this country. Ferhops if Mr, Brocken were doing his shore in
Porliament ho would realize that the real
strain of office cernes fremn the duties cf a
wartime Goverj-onent leodiag a nation engaged

prepare a manuscript, almost in the form of
an essay, and read it. It is also very easy
occasionally to get someone else to write a

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I be
allowed to say a word? I have been twelve
years in this House and this is the first occasion when we have heard a real Simon-Pure
political speech. I thought it was not permitted under the rules of the Senate. The
insinuation that my honourable friend is trying
to make now could not be one step lower than
what we have just listened to. I was at the
meeting on Friday last, and I can say that
Mr. Bracken spoke fluently and eloquently for
several minutes without any manuscript.
An Hon. SENATOR:
question.

That was not a

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I accept my honourable friend's general statement, but no his
attack on me. These statements are being
freely made in the community to-day, and they
point in the strongest way to the necessity for
a man in Mr. Bracken's position being in
Parliament, where there could be no question
about these matters, where in the hurly-burly
of debate in that sphere of action you would
get the full measure of a man, and full appreciation of his capacity to take on these great
responsibilities. I deny my honourable friend's
right to say that in trying to make that clear
in this Chamber I am saying anything derogatory or improper or not within the proper
standards of conduct in this Senate.
Hon. Mr* QUINN:

Partisanship.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Then there is another
question that arises from this anomalous situation in the public life of this country. It is
this: how far there is a real conflict between
the reactionary members of the party and Mr.
Bracken, who is a progressive, -and whether
there is going on in this country a campaign of
duplicity. I have a right to inquire into that,
as has any member of this House.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Go ahead.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am going ahead, with
your permission, Mr. Speaker, and that of
honourable senators. Mr. Bracken was net
nominated by any new party in Canada. He
was nominated; at the Winnipeg convention,
and my honourable friend opposite can tel]
better than I can whether he dictated, the
policy or platform; formulated at that time.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Certainly not.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My recollection is that
he did dictate the new name. One is sometimes justifiably suspicious about new names.
This party bas had several nanes in the course
of its history.
An Hon. SENATOR: Every election it bas
had one.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: First it was the Conservative party, then the Liberal Conservative
party, then the Unionist party, then the National Government party, and now it is the
Progressive Conservative party.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: What bas that to do
with the subject under discussion?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It bas this to do with
the subject under discussion, that I have asked
this question: Is there a real conflict between
the reactionary members of the Conservative
party and Mr. Bracken?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The answer is, no.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
campaign of duplicity?

And that there is no

May I ask another
Hon. B. F. SMITH:
question? The honourable gentleman bas
referred to changes in the name of the Conservative party. I would ask him to be good
enough to enumerate the different policies of
the Liberal party since Confederation. I can
count eight.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That shows progress on
the part of the Liberal party.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:
side as well.

It applies to the other

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: But the Liberal party
never had to camouflage its position by changing names. Here is the point I am making.
The Progressive Conservative party-and I am
basing this on a statement that Mr. Bracken
made the other day-is a new party; it is the
newest party in Canada. Well, we know that
the Conservative party in Parliament is net a
new party. That is no reflection on the
party. I have great respect and admiration
for the members of the Conservative party as
such, even though I do not agree with them;
but the point I am making is that if-and this
answers the question, what bas this to do,
with the discussion?-that if Mr. Bracken were
in Parliament it would not take us long to
know whether his party is the hyphenated
Progressive Conservative party, or whether it
is composed of two parties, the Bracken progressive party out in the open spaces and the
Conservative party led by others in the
Houses of Parliament. If there is any doubt
about this apparent discrepancy between the
two parties, or the statement that Mr.Bracken

66

SENATE

does not wish to come into Parliament because
his views as advocated outside do not coincide with those being advocated by his colleagues in Parlianent, I would recommend to
iy honourable friends that they read the
speech made by Mr. Bracken in the Chateau
Laurier the othor night, and then read the
speeh on the Industrial Banking Bill made by
Ir. Hanson in Parliament on Tuesday night.
Please do not misunderstand me.
I am
naking no attack on what Mr. Hanson said in
another place.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I think it is very irregular to niention the narne of a member of the
.îther House.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Nr. FARRIS: Oh, no, that is all right.
[ am sure of this: that ten years ago most of
os in Parliament would have agreed with what
Mr. Hanson said the other night. All I am
saying is that honourable senators should read
that speech side by side with Mr. Bracken's
speech, and tien ask themselves whether Mr.
Bracken would not be greatly embarrassed if
he sat with his colleagues in the House of
Cominons.
lon. 'Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Why do you

worr1y about that?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am not worrying
about it. All I am doing is pointing it out
aS one of the matters of public importance.
Do I understand the henonrable leader
opposit te suggest that because one criticizes
a certain policy, or intirnates that it is not
in the host interest of the country, he is
therefore worrying about it?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Mv honourable
friend is not diseussing a policy; lie is discussing a stipposition.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: A supposition whiei, I
say', will becone very obvions to anvbody
who reids Mr. Bracken's speeches in the wide
open spaces and those of hlis colleagues in the

ilouse of Commons.
Hon. 13. F. SMITH:
wondcerfuil discovery.

You have made a

iIon. Mr. FARRIS: It is not a discovery;
it is just an obvious fact.
Now tliere are some things whicl are not
referred tIo in Mr. Braeltn's speechl that I

think I imight discuss, and if ny ionourable
friends will permit me I shall eneiavour to
di-is
iossle in a dispassionate msanner.
F'irst, there is the question of the centralization of power at Ottawa. Mr. Bracken made
a statteient about that in Lis speech mi
Quebec, and it is important in considering
lion. -Mr. FARRIS.

what his policy would be as leader of the
opposition in the House of Commons. He
said thon:
When I say there should be decentralization,
not centralization, I mean that we should aim
to secure a uniforn national policy in all those
fields where the national prosperity oust be
cultivated, bot leave to the local authorities
and to capital, labour and manageneit, a large
share in the work of administration.
As I recall, Mr. Bracken took a very active
part in Manitoba in the Rowell-Sirois inquiry,
and it is my recollection that at that time lie
rather emsphasized the necessity of more
centralization, in certain aspects, at Ottawa.
I ask hionorable senators, after reading the
statemsent I have referred to, if they can
really tell what bis position is? I cannot
make it out from that. I know that if that
statement were made by him as leader of the
opposition in Parlianent, it would be probed
to the botton, and that Mr. Bracken would
find it necessary to clear it up and not leave
it as a glittering generality.
That is an
important matter, honourable senators. There
is centralization going on bere at Ottawa
to-day to a serions degree.
I am gravely concerned about the centralization of anthority in Ottawa. I recognize how
necessary it is in war-time for a goverrment
to adopt a centralized and almost arbitrary
policy, but I am disturbed as to whether or
not the Government, if it is in office after the
war, or any other governent, will be able
to resist the great forces which have been built
up under this policy. To my mind it is one
of the most serions things honourable nembers
of the Senate have to consider. If youî look to
the C. C. F. party, there is no hope there,
because their policy can only operate effectirely and successfully under an, increased
form of centralization.
Then when we turn
to the Conservative party on this question of
centralization of power, it is impossible to get
a reflection of what thoir policy will be if the
party is returned after the election, because
the leader in the House is only the nominal
leader of the party, and any statement of policy
mmust come from the real leader hinself. I
have rtad what lie has said on that. I say
thIat if he were in Parliament the public would
find ont about these things.
Now a word about the war policy. I have
looked through Mr. Bracken's speeches and
have becen unable to find that he has offered
any definite statement of policy in that connection. I know there is nobody in Canada
who has the war and its successful conclusion
iore closely at heart than Mr. Bracken, and
J know that he bas very good reasons for
feeling as he does. But when one finds that
in his public statements on theose questions he
docs not discuss that issue, one wonders, in the

1MARCH 9, 1944
first place, wbether that means that he is in
accord with the present Government's methods
of conducting the war or not. If he is, 1
tbink be sbould be in bis place in Parliament
to give them bis support, and flot be sniping
at tbem from outside; if, on tbe other band,
as a matter of tactics, be is refraining frorn
discussing that question, I tbink be should be
beaded off and should be induced to follow
the best constitutional procedure.
I notice, bonourable senators, that Mr.
Bracken goes into the province of Quehec and
tells the people tbere that this is a new party,
the newest party in Canada. In other words,
what be is saying to the people of Quebec is,
"I bave no past, and my future is spotless."
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. FARItIS: Side by side witb that,
as honourable senators wbo go hack to their
constituencies in the rest of Canada know,
there bas been for at least two years a whispering campaiga against the Government"iQue"Conscription!1"
"Mackenzie Kingl'
"
bec 1 I say that is not a healthy condition, and
that these tbings ought to be brought together,
and that there sbould he no more opportunity
for the leader of a great political party to
camouflage the situation throughout the country than there is for the Prime Minister to do
so in Parliament.
Honourable senators, may I conclude with
this word? One of the greatest problems to
be worked out after this war will be considered
The people of
at the Peace Confercnce.
Canada have the full measure of the Prime
Minister's capacity to function at that time.
It is my opinion-I ask no other man to agree
with me-that the Prime Minister is better
qualified for tbat undertaking than any other
man in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I arn proud to sav that,
and in doing so I hope I amrn ot indulging in
petty polities. It is my belief about a great
statesman. For all I know, Mr. Bracken may
be a greater man than Mr. Mackenzie King;
he may have the capacity, to go to the peace
table and surpass anything that Mr. Mackenzie
King would do. One thing I know: if Mr.
Meighen were leader *of the Conservative
party, bis position would be in Parliament and
he would have enabled tbe people to judge
of bis capacity just as well as they can judge
of the capacity of the Prime Minister.
I repeat that if Mr. Broecken is a great leader
the people of this country should have the
opportunity of seeing him function in the
higheýst place in which the leader of a party

My

can function, namely, in Parliament, where he
would have an opportunity to represent the
people, speak for his whole party, and wbere
he would undergo the acid test of confronting
his opponents. For that reason, honourable
senators, 1 arn submitting this. inquiry to your
consideration. I regret that the bonourable
leader opposite, for wbnm I have always had
the highest regard, bas seen fit to challenge
my right to make these statements. 1 have
endeavoured to discuss this question in its
constitutional aspects; I believe the statements
I have made are in the publie interest; and
if Mr. Bracken is big enough to take his place
along witb Sir John Macdonald, Alexander
MacKenzie, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Robert
Borden, R. B. Bennett and Mackenzic King,
it is my belief that he could render no greater
service to bis party than by taking bis place
in Parliam-ent, wbere be could give the completest demonstration of bis ability. If he bas
sucb great qualities, it is a tragedy in our
public life at this time that he bais flot taken
the place wbicb Mr. Meighen would have
taken, and wbere be would bave demonstrated
his capacity.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, before I corne to my real reply to
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), wbo bas spoken at great
length on a subject that would bave been
more flttingly deait with in another place, may
I say that in the twelve years during whicb
I have heen a member of the Senate tbis is
the flrst truly political campaign speech that
I have heard here. I cannot help wondering
how this Chamber would function if every
honourable member were to make from time
to time a political speech of the character
of that to which we bave just listened. I
wish to thank him, in the name of my
distinguished leader, for if Hon. John Bracken
were not a man of capacity and one to be
reckoned witb in public affairs, my honourable
friend, with ail bis powers and eloquence,
would not bave spoken in the way that be
lias, for well over an hour, almost entirely
about Mr. Bracken. If my leader were a man
of mediocre ability, bis speeches would not
have been the subject of so mucb consideratien by my honourable friend.
As for myself, 1 bave neyer made in this
buse what could be regarded as a political
speech, and I do not intend to make one.
The Senate of Canada would lose its prestige,
it would not be performing the duty for which
it was created, if it were turned into a common
political forum-if we were to make here
speeches that are better suited to another place

honourable friend the senior senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) stood in his

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. W. D. EULER moved the second reading of Bill E, an Act respecting Gore District
Mutual Fire Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
brought forward on behalf of the Gore District
Mutual Fire Insurance Company, whose head
office is in the city of Galt, in the county of
Waterloo, in the province of Ontario. The
company was established more than one
hundred years ago and to-day is unquestionably one of the soundest. most reputable and

best managed insurance companies of this
kind in the Dominion-something that no
doubt honourable senators naturally would
expect from an institution that bas its headquarters in the county of Waterloo.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: In 1937 the company was
incorporated under Dominion charter. The
company now seeks to enlarge its powers and
activities by obtaining authority to make
insurance contracts with regard to the following additional lines: forgery, impact by
vehicle, live stock, machinery, marine insurance, real property, smoke damage and water
damage, This is practically the sole purpose
of the Bill.
There is one other slight change. Under
the present charter the company must have
a surplus of at least half a million dollars
before it can write insurance. It is now proThe
posed to raise that sum to $600,000.
company bas at the present time a surplus of
nearly two and a half million dollars and it
bas on deposit with the federal Government securities considerably in excess of the

fore be quite apparent to honourable members that the policyholders of this company
are well protected.
The Bill bas the unqualified approval of the
Superintendent of Insurance.
I imight add, as a matter of interest and
information to the House, that this company,
shortly after the outbreak of war, made *a
gift of $100,000 to the federal Governmen.t by
way of contribution to the cost of the war. In
addition to that, of course, it bas made very
heavy purchases of Victory bonds.

I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Carried.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

He said: Honourable senators, the matter
referred to in this, miotion is one that I desire
to bring to the attention of not only the
Sena te, but of the other House and of the
Government. This is an age of eleetririty, and
the success or progress of almost every rommunity now depends very largely upon the
electririty it bas available at a reasonable rate.
Dealing more particularly with the province of
New Brunswick, I miay say that our water
powers bave bren developed as far as possible.
On the Saint John river there is a fair amount
of power, but there are no storage facilities.
The -Nepisiquit river aise, bas a fair amount

There is a coal-generated electrir development

coal are not inexhaustible. Prince Edward

SENATE

This is but a bare outline of the situation.
I think it would be well not to conclude the
discussion to-day, so I would move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. F. D. BLACK: Honourable senators, I
am1 sorry that I was not here when my honourable friend from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson) began his address.
Although he has
moved adjournment of the debate, I would ask
permission to make a few rcmarks now, by
way of endorsing cverything that he has said.
The suggested li ydro-electric development
holds great potectialities fer the Maritime
provincs: it could supply power cheaper, as
far as I know, than it is being supplied anywhere on the continent at the present time.
The power in the area referred to by my honourable friend is almost inrxhaustible. It
would serve Prince Edward Island, all of New
Brcn-icic and whatever part of Nova Scotia
diredii to use the powxcr. All the southern
sbores cf the Bay of Fundy-in short. at least,
two-tiris of the province of Nova Scotiawould be within dirret range of that power
devclopment.
Tiere is one other important feature, which
I do not think my honourable friend mentioned, namely, that in the immediate area between tie Mensramcook river and the Petitcodiac river, on one side, and on the opposite
side of the Petitcodiac, that is the Albert
countv side, tire
ire enormous salt deposits,
decr-iibed by engineers as some of the largest
knxwn d
cf the
oposits kind in the world.
Their imsortane is almost incomprehensible,
since -ait is the basis of most of the important

chemsial manufactures that are so vital in the
life of modern peoplies, both in times of peace
and tmes of war. The hydro power, which I
undcr-sand could be developed there and sold
at a profit, for one cent a kilowatt heur, could
be used in the development of these salt dewhich would tien become a tremendous
x
asset to not only the Maritime provinces, but
the wiolc Dominion. I have very great
picasuie in endorsing the remarks of the honourable senator fron Moncton.

Vancouver. Victoria and Eastern Railway and
Navigation Company. the Nelson and Fort
Sheppard
Railway
Company
and Great
Northern Railway Company.

MARCU 10, 1944
He said: Honourable senators, this Bill is
flot as long as it appears to be. Its hasis is
an agreement between the Great Northern
Railway Company and two of its, subsidiaTies.
Bath these subsidiaries are in the province of
British Columbia, and the plan is that the
parent company will take over fromn the suhsidiaries and operate the railroads mentioned
in the agreements. This is to be dame under
a 99-year lease, with provision that the parent
company may acquire by purchase instead of
by lease. The two apparently long agreements, schedulea A and B to the Bill, are
identical except as to parties, the first being
between one of the subsidiaries and the parent
company, and the second between the other
subsidiary and the parent campany; and they
provide for the terms of the lease. I think
the important termn to point out ta honourable
senators at this stage is that the rental price
in each instance is the annual depreciation of
the railroad, as approved by the United States
Interstate Commerce Commission and the
Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada.
In case of conflict over this, matter, the
decision of the Transport Board would govern.
Two other agreements are attached ta the
Bill, schedules C and D, one being with the
Canadian National Railways and the other
with the Canadian Pacific Railway. There
are running rights in connection with the Canadian National and the Canadian Pacific, and
the substance of these schedules is virtually
a guarantee on the part of the Great Northarn
Railway Company that it will carry out these
running rights in the same way as the respective subsidiary company had been obligated
ta do.
There is in the Bill ane provision which I
should like ta read, clause 5:
For and in respect of any of the purpases
aforesaid the said Great Northern .Railway
Company

shahl have

ail tb.le

po-wers,

authority

have given their approval ta the Bill in its
present form and ta tlie schedulas. Also, I
have bad a discussion with Mr. MacNeill, the
Senate's Parliamentary Counsel, wito tells me
that he bas gone over tlie Bill and bas no
criticism ta make of it at present. He intends
ta give it further study, and if ha lias any
comments or suggestions lie will present tbemn
ta the committee. It wiil, of course, be for
the committee ta say wbom tbey wish ta
appear before it, but the promoters of the
Bill are asking counsel for the Canadian Pacific
Railway and the Canadian National Railways
and representatives of the Board of Transport
Commissianers ta ha available for attendance
at the committee hearing. I take it that the
Transport Board of itself could not pass upon
the subject-matter of this Bill, but would
have jurisdiction after the Biil is passed. I
have been in conversation with the Board's
solicitor, wbo tells me that ha will be preparad ta attend before the committea and give
any information that ha can in connection
witb this measure.
Ia these circumstances, honaurable senators,
I maya that the Bill ha given second reading.
If this is agreed ta, I shail then maya that the
Bill ha referred ta the Standing Committea on
Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I presumne the
holding company controls the stock.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS:

Yes, absolutely.

Hon. M.r. DAVIES: Are the shareholders of

the subsidiary companies agrecable ta this
Bill?
Hon. Mr. iFARRIS: Oh, yes. Agreaments
have already been entered into and executed.

That means in short, that the Great Northern iRailway Company, in its operation of
these subsidiaries, will be entirely under the
jurisdiction of thé Board of Transport Commissianers for Canada.

I may say that it is my intention ta move,
if this Bili is given second reading, that it
be referred ta the Railways Committee. The
Bill bas aiready been examined by Mr. Flintoft, counsel for the Canadian Pacific Railway,
and by Mr. 'MeMillan, assistant general solicitor for the Canadian National Raiiways; and

MARCH 10, 1944
It may be explained that if is imrpossible
for the companiy to go into voluntary liquidation
and distribute its assets, owing f0 the existence
of its 990-3 ear lease with the Canadien Pacifie
Railway. Therefore it is obliged f0 continue
in existence, and thaf is why we have provided
that the shares of the company should not be
reduced b1elow $1 each.
If the Bill is given second reading, I shaîl
ask that if be referred f0 the Standing Coinmitfee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understand the
company is interested entirely in its timber
limits?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Surely.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Who owns the
New Brunswick Railway Company?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The New Brunswick
Bailway Company. I do not know how many
stockholders there are.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would it not
be necessary for the stockholders to approve
of this proposed reduction of capitalization?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The Bill provides
that thiere must be a special general meeting
of the shareholders and approval by at least
two-thirds of the votes before application can
be made to, the Dominion Goverament.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understand the
capitalization is 30,000Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: -shares,

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: At a special

thirds of the sharehiolders vote in favour of
the proposed reduction, thle company can
apply to the Dominion Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The company is nof
ope-rating the railway?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: No. The company
cannot go into liquidation, because it has
leased ifs railway to the Canadien. Pacifie
Railway for 990 years.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Why does the
company desire to reduce the par value of its
shares?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I think that could
be explained by reference to the technicalities
of the income tax. The Exehequer Court
recently gave judgment f0 the effeet that

7à

capital divided among shareholders is subI ect
to taxation as income unless the capital stock
is actually reduced.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Is there
earned surplus undistributed?

a large

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON- Yes. Theee faets
can be brought out in committee.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As explained by my
honourable friend, the company now has a
capitalization of $3,000.000, which it is proposed to reduce to $30,000.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Thirty thousand
one-dollar shares.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. I arn inclined
to think that both provincial and federal taxes
may account for the reduction desired. No
doubt the details will be carefully gone
inoto when the Bill is before our Railway
Committee. The company has had a very
lar&e property in these timberlands, which
comprise over one million acres of fine timber,
and that is about àll the property which is
lef t.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: That is all.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: And it bas disposed of
certain portions of that timber, but there is &
remnant. The points te, be considcred are the
relationship of the new capital stock to the
value of the lands, and also the question of
how this proposed reduction will affect the
rights of the province, as well as those of the
federal Government, in su far as taxation is
concerned.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable senators, I
think this is really a very simple proposition.
The New Brunswick Railwav Comp.any is
endeavouring to return to its stockholders the
capital which they originally invested in that
company. As the honourable senator frora
Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson) bas explained,
the province of New Brunswick has no objection. This legislation is being sought fromn
the Dominion Parliament with the full concurrence of the stockholders and also of the
province of New Brunswick. Under the Railwav Act the company cannot nay off its capital
stock among its stockholders without permission of Parliament, as provided by this Bill.
There is no subterfuge; this is a transaction
I amn sure that
plain and ahove boa-rd.
when the matter cornes before the committee,
persons will be present who are ready and
competent to explain the whole proposition.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is this consideration. It is quite conceivable that under
the existing taxation law a great injustice is
being done to this cornpany. 1 know of the
case of a cornparatively small company in

Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours, on the understanding that the
committee would meet when the Senate rises
to-morrow, which perhaps will be about
4 o'clock in the afternoon. I feel that in
committee we could have a fuller and better
discussion of this subject than would be
possible in this Chamber. Without making
further remarks, I would move that this
matter be referred to the Standing Committee
on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
merely wish to state that if there is a reference
to committee of this motion, to which the
honourable senator from Moncton (Hon. Mr.
Robinson) spoke so well a few days ago, the
reference would not in any way commit the
Dominion Government to any expenditure
that might be suggested in the resolution. I
think it is desirable that the gentlemen to
whom my honourable friend has referred
should be heard by the committee. If the
committee should think it wise to niake a
recommendation, that could be considered
at the appropriate time.
The motion was agreed to.

He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is to incorporate a company, whose
proposed business is indicated in the title of
the Bill, and certain powers are asked for in
order to enable the company to conduct that
business. These desired powers are no broader
than would be granted in the ordinary course
by Letters Patent on application to the
Department of the Secretary of State. On the
motion for second reading of the Bill I shall
give reasons why incorporation is asked for by
Act of Parliament instead of by Letters
Patent. As I have already remarked, the
object of the Bill is simply to incorporate the
company. The Bill itself would not give
power to operate. Under present conditions
it would be necessary for the company, after
being incorporated, to apply to the Comptroller of Civil Aviation for a licence, and also
to the Board of Transport Commissioners. I
shall be glad to give further explanations on
the motion for second reading.

MARCH 22, 1944
into effect ini October, 1941, the renta enforced
in Toronto were those of the previous montb,
whereas in Montreal they were those of the
previaus year. Montreal was already two years
behind in normal recovery, a few months behind in mass war-production, and fine montha
behind in the matter of the rentais agreed
upon in February or March of 1941. This,
honourable senators, is just an instance. It
does not fully prove the case, but it shows
how an order that ignores local needa may
weil create discrimination and disorder. The
rentais whieh are being received in Montreal
to-day are the same as those of May, 1941.
This may be one of the reasons for presentday conditions in Montreal, and expiains why,
even if the controis on construction were
removed, there would be no incentive to buiid.
This is but an instance. I go back to my
main point.
At this time we may feel that private enterprise is somewhat hesitant. Private enterprise
needs security: it needs sedurity against state
ownership, state competîtion, burcaucracy and
burdensome controls. I am not at war with
controis in generai. We are toid that some of
them already have been removed. I conaider controis an evil; but while the war is
on, a necessary evil. When they cesse to be
necessary, they stili will be an evil.
Control has played havoc with our liberties.
During the struggie for freedom of country,
the liberties of the citizen within the country
-which are known as civil, personai and
politicai liberties-have been to a large extent
suspended. They wiii have to be returned
to the citizen as soon as the superior interest
of country in the struggle for freedom has
corne t.o anend; and in the drafting of a
transition plan we shouid not forget those
liberties which are the most precioua inheritance of ail British subi ects. They were
acquired through incessant vigilance and
tenacity extending over centuries. They may
be iost in a single day.
The common law is unwritten, but in the
unending fight for liberty in the Old Country
the victories of the citizen are represented by
written documents, commencing with the
Creat Charter and continuing on down through
the Franchise Bill of 1884, the Factory Act of
1891, and the co-operative and trade union
Bills passed on the eve of the Great War.
We may be satisfied, I think, to follow the
advice cf the greatest British subi ect of the
day in this matter. the Right Honourabie
Winston Churchill, who aays:
We rnust beware of trying to buiid a society
in which nobo~dy counts for anything except
the politicians or officiais, a society where enterprise gains no reward and thrif t no privileges.

Hon. MI. BEAUREGARD.

On the Order:
Consideration of the forty-sixth report of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, to whom was
referred the petition of Wilson Allan Martin,
together with the evidence taken before the
said committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable senators, I would move that reports 46 to 52,
appearing on the Order Paper as orders Nos.
22 to 28, inclusive, be taken en bloc, and be
concurred in.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to delay proceedings at this
stag,. but I an disturbed about the large
rnumber of divorce cases that comne before us.
We are net a competent body to deal with
them. I sa
this without disrespect to the
ceimmittee. It is very seldom that I disagree
with the decision reached by the majority of
the committee; but I feel that this matter of
divorce should be handled by a judge or
judges, who are accustomed to hearing

MARCH 23, 1944
evidence and reaching a decision upon it. I
suggest to this House that after the Easter
vacation we should really get down to cases
and seriously consider what is to be done with
respect to this whole problem. I am suggesting,
not that we should say to the provinces of
Quebec and Prince Edward Island that they
should have divorce courts if they do not
want them, but that we should work out some
arrangement whereby the judges of the Superior Court, or the Exchequer Court, or some
other body should hear divorce evidence and
give a decision, which then, if necessary, could
be sent to Parliament for approval. We can
deal with this subject better than any other
body in Canada, and I think we should take
it up after the recess.
There is another matter to which I should
like to refer. Several years ago a Bill was
brought into this House for the purpose of
changing the divorce law of Canada. Objection to such a change can come only from the
provinces that now have divorce courts. I
think it is the unanimous opinion of business
and professional people in those provinces
that some change should be made in the
grounds for divorce. In Britain the law permits of divorce on grounds other than the
one that is valid here, and that law has
worked satisfactorily. I know that in the
provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan cases
have been brought forward which are very
disturbing to the people of the country. There
was one the other day in which a woman
whose husband went away seventeen years ago
wanted a divorce. Nothing could be done.
She had been living with another man for
years. If Great Britain can adopt a wider
jurisdiction in these matters, I see no reason
why we should not consider doing so.
Some years ago this House did pass a bill
extending the grounds for divorce, but it was
delayed and did not receive consideration in
the House of Commons. I believe that such
a man as the Chairman of our Committee
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) could work out some
sort of measure which, when presented to the
members of the other House, would be found
satisfactory. I know that certain religious
bodies have objections to any broadening of
the grounds for divorce. These objections are
not confined to any one sect. But surely we
are progressing. We must realize that the
present situation is far from satisfactory. I
raise this question because I think we have
the time to give it consideration. I am not
going to propose a committee, but I think we
owe it to Canada and to ourselves to devise
some better system than the present one.
No one wants to be a member of the Divorce
Committee. As all who have been members
106-7

know, once you are on that committee you
cannot get off. I think that next year we
shall have to put the new senators on it.
Then, I am sure, they would be in favour of
a change.
I am going to ask the Chairman of the Committee, for whom I have the greatest respect
-it is a pleasure to work under him on the
committee-to see whether, with his ability
and experience, he cannot do something along
the line of what I have proposed, and to be
the leader in the crusade.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
as an unfortunate member of the Divorce
Committee, placed there without my knowledge or consent, I should like to make one
or two observations. In, the first place, I want
to support what has just been said by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) with regard to the Chairman (Hon. Mr.
Robinson). In connection with the fact that
the people of Quebec and Prince Edward
Island have to apply to Parliament in order
to secure relief, one important point, as I see
it, is that this system is an absolute injustice
to people in those two provinces who have no
conscientious scruples against divorce. In
being obliged to corne to Ottawa and pay all
the attendant travelling and hotel expenses
for witnesses and lawyers, they are discriminated against as compared with the people of
other provinces, which have their own local
divorce courts. After all, divorce is the law
of Canada. True, many of our citizens do not
believe in it. That is their right; they do not
apply for divorce.
It does seem to me that, in all fairness, the
people of Quebec and Prince Edward IslandI will speak bluntly and say the Protestants of
those provinces-should not be discriminated
against as compared with the Protestants of
other provinces. I presume that in the province
of Ontario and the other provinces whose
courts have divorce jurisdiction our Roman
Catholie fellow-citizens do not seek divorces.
That is quite right; that is in accordance with
their belief. But the Protestants of these
provinces who may want to apply for divorce
are able to do so at relatively small cost. The
fact that the Protestants of Quebec and
Prince Edward Island have not that privilege
is to my mind evidence of unfair discrimination. I have always believed that.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Winnipeg further that the grounds for divorce
should be somewhat broadened. Probably
many people would criticize me for saying that.
It seems to me that if a couple have lived
together long enough to realize that there is no

muvx umo

SENATE
chance of their ever being able to get along
with each other, and if there is constant hickering or strife in the household-perhaps they
even separate in o.rder to live peaceablythe refusai of a divorce to them would lead to
more imrnorality than the granting of a divorce
would. An argument that is sometimes made
against divorce is that it is contrary to the
interests of the children, if any. In some cases
perhaps that is a reason why divorce should
not ho granted. But I would suggest that
children may suifer more from having te live
-in- improPei sruîtudiigs wl-pa--ts--who
cannot get along together than from being
transferred to homes blessed by happiness and
contentmcnt. 1 know that a certain class of
our peuple, with whom I have no quarrel, will
be opposcd to this view.
I strongly endorse my honourable friend's
view that some change ought to he made in
the present system.
For one thing, the
Parliament of Canada, hy its very nature, is
not the proper body to deal with divorce cases.
I have just corne from a sitting of the Divorce
Committee, where the evidence te which we
listened was most uncdifying. I do not suppose that wc are any hetter than other people,
but, after ail, the Parliament of Canada is too
dignified a body to ho handling that kind of
thing. It bas business of greater importance
than the relatively trivial one of divorce. 1
add this to thep other and stronger reamons that
I have already stated in support of my argument that divorce for people in Quebec and
Prince Edward Island ought to ho made availahle through some other channel than the
Parliament of Canada.
The motion was agreed to.

SECOND

READING

Hon. NORIMAN P. LAMBERT moved the
second reading of Bill 02, an Act to change
the namne of The Discount & Loan Corporation
te Personal Finance Company of Canada.
Ho said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill, as indicatcd in its title, is to
change the namne of The Discount & Loan
Corporation of Canada to Personal Finance
Company of Canada. The Discount & Loan
Corporation of Canada is now affiliated with
cempanies in the United States which hear
the name Persona] Finance Company, and
the change is asked fer se that the affliated

MARCH 28, 1944
companies may carry on business under a
similar name. I may say by way of explanation that the only Canadian money-lending
company having the word "personal" in its
title is the Personal Loan & Finance Company. of Fredericton, which is now in
liquidation.
After the Bill has received second reading
I shall move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce,
where officials of the Government and the
promoters of the Bill can give a full explanation.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, it is moved by honourable Senator
Lambert, seconded by honourable Senator
Bench, that Bill 02, an Act to change the
name of The Discount & Loan Corporation of
Canada to Personal Finance Company of
Canada be now read the second time. Is it
your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): No.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, when shall this Bill be read the third
time?

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understood
the honourable senator to say that this Bill
would be referred to the Standing Committee

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: That is my intention, and I would so move.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT moved the
second reading of Bill P2, an Act respecting
a certain patent application of Claude H.
Peters.
He said: Honourable senators, I intend to
move, after the second reading, that this Bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bills. The promoters
of the Bill and officers of the department concerned will appear before the committee, at
the appropriate time, to give a full explanation
of the object sought. That object is clearly
set forth in the preamble. I should like, however, to say a few words about the measure,
which was introduced because of an outstand106-7j

83

ing case of neglect and a breach of professional
performance on the part of a firm of attorneys
that is no longer in existence.
In April, 1939, Messrs. Striker & Striker,
a firm of lawyers of St. Paul, Minnesota,
sent to the Ottawa office of E. J. Fetherstonhaugh & Son, a firm of registered Canadian patent attorneys, instructions to file a
patent application on behalf of Striker &
Striker's client, Claude H. Peters. Those
instructions were accompanied by all the
necessary documents, and a cheque for the
amount of the Government fee and the patent
attorney's fee. On April 13, 1939, E. J.
Fetherstonhaugh & Son acknowledged the
papers and cheque, and said the certificate of
filing of the application would be forwarded
as soon as it was received from the Patent
Office. The cheque was then cashed, but no
steps were taken to file the application until
nine months later, on January 26, 1940. In
the meantime, however, on May 16, 1939,
Peters' corresponding United States patenthad
been granted, the application for it having
been filed on January 17, 1938. The result of
the inaction here was that section 26, subsection 2, of the Patent Act, 1935, completely
barred the issue of a Canadian patent to
Peters, because the Canadian application was
filed more than one year after his United
States application, and after the issue of the
United States patent.
On February 13, 1940, E. J. Fetherstonhaugh
& Son wrote to Striker & Striker, sending a
new oath for signature by Peters. The letter
gave the serial number of the application,
but did not give the filing date. The oath
was executed and returned almost immediately. On December 4, 1940, an action was
issued by the Patent Office, Canada, rejecting
the application on the ground that has been
mentioned. This action was sent to E. J.
Fetherstonhaugh & Son, but they gave no
report of it to Striker & Striker. In answer
to inquiries that they made on January 6 and
February 21, about the status of the application, Striker & Striker were told, in a letter
of March 14, 1941, that "this case is in a
pending state and we expect to be able to give
you a definite report in three months' time."
It was just under the three months' time that
the application was abandoned, on June 4,
1941, because of failure to answer the official
action within six months of its date. Striker
& Striker received no further word about the
application from E. J. Fetherstonhaugh &
Son. On June 7, 1943, they wrote to the firm
of Fetherstonhaugh & Company, successors
to E. J. Fetherstonhaugh & Son, with the
result that the whole situation was disclosed.
The facts were put before the Commissioner of

SENATE
Patents, who, after fairly protracted procecdings, issued in January of this year an
order striking the name of E. J. Fetherstonhaugh & Son from the official register of
attiorneys entitled to practise before the
Patent Office.
It would seem, therefore, that this is a proper
case for a special Act, since both the applicant
and his attorneys in the United States proceedcd in good faith and in the usual way to
deal with a firm which, in view of its being
on the official register of patent attorneys,
waz-at least¯liè-ad every--raEonu to .pt

readily sec, an occurrence of tiis sort is apt
to leave an unfavourable impression of Canada
on the minds of those adversely affected, and
it seems to me that from the national point
of view alone, whatever is necessary should
be donc to alleviate any incidental consequences of what appears to be at least a case
of gross carelessness.
lon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Has any reason
been given why the well-known firm of
Fetherstonhaugh was stricken from the official
list of patent attorneys?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The firm of E. J.
Fetherstonhaugh & Son was dissolved, and its
place taken by the firm of Fetherstonhaugh &
Company. It is, I think, pretty well known
-that this firm, with offices iere and in Toronto,
is under the ownership and control of Smart &
Biggar.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is the real purpose of this Bill?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: To reinstate in the
Patent Oflice herhedhe original application for
patent riglts in Canada.

Hion. Mr. LECER: This Bill will have the
effect of amending a public Act. It seems to
me that once we open the door in this way
we shall find if t ery difficult to close it again.
lon. Mr. McIRAE: Honourable senators, I
am somwhiat inclined to agree with the last
speaker (Hon. Mr. Leger). By this Bill it is
proposed to coirect a mistake in the selection
of pateit attorneys which brought about the
unfortuite -ituation described by the sponsor

of the Bill (Hon. Mr. Lambert). I doubt very
muci wiluhr we should establish such a prex
cedent. What ias happened is too bad,
but it is not a matter of major importance.
Once we establish the principle of passing a
private Act to correct our patent law we shall
have opened a gate that we may find difficult
to shut again.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I do net profess to
have an intimate knowledge of our patent law,
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

and I may be wrong when I say that I
cannot see that this Bill would have the
effect feared by my honourable friends
opposite.

The purpose of the Bill is simply

to correct a gross injustice whicb bas resulted
front following the procedure laid down by the
Patent Act. I would suggest that the point
raised by honourable senators might fittingly
be di-ciusscd at greater length before the
Commiiit tee on Miscellaneous Private Bills, to
which, if this motion carries, I shall ask that
the Bill be referred.

second reading, do we not adopt its principle?
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
lon. Mr. ASELTINE: Before the motion is
proceeded with. I should like to be informed
as to the nature of the patent, what section

bars the granting of it, and so forth.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think I explained
that under subsection 2 of section 26 of the
Patent Act the application should have been
filed here net later than twelve months after
the American application, and before the issue
of the United States patent. The patent
applied for, as set forth in the original petitien, bas to do with an air-conditioning system.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators,
the number of questions that have been asked
would be more appropriate if the Bill were
before one of our standing committees. As a
rule, I quite agree with honourable senators
who do net favour our taking action in patent
matters; but in accordance with the opinion
of my honourable friend from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) I deem it unfortunate
that the applicant in this case made his
application through wrong solicitors. Up to
a very short time before the fire of Fetherstonhaugh & Son was removed from the official
list of patent solicitors no one would have
thought for a moment that an applicant for a
patent would make a mistake in retaining that
firm. It was one of our best kniown patent
firms. This is evidenced by the surprise of
the honourable leader on the other side (Hon.
Mr. Ballantlyne) in asking why the well-known
firum of Fetherstonhaugh was removed from
the official list. In view of the questions that
have been asked, I think we should give the
Bill second reading and then refer it to one of
our standing committees, where we can enter
into the matter in detail.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I would respectfully suggest to the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) that the reference be to the Banking and Commerce Committee, where we could have the assistance of
our Law Clerk.

MARCH 28, 1944
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is a good suggestion. Some years ago, when I was a member of the Miscellaneous Private Bills Committee, it was very seldom that more than
six or seven members attended its meetings.
I fully agree with what has been said in regard
to. our moving very carefully in a matter of
this kind, where it is important that no mistakes should be made. For this reason I
think the Bill should go to one of our larger
committees, I do pot care which, and that
there should be a good attendance.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: My reason for suggesting that the Bill be referred to the Miscellaneous Private Bills Committee was that
I believe such subjects are usually referred to
that committee. I shall be only too happy to
have the Bill referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee, where it can be fully
examined.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. KING: I would seem clear that
the applicant in question, probably through
neglect on the part of what was regarded
as a responsible firm of solicitors, has been
deprived of his rights. I think we can safely
give the Bill second reading and refer it to the
Banking and Commerce Committee. There
we can have in attendance our Law Clerk
and officials from the Patent Office, as well
as those interested in the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Lambert, the Bill

was referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. W. E. FOSTER moved the second

reading of Bill R2, an Act to incorporate
Fundy Air Lines.
He said: Honourable senators, in moving the
second reading of this Bill I should like to
draw your attention to clause 2 of Order in
Council P.C. 2200, passed in 1943, which
states that the Honourable the Secretary of
State, by reason of the existing war conditions,
is of opinion, in which opinion 'the Minister
of Munitions and Supply, who is charged with
responsibility in connection with civil aviation,
concurs,.that for the period of the present war
applications for the incorporation of companies
having such principal object or purpose
should not be granted under the Companies
Act, but that applicants who desire to
incorporate companies with this principal

85

object or purpose should be advised to apply
for incorporation by Act of Parliament. Hence
the introduction of this Bill.
I may say that no right is sought to operate
aircraft or engage in air operations. Before
the company can actually operate, it must
secure from the Department of Transport a
licence which, speaking generally, would warrant the airworthiness of the aircraft. The
company would also have to secure from the
Board of Transport Commissioners a licence
to operate between such points and places as
may from time to time be approved by Order
in Couneil.
I understand that there are a number of
applications at present pending before the
Board of Transport Commissioners, but that
they cannot be dealt with until the appropriate Orders in Council have been passed.
No doubt honourable members of this House
read the statement made in another place by
the Minister of Munitions and Supply, who
has charge of all matters pertaining to air
service. In the declaration of policy which he
made a short time ago he said he proposed to
establish an Air Transport Board. This board,
as I understand from reading the text of the
Minister's statement, would assume the duties
now performed by the Board of Transport
Commissioners so far as they relate to transportation by air. It is also proposed that this
Air Transport Board should have authority to
examine into the financial structure of any
company seeking a licence to operate aireraft,
and to examine and pass upon aircraft that
any company might propose to operate.
The various clauses of this Bill deal only
with the usual financial powers required, together with the authority necessary to set up
the machinery to operate.an air-line service,
if and when a licence is secured through the
present channels or those which may be
brought into being under the policy declared
by the Minister of Munitions and Supply.
There are several standing committees to
which this Bill might be referred; but on the
suggestion of the leader of the. Government,
with whom I have been in consultation, I
propose to move, after the second reading,
that the Bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours.
Hon. A. D. MeRAE: May I ask the honourable senator what air line the company contemplates establishing under this Bill? I
presume that in asking for-legislation it has
in mind the service it would like to develop.
While I am on my feet, may I say that there
seems to be some uncertainty at the moment
with respect to our air development. From
what has been said elsewhere, I understand that

86

SENATE

n is proposed to take over one of the largest
companies. Personally I am in favour of
individual effort by companies that will develop the country, and I would not have any
particular objection to granting a charter of
this kind. But I think we ought to know
what the company has in mind; what territory
it expects to serve. It is just possible that in
authorizing a company of this sort we might
be running counter to the intentions of the
Government with regard to air service in
Canada. I know there is no harm in passing
the Bill,¯ except that we should be pittntl-g
another iron into the fire, and might be interfering in something that would have to be
worked out. If the honourable senator could
give us a little more information about what
the company expects to do, I am sure it would
help us to decide whether, having regard to
the fact that the air service seems to be in a
state of flux at the moment, we should pass
the Bill at this time.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I may say in answer
to the honourable senator from Vancouver
that it is not the intention of the company
to carry on an international service. What
is in mind is a local service.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The territory will not be
covered by the regular lines.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I cannot tell the
honourable gentlemen anything further than
that. Any route the company would apply
for, as well as the type of aircraft, and so on,
would naturally have to be approved. There
is really nothing in the Bill except the incorporation of the company. The licence to
operate would be obtained through the proper
authority.
Did I understand my honourable friend to
ask what was the Government's attitude
towards this?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: No.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I cannot say what the
attitude of the Government is towards this
proposal; but certainly when the Bill comes
before the standing committee we shall have
no difficulty in ascertaining the attitude of
the department officials.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I have just come across the following
clause:
The company may . . . carry on the business
of patrolling, by neans of aeroplanes, or other
flying machines, wooded or other areas, whether
for purposes of fire or other protection, or for
purposes of observation and investigation.
As we know, Canada is at war just now.
How would the Department of National
Hon. Mr McRAE.

Defence or the Navy or Army authorities
regard this? Would they not look upon it as
interference?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: In answer to the
honourable member I may say that I am
net prepared to discuss clauses of the Bill on
the motion for second reading. To do so
would be a little premature.
The clauses
will be discussed either in Committee of the
Whole or in a standing committee, and I shall
be prepared to deal with them there.

ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION
SOCIAL SECURITY
DEBATE

AND

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
March 22, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Beauregard:
That it is expedient that this House should
get ready without delay to study the legislation
which will be brought before it-constructive
or remedial legislation-intended to safeguard,
immediately after the termination of war production, the economic life in each of the provinces of the country; and for this purpose to
constitute among its members a committee of
economic studies, as representative as possible,
which would be empowered to investigate the
normal production in each province, the
standard of living, the employment capacities,
the conditions of labour, the openings, and, for
this purpose, to invite and hear representatives
from farmers, labourers, transport companies,
the industrial and commercial world, concerning
their preparation and their concrete projects
for the post-war period.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (Translation): Honourable senators, those who lived
through the former war, who experienced the
unemployment crisis of 1930-1938, and who
now witness the present happenings, are rather
uneasy and look to the future with some
misgivings.
The pessimists, those who never venture to
undertake anything, moan over the past, weep
over the present and despair of the future.
Yet there is no problem, no matter how
difficult, which cannot be solved by anyone
who applies himself to the task. Words are
of no avail. What is needed is action, and
action before it is too late. To govern is
to provide for the future. Well, let us provide for to-morrow.
We have here all the necessary facilities to
study post-war reconstruction and guidance
problems. In the Senate we are not influenced
by political considerations, we are not affected
by the hazards of changing governments. We
are not theoriste who, in the seclusion of
their offices, work out the solution of abstract
problems; most of us have the advantage of
meeting in our daily life representatives of all
classes of society, of studying their concrete
problems, their practical needs and of helping
them to solve such problems. There are here
representatives of all sections of Canada, who

87

are in a position to appreciate readily the
needs of every class of the population in every
one of the provinces.
In my opinion a committee composed of
members of the Senate would be most representative and realistic, and would be in as favourable a position to recognize and recommend
the necessary solutions as a committee composed entirely of theorists.
I do not contend that those people who
live in a closed world, within the four walls
of their offices, always reach unreliable oonclusions. No. They may evolve in their
minds wonderful theories, they may put down
on paper splendid programmes; but when it
comes to putting such programmes into practice, to make them workable, that is quite
another story.
The weakest point of all these plans lies
in the fact that people in offices, as often
happens, see only what goes on around them
and lack close contact with reality. If a
theorist has always lived in Ottawa, he can
have no exact understanding of the needs
experienced by the people of British Columbia, Quebec, or the central, western and
eastern parts of the country.
For instance, in the province of Quebec,
where families are very large, it would hardly
be practical to build houses of the same size
as those intended for other sections of the
country. Such a policy would disregard the
needs and conditions of each centre, and so
would be absurd.
A few days ago our highest ranking colleague said to me: "Well, after all, how will
you solve the post-war problem?' To my
mind, one of the first means we should consider is the distribution of prosperity in each
one of our communities. Since our country
has the expanse of a continent and displays
various needs, it is useless to apply but one
solution to all difficulties.
Some people think that one hat of the same
shape and size would suit every one. I am
afraid such headgear would be too big for a
number of people and too small for others.
Instead of trying to fit all heads to one single
model, it seems preferable to make hats of
different sizes for different people. And if we
wish to distribute prosperity among every
community we must, since the needs differ,
consider decentralization as a first means.
Why are we at war? To prevent the world
from being enslaved for the benefit of the
greatest centralizing force the world bas ever
known.
In order to overcome this evil of centralization, we have had to use the same system.
That is what physicians call the homeopathic
method; it consists in -applying a remedy of

88

SENATE

the same nature as the disease. It has been
necessary to pursue such a course of action
in order to co-ordinate all our efforts and
crush the enemy.
IHowever, what may be a necessary evil
to-day would still remain an evil after the
war. We should therefore eradicate it. Our
men are fighting to crush this attempt at
centralization and to preserve our freedom of
thought, of action, of life. To-morrow, when

some way bring about a solution of the
problem. I personally believe that no matter
how arduous the task before us may be, it
can and will be solved if we are quite determined to solve it.
We here witbin these walls are representatives from all parts of Canada, well acquainted
with the needs and problems of the various
provinces. Who, then, honourable senators, is
in a better position than we are to lay suitable
plans for the economic and social reconstruction of our country immediately after
the war? In making plans we shall avoid pitfalls experienced by many theorists, who have
lost sight of the essential differences as well
as the vital relations between the economic
and the social.
Man has a soul as well as a body. Often
the economic problem is studied without regard to its social aspect. Too much attention
is given to the material organization; too
little, if any at all, to its repercussion on the
spiritual, on the moral, side. When no attention is given to the soul, there can be no
lasting contentment, no happiness for man.
Any reconstruction of our world must begin
with the individual. To-morrow's world will
be better if every one of us becomes better.
That is why we must give as much care to
the spiritual as to the physical betterment of
man. I sincerely hope that the proposed reconstruction committee will be soon set up.
When it is, we shall endeavour to study efficient ways to make possible for every one
to-morrow a better life, from the spiritual as
well as material point of view.
We are fighting to-day against the worst
centralization the world has ever known. For
the time being we have centralized our forces
in order to get at our enemy's throat. But
after the war, when our goal is reached, we
must oppose centralization, because it is contrary to liberty-that liberty of action for
which we are sacrificing millions of lives.
We have a clear duty ahead of us. We are
on the second line of battle, where our task
is to prepare the groundwork for the post-war
period. If it is glorious to die for one's
country, it is no less glorious to live for one's

HYDRO-ELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT IN
NEW BRUNSWICK
REPORT OF COMMITTEE CONCURRED IN

Hon. Mr. COPP moved concurrence in the
report of the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, with respect
to the following motion:
That in the opinion of the Senate it is
desirable that the Dominion Government should
cause a thorough investigation to be made by
a firm of eminent hydro-electric engineers into
the possibilities of developing tidal power at the
confluence of the Petitocodiac and Memramcook
rivers in the province of New Brunswick.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable members, we all remember quite well the introduction of this matter by the honourable senator
from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson), after
which it was referred to the committee. As
many honourable members know, the committee heard evidence from an eminent engineer,
Dr. Turnbull, who was quite familiar with the
project, and who was supported by the President of the Board of Trade of the city of
Moncton and the Premier of Prince Edward
Island, both of whom were interested in seeing
the tidal power developed at the confluence of
the Petiteodiac and Memramcook rivers..
I may state to honourable members that,
according to an estimate given by the engineer
before the committee, this project when fully
developed will produce in the neighbourhood
of 450,000 horse-power, which would make
available a great deal more power than is
likely te be required in the vicinity of the
development, or than there would be a market
for in the immediate future.
However, this afternoon I want to say a
word on behalf of the province of Prince
Edward Island, and also to support the recommendation of the committee. Our people are
very much interested in the proposal to
develop power at this location. As honourable
senators know, during the last twenty-five
years the harnessing of hydro power all over

MARCH 29, 1944
the world has gone ahead very much faster
than it did at any previous time in history.
In order to give you a little picture of the
position in which the rural areas of the Maritimes are placed as compared with rural areas
in other parts of Canada-in fact, I might say
in other parts of the world-I shall quote a
paragraph or two from a report of a commission appointed by the Government of Manitoba two or three years ago to investigate
the possibility of extending electrical power to
the rural areas of that province. This report
is very comprehensive, and is most informative to those who are interested in rural
electrification.
At page 65 of the report, which is entitled,
"Report of Manitoba Electrification Enquiry
Commission, 1942," I find this:
According to Marquis W. Childs, about 50 per
cent of the agricultural area of Sweden is electrified; but approximately 75 per cent of the
farmers are supplied with central station energy.
In Denmark 85 per cent of the farmers have
electric power. The figure for France and
Germany is about 90 per cent, and for Holland
it is 98 per cent. In New Zealand energy is
available to about 93 per cent of the population,
the figure for strictly farm areas being only
slightly lower.
In the United States, where the adrvance in

+he develo ment
- rliHen.
past twenty-five years has bee n most remarkable, 10-9 per cent of the fa rmers were supplied with central station ele ctricity in 1934,
whereas 38.6 per cent were so supplied in 1941.
To give a picture of our o wn situation in
Canada, I shall cite the percentages of farm
electrification in each of the census periods of
1931 and 1941. They are as follows:
Province
1931
1941
Prince Edward Island.....
3-5
5.4
Nova Sceotia ..............
8-3
26.0
New Brunswick ...........

7.3
Saskatchewan .............

5-4
Alberta ...................
1-7
British Columbia .........
21-8
35-8
The figure for Canada in 194 1 was 19-8 per
cent.
So that you may realize wh at this means, I
may say that one kilowatt ho'ur cf electricity
urots
t
will cost, on an average, five cents; aledt when
and jcs
you apply electrical power to the many job
around a farm to which it can be applied, you
will see at once the disadvan tageous position
of farmers who have no electric ity as compared
with those who have it. T hat situation is
really what is making our peop le quite anxidus
at this time to have chea p power made
available to the rural areas. When the Conservation Commission, unde r Dr. Wallace,
106-8j

91

visited the Maritime Provinces within the last
year or two, this question of rural electrification came up for discussion at every meeting
throughout the Maritimes, and there was
evidence of a general desire on the part of the
rural community that electrical energy should
be made available to the farmers in the
Maritime area.
When you look at this question from that
standpoint, you can readily understand the
interest that has been aroused by the inquiry
before our Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours; and it is because of this
interest that I desire to say a few words today in support of the recommendation of the
committee that the federal Government should
take the lead in making a survey upon which
a proper estimate and plans could be based
in order to proceed with this proposal.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May I ask my honourable friend if it is not quite within the jurisdiction of the provincial government to carry
this out, as has been done in several of the
other provinces-Ontario, for example? In asking this question I do not mean that I have
not every sympathy with the province of New
Brunswick.
Mr. SINCLAIR: We have net had
vincial
ndnrtn
bythe proay evet, the prepesed develepmeet is an
intrprvicial matter. The tidal per
that
wouid he hareessed is
near as can be te the
centre cf the Maritime Previncos, aed if
hydre power were develed there it would
serve New Brunswick, Nova Scetia and Prince
Edward Island. Tho develepmet, if left te
e province, would ho slow, for any one cf
the three provincial Goverements would hesitato te assume respensibility for the undertakieg. The projeot would cal for a large
capital oxponditure, and ie financing this it
would be eecessary te obtain the mcey at
as lew a rate as possible. These ieterested
in the seheme feel that the federal Goverement wculd be able te obtain tbe necessary
capital funds at a lower rate than any province
could. Ie reply te the henourable senator from
Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy), I would say that
ne proposed
develepment sheuld be regarded
as ruch more than a provincial matter. Twhe
service rendorod would be interprovincial.
You might almoat caîl it a national scheme.
This is the eniy petential hydre develepment
accessible te Prince Edward Island, for in
that province we have ne falls or rivers large
eeeugh ta provide electrical energy. If we
caneet secure power frem these tidal waters,
o
Mravailablo alternative will be the

development of power from coal, which would
have to be obtained from the neighbouring
province of Nova Scotia.
Another point that I wish to make is that
the investigation should be proceeded with
as promptly as possible. In view of the
question asked by the honourable senator
from Leeds, it might be wise for the provincial
Governments to approach the Dominion and
suggest that they get together on an investigation of the project. On that point I have no
particular suggestion to make. In all fairness
I must say that I have discussed this matter
with waterpower engineers in the Department
of Mines and Resources, and they indicate
that it is impracticable to transmit electrical
energy by submarine cable, except for short
distances. Other engineers, whose opinion I
have obtained second-hand, do not agree with
this; they cite several instances of successful
transmission by submarine cable within the
An outstanding

instance mentioned was the cable over the
Victoria Nyanza watershed, in South Africa.
for carrying power to the Rand mines. If it
is found impracticable to carry power by submarine cable, it will become more imperative
than ever to consider seriously whether the
time has not arrived for constructing a tunnel
under the Northumberland Strait. A tunnel
would eliminate the need for a cable, and at
the same time would increase the market for
electrical energy. If the power were made
available, it would tic in generally with the
activities of the Canadian National Railways in
the Maritimes, and before long would be used
extensively throughout the three provinces.
Honourable senators, I do not wish to
delay the House unduly. My chief purpose
was te support the committee's recommendation, and te inform the Senate that the provision of electrical power at rates as low as
those applying in other provinces would be a
great boon to our rural population in the
Maritimes.
Hon. JAMES P. MeINTYRE: Honourable
senators, as I come from the province of
Prince Edward Island, I think I should say
something in support of the committee's
recommendation. The object of the proposed
development on the Petitcodiac and Memramcook rivers is, as I understand it, the obtaining of cheaper power for the Maritime Provinces. I will give you a little later on the
rates that we pay in different parts of Prince
Edward Island, and I think you will sec that
these are higher than the rates in any other
part of Canada. Unless cheaper power could
be obtained, there would net be much use in
going ahead with the proposed development.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

Some years ago there was a proposal to
supply Prince Edward Island with electrical
power from the Pictou County Power Commission in Nova Scotia. The idea was to carry
it by submarine cable from Cariboo to Wood
Island, a distance of fourteen miles. But after
studying the matter, Mr. Johnston, Chief
Engineer for Nova Scotia, said that the proposal was an economic impossibility, because
of the high proportion of power that would be
wasted through the submarine cable. However, I understand that, as the honourable
senator from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) said,
engineers have been successful in transmitting
electrical energy over considerable distances
by submarine cable in South Africa and other
Tormentine to
A cable from
countries.
Borden, or somewhere in that vicinity, would
be only about nine miles long; so I take it
the wastage would be negligible.
There are at least two ways of developing
electrical energy: one is by coal and the other
is by hydre. There is probably a third: by
fuel oil. It has been stated that pulverized
coal is just as cheap for this purpose as
water-power. In the last few years the great
improvement in steam-operated generating
machinery has made it possible te develop
electricity at a much cheaper rate than
formerly. We are hoping to be able to get
cheaper electrical power in Prince Edward
Island. and we are greatly interested in the
proposed development of the tidal waters of
the Petitcodiac and Memramcook rivers, for
in our own province there are no waterpowers or streams large enough to provide
power for rural electrification.
The
Maritime
Electric
Company
'of
Charlottetown serves that city and the adjacent
municipalities of Montague and Georgetown,
but its lines do not extend to an.y rural section.
I will give just a few figures so that honourable members may be able to compare our
rates with those prevailing in other provinces.
The residential rates in the city of
Charlottetown and district are as follows:
First 10 kilow%-att-hours or less. $1
Next 33 kilowatt-hours... 4.5 cents per kwh
Next 160 kilowatt-hours... 2.5
2-0
Over 203 kilowatt-hours ..
Minimum charge $1.
The general service rates in the city of
Charlottetown are:
Demand charge-$1 per kilowatt for all demands
in excess of 2 kilowatts.
Plus
Energy charge:
First 100 kilowatt-hours.... 6-0 cents per kwh
Next 200 kilowatt-hours ...

4.0

Over 300 kilowatt-hours... 2.5
Minimum charge-the demand charge, but not
less than $1 per month.

MARCH 29, 1944
The Maritime Electric Company's lines
from Charlottetown to Montague and Georgetown run through some rural sections, but
only a small proportion of the people in
these sections use electricity. The company
gives subscribers in these rural sections the
option of purchasing power on the kilowatthour basis or at a fiat rate. If the number
of customers averages more than ten to the
mile, the flat rate for consumption up to 20
kilowatt-hours is $2.40. The charge for energy
used in excess of that quantity is 2.5 cents
per kilowatt-hour. As the number of subscribers goes down the rate goes up. For
example, where there are between 8 and 10
subscribers to the mile the monthly rate is
$2.75; between 7 and 8, $3; between 6 and 7,
$3.25; between 5 and 6, $3.50; between 4
and 5, $4; and between 3 and 4, $4.75.
In addition to the power plant of the
Maritime Electric Company there are a few
independent plants. The town of Souris
generates its own power and supplies it to
the citizens at a little above cost. Another
plant, a small one, supplies the town of
Kensington and a nearby area, but not any
rural sections. There is another plant at
Alberton, but it serves only a very small part
of the community.
If the report on the proposed development
is favourable, as I am confident it will be,
the undertaking might well be a post-war
rehabilitation project, for undoubtedly it
would give employment to a large number of
our soldiers when they return to their homes
in the Maritimes.
.Cheap electric power would also stimulate
industrial development in our part of the
Dominion. After Confederation we lost most
of our industries to the central provinces, and
I am certain that no honourable senator would
be unfavourable to a project which would
restore to the Maritime Provinces something
of their one-time industrial prosperity. As
might be expected, the loss of our industries
was followed by loss of population. At Confederation there were between 109,000 and
110,000 people in Prince Edward Island. From
that time on there was a steady decline until
1931, when, according to the census, we, had a
population of only 88,000; but since then
there has been a slight gain, and the 1941
census showed our population at about 93,000.
I noticed recently a paragraph in the
Vancouver News Weekly to the effect that a
preliminary survey is to be undertaken to see
whether it would be feasible to raise the level
of the Columbia river and its tributaries in
order to generate electric energy for the
States of Washington, Oregon, Idaho -and
Montana and our western provinces. Of

93

course, it would be an international undertaking. We in the eastern part of the
Dominion will be only too glad to give our
friends in the West the fullest co-operation,
should it be decided to proceed with the
In giving wholeproposed development.
hearted support to this motion I feel that I
.arn expressing the sentiments of all honourable members from the Maritimes, and I take
this opportunity ta solicit the support of
honourable members from the central and
western provinces.
Undoubtedly the development of electric
energy at the Petitcodiac and Memramcook
rivers would mean much to the rural life of
the Maritime Provinces. It would enable our
women on the farms to lessen their work by
means of vacuum cleaners, washing machines,
churns, and other equipment, while their husbands would be able to apply electrie energy
to their threshing, wood-sawing and other
activities of the farm.
I do not believe that any honourable member will object to the proposal to engage
eminent hydro-electrie engineers to make a
thorough investigation into the possibilities
of developing this tidal power. Should that
report be favourable-and I can see no reason
why it should not be-I am hopeful that we
shall get the proposed development under way
in the near future.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
it is probably appropriate that, coming as I
do from the province farthest removed from
the proposed development under discussion, I
should lend my endorsement to it. Your committee had a very interesting session, and
most encouraging evidence was submitted.
We have had a considerable development of
water power in aur province, and my own
limited experience has been that both cost
and usage are sometimes over-estimated. Cost
is governed by minimum flow. If the figure
as to minimum flow is accepted, and the
horse-power contemplated is reduced by 50
per cent, the development, if feasible, is still
commercially practicable and will pay its way.
The first point which interested me was the
situation in the Maritime Provinces with regard to electric power. I quite agree that
if those provinces are to share in our industrial development they must have power in
large quantities. I was somewhat surprised
by the rates quoted, which are not far out of
bine with similar rates in our western country.
But the main point is that you require horsepower in tens or hundreds of thousands-in
this case the potential development is some
400,000 horse-power-to take care of the development which you hope will follow. The

94

SE'NATE

second point which impresscd me was that this
powe r proe ct as a post-war development would
give employment to a great number of men
and requiro the use of large quantities of
materials. In fact I think it is one of the
outstanding instances that I hav~e heard of
where, after the war, the undeýrtýaking, if found
to be practicable, would provide employment
for a great number of men and be commercialiy self-supporting.
The question raised by the honourable
senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy) could,
when the time cornes, be arranged satisfaetorily hetween the provinces concerned and
the federal Government. lUnfortunately our
water powers have heen developed under
private control and the interest of the State
has been climinated. I arn sure that many of
us, in the Iight of experience, would have
opposed that condition. One thing that, I
think, the State should neyer divest itself of is
the development of water power. It is an
inexpensive developmcnt based on cost per
horse-power, undertaken with Government
money which, as has heen pointed out by the
honourable member who has just spoken, is
seeured at a ]ow rate of interest. Furthermore, thjs natural resource runs in perpetuity,
it reqoires few mon for its operation-not
many more than are necessary to guard a
bridge.
I would say to the honourable senator from
Leeds that the Provincial and Dominion Governments may be expected to get together if
t.he proposed undertaking is found to be
feasible. The immediate question, before us
is whether in our opinion it is desirable that the
Dominion Government should engage a firm
of eminent hydro-electri ecngineors to ascertain if the proposed deveiopment would
be foasiblo andi practicablo. It was stated to
the committee that such an inv estigation might
roqoiro an oxpendituro of $50,000. That is a
more bagatelle compared with the opportunitics whlob such an undertaking woold provide
for post-war cmi ioyment, aside altogether
froin the fact, thiat. the potontial clectrie energy
is sorely needoci in thc Maritime Provinces.
For this and other reasons I am very much in
fax oor of the motion.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
I would have no serious objection to the proposed expendituro on the part of the federal
Goveraiment for the purpose of making a
survey of the possibilities of developing tidal
power at the confluence of the Petitcodiac and
Memramcook rivers, except that sucli en expenditure might, in my opinion, be rcgarded
as more or less of a commitment in regard ýo
the projeet itself. The proposed undertaking,
Hon. Mr. McRAE.

as outlined hy the honourable senator fro-m
Prince Edward Island (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)
makos a strong appeal to the imagination,
and I have evcry sympat.hy with the people
of the Maritimes in their desire to obtain the
benofits of low-cost electrie power for domestic,
mantifacturing and industrial services.
Vorv rcluctantly 1 mcvy strike a more or
less discordant note in doaiog with the point

My lîoîourabte fried who opened the debate
(Hou. Mr. Sinclair) statcd that this proposed
development, wo'uldhe interprovinciai, and that
this, in his opinion, would make it in somne
dogroe a fcdcrcl responsibility.
I must say
that I do not agroe with hinm. The proposed
undortcking boing interprovinciai, it foliows
that the rt sponsibiiity wouid ho thrown on
moe

it is usually the duty cf the strong to hielp

Hlon. Mr. EULER: -and that maxim is
relied on hy those who say that, Ontario and
Quebec, being financially the stronger provinces,
should be willing, through federal help, to assist
the weaker provinces. There is a good deal te

navigation schcrno.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: But bas it net the
blessing of the federal Government?
Hon. Mr. EUJLER: I amn giade my honourable frienci bas raisoci that point. The hydreclectrie development on the Ottawa river is

MARCH 29, 1944
an .interprovincial development, and it has
been undertaken at the expense of the provinces concerned, Ontario and Quebec-not the
federal authority. J hold that it is essentially and inherently unfair to say that the
taxpayer or the user of electrical power in
the province of Ontario or the province of
Quebec, who is paying for the energy he
himself uses, should also help to pay the
rates of the people in some other province.
I assure honourable senators that I am trying
not te be narrow minded. But is it not a
fact that if the federal Government should
go into a capital expenditure for the development of this power-I am not referring now
to the cost of the survey-the people of the
provinces which are paying their own way
would be assisting to reduce rates in other
provinces? Is that a narrow-minded position
to take? I think not.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Is he not overlooking
the post-war period, in which, having regard
to the general situation and the furnishing of
employment, the federal Government muet
take the lead?
Hon. Mr. EULER: My honourable friend
is rather anticipating something that I was
going to say. If this capital expenditure for
the development of power can be shown to be
national in its scope, and if it is to help the
employment situation, there is something to
be said for it. I am not going to contradict
that.
My honourable friend says that if the
federal Government came into the picture
money could be raised and securities issued
at a lower rate of interest. That is very good
so long as the provinces concerned still have
the responsibility of carrying the capital cost.
The honourable senator from British Columbia
(Hon. Mr. McRae) said this project would be
self-supporting-and it should be, even if it is
publicly owned. But I was going to suggest,
though perhaps it is premature to do so, that
if, instead of assuming the capital cost, the
federal Government could be of assistance in
lightening the burden, the issue of credit or
a loan might meet the situation.
I want to assure my honourable friends from
the Maritime Provinces that what I am saying
is intended, not as a criticism, but rather as
an enunciation of a principle for which there
is something to be said.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Honourable senators, I
think there is some misunderstanding with
regard to this matter. So far the people of
the Maritime Provinces have not asked the
federal Government to finance this scheme.
The resolution moved by the honourable

95

senator from Moncton (Hon. Mr. Robinson),
which was discussed before the committee in
a very interesting manner, requested only that
the federal Government, through a competent
body of engineers, thoroughly investigate the
situation and decide whether the project is
feasible. The resolution does not suggest that
the Government should be asked to pay the
total cost of anything but the initial investigation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Certainly the honourable senators who spoke made this suggestionHon. Mr. BLACK: They have intimated
that they wanted help; and there is no reason
wby they should not do that. But before this
scheme was presented to this House it was
discussed by a committee with the Government
of New Brunswick, and that Government is
greatly interested in it. This is not a private
enterprise. There is a company-and I am
one of the charter members of that company
-whiéh was established thirty-five years ago
with the idea of looking into the feasibilty of
this development. We d.id not get anywhere,
because the project was too big to be undertaken by a private group in that province,
and at the time there did not seem to be the
opportunity that there is to-day, for the
development and sale of the power. Conditions
have changed. Now, if the power is developed,
undoubtedly there will be a great demand for
it, not only in Prince Edward Island, but also
in the rural sections of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia. Furthermore, the enormous
mineral deposits in the immediate vicinity of
the development will undoubtedly attract
manufacturing plants, which will consume a
considerable portion of the power.
But I am getting away from my line of
thought. I have no doubt that the New
Brunswick Government will be ready to share
in the cost of development if the scheme
proves feasible. It may be that all that will
be asked of the federal Government is cheap
money. It is my belief that the three Maritime Provinces will work together in the
development of the power once it is demonstrated, as I believe it will be, that the
undertaking is practicable. All we want is
sympathetic support of the proposal that
there should be a thorough investigation by
competent engineers. Once that has been
given, I feel confident that if the report is
favourable, we in the Maritime Provinces will
develop the project along proper lines and will
not ask the province of Ontario to help us.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I had intended to say a word or two along the
very lines of the remarks of the honourable
member who has just spoken.

SENATE

96

We have had two or three very interesting
addresses in regard to development in the
Maritimes, and the need, at a lower cost if
possible, of further development. But we must
remember what is the real point that we are
discussing. The question is not the desirability
of this or that or the other thing, but whether
or not we should approve an expenditure of
$50,000 for an investigation into the feasibility
of a proposed power scheme. That is the sole
question at issue. There is no question as to
who shall build any plant, or what rates shall
be charged, or anything of that nature at all.
This brings me to the one real point raised
by the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon.
Mr. Hardy) and his desk-mate from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler), as to whether or not we,
as members of the Senate, should approve an
expenditure of $50,000. They are inclined to
think tbis is a purely provincial matter. Much
could be said in faveur of their view. However, I do net myself take that view, and I
would not take it in regard to any section
of the Dominion. Yeu have to regard the
position of the Maritime Provinces.
You
cannot compare Prince Edward Island with
any other province in the Dominion; neither
can you compare Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick with our larger provinces. They are
not in the same category. If these three Maritime Provinces were united as one, with the
larger population and greater wealth, a comparison could be made with Ontario, or even
with British Columbia or any of the other
large prmovincs. But that is net the position.
For some reason or other the Maritime
Provinces have decided net to unite, but to
remain separate, and the only point we have to
decide is whetier or net this Chamber should
approve of the federal Government aiding to
the extent of $50,000 in the holding of an
inquiry to learn whether or not this proposed
schenie is advisable.
I take the view that the development of
electrical power in these three provinces is
more thain a purely local question. It is
something tliat is of advantage to Canada
as a wbole. The development of four hundred
thousand horse-power of electrical energy in
the Maritime Provinces would mean a great
deal to Canada. Everytbing that is done by
the federal Government to aid in the prosperity, growth and development of industry in
any part of Canada is national in character,
and net purely local.
I think I have said all that is necessary on
the point to which we are addressing ourselves, and on which we shall have to vote.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourable members, the reason I interrupted the honourable
member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

^

was that I had in mind the fact that a sum
much greater than the amount asked for in
this resolution has already been spent by the
federal Government on surveys in connection
with the proposed St. Lawrence river development, which is situated in the two great
provinces of Canada. Surcly, having this in
mind, it is not beyond reason that the
honourable senator from Moncton (Hon. Mr.
Robinson) should ask this House to approve
of a recommendation to Parliament that the
paltry sum of $50.000 be expended on a survey of this proposed development in the
Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Will my honourable
friend permit me a comment? While the St.
Lawrence development involves power, it is
also a navigational project, which is a subject
of national concern.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Quite so, but probably
we can leave out the transportation end of
it and consider only the other development.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You would net have
the one without the other.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Cardigan): When
you are harnessing the waters of the Bay of
Fundy you are dealing with federal Government property-the tidal bore of the Bay of
Fundy-not with the property of any one
province.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It does net lower the
waters of the Bay of Fundy.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable members,
I think the argument of the honourable
senator from IKitchener (Hon. Mr. Euler) and
the honourable senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) would be acceptable in a debate.
However, the committee which heard the
evidence the other day was made uip of members of this House from all parts of Canada,
and I believe they were impressed with the
evidence which was given. What impressed
me was the unusual and potential character
of the development. If the site in question
had been a natural waterway entirely within
the province of New Brunswick, I do not
think the honourable senator from Moncton
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) would have moved that
the investigation be undertaken by the federal

Government.
committee we learned that the use of tidal
waters for the development of electrical
energy was very rare; in fact, that in only
one other place in the world had it been
attempted.
Here we have an extraordinary situation
with these two rivers flowing into Shepody
Bay, at the head of the Bay of Fundy, where

MARCH 29, 1941
the tide rises and falls forty-five feet. Dr.
Turnbull and others, including the members
of the company which took out a charter some
thirty years ago, conceived the idea that these
tidal waters might be utilized for producing
electrical energy. The development would
require a large expenditure. Because of its
unusual nature, private investors would have
doubts as to whether the project was economically sound.
What is proposed is that the Dominion
Government should cause a thorough investigation to be made into the possibilities of
developing tidal power at the confluence of
the Petitcodiac and Memramcook rivers. One
of these is a navigable river, and as such would
come within federal jurisdiction under the
Navigable Waters' Protection Act. Some years
ago the Dominion Government showed its
interest in this very project by sending
engineers to make borings and obtain various
scientific data. So, in the light of the discussion that our committee had last week, I
think we could safely suggest to the Government that an appropriation be made for
further investigation.
I have intimated to some honourable members who are interested in this proposal that
I think. the resolution would have served the
desired purpose better if it had been worded
in this way:
That in the opinion of the Senate it is desirable that the Dominion Government in conjunction or consultation with the Governments of the
Maritime Provinces should cause a thorough
investigation to be made by a firm of eminent
hydro-electrie engineers into the possibilities of
developing tidal power at the confluence of the
Petitcodiac and Memramcook rivers in the
province of New Brunswick.
I feel that if my honourable friends the
mover (Hon. Mr. Copp) and seconder (Hon.
Mr. Robinson) of the motion were prepared
to amend it with a view to having the provinces consulted, this would lead to almost
immediate co-operation. I do not intend to
press the amendment. It seems likely to me
that within the next few years the Dominion
Government will be asked to inquire into
many potential post-war development schemes
all over the country. Dr. Turnbull, the engineer who appeared before our committee last
week, estimated that if this Bay of Fundy
scheme were proceeded with it would employ
some three to four thousand people for two
or three years or longer. However, the resolution does not ask the Dominion Government
to be responsible for anything more than the
expense of a thorough inquiry into the possibilities of the project.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable senators, I see no objection whatever to the sug-

W

gested amendment, for I realize that if an
investigation is made the three Maritime
Governments will have to be consulted, more
or less.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: If the proposed amendment is satisfactory to the mover of the
motion (Hon. Mr. Copp), it will be so to me.
But there is one point I should like to make.
Consultation of the three provincial Governments would in all probability delay the
beginning of the survey, which it has been
estimated will take the greater part of a year.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think my honourable
friend is wrong. It seems to me that consultation would have the opposite effect.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable senators, I do not want to have the investigation
side-tracked. In bringing the matter before
the Senate my desire was to show that the
project had real merit. All that we are
asking now is that it be thoroughly investigated. That is all Dr. Turnbull is asking.
He has spent years in studying the possibilities
of developing power at this site, and in addition he has invited a number of other engineers
to visit the area and give their opinion. The
voluminous notes and data that he has
accumulated are simply amazing. So far as
I can see, the possible advantages to the
Maritimes through the proposed development
are almost beyond imagination.
In asking the Dominion to assume the cost
of an investigation, we are not seeking alms
at all. I think the honourable senator from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) was right when
he said that this project is of more than
provincial importance and is to some extent
national in scope.
I have no objection to the suggested amendment if the honourable leader of the House
(Hon. Mr. King) considers it necessary, but
I should prefer that the motion be not
amended.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
do not agree with the remarks of my honourable friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
McRae). The federal Government will have
tremendous demands made upon it, and certainly will not be looking around for projects
upon which to spend money. It would seem
to me that a proposal supported by responsible
people would stand a better chance of success.
Surely no one would be in a better position
than the provinces concerned to make representations to the federal Government on a
project of this kind.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Will honourable senators
-permit me to make a further brief statement?
I try to look at these things in a practical

A conference between the federal

Maritime Provinces to finance the scheme five
times over, for the reason that hydro-electric
development is a paying proposition, and the
source of power never runs dry. If feasible,
this undoubtedly would be- a good scheme. I
know what hydr'o-electric development has
done for my city and province. Electricity
used to cost us 10 cents a kilowatt hour; now
it is so cheap that we can run our electric

washers, ironers and stoves at a minimum of
cost. It may interest honourable senators to
know that in proportion to population Winnipeg has more electric stoves installed in
residences than any other city in the world.
Electrical developement is something that
governments, whether Dominion, provincial or
municipal can operate profitably as a public
utility because the maximum of material is
used with the minimum of brains.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Is that the reason
why the hydro-electrie development is so
successful in Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is equally successful in
Ontario. During the last twenty years transmission losses have been eut in two, and to-day
you can transmit electric energy two hundred
miles with no greater loss than was formerly
involved in transmitting it one hundred miles.
Swedish engineers are now conducting experiments in the hope of being able to transmit
electricity four times as far with no greater
loss of energy than at present. That is a very
important factor.
I repeat, I arn entirely in accord with the
motion, and I hope it will pass. But I would
not amend it in any way. The Dominion
Government knows there is nothing so helpful
to a community as hydro-electric development.
Nothing will give so much employment as an
undertaking of this kind, and certainly after
the war we shall need to provide the fullest
volume of employment.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators, I
think I am the the only representative from
the Maritime Provinces who bas not taken
part in this discussion, a great deal of which
has been out of order. I am delighted to note
that my friends from the West are so well
acquainted with what we require in the Maritime Provinces. I associate myself with all
that bas been said in regard to the great tidal
power potentialities of the Petiteodiac and
Memramcook rivers. This can be considered
net only as a provincial and interprovincial,
but also as a national question. For instance,
a great section of the Canadian National Rail-

99

ways between Campbellton and Halifax could
be electrically operated, thus greatly facilitating railroad operation in that section.
The motion is that the committee's report
be concurred in. We have heard one or two
suggestions by way of amendment of the
motion, but no amendment has been moved. I
do not know whether my honourable friend
intends to move an amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: No.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I am delighted to know
that so many honourable senators from outside the Maritime Provinces are prepared to
give us their support in this matter. I agree
with the honourable gentleman from Moncton
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) that action is preferable
to words.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Therefore I think that if
this motion is accepted we should invite the
Premiers of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
to come to Ottawa and lay the matter before
the Dominion Government. The Premier of
Prince Edward Island bas already been here
and given us his support. By adopting this
course we could, I believe, get action this
coming summer.
Hon. J. J. DUFFUS: Honourable senators,
two points appealed to me when this proposed
project was under discussion in committee:
first, the volume of employm-ent which its
construction would provide-for without doubt
employment will be very much needed in the
post-war period; and second, the new facilities
that hydro-electric development would bring
to the Maritime Provinces. I think that for
these reasons alone the Senate would be doing
a national service if it took similar action in
regard to other potential hydro-electrie
developments.
The motion for concurrence in the committee's report was agreed to.

Hon. J. H. KING: With the consent of

care of maturing obligations.
I find that
similar bills have come before us from time
to time, namely, in 1931, 1933, 1935, 1939, 1940
and 1942. I notice that, according to a statement made in another place, these obligations
fall due as follows:

MARCH 30, 1944
This total of $1,032,240,470.85 is somewhat
more than the amount asked for, but under
the last loan there is an unexpended sum of
$92,000,000, which would take up the balance.
I think this Bill is well understood, and I
would ask that it be given second reading
now.
Hon. A. J. LEGER: Could the honourable the leader tell us for what purpose the
loans now being refunded were originally
made?
Hon. Mr. KING: I have no definite information as to the direct application of the
payments. In April of this year loans of $250,000,000 are maturing. These, which will now
be taken care of, may be loans that were made
many years ago. I notice that some of these
loans, short-term loans, bear interest at one
per cent. The loans being paid off in July,
amounting to $33,293,470, would probably be
four per cent loans made before the war.
There are loans at 3ý per cent, 11 per cent,
2½ per cent and 4J per cent. As I say, I have
no information as to the immediate application of the payments, but they are applicable
to maturing loans, and this Bill is required to
take care of them at the dates named.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I understand that very
well, but it does not answer my question.
What I want to know is if the assets for
which the original loans were borrowed are
still worth the amount of the loans to be
refunded. Let us suppose, for instance, that
one of the loans to be refunded was originally
used for the construction of a bridge. What
I should like to know is if that bridge is still
in existence and, if so, what its condition is.
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not think it would
be possible to give that information here.
Part of the moneys to be appropriated under
this Bill may be used for the construction of
public works, but before the Government
could use any of these moneys for such a
purpose it would have to obtain specific
authority from Parliament, in the usual way:
that is, there would have to be in the estimates an item relating to the work. The
moneys appropriated under this Bill will go
into the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and
most of ther1 will be used for paying off
maturing loans.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I have no objection at
all to the Bill, but it seems to me it would
be well for this House to have the information
I have requested. I know the fact that the
original assets were or were not still in existence always made a good deal of difference
whenever the province of New Brunswick was
floating a refunding loan. If you are refund-

lui

ing a loan that was used to build a bridge
which no longer exists, brokers are usually not
so rmuch interested in that refunding. It
seems to me the same principle should apply
in the federal field.
As I say, I am not objecting to the Bill at
all, but I think that ordinarily it would be
wise for this House to be given this information when money is desired for refunding purposes. Then we should be in a position to
judge, not whether the country is really sound
or not, for of course it is, but perhaps whether
the original loan had been a good one. In
any event, it would be interesting to have the
information.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am afraid I have not
made myself clear to my honourable friend.
This Bill provides that the Government may
raise a billion dollars "for paying or redeeming
the whole or any portion of loans or obligations «of Canada, and also for purchasing and
withdrawing from circulation from time to
time unmatured securities of Canada and for
public works and general purposes." In 1942,
let us say, certain sums were voted in general
terms. The money so secured went into the.
Consolidated Revenue Fund, where it was
available to pay for maturing loans and public
works, but whatever portion was used for
public works had to be authorized specifically
by Parliament. Yet I am doubtful if the
Department of Finance would show expenditures upon public works as coming from such
moneys. What would be shown is the specific
vote of $50,000, or whatever the amount might
be, for every individual project. I do not
think the information my honourable friend
asks for could be given.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: As I understand it, the
purpose of the Bill is not only to take care of
refunding, but to provide money for new
expenditures upon public works.
Hon. Mr. KING: If the Government desires
to use any of the money for that purpose.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. But, as the
honourable leader stated, the Government
would not have authority to use any of this
money without specific direction from the
other House.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Except for refunding.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, except for
refunding.
I do not know whether the honourable
leader can enlighten me upon another point.
Where does the Government expect to get one
billion dollars at this time? How will it raise
that amount of money? I suppose it will
borrow from the banks and insurance com-

102

SENATE

panies, by short-term loans or any other
method it chooses? There is no intention that
a victory loan should take care of this billion
dollars, is there?
Hon. Mr. KING: A victory loan may take
care of some of it. Many holders of large
amounts of securities will probably re-lend to
the Government. Take the $250,000,000 maturing loan as an example. No doubt a good deal
of it will be taken care of by renewed lans.
For paying off smaller loans the Government
may use money obtained through a victory
loan or in some other way. The Government
does not intend to ask the public now for a
billion dollars to pay for maturing securities.
As I have said, many obligations will be
renewed under a new contract.
Hon. Mr. RALLANTYNE: Most of them.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No borrowing is being
done in the United States or Great Britain
now?
Hon. Mr. KING: No.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

HYDRO-ELECTRIC DEVELOPMENT IN
NEW BRUNSWICK
MOTION FOR PRINTING COMMITTEE'S
PROCEEDINGS
Hon. C. W. ROBINSON: Honourable
senators, witb leave I would move:
That authority be granted for the printing of
600 copies of proceedings before the Standing
Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours on the possibilities of developing tidal
power at the confluence of the Petiteodiac and
Memrancook rivers in the province of New
Brunswick, and that Rule 100 be suspended in
so far as it relates to the said printing.
I do not know whether 600 copies will be
sufficient, but that is the number stated in
the written motion.
If every member of
each House received a copy, more than half
of the six hundred would be used in that way.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the honourable senator give us an estimate of the cost
of the printing?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I cannot do that;
I am sorry that I have no idea what the
amount would be. The cost would not be
higher than for printing the same number of
copies of anything else.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

TECHNICAL EDUCATION
BILL

EXTENSION

SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 41, an Act to amend the Technical
Education Act.
He said: Honourable senators will remember
that under the Technical Education Act of
1919 Parliament set aside $10,000,000 to be
used in conjunction and co-operation with the
various provinces for facilitating the development of technical education. This Bill was
amended in 1929, 1934 and 1939.
My understanding is that the various provinces have co-operated with the federal Government and utilized the grants under this
legislation to advance technical education. Up
to the present Manitoba has not taken full
advantage of the original Act of 1919, and the
purpose of this Bill is to make available to
that province any unexpended appropriation
for a period of five years from March 31, 1944.
Section 8 of the Act now is in this form:
Any portion of the ten million dollars appro-

priated under the Act which niay remain
unexpended at the expiration of the fiscal year
one thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine,
whether previously carried forward or not. shall
be carried forward and remain available according to its apportionments for tle purposes of
this Act during any one or more of the five
suceeeding fiscal years. and no portion of the
said ten million dollars shall be paid to any
province after the thirty-first day of March,
one thousand nine hundred and forty-four.
Hon. Mr. EULER: How much of the money
still remains under the control of the Federal
Government?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
ask for that information.

I was going to

Hon. Mr. HAIG:

The amount is $147,000.
Hon. Mr. KING: The Act provided for a
grant of $10,000,000, to be distributed among
bhc provinces on the basis of population.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Why did the province of Manitoba not take advantage of the
original grants?
Hon. Mr. KING: A number of the provinces failed to take advantage of the legislation, and from time to time the Act was
extended to permit them to do so. This was
the purpose of the amending Acts of 1929, 1934
and 1939. I think to-day Manitoba is the
only province that has not taken full advantage of the legislation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Was there any dispute
between the two Governments?
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The province simply
did not ask for any grant?

MARCH 30, 1944
Hon. Mr. LEGER: How much has been
paid to the provinces that have taken advantage of the Act? Has any report been made
to Parliament as required by the Act?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The majority of
the provinces took up their share of the grants
several years ago.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have a table showing
the disposition of the grants, and later I shall
place it on Hansard. There is still a balance
due to Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is the $147,000 referred
to by the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) the amount available for
Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. KING:
Bill.

Yes, according to this

Hon. Mr. EULER: Or is there a balance
for the other provinces?
Hon. Mr. KING: I think not.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I understand that the
$147,000 still unpaid is all due to Manitoba.
Hon. -Mr. KING: That is right.
Hon.. Mr. HAIG: Under the Act the
provinces were required to establish certain
systems of technical education. Manitoba,
excluding the city of Winnipeg, did not comply with the requirements. Winnipeg did
comply, and received its full grant. Now there
is a movement on foot to extend technical
education in the province, and I understand,
the provincial Government intends to open
four or five technical schools specializing in
domestic science. This, I presume, has brought
the subject to life again.
In connection with technical education, I
would direct your attention to thé fact that
the people. of Canada are not paying their
teachers sufficient remuneration for the
important work they are doing. Our teachers
are the poorest paid of any class in the
Dominion, yet they are engaged in the most
vital work, that of moulding the character
of our boys and girls-our future citizens. I
speak from an experience of fourteen years
as a member of the Winnipeg School Board,
and in the interests of education, not only
in our public schools, but also in our high
schools and our universities. Our teachers
in all these institutions are not by any means
paid sufficient salaries. It was not the depression of 1930 to 1935 that gave us our
troubles in Manitoba, Saskatchewan or
Alberta; it was the fact that for two years
we had no rain, for another year we had

103

rust, and for two years we were plagued by
grasshoppers. These troubles made it impossible for us to pay even the ridiculously low
salaries which our teachers were then supposed
to receive.
I am in entire accord with the view that
education, being a provincial matter, should
be wholly controlled by the provinces. But
the Dominion owes it ta its future citizens
to make a contribution to public education.
The federal Government makes grants for
the purpose of improving our live stock, our
grain, and so on, but the one vital thing it
does not do is assist in improving education, especially primary education. Ninety
per cent of our children never go higher than
the public schools; seven per cent go to the
high schools, and less than three per cent
to the universities. In the present life-anddeath struggle of the United Nations the
education of our university students--this
small percentage of our youth-is considered
to be of such importance that these young
men are allowed to complete their courses
before becoming subject to military service.
How much more important should we consider it that ninety per cent of our young
people be given an adequate education! The
value of a good teacher is above rubies. In
my own city we pay $1,000 a year to a public
school teacher. She will have about fortyfive children in her class, and in five or six
years their education is supposed to be completed. We find it very difficult to get male
teachers at the low salaries offered. I have
in mind a teacher in our province drawing
only $3,000 a year, yet I am confident that
were he returned to the House of Commons
he would become a Cabinet Minister. He is
a wonderful man and an inspiration to his
pupils. I am sure most of us will readily admit
that the man or woman who taught us in
public sebool, high school, or university left
on our minds an impression that has stayed
with us all through life.
I know that some of our provinces are afraid
that should the Dominion Government make
a grant in aid of education such aid might
carry with it a certain degree of control over
education. I think that danger can be guarded
against. We have a problem in the Dominion.
A certain percentage of our people speak one
language, a certain percentage another, but
we can all get together on a fundamental
basis once we have a high standard of educaOnly by
tion in every part of Canada.
education can we make this a great country.
We must train our children to become good

104

SENATE

citizens. What do we do with our youth teday? Largely, our system is based on training for the profession of law, or medicine,
or the church. The young people who receive
such training represent but a small percentage
of our population. The majority of our children must depend on the education they receive in our public schools, and here the
revenue is limited. In our province and, I
presume, in the other provinces, property pays
for education; and property owners have the
least need for assistance in the education of
their children.
I speak with some feeling on this matter.
When a member reaches this Chamber he
is presumed to take more than an ordinary
interest in the welfare of the country. He is
presumed to have had experience in the public
life of his community and to be willing to
devote some of his energies to the service of
the Dominion. I think that the Senate should
investigate this question and so be able to
place before the people of Canada a programme of education. I do not know what
would be the best programme. I am a lawyer
and therefore can speak only for my own profession. Take the young man I have referred
to: in a lecture the other day he told us that
in his school when the boys and girls reach
Grade VI or VII they are tested as to the
occupation for which they will be best
qualified. I know lawyers who should be contractors, contractors who should be lawyers.I am a lawyer-ministers who should be doctors, and doctors who should be ministers.
There is at present no system whereby young
men and young women can be directed along
the line for which they appear to be best
equipped. The provincial Government intends
to open up five or six schools for classes in
domestic science and similar subjects; but the
project may net be successful unless the
Dominion gets behind it.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
How about the
British North America Act in regard to
education?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I agree that education is
under the control of the provinces; there is
no dispute about that; but if you give the
provinces sufficient assistance they will establish advanced systems of education and pay
their teachers adequate salaries.
I hope
honourable members will pardon me for again
mentioning Winnipeg, but it is the only city
with which I am thoroughly familiar. Oui
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

children in my city receive botter training
than do the children in the country districts,
where one teacher has to look after forty
children divided into six classes in a one-room
school. Under these conditions the teacher,
no matter how able, cannot give proper attention to the pupils. Besides, country teachers
are paid salaries of only $500 or $600 a year,
as against $1,000 a year in Winnipeg. I am
stating facts.
Honourable members, I have dealt with this
subject at some length because it is not often
that education engages the attention of this
Chamber. I plead with honourable senators
to study the question. When you get back
home lend a hand in support of the demand
for botter pay for our teachers in high schools,
public schools and universities.
Only the
C.C.F. party bas as yet become active on
behalf of the teachers. The rest of us had
botter wake up and realize the importance of
our teachers in the scheme of education. It
is net a question of heading off the C.C.F.
I am net afraid of the C.C.F., but I am aftaid
of what may happen te our country unless we
progress along the lines I have indicated.
Honourable members, I am in favour of this
Bill.. On behalf of the province of Manitoba
I wish to thank the leader opposite, and,
through him, the Government, for having
introduced legislation that will make available to the province the original grant in aid
of technical education.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I have myself had some experience in the
educational world, having spent about twentyfive years in it from the time I started as a
teacher in a little country school until I
behame Minister of Education. The great
weakness in our school system-and I am
speaking net of our universities, our collegiates
or our technical establishments, but of the
common schools, the little rural schoolsthe great weakness in our entire system from
one end of Canada to the other is that the
teachers in those common schools are net
properly equipped for the great work they
have undertaken.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In my earlier days I
was inspecting schools for about nine years,
and during much of that period I walked into
from 140 to 175 school districts and had great
opportunities of learning the degret to which

MARCH 30, 1944
the teachers were equipped for their important
work. Of course, the real trouble lies with
our people. Day after day, week after week,
and month after month, for a period of years,
our people hand over their children to a
whiffet of a boy or girl, whom they expect to
give the children the education they need.
I do not know exactly what the situation is at
the present time, but in dayb past those who
undertook the work of teaching were paid
anywhere from $25 to $40 a month-that is all.
They were ill-equipped and badly paid. The
result was that the great majority of them
were looking forward to getting out of educational work as quickly as possible. That is
what is wrong with our educational system in
Canada. The trouble is not in the top
branches, but in the lower branches; and if
something could be done to see that teachers
in our little common schools were better
equipped and paid a salary that would hold
them longer, we should get better results.
Hon. DUNCAN McL. MARSHALL: Honourable senators, I wish to take this opportunity
of paying what I consider is a well deserved
tribute to a former Minister of Agriculture in
Canada who did more for agricultural education in the few years that he was Minister
than most other men I have had anything to
do with.
I remember that when Mr. Burrel was
chosen for that portfolio it was said that we
now had a gardener for Minister of Agriculture. But in a little while those of us who
had been interested in agriculture all our
lives discovered that this man had vision.
He secured a vote of $10,000,000 to be divided
among the different provinces pro rata for
agricultural education; and that is the best
single act ever performed by any Federal
Minister of Agriculture during my lifetime.
When Mr. Burrell did that, he did something else. He searched the country over for
a man to take charge and give direction, and
he secured Dr. C. C. James. I was a boy
when Dr. James, then only 22 years old, was
appointed by Hon. John Dryden as a professor in the Ontario Agricultural College at
Guelph. To be without farm experience was
considered a crime, almost, on the part of
a man who was going to teach in an agricultural college. But later on, the first time
that I went into his office and saw the number
and variety of plants he had grown there, I

105

realized that he knew something about plant
life and had agricultural ideas. During the
time that Dr. James carried on in the province of Ontario, and afterwards in the federal
field, he was the greatest agricultural educationist the Dominion of Canada had. He
did an amazing work. He travelled into
every province of Canada and consulted every
provincial Minister of Agriculture.
As I say, money was granted to the provinces, and, as all honourable members know,
the federal Government had a voice as to
how it should be spent. I happened to be
Minister of Agriculture in the province of
Alberta at the time; so I came into close
contact with the undertaking, and I want to
say that the work done by the Honourable
Martin Burrell through that vote, and through
the inspiration that Dr. C. C. James gave in
the matter of agricultural education in every
province in Canada, was very remarkable. I
remember going down to Prince Edward
Island about that time. In that province they
had a school of agriculture that was well
worthy of the name, for it was doing active,
practical, sensible work.
I was greatly interested in the remark of
the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Haig), that probably a good deal of the
money still remaining to Manitoba's credit
would be spent for agricultural education. We
have aIl noticed recently how the Prime
Minister of Great Britain has stressed the
importance of education now and after the
war. It is my hope that in the Dominion of
Canada, and in its several provinces, agricultural education will be given first place, and
that something will be done along the lines
of what Mr. Burrell did, because, in the direction of the work the right kind of man can
do more than most of us think. As a matter
of fact, even yet, in the province of Alberta,
several hundred farmers' sons and daughters
are profiting each year from Mr. Burrell's
vote, although the money has long since
been spent. They are profiting by reason
of the agricultural schools that were established, one of which is the best school of
agriculture in the entire Dominion of Canada.
I have hoped that on some appropriate
occasion I should have the pleasure and
satisfaction of paying this tribute to the honourable Martin Burrell and what he did, and
I have been glad to avail myself of this
opportunity.

Honourable senators, in the ab-

sence of the ho-nourable senator from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hlayden), 1 arn moving the second
reading of this Bill. The information furnished
me in connection with it is that Stanley
William Blanchard, James Alexander Bain,
Edward William Tokley, clergyman; Russell
L. Leroy, clergyman; and Jacob Hamilton
Weaver, clergyman; all cf the City of Ottawa,
in the province of Ontario, are applying for
incorporation under the namne of Wesleyan
Methodist Church of America in Canada.
Apparently these people have churches in
Ottawa South, Winchester, Morrisburg, and
several other small places. I believe this Bill
has been before our Law Clerk, Mr. MacNeill,
and the namne proposed does not conflict with
any other.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
What is the
namne?
Mr. PATERSON:
Wesleyan Methodist
Church of America in Canada. 1 know very
Iittle about it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I know very
little about it myself, but I understood that
the Methodist Church, including the denomination my honourable friend bas just mentioned, had come into the UJnited Church.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: No. There are
still some Wesleyan Methodist Churches doing
business in Canada, particularly in Ontario.
If this Bill receives second reading, I, as a
Methodist by marriage, shaîl hope that these
gentlemen will be hrought before the cornrnittee in order that we may ascertain the
reason for the high-sounding words "Wesleyan
Methodist Ohurcli of America in Canada."

107

MARCH 30, 1944
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Wesleyan
American?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: "Wesleyan Methodist Church of America in Canada." I believe
there isanWesleyan Mettlndist Church in the
United States, and I know that there are some
churches still functioning under that namne in
Canada. But those of us who belong to the
United Church of Canada have a right to
hear from these gentlemen their reasons for
organizing or instituting another incorporated
body of Methodists.
Hlon. Mr. COPP. They were not satisfied
with the United Church.
I think the
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
hionourable senator fromn Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) is quite right. I do flot know
what committee this Bill will be referred to,
but I think we ought to hear what these
reverend gentlemen have to say.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It would be the
Miscellaneous Private Bills Committee.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: To me that
would seem very appropriate.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: I do not know
whether the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) is a member of
that committee. If not, we should refer it to
a committee of which hie is a member.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I shail try to be
present when the committee meets. This Bill
may be ail right, but I should like to know
the why and wherefore of it.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I do not think there is anything extraordinary about this measure. I rîse, not for
the purpose of offering any apologies for the
Wesleyan Methodists of Canada, but simply
to suggest that when we have the spectacle
of the continuing Presbyterian member from
Fort William (Hon. Mr. Paterson) offering
at this late date a Bill to incorporate the continuing Methodists in Canada, I think that
Bihl should receive full support of the Senate
without going to committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would draw
attention of the honourable senator fromn Fort
William (Hon. Mr. Paterson) to the fact that
his motion is without a seconder.
Hlon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert) to second the motion?
Hlon. Mr. LAMBERT: I am very pleased
to second the motion.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl
was read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITE

Hon. Mr. PATERSON moved that the Bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Miscellaneous Private Bis.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the gentleman
mentioned in clause 1 be requested to corne
before that committee and tell us about the
Bill?
Hon. Mr. KING: They will be there.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Provided you
do not ask them to join the United Church.
The motion was agreed to.
ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION
SOCIAL SECURITY

AND

DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, March
28, the adj ourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Beauregard:
That it is expedient that this House should
get ready without delay to study the legisiation
which will be brought before it--constructive
or remedial legislation-intended to safeguard,
immediately after the termination of war production, the economic if e in eaeh of the
provinces of the country; and for this purpose
to constitute among its members a committee
of economic studies, as representative as possible, which would be empowered to investigate
the normal production in each province, the
standard of living. the employment capacities,
the conditions of labour, the openings, and, for
this purpose, to invite and hear representatives
f romn farmers, labourers, transport companies,
the industrial and commercial world coneerning
their preparation and their concrete projects
for the post-war period.
Hon. P. R. DuTREMBLAY: Honourable
senators, the motion before us recommends
that this House study the legishation intended
to safeguard the economic life of each
province in Canada after the termination of
the war, and endeavour to find out what projects may be undertaken during the post-war
period. I hope that every member of this
honourable Chamber will support the principle
of the motion.
No doubt an object similar to that stated
in this motion was what the federal Government was aiming at when it announced that
aIl the provinces would be called to a conference at Ottawa. A Dominion-Provincial
conference, as honourable senators are aware,
is to take place as soon as convenient for
the provinces. I presumne that the conference
agenda will contain many suggestions that
the mover of this motion (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) has in mind. No doubt there will be
various requests fromn the provinces to the
Dominion Goveroment for help in numerous
directions.

108

SEN ATE

There is one matter of great importance
that I think should be submitted to the
conference. namely, the question of education.
I agree with much of what was said about
edu.cation this afternoon by the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). If
we desire to make good citizens of our young
people, if we wish to see them progress and
succeed, it is essential that we give them the
best education possible.
As honourable senators know. education
cornes under the jurisdiction of the provinces.
True, the federal Government has helped liberally in several instances. The responsible
authorities in a number of provinces have
already prornised the people that better educational facilities will be provided. This will
mean the expenditure of large amounts of
money. Where is this money to come from?
Some provinces have not the means to pay
for all the facilities that they would like to
provide.
In certain of these provinces the people are
already heavily taxed. Honourable members
will recall what was said the other day by the
mover of this motion about the difficult position of landlords in the city of Montreal. One
of their principal difficulties arises from the
fact that the financial burden of education is
carried almost entirely by real estate. The
provincial Goverrnient should be - able to
assume a larger share of this burden. The
Dominion could perhaps give aid to the
provinces for educational purposes in a way
that would net interfere with provincial
autonomy. It could, for instance, make a
substa.ntial increase in provincial subsidies.
At times certain provinces complain that
they have not the revenue necessary to carry
on important obligations inposed upon them
by the British North America Act. Another
complaint is that they do not receive all the
revenue to which they are entitled under that
Act. For instance. it is pointed out that
although the provinces were given the
exclusive right to levy direct taxes, which
include the income tax, these have been to a
large degree appropriated by the federal
Government. The argument is that the Fathers
of Confederation intended that the moneys
derived from direct taxation should be at the
disposal of the provinces. Of course, we must
not forget that the British North America Act
contains a clause permitting the federal Government to impose direct taxation in the event
of war. This clause was availed of, legally
and properly, at the time of the last war, in
1917. It was necessary then, as it is to-day, for
the Dominion to levy an income tax. There is
no doubt in my mind that the Income War
Hon. Mr. DUTREMBLAY.

Tax Act will be kept in force for many generations, in order to enable the federal treasury to neet obligations arising froin war
conditions.
When the provincial authorities saw that the
federal Government intended to continue
collecting the income tax, they imposed a
provincial income tax as well. One result of
this was that the citizens of Montreal were
for a time paying income tax to three governments: the federal, the provincial and the
municipal. Such a condition tends to impoverish the people, and adds to the difficulty of
collecting additional taxes for educational
purposes.
We must adm.it that when, a few years
ago, the federal Government teok over provincial income taxes for the duration of the
war. it was generous and fair to the provinces.
Some people are dissatisfied and criticize the
Covernment to-day because of the fact that,
owing to the temporary wartime prosperity,
the fedoral trcasury collects now a total in
excess of the compensation that was allotted
to the provinces when the arrangement was
made. It cannot be denied the Dominion
Government needs the money for war expenditure.
However, as I said before, the
entire situation could be corrected by an increase in provincial subsidies.
The question of succession duties, which are
now payable to both the federal and provincial
Governments, should also be discussed at the
coming conference. These burdensome taxes
do not encourage a man to try to provide for
the future of his family. They are so heavy
as often to be the cause of great inconvenience
to heirs.
I know that war expenditures necessitate
the imposition of such taxes by the Government. I would suggest that the conference
endeavour to come to an arrangement whereby
there will b only one income tax and only
one succession duty. If it could be agreed
that the Dominion continue collecting the income tax, a more liberal proportion of the
tax receipts should be paid to the provinces.
This woutld be an easy matter to adjust, and
the single collection would prove less costly
than the present system.
I would make another humble suggestion
regarding the future prosperity for which we
hope in this country. No doubt after the
war our people will be desirous of receiving as
high salaries as those that are paid to-day and
of enjoying, if possible, a better standard of
living. These objects can be attained only if
we have the necessary buying power to create
the desirable situation of full employment for
all employable men and women.
That
situation can be arrived at only through the

MARCH 30, 1944
supplying of our -needs. Our social system is
based on free enterprise. Our future prosperity
and happiness depend largely, if not entirely,
on private enterprise. We must not fool ourselves. Artificial methods will not endure.
Something more is required than the help of
a government, whether socialistic or democratic, to ensure employment at reasonable
wages to all the people all the time. The law
of supply and demand will always be the
golden rule. To give security to a!] we must
first re-establish normal conditions for business
in general. We have available enough wealth
to initiate important enterprises. We must
therefore, as soon as possible, revert to normal
conditions; the country can hope for security
only on such a basis. Owing to the heavy
taxation it would entail, there is no lasting
security to be hoped for through artificially
stimulated markets. I hope that as part of
our post-war policy all encumbrances on or
barriers to business will be removed as quickly
as possible in order that commerce may follow
its natural course, and so, I trust, lead to the
happiness and prosperity of our country.
We must admit that Canada is to-day
enjoying great prosperity. There is, for
instance, full employment at high wages;
industry in general works at full capacity;
business on the whole is good. To maintain
these conditions we must keep production at
its present high level. In order to do so it is
necessary that industry shall have the necessary capital. The creation of the Industrial
Development Bank will render valuable assistance to this end, and with our Canadian banks
performing such splendid services in furthering the activities of trade and commerce, we
may well hope that Canada will enter upon
a new era of prosperity and happiness.
Our greater buying power, our commercial
treaties, our excellent war effort, which has
enhanced our standing with our Allies and
with our friends, our fellow members of ,the
Commonwealth of Nations, and the great
development of our industries-all these things
give me full confidence in the future of
Canada. This country should be able to give
full employment to every one desiring work;
for only in employment can we really have
true security.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. ARTHUR MARCOTTE: Honourable
senators, in rising to speak in support of this
motion, I wish to offer my congratulations to
the mover (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) on the
opportuneness of his proposal and the strong
arguments he has brought forward in its
support.

The speech of his seconder (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt), his first in this House, was a good
one indeed. I am sure that we shall all benefit
from his experience in economics.
The proposed committee when formed will,
I hope, make far-reaching enquiries, study
present and future problems and offer useful
suggestions. I wonder if the wording of the
first sentence of the motion should not be,
"Legislation which should be brought," instead of "will be brought." We cannot wait
until the legislation is presented to us, for
then it will be too late to study it as fully
as we intend to.
I have on several occasions stated in this
Chamber that I was opposed to state ownership and state operation. There are three
cardinal reasons for the lack of success of
state operation: (1) money is easy to secure
for any purpose of construction or development, whether needed or not; (2) extravagance
and waste predominate in operation; (3) there
is an absolute disregard of the necessity and
means of repayment of borrowed moneys. I
realize that in time of war the Government
has to take control of some main industries,
but I heard with pleasure the honourable
senator state that we should put a brake on
centralization and bureaucracy.
We have learned lessons in the dreadful
school of war, and the records of our armies
are splendid. We have also learned other
lessons in the sphere of production, and I
believe it is important for the future of
Canada that we note these lessons and, regardless of what we have accomplished in our
economic efforts for the war, view these efforts
in their truc proportions. Let us draw from
that experience correct guidance for the conduct of our economic life in time of peace.
I do not intend to criticize the Government
for everything it has donc, even though its
policies did not always bring the results
expected; but I would point out how well
the system of private enterprise bas served
us in this great national crisis. Take the field
of public finance. To avoid threatening inflation, the Government established the system
of paying a cost-of-living bonus to certain
classes of workers. Later it became necessary
to increase the number of these classes, but
it was not sufficient, and on top of that direct
control of prices was established. This system
of control is absolutely contrary to the spirit
of our society, which is one of free enterprise.
I think we might with justice say that the
Government has thus raised an army of
bureaucrats checking on almost every ordinary activity of our people. I hope that this
army will be demobilized as soon as possible.

110

SENATE

But this was not sufficient, and it became
necessary to pay each year a large sum of
money in subsidies, with the result that
whereas we were promised that the cost-ofliving bonus would prevent inflation, we now
have the cost-of-living bonus, the wage increases which it was to prevent, the cost of
administering price control, and the burden
of a. colossal sum in subsidies. I admit that
this country has done better than most others
in preventing any inflationary rise in prices,
but this does not prevent me from saying
that possiblv we could have done much better.
What I should like to point out is that the
Government should not hesitate to admit
freely and generously that any success attained
has been due not solely to skilful administration by Government officials, but rather to
the enthusiasm, the courage and the enterprise
of private citizens and private corporations.
We know that before the war many private
corporations were so keenly alive to the
prospect of war and so fully aware of the
demands which it would make on our nation,
that at great expense to themselves they made
preparations for it. For example, the Government is pointing with pride to the great
Sorel industry; yet it is a fact that this industry
was started by private enterprise, and not
only without assistance from the Government,
but without even encouragement. It must be
admitted that in the production of aeroplanes,
shells and many other commodities, splendid
results were due to the forethought and the
energy of private enterprise.
The Government is fond of boasting of the
fact that one-third of the motor transport
used by the armies of the United Nations
comes from Canada. This is not due to any
foresight on the part of the Government nor
to skilful administration by its bureaucracy;
it arises from the fact that private enterprise
created the great motor industry in Canada
and placed it at the disposal of the Government. I could cite a number of the new
Crown companies which have been created
and which in my opinion were not necessary.
It would have been wiser on the part of the
Government to let contracts for the necessary goods and provide private corporations
vith capital assistance.
I will not spend time in discussing the
great aluminum industry; it would require a
whole speech; but this also is the result of
private enterprise.
True, there was some
government assistance, but we have evidence
that only the knowledge and skill acquired
entirely in the service of private corporations
made success possible. If I desired to select
other examples of what private enterprise has
accomplished for Canada during the war, I
could find them in endless s'ariety.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

I could, for instance, cite the case of the
Canadian Pacific Railway, not only for its
splendid work in railway transportation, but
also for the spirit of enterprise shown in
acquiring a large number of struggling private
air lines and linking them into one great
Canadian system. This system, so far from
interfering with the Government-owned TransCanada Air Lines, in fact provided Northern
Canada with a modern transportation service which otherwise would not exist. In
addition, the Canadian Pacific Railway, as is
typical of private enterprise in general, has
been able to place at the disposal of the
nation highly organized industrial plants and
highly skilled labour in great numbers. It
has manufactured tanks in the Angus shops
and naval guns at Calgary, as well as everything else that the Government has asked it
to make. The same thing is true wherever
you turn in Canada.
I will not attempt to catalogue the different
private enterprises which have 'contributed to
our war effort, for I might be charged with
being an advocate of "big business." But I am
not afraid of being classed as an advocate of
private enterprise. I take pride in it. Look
at the great services rendered to Canada by
the private enterprise of our farmers. There
was a shortage of farm labour such as had
never been known; some farmers' sons were
drafted for the fighting services or attracted
to the cities by the higli wages of industrial
undertakings; still these farmers not only
kept up production, but increased it so
tremendously that the food supplies from
Canada have been a major factor in maintaining the heroie resistance of the people of
Britain.
I should like to point out that not only
great corporations, but little machine shops,
little shoe factories, little clothing plants from
coast to coast, have contributed in impressive
volume to the equipment of our fighting men.
I believe that if we were to measure the total
contribution of private enterprise to the war
effort, we should discover that more had been
accomplished by what we may justly regard
as small business than even by those great
corporations to which I have referred.
I submit, honourable senators, that of all
the lessons which we may draw from the war
the greatest is this: that Canadian private
enterprise must be maintained, and that the
functions of Government should never be
extended beyond those of giving guidance and
direction through our national policies. Let
us remember the advice given us by that grand
Prime Minister, Winston Churchill:

MARCH 30, 1944
We must beware of trying to build a society
in whieh nobody counts for anything except a
politician or an official, a society where enterprise gains no reward, and thrift no privileges.
I conclude, honourable members, hy asking
you to remember this above ail: that
whatever may be the aîni of any other nation,
we in this Dominion intend to continue in the
future as we have in the past to hase our
economic if e on that one system which -made
it possible for us to do our part in this warthe free enterprise of free Canadians.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I have only a word or two to say in regard to
the motion before the House. If effect can ha
given to the motion, I arn decidedly in favour
of it; but it scems to me there are a few
points to consider. First, there is not much
use in our passing motions if aftcr we have
done so they are going to remain dormant.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: This motion is very
wide in its scope; it takes in many things, ail
of which might well ha looked into. And if that
were donc it would entail a great deal of work
-work which should be donc, and which, I
think, could perhaps be done better, by the
Senate than by any other parliamentary body.
If inquiry were made into ail the questions
brought up hy the motion, and pcrhaps into
some more, it might resuit in furnishing the
Government with a blueprint or guide as to
what it should consider when the post-war
period arrives. I arn not unmindful, however, of the fact that we already have two
committees-one in each House-dealing with
this post-war period, and it is just possible
that the Governmen.t might feel that the
ground is alre-ady covered. I do not wish to
say anything disparaging about the findings of
those comimittees to date; but as I read their
reports I feul to, sce evidence of any very
great effort to provide jobs for the unemployed aftcr flhc war is over. That, I take
it, would ha pretty much the entire object of
this motion.
To give effect ta this motion some expenditure would be nccessary, and I think that
before passing the motion we should ascertain
from the honourahie leader on the other side
whether the Government feels that such an
inquiry should be made by the Government
itself. We cannot get lahouring men and
others here, without incurring some expense,
and I arn afraid that if we set up a committee
without authority to incur expenditures of
-that kind, any inquiry it might make would
ha very incomplete.

111

I arn very much in favour of the motion.
I think that what it proposes is absolutely
necessary. Prohahly wc should have startcd
a couple of years ago, for the inquiry proposed
will require more than one season's work.
But the success of it depends on whether the
Governmenit wants it or nýot.
Hon. Mr. KING: I would ask that the
matter he allowed to stand.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Copp, the debate
was adjourned.

FIRST READING

A message wes rcceived from the House of
Commons with Bill 65, an Act for granting to
His Majcsty certain sums of money for the
public service of the financial year ending the
3lst Merch, 1944.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND

READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl this
Bill ha read thýe second tirne?
Hon. Mr. KING: With the consent of the
Senate, I move second reading 110W.
This Bill, honourable senators, covers supplementary estimetes totalling $2,754,162.56.
The over-expenditures on the estimates of lest
year refer largcly to one or two departmnents.
For instance, the Post Office Department has
asked for an increase of 3670,000 over last
year's estimate. That over-expenditure is due
ta certain adjustments ýthat have heen made
with respect to wages in the departrnent, and
expenditures in relation to the wer and
incrcased air mail service.
Then, on page 4, there is an item of 3141,000
in connection, with the Hudson Bay Railway.
This is to provide for the difference hetween
expenditures for operation and maintenance
and revenue accruing from operation during
the year ending March 31, 1944.
Under the Maritime Freight Rates Act there
ia also an ad'justment, the amount required
being $790,862.77. The Maritime freight rates
are adjusted, I umderstand, in relation to, the

SENATE
quantity of freight. Of course there lias been
a great increase in the freight passing over the
lines to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
On page 5 there is an amount of $217,045.36.
This is an addition ,to the sum of $475,000
already appropriated to provide for payment
during the fiscal year 194344 to the Canadian
National Railway Company of the deficit in
the operation of the Prince Edward Island
car ferry and terminals arising in the calendar
year 1943, as certified by the auditors of the
railway company. Payment is preceded by
application, approved by the Minister of
Transport, made from time to time by the
railway company to the Minister of Finance.
As honourable members are aware, a Prince
Edward Island car ferry was lost, and, additional expenditures have been made there.
With these remarks, I

EXCHEQUER COURT BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING noved the second reading
of Bill 35, an Act to amend the Exchequer
Court Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I should
like to make just a brief explanation. The
Minister of Justice lias indicated in another
place that it lias been thouglit wise to propose to Parliament the appointment of a third
judge to the Exchequer Court. The Minister
says that the work of the court lias increased,
and that there is an indication of a further
increase. For instance, it is contemplated
that problems of adjudication upon relations
between companies that have received capital
assistance and other concerns engaged in war
work will be a heavy task for the court. I
would commend the Bill to the favourable
consideration of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I imagine that the work of the Exchequer
Court lias increased in the past and will in
the future be very much further increased.
Does the honourable leader know for how
long there have been two judges on that
court? It must be a long-time.

Hon. Mr. KING: With leave, I would move
that it be read the third time now.

Hon. Mr. KING: There have been two
judges for a long time, but I do not know
for just Iow long.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask a question, for
my own information? The Hudson Bay Railway, of course, is owned and operated by the
Canadian Government?

Hon. Mr. CALDER: The work of the court
must have been increasing, and present conditions are bound to increase it still further.

Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Is it part of the
Canadian National Railways system, or is it
separate?
Hon. Mr. KING: I think it is separate, but
it is operated by the Canadian National
Railways.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That is the reason why
you are asking for a separate amount?

immediately after the termination of war production, the economic life in cadi of the
provinces of the country; and for this purpose
to, constitute among its meinhers a committee
of economie studies, as representative as possible, which would be empowered to investigate
the normal production in each province, the
standard of living, the employment capacities,
the conditions of labour, the openings, and. for
this purpose, to invite and hear representatives
from farmers, labourers, transport companies
and the industrial and commercial world coneerning their preparation and their concrete
priojects for the posit-war period.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
wish to make, a few remarks with respect to
this motion standing in the namne of my honourable friend the senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Beauregard), seconded by the honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr.
Vaillancourt).
Any one who will carefully
read the resolution and the speech made by
the honourable the mover will find therein
mucb material for consideration and thought.
Before proceeding furtber I wish to congratulate the honourable gentleman from, Kennebec, who is not in bis seat at the moment,
on bis appointment to the Senate, and also
on the fact tbat bis first speech in this Chamber
was in relation to a matter of such public
importance.
My honourable friend the mover bas covered
a wide field. H1e seems t.o fear that there is a
danger of centralizsition in the post-war period,
0f course, in. war-time Governiments must assume greater powers in order to give the fullest
effect to tbe war effort. But I think that,
generally speaking, botb tbe people of Canada
and members of the Government are strongly
of opinion tbat, in regard to social and similar
legisiation, the greater the de central ization the
better will be the administration. True, under
our Constitution questions will arise as to
wbetber a given subi ect is under provincial
or Dominion jurisdiction; but to-day tbere
is a feeling in the public mind that tbese
questions must be adjusted, and 1 believe it
may be taken for granted thnt our public
men are aware of this feeling and are prepared
to bring about tbe fullest co-operation between provincial and federal authorities. It
is amazing that those wbo drafted the Britisb
North America Act were able te foresee so
clearly the developmrent of a great nation on
this baif of tbe Nortb American continent.
Tbeir work bas served a very useful purpose,
but 1 think it is generally acknowledged that
if we are to get the full benefit of Confederation -the British Nortb America Act will
bave to be modified in order more clearly
to define the respective jurisdictions of the
provinces and the Dominion. I am satisfied
that neither the Government nor Parliament
106--9

desires wartime controls to be retained in the
post-war period, and undoubtedly tbey will
lie discontinuied as the necessity for tbem
disappears.

But in tbis connection it must be borne in

In bis motion my honourable friend asks
that a committee of this Cbamber sb.ould be
constîtuted to investigate aIl matters pertaining to economie reconstraiction and social
security. As we* alI know, shortly after the
outbrcak of war, at the instance of the Prime
Minister, a committee was set up in the other
House to make a study of wbat measures
sbould be taken in the post-war period for the
purpose of effecting reconstruction, rehabilitatien and social security. Some of the ablest
men in our educational, industrial -and agricultural life were engaged to make a study of
post-war conditions.
The committee beld
many sittings and beard representations from
Government officials, university professors, industrialists, members of boards of trade and
chambers of commerce. and spokesmen for
labour and agricultural organizations and the
railways; and tbe premiers of varionis provinces also attendýed and presented their
views. The House of Commons set up also à
smaller committee to deal with the question
of social security. Dr. James and other emîinent men wbo bave made an exhaustive study
of social problems gave evidence and made
certain recommendations to the committee.
Eacb committee bas since presented a report to
the House of Commons.
Last session the Senate constituted a comnmittee on Reconstruction and Social Security,

committee would have been set up again this
session but for the fact that the Speech from
the Throne contained an intimation that a
Department of Reconstruction would be established. Also it was felt that the field of
inquiry had been fairly well exhausted.
I would suggest to my honourable friend
that he consent to the subject-matter of his
motion being referred to our Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, so that
that committee may ascertain whether any
useful purpose can be served by further inquiry
in this field. The Banking and Commerce
Committee might decide to set up a special
committee to study economic conditions mentioned in the motion. I am sure the Government would have no objection to this being
donc. I think my honourable friend would be
well advised to follow the course I have
suggested.
Again I wish to commend my honourable
friend for having brought this interesting and
important subject to the attention of the
Senate. and also those honourable members
who have taken part in the discussion.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD:
senators-

Honourable

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would draw
the attention of honourable senators to the
fact that if the honourable member now proceeds ho will close the debate.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
the honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
King) has expressed the opinion that the
Banking and Commerce Committee would be
a suitable committec to which to refer this
motion. I have no objection to this, except
on one point. As ho himself has said, this
resolution is cast in broad terms and covers a
wide field. This being so, there is no question
that during the discussion in committee we
are bound to run up against points of constitutional law in regard to jurisdiction as
between the provinces and the Dominion. I
am wondering how far the Banking Committee
could proceed te deal with the various subjects covered by this motion, in view of these
Honourable
constitutional points of law.
senators will recall, when Right Hon. Mr.
Meighen was leading one side or the other
in this House, that frequently in dealing with
certain legislation we were fa:ced with the
question of whether or net it encroached
provincial jurisdiction. There has
upon
been a great deal of litigation in respect of
federal legislation dealing with labour, and
several appeals have been taken to the Privy
Council. We have seen still more litigation
in connection with federal statutes covering
insurance companies. I might cite other subjects of disputed jurisdiction, but I will net
Hon. Mr. KING.

labour the point. If a committee of this
House, whether a standing or a special committee, makes a study on the lines proposed
in the motion, it will be faced with many
questions of jurisdiction. I am inclined te
think that perhaps a special committee could
give botter attention to the subject-matter of
the motion than could the Banking Committee.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HARDY: At the same time, the
Banking Committee has always enjoyed the
fullest confidence of this House as a hardworking and conscientious com.mittee. I repeat, I am afraid that if the motion is referred
to a committee, no matter what recommendations are brought forward, we shall in many
cases be confronted by difficulties arising out
of the split jurisdiction between the federal
and provincial Governments. This difficulty
must always be kept in mind.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members, speaking merely on the suggestion that
has come from the leader on the other side
(Hon. Mr. King), may I say that I can sec
no objection to it. Yet I have difficulty in
understanding how we are ever going to get
anywhere.
We have had, as the leader of the House
has said, two committees, one constituted by
the ofier Chamber and one by this. They
have done a great deal of valuable work. But
this resolution covers a large part of what
has already been donc, and to throw it to
the Banking and Commerce Committee at this
stage, in the hope that it will deal with all
the matters covered by the resolution, seens
to me te be expecting too much. If the mover
of the motion and, say, the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) and the
Chairman of the Banking and Commerce
Committee (Hon. Mr. Black) could get together and decide whether any subject should
be further considered by some committtee,
then if there was a reference to that committee
we should be in a botter position to accomplish something.
A vast amount of work has been done, net
only in Parliament, but everywhere throughout Canada. One of the finest signs of the
times is the discussion, by all classes of our
people, of what should be done after the war
ends. Regardless of what they say or think,
the fact that our people are in that frame
of mind promises well for the future of
Canada. I merely suggest that this resolution
should be referred to a small committee, with
instructions to indicate to the House whether
or net it would be wise for us to give some
of these matters further consideration.

MARCH 31, 1944
Hon. Mr. KING: I think my honourable
friend has misunderstood me. I hope very
much that this matter will be referred to a
committee. It could be a special committee,
or one selected from among the members
of the Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But you would have
a large committee.
Hon. Mr. KING: What I have tried to
make plain is that if the members of the Banking and Commerce Committee are of opinion
that further evidence should be heard, they
could hear it themselves as a committee, or
could appoint a small subcommittee to do so.
If we proceed along that line, we shall be,
I believe, fairly sale. If the resolution is referred to a committee, I think the committee
should not be asked to re-hear witnesses who
have already given evidence before a parliamentary committee, unless there is some
special phase which seems to require further
study.
It has been suggested that the resolution
be referred to the Committee on Finance.
An Hon. SENATOR:
committee?

Why not a special

Hon. Mr. KING: We had a special committee last year. We have not reconstituted
that committee this year, because the Government has proposed a Reconstruction Department, and the question now is more or less one
of administration. I have no strong feelings
on the matter before us, but if the resolution
were referred to the Banking and Commerce
Committee, and its members decided that a
smaller committee could deal with it better,
they could so report to the House and we
could act on their recommendation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I can see ne objection to moving along those lines.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: May I say
a word or two about two phases of this resolution, each of which appears to me to be distinct
from the other? I would suggest to the
mover of the resolution that when lie rises to
conclude this debate, he should clarify his
mind and ours as to the first hall of the resolution, which bears particularly upon the aspect
of Dominion-provincial relations. The other
half of the resolution refers very clearly to the
scope of the -work of the committee, of which
I had the honour of being chairman last year,
namely, the Committee on Economie Re-establishment. So far as economie rehabilitation -is
concerned, it is my view that any contribution
which any committee of the Senate could make
now would be affected very definitely by the
fact that the problems of reconstruction from
an economic and financial standpoint are in
106-91

process of being worked out by the Government through two of its departments. Further, if a committee were to re-hear evidence
of outstanding representatives of business and
industry it would be more or less prejudicingif that is the word-would be more or leqs
duplicating work which is already going on,
and which has a very definite bearing upon
the period following the war.
The first part of the resolution deals with
anticipated legislation. I feel that we should
be very careful on this point, and for that
reason I should like my honourable friend, the
mover of the resolution, to make himself quite
clear. We must be very careful lest we
prejudice the work to be done soon by a conference between the provinces and the Dominion respecting the vital question as to whether
or not financial arrangements now in vogue
shall continue, and whether they will be in
the interest of the whole country, having particular relation to some of the social services
that have been recommended. If a committee
were to engage in the discussion of that subject now and an interprovincial conference
should take place within the next month or
two, what would be the result? It seems to
me that we should be better advised to wait
and sec what that conference is going to do.
and to have a full discussion later.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I had not intended to say anything
about this motion, but I really think I should
point out that, in my judgment, it is the
most unfortunately worded motion or resolution that I have seen before this House in
many years. There are many people in this
country of ours who think we are a lot of
biased old menHon. Mr. DUFFUS: Not all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -living in a past
age, and thinking chiefly about how little we
can do for what we get. Here we have a
resolution which provides ammunition to all
who do not like the Senate or senators. What
are we going to do under it? Listen to this
language! We are going to investigate "the
economic life in each of the provinces of the
Dominion." After we have done that, we are
going "to constitute a-mong the members a
committee of economic studies, as representative as possible, which would be empowered
to investigate the normal production in each
province, the standard of living, the employment capacities, the conditions of labour, the
openings--" What openings? There is not one
word to indicate what openings we are talking
about. I presume this means openings for
the several hundred thousand soldiers who, we
hope, will be returning from overseas shortly.

116

SENATE

But the resolution docs flot say that. We are
just going to investigate "the openings in the
various provinces."
Speaking fromn my own cxperience-which,
in the estimation of seine, is very narrow-I
would say that we do flot nced to go very
far to investigate certain conditions. Right
here in the city of Ottawa we caxq find filth,
distress and hardship, such as should flot be
tolcrated in this Canada of ours. We can, flnd
it in even greater mesure in the city of
Montreal, in the city of Toronto, and in varîous other places. Under the British North
America Act the provinces largely control such
conditions, and it seems to me that the
provinces
would very much resent the
languege of the resolution bcfore us and the
jdea that the Senete of Canada was going to
investigate the economic life in each of the
provinces. We are goi-ng to investigate the
normal production in each of the provinces,
and then, 1 presune. make a recommendation.
Well, in the light of a few yeers' experience
in ýthis House, and on thie Banking and
Commerce Commiittee. I have a mental
photograph of the recommendation and the
results that would be secuired. Thcy would
be ebsolutely worthless, and, in my humble
judgment, would do more hiarm than good.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honouirable senators,
I do not wish to prolong tiis discussion, but
I want to make one or two remerks with
regard to the proposed suhmission' of this
resolution te the Banking end Commerce
Committce. As w-e had a special committee,
set up lest year to inquire, in part at least,
into, the metters under discussion. it seems to
me that this matter, if it is to be referred te
any committee, should bc referred to that
one, which should be rejuvenated or reconstructed for the purpose.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I sey this not because,
as chairman of the Banking and Commerce
Committee, I want. to shirk, eny task,' but because the Re-establishment Committee has
already had witnesses before it and heard
evidence withi respect to matters within the
9cope of this resolution. Thet evidence will
be fresh in the minds of the committee members, and in my opinion that committee, if reestablished, would be better able to. ha.ndle
the maLter than a large committee, such as
the one on Benlcing and Commerce. The experience and knowledge gaincd, by tbe Chairman and members of the Re-establishment
Committee ouglit to fit them to do much
l)ett( r wvork thali couîld bc doue by a new
coîumittep, few of whose members were on
that special committee.
lion. Mr. ML RDOCK.

Frankly. 1 (lo neot believe tl)et a committee
of this House, or- of the other Houise, could get
very far in deeling withi this metter. I am
in sympathy witlî the resolution, and I have
cnjoyed listening to the remarks of those
wlho liave spoken upon it. 1 think tb 0 t all
the speeces made during this debate have
been pertinent and intercsting. Yct I do not
know t1iît this Chember, or the bouse of
Commons either. would be able to do much
wth thie subjeet-matter of the resoluition
unless the British N-ýor-th America Act were
amended in some particulars. In any event,
if a good deal of the ground covered by the
resolution lias elreedy been considered by a
special committee, I do not think there
shouild be a reference to the Banking and
Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourahle senators, I
should like a littie time to, consider this
resolution further and to consuit some friends
about it. And it would he interesting to know
if thcre is to be a Dominion-provincial conference in the next two or three weeks. For
these reasons I move that the debate be adjourncd. I think it would be in the interest
of harmony in this Chamber to have an
adjournmciît of the debete until aftcr the
Easter recess.

MESSAGE OF' PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT THEOUGE HON.
RAY ATHERTON, UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR
The

Hon.

the

SPEAKER:

Honourable

after presenting his credentials ta His Excellency the Governor General and calling upon
the Right Honourable the Prime Minister

118

SENATE

and Secretary of State for External Affairs,
paid an official visit to the Speakers of the
Senate and of the House of Commons and,
through them, tendered his respects to the
honourable members of both Houses of Parliament.
His Excellency, in the most courteous,
cordial and charming language, expressed the
high regard of the President, the people of
the United States and himself for our national
and parliamentary institutions and the sterling
qualities of our Canadian people.
We said to His Excellency that, Canada
being an American as well as a British nation,
we were fortunate in having such a good neighbour as the United States of America; that
their great President had endeared himself to
the hearts of all Canadians, te whom he had
so often manifested his friendship; that we
all had been deeply moved by the assurance
given by Mr. Roosevelt before the war, that
if Canada were attacked the United States
could not stand idly by; that, on the other
hand, appreciating that the United States, like
Heaven, could help only those who would first
help themselves, Canada had done her duty
for the defence of her own territory; that we
were now very proud to fight in the four corners of the earth side by side with the United
States and our other Allies, not only in our
own defence, but also for the inalienable rights
of humanity; and we expressed our most sincere good wishes for the health and happiness
of the President, the prosperity of the American people, and the success of His Excellency's
mission to Canada.
The Ambassador thanked us and stated that
these sentiments wcre in unison with the
feelings dearest to the leart of the President
and of every American citizen.
A few days later, ihe liHonourable the
Speaker of the House of Commons and I
repaired to the United States Embassy to
return the visit. We were most graciously
received by His Excellency, and we took that
opportunity to express net only our own
gratitude, but also that of all honourable
members of both Houses of Parliament, who
felt greatly hon'oured by the visit which
flis Excellency had been kind enough to pay
to their Speakers. We extended to His Excellency our sincere congratulations upon
his appointment and our appreciation of
the honour paid to Canada by the United
States in accrediting, as their first Ambassador,
'one of the most distinguished members of
their Diplomatie Service, a gentleman whose
great reputation bad preceded him and who,
by his high qualities, in the short period of
his stay among us had already entrenched
himself solidly in the bearts of our people.
Th Hion. the SPEAKER.

We added that the United States and
Canada, with a four-thousand-mile uînarmed
bouindir, had liv-ed in peacie for one hundred
and thirty yar- setting forth to the world
an outstanding example of good neighbourliness; that twice during the lifetime of the
presnlt generation we liad fought the same
battles and shed our blood on the same battlefields against a commînion enemy; that thtese
ord. als ind ihe suprenie sacrifice made by
e
our sons ii icc dfience of our ways of life
anti of ur Christian civilization had woven
betwcen us iubreakable tics; that the unconfidence which existed between
bounilLd
our two couintries had been considerably
stri-ngtlientil by the Conference of Quebec,
and by tlie eloquiet and inspiring speech
of the President to the people of Canada,
delivered on Parliament Hill on the occasion
of his historie visit to our Capital. We professed our faith in a prompt, decisive and
glorious victory for our armies, and in our
ability to continue for evermore to work
together for the liberty and happiness of our
respective peoples and of all mankind.
We concluîd d by renewing our good wishes
for thii health of the President, the prosperity
of the United States and the success of His
ExelIneex's Mission to Canada.
Ils Exclency thanked us most warmly for
our visit and, particularly, for our speech,
whieh lie undertook to convey to the President, as nely verbatim as possible.
His Excellency did so, and on the 19th of
April His Excellency called again upon us to
communicate a letter which he had received
from the President, and whieh I have His
Excellency's permission to read to the Senate,
together with his own letter of transmission:Embassy of the
United States of America
Ottawa, April 19, 1944.
Dear Mr. Speaker:

The White Hous e,
Washington
April 6, 1944.

My dear Mr. Ambassador:
I am glad that you told me in your letter
of March 23, 1944, of the visit you received
from Messrs. Vien and Glen of the Canadian
Parliament and of their deep attachment
to the great tradition of Canadian-American
friendshi.p.
At some appropriate time would you please
thank them for their kind words of me, both
when I was in Ottawa and when you spoke
with them at the Chancery.
. I wish also that you would tell them of the
instinctive regard and affection for Canada and
Canadians which a century and more of successhas engendered among
ful neighborliness
Americans. It means much to us that CanadianAmerican relations have developed a quality all
their own. I thipk also that it can f airly be
said that we Americans -face the immense tasks
ahead with greater confidence ibecause of the
practical lessons of the past, the strongly rooted
co-operation of the present and the concrete
ideals we share for the future.
Very sincerely yourd,
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The Honourable Ray Atherton,
American Ambassador,
Ottawa, Çanada.
Honourable senators, words fail me adequately to express your gratitude and my
own to the President and the Ambassador of
the United States of America. I am sure that
1 am a faithful interpreter of your feelings in
saying that we are most thankful, and that
we affirm and endorse very heartily these
noble utterances of the President which articulate the ideals that we all cherish and for
which we are fighting. With your permission,
1 shall direct that the letters of the President
and of the Ambassador of the United States
form part of the permanent records of the

Under the treaty ail rights regarding international agreements which authorize British or

REFUNDING BILL, 1944
SECOND RIEADING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 64, an Act respecting the Canadian
National Railways and to pýrovide for the
refunding of matured, maturing and callable
financial obligations.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a Bill
to empower the Canadian National Railways
to refund maturing and callable obligations
between 1944 and 1950. These obligations in
ail amount to, I believe, $257,575,477.47.
The Bill follows pretty much the lines of
Under that
a similar Bill passed in 1938.
Bill, in February of this year loans by the
Government to the Canadian National Railtotall-ed
1938,
ways under the Act of

$105,719,032.65. 0f this amount $24,689,392.53
bears interest at the rate of 2 per cent per
annnm, and $81,029,640.12 at the rate of 3ý
per cent per annnm. All lbans made sin-ce the
ontbreak of the war are at the rate of 3ý
per cent.
Repayments on boans under the Refunding
Act of 1938 have been made out of cash surpluses of the railway company in 1941, 1942
and 1943. Portions of these surpînses applied
to sucb boans total $22,622,073.15. Other cash
surpînses have been applied to boans for capital purposes. The railway company bas not
retained any portion of the cash surpluses
earned in 1941, 1942 and 1943: aIl have been
paid over to the Government in the repayment of boans.
I have here a statement that was presented
to the Huse of Commons. It sets forth the
obligations, amounts and dates of maturity.
The amonts are set out separately and total
np to the figure I have already given of
$257,575,477.47. I tbink it wonld be well to
have this statement placed on Hansard for
reference.

the obligations that are to be substituted
for those which are outstanding?
Hon. Mr. KING: I think so, yes.
If this Bill receives second reading now, it
would be well to refer it to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce so that
honourable members may have an opportunity
of familiarizing themselves with its various
sections.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING: I would now move that
the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask why
this Bill, which is a railway Bill, should not
go to the Standing Committee on Railways,
Telegraphs and Harbours?
Hon. Mr. KING: It deals with finances,
and I think it is proper that it should be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

JUDGES BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 85, an Act to amend the Judges
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, it will be
.recalled that at our last sitting before the
Easter adjournment we passed a Bill for the
appointment of an additional judge to the
Exchequer Court of Canada. The object of
the present Bill is to provide the salary for
that additional judge, at $9,000 a year.
Hon. J. T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I wish to say a few words about the amount
of the salary provided for by this Bill. While
Hon. Mr. KING.

it may be true that if all the judges in
Canada retired to-day their places could be
filled to-morrow by equally capable lawyers,
I feel that after income tax deductions are
made our judges are not receiving enough
remuneration. Only lawyers who practise in
the courts can appreciate the significance of
that. The layman may say: "The judge's
salary is pretty good. I know many lawyers
who do not make as much." But remember,
these men sitting on the Bench have to
decide a wide variety of questions, some of
which are highly important. The very root
of freedom rests in our judges, who must
be men of much ability.
Some people may ask why it is important
to see that our judiciary is well paid. Well,
in Canada we have always followed the British
theory, and I think rightly so, that a judge
should have reasonable assurance of being
able to accumulate a competency for himself, and for his wife, in the event that he
should die first. I think that $9,000 would be
sufficient for a judge of the Exchequer Court,
if he got the whole amount; but after he
pays his income tax he has about $5,000. As
a rule he is dealing with important questions,
and often the amount involved is large. Many
of the issues coming before him concern
disputes between the Government and an
individual citizen-and the law is on the side
of the Government.
I wish to make a general protest against
the low salaries now being paid to our judges.
Ten years ago I thought the remuneration
was high enough, and I should still think so
if the amount was received in full. It seems
to me, honourable senators, we should seriously
consider making representations to the Minister of Finance that judges are one class of
people who ought to be allowed enough
remuneration to maintain themselves absolutely above reproach. I am not suggesting
that they can be influenced in any way--not
at all-but I sav it is not fair to ask a man
to retire from active professional life and go
on the Bench at a heavy financial sacrifice.
Many of the lawyers who happen to have a
bank account, bonds, or other assets did
not make their money out of the practice of
law. Clients often inform lawyers about opportunities to make money. But once a man is
appointed to the Bencfi he is eut off from
any such means of benefiting himself.
I do not think that any of our judgeswhether on the Supreme Court of Canada, the
Exchequer Court, or any of the provincial
courts-are paid enough. There may be too
many judges in sone provinces. For instance,
on the appeal court in each of the provinces
of Manitoba. Saskatchewan and Alberta there

APRIL 26, 1944
are five judges, and I believe that any one
of those courts could handle all the appeals
for the three provinces and not be too busy.
These provinces are for the most part agricultural communities, and the matters coming
before their courts are much alike.
The other day I read a newspaper item
stating that a prominent labour man had complained that the salaries of Our judges were
too low. I agreed with him, but it struck me
as rather queer that he had to call public
attention to this situation.
I hope honourable members will suggest to
the Minister of Finance the desirability of
some amendment in the income tax law in
favour of judges. He may not be able to
have any amendment put through now while
we are in the depths of a crisis-and I am not
one who would urge a change at this time, for
we may be within two or three months of the
most critical period of the war-but I do say
that after the war some consideration should
be given to this matter.
It is an easy thing to say we are fighting
to preserve freedom. The average lawyer who
has had any practice in the courts knows that
the administration of justice is one of the
most important functions of a free people. I
do not care how able your Attorney General
or your Crown prosecutor may be; if the judge
on the Bench has not the right character and
the necessary ability, the administration of
justice will not be as good as it should be. I
do not expect ever to be a judge, but I do
expect that some of my friends, fellow-lawyers,
will be practising before judges for many years
to come. If a man is good enough to be
appointed to the Bench, he should be given at
least a reasonably commensurate salary.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
NATIONAL RAILWAYS AUDITORS BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 86, an Act respecting the appointment
of auditors for National Railways.
He said: Honourable senators, the object of
this Bill is to appoint auditors for the Canadian National Railways for the year 1944. All
honourable members know it is necessary for
Parliament to make such an appointment
annually by joint resolution of both Houses.
The present Bill follows the same pattern as
the measure passed last session. On inquiry I
find that the amount paid the auditors last
year was $50,000, plus $1,800 for auditing the
books and accounts of the air service.
The same

WATER METERS INSPECTION BILL
THIRiD READING

POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. KING moved the third reading
of Bill 36, an Act to repeal the Water Meters
Inspection Act.
Hon. J. ANTOINE LEGER: Honourable
senators, if the position is correctly stated in
the explanatory note, I am net against the
purpose of the Bill; but I wonder whether
we are taking the right course to the desired
end. This is the second or third bill of this
nature which has come before us. The explanatory note does not state whether the
purpose for which presumably the Act was
passed in 1905 has been served or not. If we
pass this Bill we are, in effect, telling those
who come after us that the statute was found
to be useless and a nuisance, and therefore we
got rid of it.
It seems to me that the proper procedure
would be to set out in a preamble the reasons
for -the Bill. I wonder whether or not the
Act was useful. It seems to me that when any
commodity is sold by measure the meters
should he subject to inspection.
If, for
example, water is sold by measure its measure-

APRIL 27, 1944
ment should be regulated in the same way as
are other commodities, such as sugar, tea, or
anything else.
An Hon. SENATOR: Liquor.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is right, too. Instead of seeking to repeal the Act, I think it
should be re-enacted to form part of the
Weights and Measures Act. But I doubt very
much whether what is sought to be repealed is
in fact a statute. Apparently, since it never
was proclaimed, the legislation never came into
effect, and consequently to attempt to repeal
that which does not exist seems to me very
much like whipping the wind, and the word
"repeal" is absolutely out of place. I hope
that in future when dealing with similar cases
the explanation will appear in the form of a
preamble to the Bill, with an enacting clause
to the effect that the so-called Act be expunged
or stricken from the Statute Book. The point
is not very important, but I think honourable
members will agree with me that we should
always be careful to proceed in the right way.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
do not wish to enter into a discussion with my
honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Léger) with respect to procedure. I may say,
however, that, like him, I do not sec why we
should not meter water as we do electricity
and other commodities. The Minister tells
me that no demand for the metering of water
has ever come before the Department, the
explanation being that the meterigg is done
by municipalities under municipal regulations.
Although the Act bas been on the Statute
Book since 1905, it was not brought into effect
by proclamation, there being no requirement
for it. When in 1927 the statutes were revised,
the proclamation feature was dropped. However, as the Bill has been passed by the other
flouse, I would suggest that the Senate agree
to the motion for third reading, on the understanding that the remarks of the honourable
member from L'Acadie be brought to the
attention of the authorities.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
the point raised is worth while considering.
As I understand it, the Department of National
Revenue bas jurisdiction over electricity, gas
and other metered commodities, and the
meters are inspected periodically. It may be
that up to date no municipality bas had a
water-metering system, but the mere fact that
no application has been made to the Department for inspection does not mean that
to-morrow there may not be one or more
municipalities supplying metered water. I
think this Bill should be referred to, say,
the Banking and Commerce Committee, so

that officials of the Department may make the
situation a little clearer before we take final
action.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This is a motion
for third reading. The argument should have
been presented on the motion for second
reading.
Hon. Mr. KING: I would suggest that the
Bill stand over until next week.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Stand.

SECOND READING
Hon. ARISTIDE BLAIS moved the second
reading of Bill T3, an Act respecting the
General Missionary Society of the German
Baptist Churches of North America, and to
change its name to the North American
Baptist General Missionary Society.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this Bill is set out in the title.
By clause 1 the name of the society is
changed and all its rights and liabilities
reserved.
In their petition the society represents that:
(a) The word "German" as part of the title
is no longer indicative either of the constituency
served or of the Christian Mis.sionary work
done by the society, as many thousands of its
members are not even of German descent, and
the German language no longer is used by a
majority of its members.
(b) By far the larger percentage of the work
donc by the society is in the English language.
(c) The continued use of the word "German"
in the narne of the society bas proved, and is
proving, a hindrance and a handicap to its
work.
If the motion is agreed to I shall move that
the Bill be referred to the Miscellaneous
Private Bills Committee, before which a
representative of the society will appear and
furnish such additional information as the
committee may require.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

DIVORCE BILLS
REPORTS

OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR, for the Chairman of
the Committee on Divorce, moved consideration of the committee's 64th to 69th reports,
inclusive.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Have these reports
been distributed yet? I believe not. I do not
think we should consider them until we have
the reports in our hands-not that it is a
matter of very great importance, perhaps, as
many honourable members do not read them,
but as a matter of order and proper form.
The

Hon. the SPEAKER:

Stand.

Hon. MUr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators,
these arc reports from the committee. The
official evidence is the transcript by the
reporters, and is in the hands of the Clerk
of the Senate. It is not distributed until
printed copies are received from the Printing
Bureau; but when the evidence is in the
hands of the Clerk, that is considered to be a
compliance with the rules, and quite in order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then any of us who
are interested in one of these divorce cases
have to go to the Clerk to ascertain and
analyze what the committee is recommending.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, no. This is only a
report of the committee. When the report is
adopted, the bill comes before the House, and
before we can give it second -reading the report
of the evidence must be in our hands.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is fine! I am
glad to hear my honourable friend from Winnipeg say that, because on the 31st of March,
Hon. Mr. BLAIS.

when we adjourned, we gave first, second and
third readings to divorce bills, the record of
which was not in our hands for five days
afterwards.
The order before us is for the consideration
of the sixty-fourth report. Have I the right
to look at the sixty-fourth report? I am told
that the rules do not contemplate that I shall
have everything before me before I vote.
Nonsense! I realize that the most important
rule relating to this question bas not been
applied in the Senate of Canada for 30 years.
In proof of ,that we have the statement of
the Chief Clerk of Committees, made to my
seat-mate and myself some time ago. But I
for one object when neither I nor any other
members of the Senate have it, and I object
to what we did on the 31st of March, in giving
the first, second and third readings to five
divorce bills, I think it was.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It would be quite
in order for any honourable senator to object
to the consideration of a bill before the
evidence taken before the committee was
printed and distributed. As regards the report
of the committee, however, it is a question
of expediency. There is nothing in the rules
of the Senate to prevent the consideration of
a report of the committee, even though the
exvidence bas not been printed and distributed.
Honourable senators may decide whether they
will consider the report now or later, but there
is no rule to prevent consideration of the
report now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then, your Honour,
is this language not clear: "Consideration of
the sixty-fourth report"? Who is considering
it? I am not considering it, because I have
not got it before me, nor bas any other
honourable member of this House. I know
that this apologetic interpretation bas been
made use of before.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: It is a statement of
the rules.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: An interpretation of
the rules by Beauchesne would not sustain it,
and we all bank on Beauchesne. Nevertheless,
some honourable members want to rush things
through, as they did the first, second and third
readings on the 31st of March, without having
the record before them. If we are to be a
rubber stamp, "Go ahead," I say; but if we
are going to do business in compliance with
the rules, let me have a chance to consider
the sixty-fourth report, and do not jam it
down my throat without giving me some
information.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, what
we are asked to consider to-day are reports

APRIL 27, 1944

127

from the Divorce Committee, which bas heard
the evidence. If the reports are accepted by
the House, then bis will be introduced on the
basis of the reports. Ail the evidence adduced
before 'the committee wiil be presented before
the buis are considered. Adoption of a
report does flot. mean that there will be a
divorce; it means merely that a bill te grant
a divorce will be founded upon the report.
The reports which appear on the Order
Paper for consideration were before the
flouse yesterday, and by unanimous consent
were put down for consideration to-day.
Personaliy I do flot care what happens to
them. We are foilowing the usual and, I
think, proper practice, and when the bis corne
before the flouse for consideration any honourable senator wiil have a right to object to the
divorces being granted.

claimed that the Senate has not much to, do.
That is -one of the reasons. Yesterday we met
f or 45 minutes, and the day before for 45
minutes. To-day we are just running by the
record and say'ing, "Neyer mind the rules at
ail; just let us clear up and get out of here."
1 have no-thing more to say.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I should like to
point eut to honourabie senators that the
reports in question have been presented to
the flouse, and each and every one of them
appears in our printed Minutes of Proceedings.
The evidence is not generally printed and
distributed before the introduction of the bill.
The only rule relating to this which I can find
mn the Standing Orders of the Senate is rule
135, which reads:
Evidence taken before the coinmittee shall
he printed apart from the Minutes of Pro-ceed-ings of the Senate, and only in sufficient nombers for the use of senators and members ef
the flouse of Gommons, that is to say, one copy
for distribution to eacli senator or memnber, ten
copies for the parties and their counsel, and
twentyfive copies to 'be kept 'by the Clerk of
the Senate for purposes of record and reference.
Reference has been made to the speed with
which the Senate disposed of several divorce
bis the ýother day. Any honourable senator
could have objected at ýthat time to the second
reading or the third reading; but as nothing
of -the kind was done, it was quite in keeping
with the Standing Orders that the Senate, hy
unanimous consent, should proceed with the
second and third readings.
The reports now before the Senate have al
been printed in the Minutes of Proceedings,
which, appear together with to-day's Order
Paper.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wouid your Honour
kindiy let them, stand, and wouid yeu allew
me to suggest that you have net read the
proper rule? I shahl read one of the divorce
mules which will prove ýthat the position your
Honour is taking is wrong.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honour, that
will surely be a very nice statement to go eut
to some people who are interested in this
matter. We are asked te consider the sixtyfourth report, and ail we have got -is the indication te which. yen refer, that a few days ago
Tom, Dick or flarry was asking for a divorce.
That is ail we have. That is the sixty-feurth
report. 1 know we have been doing this sort
cf thing right along. I know aise it has been

The Hon. the SPEAKER: I shouid. like te,
point out that there is nothing in the ruies
governing this. It is a matter -of expediency,
and is in the banda of honeurabie, senators
themselves te determine whether or not they
shall proceed to-day with -the consideration of
these reports. There is nothing in the ruies
te prevent the Senate preceeding; there is
nothing in the -rules -te prevent the Senate letting these orders stand until another day. As
I say, the question is entirely within the power
of the Senate.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Honeurable senators,
as a member of the Divorce Committee, and
one who. ordinarily dees net object on any
technicality in conneetion with any business
that cornes before the flouse, may I say that
1 thînk our rotes might very well be amended,
as the mules of the ether Chamber are geing
te be. I bave a certain sympathy with the
honourabie senator who objects. I-t dees net
seem te me very logical for members of this
Chamber te consider a report which-I shahl
take as an example the one we are deaiing
with-just says this:
With respect te the petition of Margaretha
Bernhsrd Cronsuer, of the city ef Montreal,
in the Province of Quebec, seastress, for an
Act te dissolve 'lier enarriage with Joachim
Cronsuer, the committee flnd that the requirements of the Ruies of the Senste have been
complied with in ail material respects, except
Rule 140 respecting payment of the Parusamentary fees.
Then, withlout any basis, clause 2 proceede:
The committee recommend the passage of an
Act te dissolve the said marriage.

If the flouse adepts this it puts itself on
record as being in faveur of the passage of an
Act te dissolve the marriage witheut having
anything whatever on which te hase its conclusion or opinion. That te me dees net seemn
quite logical.
While as a matter of fact I do net like te
deiay the proceedings, I may say that we al
know what, in ail probability, is going te
happen-that the flouse will be willing te
place the responsibility on the committee

SENATE
which hicard the evidence because as a rule
we pass these bis without any discussion at
ail. But I do &saythat it does not seem consistent for the 1flouse to say here and now
thiat it recommends the passage of an Act to
dissolve a mîarriage, when we have so far had
no opportunitx' whatsoex er to consider the
ex idence on which. such a bill would be based.
Hon. Mr. COPP: When will the House
evcr have an opportunity to consider the
evidence?
Hon. Mr. EU'LER: After the evidence is
availal)le for honourable members to read.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Exactly the same procedure takcs place in connection with the
report of every committee. For instance, the
otiu r day the Banking and Commerce Committee prescnted two or three reports, each
rcconmmending that a bill should bie passed
witli certain amendments, and we were asked
to concur in thesc reports, although xve did
flot kniow what the amendmnrts were.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That procedure was just
as wrong as this.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not at ail. It is only
a qucstion of procedure. Every hionourabie
member knows that after we adopt a report
of that kind the bill in question, with its
amendinents, xviii be prhxited and distributed.
In the case of a Divorce Commit-tee report,
after it is adopted a bill is printed and distributed, aiong with the evidence taken before
the committee, and we have the whole thing
in our hands before we are called upon to
vote on the motion for second reading of the
bill. The procedure with respect to reports
presented from committees is the samne as it
has been since Confedieration.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: The Banking and Commerce Committee, or any other such committee, simply reports in favour of a bill, or
of a bill as amended, but a Divorce Committee
report recommends the passage of an Act.
There is a great difference between the two
kinds of reports.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is no difference.
A committee's report on a bill may recommend
certain amendments, in whicha we are asked to
concur.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But we are asked
to consider Divorce Committee reports "tegether with the evidence taken before the said
committee."
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators,
may I speak once more on this matter? We
are told that we can vote for or against a
divorce bill when it comes before us. But if
Hon. Mr. EULER.

we have previously concurred in the committee's report we have aiready gone on record
as favouring the passage of that bill.
Hon. Mr. KING:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Clause 2 of the Divorce
Committce's sixty-fourth report, for instance,
reads:
The committee i ecommieid tue passage of an
Act te udissolve tue said mari age.
So if we adopt tlîat report we place ourselves
on record, before we sec the bill, as being in
favour of the passage of an Act. There is no
getting away from that, for it is stated there
in black and white.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As the Honourable the
Speaker bas intimated, the question is purely
one of practice. In this flouse the practice
lias aiways been to consider the merits of
divorce buis, as of other bills, on the motion
for second reading. Aniy honourable member
who objeets to the granting of any particular
divorce eau vote against it when the bill comes
up for second reading. Before that stage is
reachcd, the eommittee's report, together with
the ex idence taken at the hearin., is distributed to ail honourabie members. No one bas
ex er been regarded as having bound himself
to support a divorce bill because Pce bas voted
for the adoption of the committee's report
recommending thîe bill.
The honourable member from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) Pas objected several
times to certain divorce bills. My memory is
that on each occasion hc bas expressed his
objection when the motion for second reading
of the bill was before the flouse. By that
time hie had had an opportunity to read and
digest the evidence. That is in accordance
with the procedure which we bave always
foilowed, and in my opinion it is simpler and
more intelligent to follow that procedure than
to consider the merits of a bill on the motion
to adopt the committee's report. A~doption of
a committee's report has neyer been held te
bind a legisiative chamber in the sense that
adoption of the motion for second reading does.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable
gentleman please deal witb the matter now
before us? We are asked to consider these
reports of the Divorce Committee "together
with the evidence taken before the said
committee."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 admit quite freely that
if honourable members xvish to discuss these
divorce petitions at tbis stage, it is quite within
their right to do so. TIhe point I wîsh to make
is that our practice has been to postpone discîîssion, of the merits of a bill until we corne

APRIL 27, 1944
to the motion for second reading. I think that
the practice we have followed so far is much
better than the one that seems to be suggested
now, and I believe that if we made a change
we should return to the present practice within
a short !time.
When I was a member of our provincial
Legislature I bad some experience with parliamentary rules, and my opinion, for what it is
worth, is that whatever procedure we prefer
for divorce bills can be provided for in our
rules. His Honour the Speaker is absolutely
correct in pointing out that the matter is
entirely within the control of the House. It
really will make no difference which procedure
we follow. If the merits of petitions are discussed at the report stage, there need be no
further discussion when the bills are brought
down. By adopting these reports we do not
preclude ourselves at all from free discussion
on the motion for second reading of any bill.
And at the second reading stage we shall have
the evidence before us.
My honourable friend said that one day this
session a number of divorce bills had been put
through more than one stage. Incidentally, it is
improper to refer in such way to something
done in the current session.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Why?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Because it is against the
rules. The point is that we dealt with those
bills speedily in order to get them before the
House of Commons as soon as possible.
Let no one say that any honourable member of the Senate likes this divorce business.
Not one of us likes it. To meet the existing
situation, divorce petitions are presented to us,
and we have to deal with them as best we can.
It is, if I may say so, a little discreditable
to the Parliament of Canada to have to handle
business of this kind.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But somebody has to
attend to it. Apparently the present procedure
is in line 'with what has been going on since
Confederation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: If we have to do
this work, then let us do it according to the
rules.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The House makes its own
rules. I think we should follow our usual
procedure and adopt these reports, but if a
majority of honourable members prefer to
change the procedure there is nothing to prevent them from doing so.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators,
at the risk of violating the rules against speaking too often, may I repeat that my objection

129

to the motion is that by adopting these reports
we commit ourselves as being in favour of the
passage of Acts granting the divorces applied
for. That does not seem to me to be quite
logical. I was wondering if we could not overcome the difficulty by moving that the reports
be received.
What is the
Hon. Mr. STEVENSON:
difference?
Hon. Mr. EULER: There is a considerable
difference. The present motion is that the
reports be adopted. By voting to receive a
report, we do not necessarily adopt it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What serious
objection is there to recommending the bills?
Hon. Mr. EULER: If we recommend them
now, we place ourselves on record as in favour
of passing bills which we have not yet seen.
Hon. Mr. KING: Oh, no.
Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
senators, some confusion has probably been
caused by the special rule governing the introduction of divorce bills, as distinct from other
private bills. Rule 113 says:
Every private bill is introduced on petition,
and presented to the Senate after the petition
has been favourably reported on by the Committee on Standing Orders.
But the procedure with respect to divorce bills
is different. Rale 133 provides:
All petitions .for divorce and all matters
arising out of petitions for, or bills of divorce.
shall be referred to the Standing Committee
on Divorce. . . .
The way in which bills are handled is a
matter of practice as expressed in the rules.
Adoption of a report from the Divorce Committee does not commit the House as being
in favour of the principle of the bill that
follows. It is simply a matter of practice. No
honourable member may introduce a private
bill until a petition for leave to introduce has
been presented to the Senate and approved.
A petition praying for a bill to dissolve a
marriage must be referred to the Committee
on Divorce, and when that committee reports
favourably on a petition it is, in effect, only
recommending that leave to introduce a bill
be granted. After its introduction, a divorce
bill, like any other bill, is subject to consideration on its various stages.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: But I would again
draw your Honour's attention to the fact that
these Orders call for consideration of reports
of the Committee on Divorce "together with
the evidence taken before the said committee."
Have we got that evidence?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Yes, we have.
Honourable senators, there is some confusion
about this matter. Rule 143 shows clearly

130

SENATE

that the procedure we are following this afternoon is perfectly correct. Rule 142 provides,
among other things, that the committee shall
procced "to hear and inquire into the matters
set forth in the petition." Then Rule 143
says:
After such hearing and inquiry, the committee
shall report to the Senate, stating whether the
requirenients of these rules have been complied
with in all material respects; and, if it shall
have been then found that any such requirement
has not been so complied with, stating in what
respect there lias been default, and also stating
the conclusions arrived at and the action
recommended by the committee.
2. The report shall be accompanied by the
testimony of the witnesses examined, and by all
documents, papers and instruments referred to

the committee by the Senate or received in
evidence by the committee.
3. If the report recommends the granting of
relief to the petitioner it shall also be accompanied by a draft, approved by the committee,
of a bill to effect such relief.
4. The minority may bring in a report
stating the grounds upon which they dissent
from the report of the committee.
And Rule 144:
Upon the adoption of the report of the committee, the bill may be presented and read a
first time; and thereafter no further reference
to the bill to the committee shall be necessary,
unless so ordered by the Senate.
The procedure in regard to these reports is
entirely in keeping with the rules. If those
rules are not satisfactory to honourable members, we should take steps to amend them.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Might I digress by
referring to rule 141. It reads as follows:
The petition when presented to the SenateThis is the Senate, I think.
-shall be accompanied by the evidence of the
publication of the notice as required by Rule
136, and by declaration in evidence of the
service of a copy of the notice and of a copy
of the petition as provided .by Rule 137. The
petition, notice, and evidence of publication
and service, and all papers connected therewith
shall thereupon stand as referred, without
special order to that effect, to the Standing
Committee on Divorce.
Surely the Senate is entitled to some of these
things, although I know that for thirty yearsHon. Mr. ASELTINE: It lias all been donc.
lon. Mr. MURDOCK: -it
done in many cases.

lias not been

lion. Mr. ASELTINE: It las been donc in
this case.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Rule 141 has to be
complied with before the petition comes before
the committee at all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I am talking of the
Senate. The petition is presented to the
Senate. The rule reads:
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

The petition when presented to the Senate
shall ie accompanied by the evidence of the
publication of

the notice-

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I know many people
think we are just a lot of fussy old men who
want to do nothing but get out of here. But
I am trying to emphasize that the rules mean
something and should be observed. In March
we gave first, second and third readings to
certain bills, with respect to which we did not
get the evidence or even a scrap of paper until
five days later.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is
on the motion made by Hon. Senator Copp,
seconded by Hon. Senator Sinclair, that the
various reports of the Standing Committee on
Divorce, appearing on the Order Paper as
Orders Nos. 6 to 10, inclusive, be now considered. Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Your Honour, I
distinetly object. It is contrary to the rules.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I object to that statement.
You. Mr. Speaker, have already given your
ruling.
The lon. the SPEAKER: I have ruled that
there is no rule which would prevent the
Senate in its discretion from considering and
adopting these reports.
The motion was agreed to, on division.

ECONOMIC RECONSTRUCTION AND

SOCIAL SECURITY
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from March 31 the
ad'journed debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Beauregard:
That it is expedient that this House should
get ready without delay to study the legislation
which will ibe brought before it-,constructive or
remedial legislation-intended to safeguard,
immediately after the termination of war production, the economie life in each of the provinces of the country; and for this .purpose to
constitute among its members a committee of
economic studies, as representative as possible,
which would be enpowered to investigate the
normal production in each province, the
standard of living, the employment capacities,
the conditions of laibour, the openings, and, for
this .purpose, to invite and hear representatives
from farmers, labourers, transport companies,
the industrial and commercial world concerning
their preparation and their concrete projects for
the post-war.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
this important resolution may be divided into
two parts. The first part reads:
That it is expedient that this House should
get ready without delay to study the legislation
which will ibe brought ibefore it-constructive
or remedial legislation-intended to safeguard,
immediately after the termination of war .production, the economie life in each of the
provinces of the country;
That "constructive or remedial legislation"
is included in the announcement which the
Prime Minister made the other day that certain further legislation will be brought down
this session. The legislation will be studied
when it comes before us. I do not think we
need a committee for the purpose.
The second part of the resolution is altogether different. It reads:
and for this purpose to constitute among
its members a committee of economie studios,
as representative as possible, which would be
empowered to investigate the normal production
in each province, the standard of living, the
employment capacities, the conditions of labour,
the openinga, and, for this purpose, to invite
and hear representatives from f armers, labourers,

131

transport companies, the industrial and commercial world concerning their preparation and
their concrete projects for the post-war.
We have had in this House, under the chairmanship of the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), and in the House
of Commons, under the chairmanship of Mr.
Turgeon,'the member for Cariboo, a thorough
examination of these matters. Everyone knows
what serious problems 'will confront all the
world following the present terrifie struggle.
A severe world-economic dislocation followed
the 1914-18 struggle, but that dislocation was
on a small scale compared with what we shall
have to face after the Allied nations win this
war. I appreciate what the honourable senator
from Rougemont (Hon. Mr. Beauregard) has
done in bringing to our attention in a very
forceful way these after-war problems. Our
public debt will be larger than it has ever
been before, far larger than any of us ever
imagined twenty or thirty years ago that
Canada could carry. Our industrial capacity
has increased beyond our fondest dreams of
ten or even five years ago, and this in its turn
has brought about certain economie changes.
It is well that these things should be brought
to our attention.
Then there is the important question of an
adjustment of the relationship between the
Dominion and the provinces. I take second
place to no one in my desire that the rights
of the provinces shall not be interfered with.
But we must remember that during the last
war Canada advanced constitutionally by leaps
and bounds. We were recognized as one of
the important nations of the world, and we
joined our Allies of those days in signing the
treaty of peace. Truc, the Statute of Westminster came later, but it was really declaratory of a status that had already been
recognized. We are again in a similar position.
The Prime Minister of Canada is, I presume,
now in London to confer with the other Prime
Ministers of the Commonwealth in regard to
post-war policies.
I do not believe that at this stage the Senate
should discuss the question of Dominionprovincial relations. And I will tell you why.
Within -the next three or four months there
is to be a conference between the provinces
and the Dominion at which these matters will
be discussed. The two Central Provinces are
in a much stronger economic position than the
other seven provinces. We cannot have a
great country unless all its parts are great.
In other words, we cannot have a great country
if only the Central Provinces are prosperous
and the other provinces are in economic
trouble. This undoubtedly will be brought
very forcibly before the Government when
the projected conference takes place.

SENATE
And the very nature of the problems arising
out of the war wjll force us to, reconsider the
relationship of Canada as a wbole to itself.
The Senate is flot the place to take that into
consideration, for the reason that wvoin this
House represent minorities. In the House of
Commons 147 members represent the Central
Provinces and 98 the other seven provinces;
wvhile in this House the relative figures are
48 and 48. One reason for this equal division
of our membership between the two sets of
provinces is that the smaller provinces might
have soine body which would at least give
tbem an ex on break in considering thoir
problems. We are not a body elected by
popular vote; we are, rather, an appeal body;
and it is our duty to hold the scales evenly
betwoen the different parts of the Dominion.
If Canada is to be a great united nation it will
nover be united so much by the bouse of
Commons as bv the Sonate, for the reosn
I have already stated; that is, the equality
of our roprosentation as between the twe sets
of provinces and our net having to seek
re-election by popular vote. As a member
of the Sonate for Manitoba, I have no fear
xvhatever that, say, the honourable senator
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), or the
honourable -enator fromn Leeds (Hon. Mr.
Hardy), or any bonourable senator, from
Queboc would deal otherwise- than fairly with
Manitoba,
Alberta,
Saskatchewan, British
Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia or
Prince Edward Island. I do not suggest they
would act, to the prejudice of these provinces;
but even if thcy wantod te tbey could not,
simply because we have as many votes as
they have.
I do flot think this resolution, sliould
ho proceeded with.
After the House of
Commons bas deait with any constructive or
remedial legisiation based on reports of its
committees, and that legisiation reaches us,
if we do net tbink it is fair te the smaller
provinces xve shall have te reject it. Certainly
xve are not the body te introduce sncb legislation. Therefore I suggest te the honourable
senlator that hoe do net press bis motion. If ho
doos, I must say quite candidly that for the
reasons stated I shall be compelled te vote
against it. I appreciate the earnestness ef the
hononrable senator and his desire te find a
solution for the problems that will face us
after the war, problems wbose solution will
tax the combin-ed brains net enly of the
members of the Senate and the House cf
Commons, but of ail the people of Canada.
To press this reselution weuld, I believe, enly
make more difficnlty fer the Government.
I do net want anyhedy te tbink that I am a
supporter of the Goveroment.

tion that has existed in Canada for at least
fforty-seven years. That organization, is a
member off the Wesleyan Methodist Church
of America Conference, and I understand it
takes its discipline and doctrine from the
Conference. The American organization is au
incorporated body that has existed since 1860,
and the Canadian organization dates ffrom
about 1897. There are about fifteen churches
in Ontario, and possibly three or four in the
province o f Quebec.
The main object off the Bill is t.o e-stablish
an incorporated body for the purpose off holding property. At the present time the various
churcli buildings are carried in the names off
the members of 'the congregations, as trustees,
and in consequence changes are n-ecessary ffrom

stated that he haýd no objection tn the fform
off the Bill. It is a standard fform that has
been used a nýumber off times for similar

they are ail members off the littie church on

SENATE
UNITED NATIONS RELIEF
AND
REHABILITATION BILL, 1944
MOTION FOR
SECOND
READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 84, an Act for carrying into effect the
agreement for United Nations relief and
rehabilitation administration between Canada
and certain other nations and authorities.
He said: I have no doubt that honourable
senators have familiarized themselves with the
agreement scheduled to this Bill. The draft
agreement, tabled last June, was the result of
discussions between the four 'major powers,
Great Britain, the United States, the Union of
Soviet Socialist Republies and the Republic
of China. The final agreement was signed by
forty-three powers. These powers, I may add,
represent 80 per cent of the population of the
world.
The first meeting of the Council set up
under the agreement was held at Atlantic
City last November. The second meeting is
to be held in Montreal next June. The
Council meets twice yearly, and more frequently when so directed by the Central
Committee.
Apart from the war measures which we have
passed for the assembling, training, equipping
and placing of our fighting forces in the
war arcas, I believe this Bill is probably one
of the most important that Parliament bas
been asked to consider during the last five
sessions.
This agreement symbolizes to some extent
what was in the minds of President Roosevelt
and Prime Minister Churchill when they
drow up that historie document now known
as the Atlantic Charter.
Many men who were engaged in the fighting and administrative forces of the last great
war will recall what was then found necessary
n the way of relief for the distressed nations
of Europe. It was to he expected that our
leaders in this great conflict would try to
anticipate the necessity of the arrangement
embodied in this Bill. After the armistice at
the end of the last war a body known as the
Supremo Economie Council was set up, of
which MIr. Herbert Hoover, United States
Food Administrator, and later President tf the
United States, was chairman.
He directed
and had charge of the administration work. At
that time the cost, totalling $377,000,000, was
met by gifts from governments and individuals; also, purchases were made amounting
to $520,000.000, and loans advanced to the

extent of $1.423,000,000.

In addition, credits

were allowed to Allied governments by the
United States of America.
Having in mind the experience of the last
war and the greater magnitude and extent of
Hon. Mr. TANNER.

the present conflict, I think it will he readily
agreed that on this occasion an even greater
effort will ha ve to be made than was made
after the last war. When the present war
broke out in 1939, Great Britain, France and
Poland were the three powers contending
against Germany and Italy. As hostilities
progressed other nations became involved.
With their entrance into the war-I refer
particularly te Russia and the United States
group of nations known as the United
-a
Nations of the world came into an accord,
and to-day they are opposing and fighting
those who advocate a form of government
which we in this country would not tolerate.
It is · hat group of nations who are parties te
t
this agreement.
Under the agreement a Council has been set
up, and in addition there is a Central Committee composed of representatives of Great
Britain, the United States, Russia and China.
By unanimous vote of the Council at Atlantic
City in .November, Mr. Lehmann, former
Governor of the State of New York, was
appointed chairman of this Central Committee, and he is now engaged in Washington
in building up an administrative staff to carry
on the work. It is proposed that the organization should be prepared, after the success
of our arms and the expulsion of the enemy
from various countries, to move in and undertake to relieve, as far as is humanly possible,
the conditions they will almost certainlv meet
there. With the scientific knowledge we have
it is believed that through the distribution of
supplies by a competent staff muich can be
done to prevent epidemies which might otherwise become verv serious and result in the loss
of many millions of lives. As to food supplies
alone. it would not he an exaggeration to say
that if we fail in or dutv the probability is
tîat millions of people will die of starvation.
From information available to us we know
that in overrunning these countries the enemy
has deliberately taken from the people ail the
excess food supplies, leaving them only the
harest necessities upon which to exist. We
kow also that if the enemv, as he is forced
to retire, practises the same scorched-earth
policy which he has followed in certain
countries, there will be little in the way of food
and nourishment for the people who are left
behind after his retirement. It is important,
therefore, that this agreement be brought into
effect, to enable the United Nations to supply
the needs of these people and meet the other
problems incidental to re-establishing them in
their ordinary ways of life.
At its Atlantic City meeting last year the
Council appointed a Food Committee. the
chairman of which is Mr. L. B. Pearson, a

MAY 2, 1944
Canadian who bas been associated with our
Embassy in Wasbington. We are fortunate
in baving a rnan of such high character and
ability in this position, for we shahl find, I
tbink, that tbe responsibility for food and
supplies of tbat nature will largely devolve
upon the Americas, particularly Canada, the
United States and the Republic of Brazil.
A committee set up in London in 1942 made
a report in 1943, in which they estirnated
that the food requirements for Europe in the
first six rnontbs after the Armistice would be

twenty-three million tons,

exclusive,

of the

requirernents of the Soviet Union. 0f this
quantity it was estimated that sorne fourteen
million tons would bave to corne frorn overseas. Sir Frederick Leith Ross, the chairman of
the cornrittee, which is being disbanded, now
bccornes tbe Deputy Chaîrman of the
European Comrnittee.
So far I have spoken onhy of the countries
of Europe. A tremendous problern will develop
also in tbe Far East. This bas not yet
received as rnuch consideration as the European probhern bas, but as Austrahia, New Zealand, India and other countries in that part of
the world are signatories of this agreernent, no
doubt they will give rnuch in the way of supplies to meet the requirernents of the peoples
of the East, especiahly those of China. We
know tbat wben the tirne arrives to corne to
the relief of tbat country the undertaking will
be a tre-mendous one.
The Bill itself is concise. It rnerehy states,
in clause 2, sub-chause (1) that:
The Governor in Council may make such
appointrnents, establish such ýoffices, make snch
Orders in Council, and do such things as appear
to him to be necessary for carrying ont the
agreement set out in the sohedule to this Act
or any resolutions of the Council of the United
Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or its committees in carrying out the
provisions of the agreernent.
And in sub-clause 2.
Any interim expenditures, flot exceeding ten
million dollars, incurred in carrying ont the
said agreement, ýmay be defrayed ont of rnoneys
provided under the W*ar Appropriation (United
Nations Mutual Aid) Acet, 1943. Ail other
expenditures ineurred in carrying out the said
agreernent shaîl be defrayed ont of moneys
providedby Parliament.
What we really bave ta consider here
to-night is the approval and voting of a surn
of 810,000,00 in order that Canada may be in
a position to carry out the prehirninary phases
of bier obligations under the agreemnent signed
in November of hast year.
I bave no reason and no0 desire to extend
rny rernarks. I arn ho-ping that other members
of this Chamber wilh speak to the Bill, as I
think the whohe question of the agreernent and
its obj ects is one that rnerits careful consideration by this Chamber.

Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I arn sure I amn speaking for al
honourable members of thîs Chamber when
I say that we are indebted to the bonourable
the leader of the Governrnent for placing
before us so much detailed information in
regard to, this subi ect.
I certainly have no objection to this hurnanitarian Bill. As the honourable the leader
opposite has pointed out, our first great
problem is to win the war by force of arms.
Our second responsibility will be to take care
of the hungry, the destitute and the sick
peoples of the nations hie has referred ta; and
we are looking forward to the time-I hope it
will be in the flot too distant future-when
they will be freed from the tyranny under
wbich they have been suffering for so, many
years.
It is quite right and proper that the
Dominion Governmenit should bring down such
a bull as this, and tbat Canada, as one of the
United Nations, should take a full and generous
share of the responsibility. I arn delighted
to hear frorn the honourable the leader,
although I had already read about it, that a
very able Canadian, Mr. Pearson, is going
to be in charge of the food administration.
Wbile I bave not met bim personally, I arn
familiar with bis record, which certainly is a
most creditable one. We are also fortunate
in having ex-Governor Lehmann filling the
very important post that the honourable leader
of the Government has referred to.
The expenditure that we are asked to
approve of just, now is one not exceeding
310,000,000, but I understand that as occupied
countries are relieved and this good work goes
on the Government will from tirne to tirne
bring before Parliament other votes, the total
of whicb will not exceed $90,000,000.
Hon. Mr. KING: That amount bas been
suggested, but 1 do flot think any one has set
a definite figure.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Rehabilitation
is a huge task, and a very necessary one. This
Bill will do more than anything else to, obtain
for us the good will and gratitude of the
peoples of the oýccupied countries as these are
relieved frorn tirne to time. 1 certainly
approve of this measure in every way.,
Hon. ATHANASE DAVID: Honourable
senators, it is very far from my mind to give a
lesson in French or in English, but I should like
to make sorne reference ta, the word "rehabilitation." In the past few years I have often
seen the word used in newspapers and magazines, and I had tbe curiosity to look up its
rneaning in French and Englisb dictionaries.

SENATE
I knew it was a French word. The English
terni, if you will permit me to say so, is derived
from the French. In both languages the term
is applied in connection with a reformed
prisoner, a bankrupt who lias paid his debts, or
a man who, having been slandered during his
life, lias his reputation re-esablied after his
death. I think that an additional definition
given in Harrap is " a reorganization plan."
In the French version of the Bill the word
"rétablissement" has been chosen, but I regret
to say that even that is not suitable in all
cases. "Rétablissement" means "re-establishment." It would apply where a man who was
formerly a farmer, say, was re-established in
that occupation. Well, in our armed forces
there are certainly many farmers and men in
other occupational groups who will want to
change their occupations when they return. I
would suggest that the word "réadaptation" be
substituted in French.
have net looked to
sec if that word is in the English dictionary,
but if it is there I think it should be substituted in the English version of the Bill as well.
I am sure that if French officers of any
idut-ation
are told thafl the Governeient of this
'o-entry intends to reheabilitate them. they wili
he surprised at the inpli-ation that in risking
thcir lives on the battlefield they committed a
crime.
Here is a definition which I have taken from
a dictionary:
Rehabilitate: To restore to a former condition or position; to re-establish the character
or reputation of. When a person lias been
wrongly punished and his innocence is proved.
those who have condemned him usually do their
best to rehabilitate him in the esteeni of his
fellows. He is also reiabilitated in his honours
if these have been taken away, and his
rehabilitation annuls al] records of his sentence
and supposed crime.
I will read a French definition, which is
much.worse than the English.
(Translation): Rehabilitate: to restore to a
former condition, rights, prerogatives, etc., one
wio liad been deprived of tlhem through a
judgmenit. To re-establish the good name of a
man ceonvicted by a court. Formerly, the expression to rehabilitate a narriage meant to
correct a defect in the marriage by a new
ceremony. Figuratively, to re-esta'blish in public
esteem or in the estcem iof a nerson. For exampli: "Tlat action has rehabilitated him in
publie opinion." To rehabilitate oneself (pronominal verb): to recover one's former condition: or, figuratively, to recover esteem, consideration, bonour.
I just wanted to state to honourable senators
my opinion that if the English word "rehabilitation" is derived from the French, as I believe
it is, it certainly would net apply in the case
of soldiers who wish, on their return from
overseas, to enter different occupations from
those in whiel they were engaged prior to
enlistment.
Hon.

Mr. DAVID.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would not the
definition "to restore to a former condition or
position" be the neaning under this Bill?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I doubt very much that
all the men returning froin the front will want
to be restored to their former positions. On
the contrary, I believe that many of these
young people will want to readapt themselves
to new occupations.
I hope honourable senators will accept my
rcmarks in the spirit in which they were
uttered. As I said at the outset, I have no
desire whatever to give a language lesson. My
knowledge of English is too poor for that.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Lambert, the debate
w-as adjourned.
OTTAWA AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 87, an Act to authorize an agreement
between His Majesty the King and the corporation of the City of Ottawa.
He said: Honourable senators, I shall make
just a brief statement on this Bill. A bill in
this form bas become a hardy annual, which
bas been before Parliament every year since
1930. On the occasion of moving the second
rcading of last year's Bill I endeavoured to
give a short history of the grant made to the
city of Ottawa. I indicated that in 1898 there
was a grant of $60,000; that in 1920 this was
increased to 875,000; and that in 1925 an agreement was made for five years, providing for
payment at the rate of $100,000 a year. That
agreement expired in 1930, and since then a
measure similar to the one now before us bas
been passed annually.
For some time past representations have
been made in the House of Commons and by
the municipal authorities of Ottawa that more
liberal consideration should be given to the
city, because no municipal taxes are paid on
the large amount of local property that the
federal Government bas acquired. When this
Bill was before the House of Commons recently, the Prime Minister indicated that he
personally had had correspondence and conversation with His Worship the Mayor of
Ottawa, who was desirous of having a study
made of the future evolution of the city.
In course of time Ottawa will naturally
become one of the world's great capitals. We
all know that the Prime Minister bas given
much thought and study to its beautification
and development as a national centre. I think
that bas been true of former Prime Ministers;
there bas been a disposition on the part of all

137

MAY 2,1944
of them, especially since 1891-prior ta that,
even-to favour the making of plans for the
future development of Ottawa.
The Prime Minister stated in another place
that he would ask a joint committee of the
Senate and House of Commons ta hear
evidence and consider representations of the
City of Ottawa with respect ta the annual
grant, and ta study and consider plans for aur
national capital. After this statement was
made, the Bill was passed without discussion
and sent over to the Senate. I now reeommend it to honourable members for their
consideration.

Portsmnouth. There being no fire brigade in
the village, the municipal authorities decided
ta build a small fire station at an. estimated
cost of 34,000. 1 approached the Minister of
Justice and asked for a grant of $2,000, because the fire station would be situated right
across the road from the peaitentiary; whereas
the Kineton fire station is two or three miles
distant. I received no encouragement whatever; in fact, I was týurned down flat. That
does flot worry me unduly, but in view of
wbat is now under consideration, I repeat,
we might at the same time look into the
position of other municipalities where there
are large federal buildings that pay no taxes.

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, it will be recalled that when
the Bill came before the House last session
the late Senator Côté and I had some discussion regarding the possibility of adjusting the
differences between the Dominion Government
and the City of Ottawa in relation ta this
annual grant of $100,000. Altbough this Bill
provides for the payment of the same amount
for another year. I rise ta express the hope
that when the joint committee suggested by
the Prime Minister is set up some adjuetment
will be made, for I think I am not exaggerating in the slightest degree when I say that
an adjustment is long overdue. I hope also
that the deliherations of the proposed oint
committee will lead ta the establishment of
an enlarged Federal District Commission, a
subj ect I mentioned last session when we were
discussing a similar bill. That possibility was
most encouragingly and hopefully set forth
by the Prime Minister when this Bill was
before the other House. I hope the committee will accomplisha somethîng, for I recaîl
that some years ago a commîttee set up ta
consider a scheme for the beautification of the
capital vanished, as it were, into thin air.
Plans were only partly initiated and then
abandoned because of the war. If the larger
scheme of a Federal District Commission is not
ta be undertake-n in the near future, I think
the taxpayers of the city of Ottawa should at
least be assured of same relief pending
development of the larger scheme.

Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators, we are ahl proud of the development
of the capital during the past few years. Much
has been dune by way of improvement, but
much more can be done. Inasmuch as Ottawa
is our national capital, it is only right and
proper that the beautification scheme should
he continued, and that this sumn of maney
should be voted. I cannot, however, find myself in agreement with the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Han. Mr. Lambert) when he
suggests that there should, be some adjustment, that is, I tnke it, some reduction of
taxation for the benefit of those who lîve in
this beautiful city. Sa far as I can make out,
they are fortunate indeed in this respect, for
their taxes are much lower than those levied
in the good city in which I live and in many
other cities. It may be said that that is a
debatable question, and certainly it can be
looked into by the proposed committee. I
cannot at the moment see what a joint cammittee of the Senate and House of Commons
could do, but other honourable members may
be able to enlighten me. At the present time
I believe any improvements are left entirely in
the hands of the Federal District Commission.

Hon. W. RUJPERT DAVIES: Honourable
2enators, I merely rise ta suggest that should
the proposed committee be set up it might
very welI consider the relationship between
the federal Government and aIl municipalitiesl
in which there are federal buildings. Many
muxiicipalities throughout the country get no
relief whatsoever in respect of such buildings.
For instance, what is known as the Kingston
penitentiary is situated in the little village of

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There may be
many advantages in the proposaI, but for the
moment I cannot see any. I am quite willing
ta leave the improvement of the capital in the
hands of the present Commission. It bas donc

further improvements. 1 have no objection to
the Bill.

The motion was agreed to.
AMMUNITION FOR GAME HUNTING
INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. W. M. ASELTINE rose in accordance
with the following notice:
lIon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

That lie will call the attention of the Senate
to the shortage of amnunition for hunting game
birds and animals and will inquire of the
ministry as to the possibility of releasing a
reasonable supply of amunition for that
purpose.
He said: Honourable senators, I wish te
preface my remarks by stating that although
I indulge in hunting gane, yet I am a
conservationist. I am a key man for "Ducks
tnlimited." and a menbor of several other
gane associations, and I spend a good deal of
iny time while at hsome in furthering measures
to conserve the wild life of Saskatchewan.
J mav state that the nuiber of migratory
and upland game birds and game animals shot
during the hunting season is small in proportion to the heavy losses of bird and
animal life in Western, Eastern and Northern
Canada caused 1 y forest and prairie fires,
drought, and other disasters. Every year more
game birds and gane animals are destroyed
by fire alone than by all the iunters of North
America. Marsh fires destroy nests, eggs and
y oung birds, and bush fires destroy deer,
moose and other game animals.
This is not a controversial subject, and I
hope honourable members will relax for a
lew moments while I mention some points
which I think are important to Canadian
hunters and sportsmen. I believe, too, that
what I have to say may be helpful wben we
are discussing rehabilitation.
Several gane associations, sportsmen and
hunters in Western Canada have asked me
to bring this matter to the attention of the
Senate, but my remarks are intended to apply
to the situation as it affects the whole of
Canada. I shall be able to touch on only a
few of its many angles, and I hope that other
honourable members will deal with those that
I do not cover.
There is a widespread opinion that the
release of a reasonable supply of different
kinds of small ammunition will not affect
the war effort. Were it otherwise I should
not bring the subject up at all.
Honourable senators are aware of the fact
that prior to 1943 there were no restrictions
at all in regard to ammunition; anyone could
secure all that he required; but in 1943 the
production of commercial ammunition was
only sufficient to meet a certain approved
demand-for the Eskimos and for the forces
in training who were learning to shoot, and
so on-and as a, consequence the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board stepped in and passed
Order No. 251 dealing with the whole question. At that time the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board declared that as soon as the
situation improved with regard to materials
:and labour the restrictions would be removed.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 1 like the attitude
that the president of the association takes witb
regard to the whole question, and 1 tbink it
would be interesting to put a paragraph or two
on record:
Last year representations wiere made ýby
Alberta and Saskatchew an at Ottaw a for release
of ammunition on the ground that thiere hlid
been a very heavy increýase in birds whielh
should hoeharvested. It carne befor e our board,
and we decided not to malte any representations,
although. we viewed withi apprehension the large
inerease in crows, etc., and other predators, anti
also feared that the heavy concentration of
ducks might be dangerons to the farmers anti
destroy their crops, if no shooting were done.
The board, however, decided that the Government hlaving taken the stand that any increase
ini amesunition would be injurions; te the -,%ai
effort, they refnsed to take any steps in this
connection.
This year we made representations ta the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, Mr'. Ross of
Montreal,
as regards the seriousness of
predatoe, and hie estimated 70 per cent of the
normal ammunition might bc available, and 1
believe they have in mind making a limited
distribution this fa]].
In view ef the tact that the younger mnen
are ail in the armed forcesq. the number et
liunters wi]l be matexially reduced. If 70 per
cent of normal ammunition wvi]l be available in
Canada this year, thon in view ot the sevore
gaseline shortage one would think it wouid be
possible for the Government te release ammnnition in the normal way, becanse we thinkz
they can be assured that thore won't be 70 pet,

a large number of people go ont on the opening
dýay, but after that cannot efford the gaselinie.
and there is little activity, and the shoot is very
munIs less than it w-as prier te gasoline being
rationed.
That was a very reasonable attitude for the
Manitoba Game and Fish Association te take
lest year; and I think that association is in
lino with others in bringing Up the matter
again at this time.
Perbaps honourable senators do net knew
that there is considerable bootlegging of
immunition in Canada at the present time.
You can buy shotgun shelîs from hoarders who
stocked up with shells of different kinds prier
te Ordor No. 350 coming into effent lest fail.
For a box of shelîs ordinarily priced at a
dollar, these people wiIl ask $5; and for rifle
sheils tbey ask enything fromn fifty cents te
one dollar each. Thet situation would probably be corrected if some release of ammunitien were made by the Wartime Pnices and
Trade Board. We should not have te pay five
timos the roguler price te people who guessed
rightly that there would be a shortege of
ammunition and are now acting as scalpers.
I think there should be some preference for
members of the Army, Navy and Air Force
when on beave. 1 was told yesterday by an
Air Force officer, who roturned to, Canada last

fall after three years of operational service
overseas, that menibers of the armed services
on leave in England who want te go te
Scotland for a holiday con get 200 rounds of
shotgun shelîs just for the asking, and enough
gasoline te last them on their trip. He said
that this privilege was very much appreciated.
But what did he find when ho came back to
Canada? After applying for a littie ammunitien, and having bis application turned down,
hoe found that he could get some by paying
$5 a box. But he was net allowed enough
gasoline te drive eut to the country, se he
could net use even the few shelîs ho had
obtained et such a high price. It seems te me
that even though there is ne lifting of restrictions on emmunition for the generel public,
sorne exception should ho mode for members
of the armed forces while in Canada on beave
frern overseas, in order that they might have
a little pleasant outdeor recreation.
I mentioned that there had been a large
mnereese in our game birds, mestly of the
migratory species. The latest issue of Rod and
Gun states that 10,000 mallards wintered in
Alberta, fed in the fields out there, and did
net go seuth et aIl. In 1937 Canada had
enly a few million wild fowl, mostly duck,
but the estimated number in 1943 wes 125
million.

1. Over $1,000,000 lias ibeen eontributed b5,
30,000 sportsmen and nature loyers of the
United States.
2. $750,000 hm .been spent in Canada building
dams, dykes, canals, ditches, ploughing fire
gards and cutting fire lanes, building teoces,
fghtiog fires, destroying predators, etc., etc.
3. To date 117 projects, have been constructed
ta safeguard wild life on well over 1,100,000
acres in the three prairie provinces.
4. The Dominion Government, the provinces

of Western Canada, many municipalities, private

corporations and individuals have made land
available at little or no cost.
5. More than 2,000 key men, farmers, ranchers,
trappers, air pilots, country business men,

school teachers, sportsmen and naturaliste work
in their opare time without compensation or pay
or expenses.

6. A three-reel eoloured niovie lias ýbeen pre.
pared, and each year this movie, ishowing different phases of 'bird life in Western Canada, i's
shown ta millions of people in bath countries.
No doulit several honourable senators have
seen this wonderful picture.
Lectures are given with the movie for the
purpose of making the people of t-he prairies
conscious of the necessity of conserving their
wild if e resources.
7. The work of this organization, co-.operating
as it does with aur American neighbours, has
tended ta the building up of a more friendly
feeling between Canadýians and Americans. The
result is that the two peoples are being drawn
more closely together.
8. The publicity that is ibeing gained is
abtracting ýmany thousande of touriats ta WesternCanada, Ontario and other provinces, or will
do so after victory lias been acbieved
9. As a result of the work being done by
Dueks Unlimited, the water fowl population in
the great Canadian nesting grounds of Western
and Northern Canada bau increased from
4,0 million in 1937 ta 125 million in 1943 .
I may mention that Ducks Unlimited should

ho, given credit for the following good results
obtained by virtue of their work, namely:

1. The muskrat population in the districts
wliere dams have been built and marshes reflooded lias increased ta an unbelîevable extent,
resulting

in thousandîs of

dollars worth

of

additional peIts.
2. Thousands of cattie are able ta use pasture lands that were useless until permanent
water provision was made.

1*41

3. Reservoirs have raised the water-table
under many thousands of acres, heiping farmers and ranchers, as weii as providmng moisture
for hay and many other crops.
Ail this lias been done at no cost whatever
to Canadian citizens, and I feel that I shouid
take this opportunity of bringing these facta
ta the attention of honourabie members.
Mr. T. C. Main, Gênerai Manager of Ducks,
Unlimited, was loaned by the Canadian
National Railways to the company for an
indefinite period. He was an engineer of
water service for the railway company.
Honourabie senators, 1 have endeavoured ta
cover ai the essential points in this matter,
and I hope that the Government, through the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, will see its
way clear to release te the generai public a
fair amount of ýammunition for the purpose of
hunting game birds and game animais in the
fall and winter months of the 1944-45 season.
Hon, W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourabie senators, I desire ta -compliment the honourable
member from West Central Saskatchewan
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) upon bringing this inquiry
teoaur attention, because it gives me an
opportunity of presenting a situation that
does not relate ta amail game. It has to do
with depredations by wild animais on live
stock in the ranching country of the footbis of Aiberta during the last year or two,
brought about iargeiy by shortage of ammunitien. Our ranchers have no rifle ammunitionnot the smali arms ammunition mentioned by
my honourabie friend-to enable'them to kiil
such predatory animaIs as grizzly bears, wolves
and coyotes, whieh are more numnerous to-day

than at any time in the recent history of ranching. In the foothuii country near Pincher Creek
a grizzly bear during the niglt did a great deal
of damage ta live stock. I know of another
case in the same general neighbourhood where
a wolf did very heavy damage. Out on the
prairies the coyete is more destructive than
ever hefore. I thin-k there is good reason for
making representations ta the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board to release sufficient, rifle

ammunition, se that ranchers and farmers may
check these depredations, brought about, s I
have said, by the shortage of ammunition.
A similar situation exista in the border state
of Montana. There the ranchers have raised

a large sumn of rnoney ta provide bounties for
getting rid of the coyotes which are destroying
sheep and cattle on the range. I agree with
the honourable senator from West Central
Saskatchewan that a iarger amount of smail
ammunition is availabie in the United States
than in Canada, but I think the ranchers and
farmers there are troubled just as we are
by a lack of rifle ammun-ition.

SENATE
Assuming that there is a shortage of ammunition, and that the supply should be controlled, it would appear to be better for the
appropriate department of government to
authorize the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
to issue permits. Members of this force are
located all over the Western Provinces, they
know local conditions, and if a farmer or
rancher applied for -a permit for ammunition
because of the menace of wild animals to his
livestock, they would be in a position to
decide whether or not it should be issued. In
this way the supply of the ammunition could
be regulated to ensure its getting into the
hands of those who need it for the protection
of their live stock. I have not discussed this
matter with my rancher friend from High
River (Hon. Mr. Riley), but I do know that
in Alberta there have been very heavy losses
of live stock owing to shortage of rifle ammunition. If something can be done to release
sufficient ammunition for the purpose I have
mentioned, it would effect the saving of much
live stock, to the monetary advantage of both
ranchers and farmers.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
members, the honourable senator from West
Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
has not presented an aspect of this matter
which. in my opinion, is of much greater
importance than what he dealt with; I mean
what happens when great flocks of duck come
down from the north and invade the stooked
grain of the farmer in Alberta. The birds are
heavy, weighing three or four pounds, and
they knock stooks down and scatter the grain
all over the field, practically ruining the farmer's crop. In the years prior to the war it was
the practice of the provincial Government to
give the farmer a shooting permit, even if the
season was not open. He notified his friends
in town that his fields were being overrun by
duck, and they came out and shot them up.
Wild animals are creatures of habit. If wild
duck coming down in thousands find they
can invade a field without danger of interruption, they will come there every day until
they have cleaned up all the grain; whereas
if they are well shot up they will not come
back, but will go somewhere else. Consequently we need shotgun ammunition for this
purpose; perhaps more will be needed next
fall than ever before.
So far as the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board is concerned, I think it has very little
information on the facts. The ordinary shotgun ammunition does not contain anything
of much use to the war effort, either in the
propellent, which is powder, or in the projecHon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

tile, which is shot. In the case of the large
predatory animals, such as bears, wolves, and
coyetes, you require a different type of
ammunition. It is conceivable that its production might affect the production of
ammunition for the war.
The propellent
charge in military ammunition is cordite,
whereas for small rifle shooting it is powder.
Consequently what is needed is a little more
knowledge and information on the part of
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board as to
the facts in the case. I submit that distribution of ammunition for protection of farmers'
fields in the fall of the year is much more
urgent and important than releasing ammunition to hunters generally, although they do
contribute their part in protecting farmers'
fields during the scason.
As to the suggestion by the honourable
gentleman
from
Lethbridge
(Hon. -Mr.
Buchanan), it must be remembered that the
Mounted Police operate in the provinces for
the enforcement of provincial law; and game
shooting is a provincial matter. Consequently
I gravely doubt whether they can operate
under any federal regulation which the Wartime Prices and Trade Board may pass. The
cure is to make ammunition available; then
the farners thenselves will look after the
protection of thîeir fields. As I have said, the
protection of the farmers' grain is of ontstanding

importance, and I think that some

steps should be taken to ensure a supply of
shotgun ammunition in order that the
farmers may organize their own defence,
whichi, given the opportunity, thcy will do.
The increase in game in the West is due
to a more ample supply of water than we
have liad in the past. Those in charge of
prairie rehabilitation have donc a great deal
in incrcasing the water supply, and this in
turn has led to an increase in game. It must
be borne in mind that so far as Ducks
Unlimited is concerned, it is principally an
Aierican organization. We breed the birds;
they shoot them. That is the long and short
of it. W/e breed the birds in this country
and Ducks Unlimited are interested in this,
and they have done a thoroughly good job.
But the work of the prairie rehabilitation
people lias donc more to increase the number
of wild duck than have the efforts of Ducks
Unlimited. We should not forget that our
own Government is doing very effective conservation work in providing water. If you
provide water you will have plenty of bird
life.
We are not so keen on having our
pheasants killed off; they are not grain-eating,
but inscct-eating birds. Our bag limit is five,
not fifteen.

MAY 3, 1944
I agree that the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board should take immediate action in this
matter, otherwise we shall have trouble, because farmers cannot scare birds away by
erecting scare-crows in their fields. The duck
have to be shot up well, and then they will
not come back again. You cannot scare
They destroy the
duck any other way.
farmer's grain crop after it has been harvested
in stooks.
We should be grateful to the honourable
gentleman for bringing this question to our
attention, for it is of sufficient importance
for firm action to be taken immediately.
Hon. J. H. KING: If there are no other
speakers, I should like to make a statement in
answer to the inquiry of the honourable senator
from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine). His discourse in regard to the
increase of game birds and the work that is
being done by Ducks Unlimited is most interesting. I rather agree with the honourable
senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach),
however, that the increase is probably not
entirely due to the privations our people have
suffered in the matter of ammunition, but that
natural causes have aided very much in bringing about the increase of the last two or three
years. We know from experience what has
taken place under international regulation with
respect to game birds and other wild life. We
have the example of the seal on the Pacifie
Coast, where, under international agreement, a
herd which was almost extinct was brought
back to practically normal numbers.
I referred the inquiry of my honourable
friend to the appropriate department of the
Government, and I have an answer, which I
think should appear in Hansard. It is as
follows:
The only interest which the Department of
Munitions and Supply has in the snpply of emall
arms ammunition -for civilian use lies in the
Department's control of the metals used in the
manufacture of this ammunition, and in having
first laim on facilities for the production of
ammunition for the use of the armed forces.
The only restriction orders governing the production of small arms ammunition for civilian
use, and governing its distribution, are those
of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.
With respect to the supply of metals for
manu'facturing purposes, arrangements were
made' at the beginning of January that blanket
authority be extended to the producer of
civilian small arms ammunition to take immediate advantage for civilian production of any
slackening in the Depa.rtment of Munitions and
Supply requirements. This blanket authority
was extended following arrangements with the
Metals Control for the release of the requisite
metals. It is, of course, subject to review at
any time, should the supply situation change,
but no shortage of the metals is anticipated at
the present time. The bIanket authority re-

ferred to above was a clearance given by the
Wartime Industries Control Board to .the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board; the actual
authorization to produce small arms ammunition for civilian requirements was then
extended in the same terms to the producer by
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board.
From this I would understand that the
metal required for the production of ammunition for civilian needs is now available, and
that manufacturers have been advised? that
they may make use of any slack time in filling
these needs. That being so, I think there
would be a sufficient supply of small arme
ammunition for the people of this country in
the coming seasen. Much, of course, will
depend on war requirements. As this matter
is of importance to those who engage in
shooting, I think they should have notice of
my honourable friend's inquiry and the result
of it, so that they may have full knowledge
of the situation.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Does that cover
rifle, ammunition, or only shotgun ammunition?
Hon. Mr. KING: I believe it covers rifle
ammunition as well.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: "Small arms" covers
the whole situation; but before the retailers
can sell the ammunition an amendment to
Order No. 350 will be necessary.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think that will be taken
care of. In any event, I shall see that further
inquiry is made with a view to meeting the
situation, if the prohibition still exists.

The Senate resumed from yesterday the

the second reading of Bill 84, an Act for carry-

SENATE
ing into effeet the agreement for United
Nations relief and rehabilitation administration
hetween Canada and certain other nations and
authorities.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honoui'able senators, those who have followed the
development of the proposais contained in
Bill 84, and who have been enlightened by the
recent discussion in the other Huse, cannot
find much difficulty, I believe, in supporting
this Bill. It passed almo'st unanimously in
the other Huse after a debate which was
characterized by several very commendable
speeches from both sid-es of the House, and
after a series of questions and answers ini

plane.
It is not my purpose, therefore,
in the course of the few remarks I have
to make on this Bill, to attempt te, review alI
the stcps which led up to the establishmnent of
UNRRA a few months ago, or to discuss the
provisions for its operation. I am sure that
ail honourable senators are pretty well informed on this subi ect aiready, and are
acquaintcid with the proposed work of the
international association which was set up in
Atlantic City hast November. It deserves our
earnest and sincere interest, mainly hecause
it is a vo-iuntary co-operative international
effort which, as was said in the other place,
represents the flrst step to be taken along the
patlî frum war tu peace.
Th(- agreement which is the hasis of this
Bihl, however. is only the paper set-up or
design of a mechanism-a human miechamismand its successful operation will depend
large1Y ipon. first, the whole-hearted support
whichi it receives from the peiopies and
goveroments of ail the nations which are
associated with it; and secondly, the actual
existence of sufficient fond and mnaterials to
meet the demands of the peopies who are to
be served in this cause.
Canada plaved an important part in the
w uneç of setting uip this organization last fal
at Atlantic City, where the conference of the
representat ives of 44 nations was held; and
Canada now has a furthcr important responsihiiity in heading up the Committee of Supplies whicha was formed at that tim-e-a
cominittee whiehi makes this country a central
factor in the whole scheme of rehabilitation
and rýlief. It should be pointed out that
while at first contributions of funds will ho
ncce,(ssary, occupied countnies which have
realizable assets in places of safety in the
United Nations will be expected to pay for
their share of the relief.
Thc question of the adequacy of world
supplies for the use of UNRRA was just
clighitly touched upon in the other bouse, but
Hon. Mr. KING.

it seems to me that in passing this Bill, which
after ail is only setting up a piece of
machinery, we should realize, and everybody
everywhere should realize, that the vital point
in connection with the whole undertaking wili
be the availability of supplies in sufficient
quantity to bring relief te, those peoples who
will very soon urgently require it.
The director-general of UNRRA in assessing the requirements must consiilt with such
inter-governmental authorities as the Coinbined Food Board, the Production and
Natural Resources Board and the Shipping
Board, on aIl of which Canada is represented.
UNRRA will receive its supplies of food and
materials through these boards. It was stated
during the discussion in the other House that
not yet bas Canada, nor presumably any other
of the supplving coixntries, received any demand or indication from UNRRA as to the
kind and quantity of supplies that will be
needed. Such lack of definite knowledge six
monthis after this international organization
was set up suggests a certain absence of efficiency in initiating the practical purpose of
relief abroad, and is probabiy due to delay

There can be no doubt whatsoever about
the present appailing need for food and supplies in the occupicd countries of Europe; and
nothing could be more certain than the extent
of the demnand that will confront Canada and
the United States as soon as hostilitieso cease.
In an article which appeared last October in
the Saturday Evening Post from the authoritative and talented pen of Mr. Hallet Abend,
Just before the formation of UNRRA at
Atlantic City, it was shown that at least ten

territories, are already

in the recovery of the health of the people.
The people of Europe and Asia, having
been told these things, naturally have high
exmectations of their being realized. We, along
with the other sigoatories to the agreement
hefore us, are m-aking solemn promises, which
are being taken at face value. Unless these

hunger, and a death t'oll from starvation which
would make the casualties of war a mere
bagatelle.
Referring to the proposed undertakings of
U-NRRA, in the article that I have mentioned,
Mr. Abend wrote:
Actually, the food situation in thie countryThat is, the United States.
-as welI as in other United Nations and the
important neutral countries wilI not permit the
fulfilment of these lavish promises.
Ex-Governor Lehmann of New York,
Director General of UNRRA, bas warned the
people of the United States that food rationing in that cou-ntry will continue for a year
or two after the war ends. And in Britain,
Mr. Bevin, Minister of Labour, said last fal
that price control and coupon rationing will
have to be maintained for four or five postwar years. A confidential report given to,
Secretary of Agriculture Wickard last summer
by representatives of baîf a dozen boards
concerned with food informed him. that only
by careful production and conservation could
the United States have food enough by the
end of 1944 to feed 40 million people in addition to its own population and its army
overseas. The United Nations Conference on
Food and Agriculture, held at Hot Springs,
Virginia, earlier in 1943, also issued a warning
against eventual world-wide famine conditions.
It may be seen from these statements that
a practical dhallen-ge to the good faitb and
organizing capacity of Allied democracy
throughout the world is represented by
UNRRA. Mucb could he said about the
lessons to be îearned from the Allied failure
to take adequate steps for giving relief to
Europe after the armistice in 1918, but I shah1
flot take time to go into that. now. Possibly
someone else may feel like referring to that
historie failure.
We must realize that in passing this Bill
we are solving notbing: we are simply helping to, create some international machinery
which, if it functions properly, imay do much
to secure a worthy measure of peace for the
world. For the people of Canada, it should
have a strong appeal, hecause it will mean, for
one thing, the continued use of ber great
agricultural resources in the cause of humainity. Our farmers, deprived of twenty-five per
ceint of their man-power in these war years,
have set up a phenomenal record in production. It is difficult to see how more ean be
donc than is being done now; yet we see our
colossal supplies of wheat, accumulated out
ùf the abundance of past years, rapidly
106-11

dwindling bef ore the increased demands of
the current crop year. In these days when the
shadow of drought seems again to threaten a
vast area of our farma lands, the consideration
of this Bill impresses upon us the serious
prospect of famine and pestilence following
in the track of war.
Hon. MT. CALDER: Could the honourable
gentleman tell us if UNRRA is operating in
southeru Italy, Sicily and, say, Tunisia?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: -My understanding
is th-at UNRRA is not operating there yet.
Undoubtedly UNRRA will meet with some
difficulty in taking over certain functions
fromn such an organization as WVFA-the Wartime Food Administration-which is directly
connected with the Army. It is no secret at
all that the work of the WFA through the
AMG administration in Sicily has been
criticized at Washington, simply beeause this
organization started to feed the people of
Sicily and occupied Italy on army rations, with
the characteristically lavish band that military establishments sometimes employ in such
cases, until a most effectual restraint was
imposed by another organization at Washington, which controls food supplies. I believe
that this and other difficulties of the kind are
being satisfactorily ironed. out. Within a certairf time-I tbink it is six montbs-after
retreat of the enemy from. or military occupation of an occupied country, UNRRA is
supposed to take over and administer relief
and rehabilitation measures, whicb include the
distribution not only of food and medical
supplies, but of agricultural implements to,
belp tbe people of the country to begin production of tbeir own food as soon as possible.
H-on. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, I think tbis is an appropriate time
to remove an impression that seems to exist
not only here, but in other parts of the
world,' tbat Canada bas a plentiful supply
of foodstuffs and will be able to assist without
difficulty in carrying out this relief measure.
I am very fearful that the wheat supply situation will be serious before this crop year is out.
The fact is that when the war is over we may
flot have a surplus of foodstuffs to help
European countries. I do not want to be an
alarmist -at this moment, for this montb or
next month there may be enough moisture to
bring on a gond crop in tbe western provinces.
Nevertheless, I want to say that during ahl
the years that I have been in Western Canada,
until now I bave not known a year when the
outlook at this season was so dark over sucb
a large aires. Last winter was the most open
winter that the West has had in aIl my
experience. Before the winter began there had
heen little rain, and tbrougbout the winter tbe

EMBIED EDITION

SENATE
snow-fall was light. So far, this spring also
has been unusually dry; we have not had
nearly enough rain to promote any considerable crop.
If that condition continues in Western
Canada, flot only will thera ha a very small
grain crop this yaar, but the shortaga of
pasture and water will nacessitate throwing
live stock on the market. These conditions
would precipitata a situation that would prevent Canada from supplying anything like
the quantity of foodstuffs wae are being counted
upon ta have available. The shortaga is likaly
to, bceaspeially acuta in grain, but seriaus also
in liva stock. The honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) quotad exGovernor Lehmann as saying that rationing
might have ta be continuad in the United
States for some time after tha war. I fear
there is good ground for that statement; and
I think we should anticipata that, if wae are to
carry out the provisions of this relief measure
and help meet the needs of distressed European countries, we may have ta continua
rationing in Canada also after the war.
I thought it well ta make this statament,
because many honourabla mambers may not
be familiar with axisting conditions in Western
Canada. I want ta repeat that in ail my
expcrience I nover knaw such a dark outlook
for the crop ycar as thora is in the West at
proýýent, at least in most of Alberta, and, I
should say, rnot of Saskatchewan.
H-on. CYRILLE VAILLAN-,,COURT (Translation): Honourable senatoýrs, aft.er the remarks which have alrcady bcen made, I do
not int.end ta repeat the historical account of
this matter; but as I had the privilege of
being attached ta the Canaclian delegation
which attended the conferenca held in Atlantic
City last Noývember, I fecil it my duty ta say
a faw wo*rds on this Bill.
The obect of the Bill is ta relieva tha
enslaved and famnished peoples of the United
Nations, ta hclp tham ra-cstablish themsalves,
and ta provide them with food and whatever
ciao they may need. It is not aur purpose ta
help the peoples who have subjugatad and
persecuted others, but ta aid the oppressed
nations.
It is estimated that during the first six
months of the invasion, fifty million tons of
supplies will have ta be providad ta the people
who during the past four years have been
trampled under foot by the anemy. It is hopad
that fifty par cent of those supplies will be
found in the countrias affacted. The remainder
will hava ta be exportad by the United
Nations. Canada's contribution will consist
mainly of wheat.

purchase of food, and aur farmers, while halping ta, relieva famishad peoplas, will derive

In Atlantic City I spoka ta several delagates

left me quite depressed. I still recaîl the

"In aur country sixty par cent of aIl childran

utmost to help their brethren in other countries, especially those who to-morrow will rise

The Bill which we are asked to pass is of
the greatest social significance. The democracies are sometimes called plutocracies; our
people are accused of trying to prosper at the
expense of others. Now, we will prove, not
only by our words but by our actions, that
we are Christian democracies, and wish to
behave as such; that we sympathize with the
afflicted and will help them to their feet so
that to-morrow they may once again stand
with us side by side. Our gesture is one of
co-operation, fraternity and Christian charity.
Furthermore, it constitutes not only an act of
deliverance of those whom we would aid, but
is a measure of protection on our own behalf.
In Atlantic City medical specialists told us:
"Our greatest fear is that when the war ends
an epidemic will break out. A disease germ
developing in an enfeebled constitution grows
stronger as the body weakens, and when its
virulence has increased a hundredfold, it can
strike a sound body, and consequently could
reach us." So, in helping the famished peoples
of Europe, who in the very near future will
be linked with us more intimately than ever
before, we are not only relieving their distress,
but are giving our charitable works public
character and are safeguarding ourselves.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

CANADIAN HISTORY-UNIFORM
TEXT-BOOK
MOTION

Hon. ATHANASE

DAVID:

Honourable

members, I should like, with the leave of

the Senate, to amend the motion now standing in my name on the Order Paper, and to
move it in the following form:
That this House, acknowledging the teaching

of history as one of the fundamentals of
patriotism in every country, and anxious to
develop a better and more understanding
Canadian patriotism expresses the wish that,
at the Interprovincial Conference to be held in

Ottawa, in the near future, the delegates representing the nine provinces of our Confedera-

tion may be pleased to appoint a committee
composed of the most impartial and competent
historians, as such recognized in each province,
with the mission of preparing a text-book of
Canadian history that could be accepted and
adopted by all provincial Governments in all
schools under their direct or indirect jurisdiction or control.
I believe I need not trespass on your time
at any great length in addressing myself to
this motion. Its inspiration is derived from
the sentiment which in the course of years
has developed in me as a result of visiting
the different provinces of Canada.
At this time, I think, when every country is
looking into the future, we in Canada should
try to solve what is one of the most serious
problems that face us. The source of greatness of every nation is education, and the
teaching of history is one of the most important elements of education. Tell me what the
teaching of Canada's history will be to-morrow

and I will tell you what the mentality of the
young Canadian generation will be.
Youth 'to-day, as after the last war, claims

the privilege of rebuilding and reconstruoting
the world. It listene very sceptically to
Utopian affirmations 'that to-morrow is the
dawn of a new world which will know the
solutions of all problems, and will apply them;
that there will be a complete and total change
in the mentality of both countries and individuals; that governments themselves will not
escape

this

drastic

new

orientation;

that

capital, although restrained, will be happy,
and labour, more free, will be satisfied; that
minority rights will be respected everywhere
and racial antagonism a thing of the past; that

quarrels between nations, the ambitions of

148

SENATE

peoples, and the desire of might will be done
with; that the State, accentuating its paternalism, will become the distribuitor of all gifts,
of all happincss, thereby satisfying the desires
and wishcs of the multitude-in a word, that
the days to come will see a golden age. Youth
applauds such a beautiful dream, but knows
it is only a drea.m that takes very little
account of human nature, which ýalways bas
remained the same and probably will never
change. Yet the young men of to-day hope
there can be found remedies for certain problems, the solution of which is necessary to the
intellectual and national progress of their
country.
Now, joining my thoughts with those of
young Canadians, may I say that if on
account of differences of language, religion and
national origin, the unity so often spoken of
in Canada is improbable, surely, if we have the
foresigh-t to scrutinize education, which is
ometimes bad and sometimes false, especially
in the domain of history-and this is one of
the most potent causes of lack of understanding between the two people who constitute the majority in this country-we eau
establish something which, though quite different from unity, is greatly to be desired, namely,
a beautiful and comprehensive fraternity.
It -is time, I think, for a complete change in
the teaching of this fundamental element of a
Canadian patriotin. The way in which it has
been taught in the past has created too, many
quarrels, too much friction and chauvinism. It
is not a question of falsifying history. History
is history; it is a search for truth-a narration
of facts and events arranged in chronological
order, and a statement of their causes and
effects. It is both the recorded and unrecorded
events of the life of an individual, a country
or a race. When the endeavour is to deduce
laws co-ordinating the march of events, then
it; becomes the philosophy of history. Who
would doubt or deny that to draw such conclusions from historical facts and teauch tieir
philosophical effects requires more than a
whimsical, fanciful or casual study of history?
Therefore, if we do not want the youth of this
country to have a distorted general view of
past history, the competency of the teachers
shourd be a sine qua non of thcir appointment.
It will rest with those responsible for educatien in ach province to ensure the accurate
teaching of history, devoid of aill chauvinism
and fanaticism.
The text-book to be placed in the hands of
bolti teacher and student should be such that
lt logical deductions of any impartial
reader would give Canadians, of whatever
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

origin, reason to be proud of the great events
that took place in this country during the past
four centuries.

I think honourable senators will also agree
with nie when I say that a false conclusion
drawn hy a teacher from the facts of history
and impressed upon the mind of a child may
create a prejudice that will take years and
years to eradicate.
It seens quite unnecessary for me to state
that the proposed text-book should not be a
panegyric of any goverrnment or political
leader, as was the American history recently
prepared and published by the Office of War
Information at Washington. That has created
a fuiore in the United States. The proposed
Canadiap text-book would be prepared by historians of all provinces, well learned in their
subject and known for their impartiality. This
safeguard would, 1 think, constitute sufficient
guarantee that the book would not and could
not become a medium of propaganda. Honourable senators will note the phraseology of
the motion: "with the mission of preparing a
text-book of Canadian history that could be
accepted and adopted by all provincial Governments." There would be no obligation on
any provincial Government to accept or
adopt such a text-book.
I fully realize that any one desirous of
finding fault with this motion will be able to
see in it features on whici to base criticisms;
but I an so deeply convinced that the proposed uniforni history would render good
service to C;anadians and to Canada that in
advance I relegate such criticisms to a place
among thosermade in the past with respect to

certain actions of men who to-day are
acknowledged as having rendered service to
their country. To serve Canada is my sole
desire, and I will continue in my endeavour to
serve ber as long as God gives me strength.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: In the month of February, 1943, in a splendid article entitled "A Suggestion for Peace," Miss Dorothy Thompson
said:
J think we ought to eml this war the way it
really beganv-with a book-bîurninîg. I think ail
the existing history text-books uîsed in all the
elementary

and high

schools

of

the

so-called

civilized world ouight to be destroy ed. and new
oees iade. I think we ought to begin makiig

thei riglit now....
I believe that as a preface
to a real and lasting peace we ou glt to create
a universal world history, so that youngsters

might learn approximately the sane account of
the life of nankind and the developmnent of
each of the national segments of mankinl,
whether they speak Fnglislh or Germai or
French or Italian or Russian.
This, I believe, applies to Canada. Is it not
truc of the cight provinces in which the
English language is predoninant that in gen-

MAY 4, 1944
eral there are, of course, notable exceptionsvery few children know much about the French
heroes of the heginning of the Canadian
,golony?
And why is that so? Because their
history text-books say very littie
about
Champlain, Lévis, Laval, Lallemant, Brébeuf,
Bienville, Closse, Jeanne
Mance, Talon,
Maisonneuve, Frontenac and many others who
lived here under the French regime.
Similarly, in our province of Quebec, do we
know enougb about the sacrifices and deeds of
the pioneers of the English race?
So littie, I
may say, that as late as 1941 it took an bistorian to reveal to us that at the beginning of
the Englisb regime, despite what we were told
in the schools, Governor Murray always acted
with great kindness and fairness towards the
Canadians of French deseent.
This leads me to say that if the school is
second only in importance'to the family as a
hotbcd of patriotism, the subject of instruction
that sbould first be completely Canadian in
the ýmost perfect sense of the word is history.
Would it not be possible, if we really desired
it-as I bave, for the past forty years-to
create in thjs country a Canadian mentality
common to descendants both of tbe English
and French races? And to that end could we
flot bave but one history of Canada in
Canadian sehools?
Without in the: least encroaching on the
autonomy of any province, I sbould like to sec
appointed a committee of bistorians, composed
of the most learned men in this field in the
nine provinces, with instructions to prepare a

manual of Canadian

hiStory

for use in every

provincial school. This, 1 know, could not be
doue witbout tbe consent of ail the provinces.
But I think I know enough of the desire of
those, arnong the learned and better class of
Caniadians of both races, who bave profoundly
at beart the spirit of f.raternity that I have
mentioned, to rest assiired that they would
agree to the projeet.
May I say, bonourabie members, that if this
were done it wouid be a happy day indeed for
this country. Tben the young boy of Quebec
would learn to respect his little brothers of
Ontario, the Maritimes, the Prairies, and
British Columbia, because hie would have read
of the heroism. bardships and sacrifices of their
ancestors; and this sentiment would be reciprocated by the cbildren of the other provinces,
who would know that Canadians of French
origin, wrested Canada from the Indians; that
in so doing many of them were siain; that
priests and missionaries suffered martyrdoma in
their zeal to assure the reign of Christ,- that
French-Canadians of Quebec twice saved this
c-ountry for the British Crown, and that al

tbrougb our history great men of that province
had at heart respect for tbe treaty which ceded
Canada to England.
From this common knowlcdge and mutual
respect would be born a union of good will and
energy entirely Canadian in purpose. This
would enhance the greatness and power of the
Dominion, which could not be assured, indeed
mig.t, be endangered, witbout, a better understanding between both sections of the majority
of our people and their united attachment and
devotion to Canada.
I hope I shall live to sec tbis fraternity
establisbed between those of English and of
French descent. In order to basten this very
desirable development, let us search our bearts
and souls, to find out what sincere patriotism
can s-wzgcst of îdealis'rn ap.d vçt of rcaIism. so
that our bopes may not remain merely a dream.
Let us encourage reciprocal respect and estcem
among Canadians. Let us be proud of being
citizens of Canada. Let us express our joy
because of living hem. Then wilCanada be
for ail of us our only mot.herland, and we sbail
bave the satisfaction of knowing thàt our
sehools bave attained what should and must
be their ultimate goal: the culture and education of better ànd more undenstanding Canadian citizens.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I rise to tbank the bonourable gentleman from Sorell (Hon. Mr. David) for the
eloquent manner in which hie bas submitted
this important motion for our consideration.
If I understand tbe honourable senator correctly, hie proposes the creation of a committee
of impartial and competent bistorians to prepare a history of Canada from the time of its,
discovery by Jacques Cartier. I agee with bim
that it is essentiai that our young boys and
girls should be afforded every opportunity of
becoming thoroughly informed about the bistory of tbeir glorious country, and I share bis
hopes that ail the provinces wiil agree on a
common text-book.
If sucb agreement is reacbed, I hope the
body of bistorians chosen will set forth
in the text-book the fullest historical information, province by province, witb respect to:
the heroic martyrdoma of the early missionaries
who gave their lives for Christianity; tbe
outstanding events in the lives of the noted
men tbat ruled Canada under both the French
and the British regime; the grcat merchant
adventurers wbo established our fur trade; and
those men ta wbose wisdom and courage we
owc our first transcontinental systemn of transportation-the Canadian Pacifie Railway. The
proposed text-book should also describe our
formn of government before Confederation,

SENATE
and our steady growth to Dominion status as
a member of the British Commonwealth of
Nations. I think this is particularly necessary
because-though it may be rather unkind on
my part to say so-many of our youth from
the Atlantic to the Pacifie coast are not at all
as familiar with the history of their country
as they should be.
I should like this proposed text-book to
make special reference to Canada's position
as the leading Dominion in the British
Commonwealth of Nations-or, if you prefer,
the British Empire. No matter what our
racial origin may be, we all are very proud of
Canada; we are Canadians first; but we are
also proud that Canada is a part of the British
Commonwealth of Nations. I hope the proposed history will relate how advantageous
our British connection bas been to us, and
how absolutely necessary it is that that connection should be continued without impairing
our autonomy in the slightest degree.
If all this can be embodied in the proposed
text-book, then we all shall have good reason
to thank the honourable gentleman for bringing this subject to our attention. If we are
to have a greater degree of unity in our love
for Canada and the Empire, it must be
founded on a uniform text-book of Canadian
history for use in our schools from one end
of the Dominion to the other. I an fully in
accord with the motion.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I wish to associate myself
briefly but most cordially witl the resolution
which the honourable senator from Sorel
(Hon. Mr. David) bas presented to us so
eloquently. To realize the objective he bas
so ably set forth, two essentials are necessary.
First of all, the provincial representatives who
assemble at the proposed conference to be
held in the near future must be actuated by
a common appreciation and understanding of
the truly Canadian aspiration reflected in this
resolution; and secondly, if that common denominator can be found and expressed in the
form of a committee to supervise such a task
as has been indicated, a great literary artist
with Canadian experience and sound judgment
will have to be fond to write our history as
it should be written.
To prosent the problem involved in our
honourable colleague's resolution in words
which seem to me most appropriate, I should
like to quote a brief extract from a little
book recently publisbed. which bas been
received with much attention throughout
Canada. The author, Dr. E. K. Brown, is a
brilliant young Canadian who, after serving
as a professor in two of our universities, is
now the head of the department of English
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

at Cornell University in the State of New
York. I quote from a critical essay which
he wrote, and which within the last few
weeks earoed the Governor General's annual
award for the most outstanding production
in the Canadian field of letters for the current
year. This is what it says:
Canada is not an integrated whole.
The
Maritime Provinces recall the days-only
seventy-five years in the past-when they were
separate ecolonies; Nova Scotia, for instance, bas
re-established its colonial flag, dating from the
eighteenth century, and flying now from the
Province louse at Halifax; French Canada is
a civilization apart; Ontario unconsciously
accepts itself as the norm of Canadian life; the
Prairie Provinces are steeped in their special
vivid Western past; and British Columbia bas a
strong sense of its pre-Confederation life and of
its continuing separate identity. Geography
confirms this influence of history. Ontario is
separated from the Maritime Provinces by the
solid enclave of Quebec; between the populous
southern part of Ontario and the prairies, the
Laurentian shield interposes another huge
barrier; and this barrier is no stronger, if
broader, than the Rocky Mountains create
between the prairies and the coastal province of
British Columbia. There is little doubt that
the Fathers of Confederation, or the majority of
the leaders among them. expeeted and planned
for a muuch more unified whole than bas so far
corne into being. In · ime of war the tendency
t
to self-aggrandizement on the part of the provinces is arrested, and even reversed; but tbere
is ground for fcaring that the return to peace
will start it into vigorous being once more.
Amnong muost Canadian s there is little eagerness
to explore the varieties of Canadian life. little

awareness how mnch variety exists, or what a
peril that variety is, in time of crisis. to national
unity.
In these graphie words Dr. Brown bas
shown conclusively, I think, that the development of this country up to the present time
definitely bas been based on the geographical
and physical divisions of the Dominion. If
an adequate Canadian history were being
written to-day, possibly it would have to
assume a composite form-a series of pictures or examples. There is an old classical
proverb which comes to my mind. If I
remember it correctiy, iL says that history is
philosophy derived froin examples. If that
be true, then the philosophy of Canadian
patriotism most certainly is the end to be
sought in the teaching of history throughout
the schools of this country, and for that
reason, honourable senators, I feel certain
that everybody in this Chamber most heartily
will wish godspeed to the project which bas
been presented by the honourable senator
from Sorel to-day.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE (Translation):
Honourable senators, you have just heard a
very eloquent speaker from the old province
of Quebec introduce, in the English la.nguage,
a most important resolution. It might now

161

MAY 4, 1044
interest you to listen to a speaker freim Ontario,
-the greatest Anglo-Saxon province of the Confederation, secanding that motion in French.
In fact, -this gesture, it seems te me, holds a
very 8pe.cial significance in these circumnstances,
since it complies spontaneously with the desire
of the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon.
Mr. David) to achieve a unanimous under-standing.
Moreover, in the past there have been instances similar to the one for which I amn
responsible to-day. For certain statesmen,
rejected by the4r own provinces. when seeking
election to the House of Gommons, found
in a neighbouring province the sympathetic
welcome which enabled .them -to sit in the
nsjtion's Parliament. You know, of course,
that I amn referring to La Fontaine and Baldwin. The illustrious La Fontaine, defeated in
his own province, sought to be elected in
Ontario; and, reversing the role, the Honourable Mr. Baldwin qualified in the county of
Rirnouski, I believe.
Such an incident in or political history
shows ýthat in spite of the difficulties entailed
by varjýous events, there is always enough
good will, on either hand, to find some coinmon ground of understanding symbolizing the
new spirit linking us together.
I should like to congratulate the honourable
senater from. Sorel tipon the extremely tactful
manner in which hie handled the matter introduced in the resolution. And it is with gratitude and deep-felt interest that I emphasize
the highly favourable support given bis remarks by the honourable leader lopposite
<Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) and also by my
Ontario colleague (Hon. Mr. Lambert). This
bids fair for the outcome cf the debate which
was initiated under such auspicious circumstances.
The turn of the debate might surprise some
people who expected a purely academic discussion. Perbaps an inference was drawn, in certain quarters, that as the Senate had ve.ry little
to do, it would resolve it.self into some sort
of literary academy, and that for this purpose
the figure selected for the inauguration of its
new functions. none oKther than the former
Provincial Secretary of Quebec. was a particularly happy choice, since hie is renowned
for bis moving eloquence and his polished
literary culture. Well. honourable senators,
such an inference is undounded. I arn amnong
those who believe in. the great importance of
this resolution introduced by the honourable
senator from Sorel, since nothing can do more
to direct the future of the country along
ideological and psychological channels than
the education given in our primary schools
to the generations of to-niorrow. Moreover,

that fact, even before it dawned on us, perhaps, was well understood by the powerful
leader of the Hitierian hordes, whom we are
now fighting, when hie decreed the use of hie
famed Mein Kampf in ahl the sehools of
That book soon hecame the
Germany.
Bible or new political catechism of the
Germanie empire, with the re.sults we are
experiencing to-day.
May 1 take this opportunity of mentioning
a simple fact that will prove the importance
and especially the desirability of the resolutien introduced by the honourable senator
from Sorel? Travelling one day between
Windsor and Ottawa, as I often do during
adjournmnents, I chanced to ineet a Canadian
officer hailing from Saskatchewan. H1e was a
sympathctic fellow-traveller, a delightful coinpanion with whom I soon struck up an
acquaintance, and hie readily told me his life
story. He was born in Scotland and had
lived in Saskatchewan seine twenty-odd years.
I asked him, since hie wore the insignia of the
Canadian soldier, if hie really considered himself a soldier of Canada. Hie answared : "Absolutely. Canada is now my country, and 1 amn
proud to defend hier overseas." "Very well,
my good friend," I replied, "but may I ask
if you know sornething of the genesi.s of the
country for which you are willing to shed
your hlood?" I quote his textual reply: "h
only thing I know about Canada, outside of
my own province of Saskatchewan, is that the
Governor General is the Earl of Athlone."
That was ail hie, a citizen and soldier of
Saskatchewan ready to give bis life for "bis"
adopted country, knew about Canada as a
whole. True, hie arrived in the Dominion too
late to learn about it in primary achool, but
during the twenty years lie spent among us
lie ought, I think, to have had some opportunity of becoming familiar with the history
of the country in whose service hae is fighting.
Honourable senators, such a fact, brouglit to
light by chance, justifies at once the resolution introduced by our honourable colleague.
I have no intention of speaking at length
on the motion this afternoon. I do not want
to deprive other colleagues from the riglit of
continuing the debate, but in view of the fact
that 1 t4ook the responsihility of rising when
I did, 1 believe it is n-ow my privilege to move
the adjournment of the debate. Therefore,
Iso move.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjo'urned.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. FARRIS moved the third reading
of Bill B, an Act respecting Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway and Navigation
Company, the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railway Company and Great Northern Railway
Company.
He said: Honour-able senators, when this
Bill was before committee I stated that I
would repeat in the Senate certain information
which was given to the conmittee. My reason
for doing so is tlat the Bill lias to go to 'the
other House, and a short statement to supplement what I said on second reading may bc of
use.
The object of the Bill is to simplify the corporate structures and holdings of the Great
Nortliern Railway Company and its subsidiary
corporations, by reducing the number of
auparate corporations, and thereby also to
avoid many complications that are caused by
the present set-up. This proposal is in line
with the gneral policy of the company. The
company has already, by purchase or liquidation, acquired the properties of all its railway
subsidiaries in the United States, and now
desires to complete ifs programme in this
respect by acquiring its Canadian railway
subsidiaries.
la support of this proposal, the company
submits the following statement of facts. 'Tlie
Canadian lines are already generally considered and referred to as "Great Northern."
The Great Northern Railway Company name
appears on ticket offices, stations, engines and
trains in Canada, as well as on letter-heads
and stationery used in Canada. Communications and official notices frem Government
departments, letters from shippers and the
public, and in some cases court documents
intended for the Canadian companies, are
often addressed to Great Northern Railway
Company. This results in considerable confusion; and in the case of official notices and
court papers it gives rise to legal questions.
lon. Mr. IIAIG.

The Canadian company lias no freight or
passenger equipment, no train or engine crews
of ifs own, and no separate officers of ifs own.
These are supplied by the Great Northern
Railway Company. So the proposal in this
Bill would require no change in the methods
of operation or employment, as far as the
public and labour are concerned.
The traclk mileage owned, operated or leased
by the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railways Company is 124-43 miles, all in British
Columbia. The mileage owned and operhted
by the Nelson and Fort Sheppard Railways
Company is 54-84 miles, and in addition the
company lias leased or acquired running rights
over 6.06 miles of Canadian Pacifie Railway
track.
The motion was agreed to. and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Honourable
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD:
senators, in closing this debate I have no
intention of revicwing at length the approval
and criticismn that the motion received fromn
both sides of the House. 1 may be permitted
to say that I greatly appreciate the support
it was given by honourable members who
look at the things to which it relates from
the same angle as I do, and, more particularly, the unreserved endorsation by my

should be rcfcrred, things have changed. It is
no secret that from every corner of this

ground that it might embarrass the Government.
Before considering this point, let us see what
the motion calîs for. It calîs for an investiga106 -12

tion to be conducted by this flouse, not so
much for the purpose of fostering employment
as of decentralizing employment and combating bureaucracy.
The motion is divided into two parts. The
first part, the preamble, invites honourable
members to prepare thcmselves for most
momentous pie ces of legislation, both remedial
and constructive, whicha this flouse may be
called upon to ponder before long; and the
second part suggests that the necessary

motion bas nothing racial, parochial or
sectarian about it. Its scope is national, with
a marked tendency te favour remote parts of
the country. But it invites honourable members to consider the problems of reconstruction
and employment in ternis of provinces. because
the provinces have, and for a great. many
reasons are bound to have, individualities,
modes of living, resources and nceds of their
own.
I may have to apologize for the wording of
the preamble, which caîls for honourable ruerbers to inform themselves in preparation for
legisîstive measures that will corne before the
Senate. I have confessed my personal need of
additional information, and in that respect I
have nothing to withdraw; but I feel that 1
wvas wrong in taking it for granted that my
sliortcomings were common to other honourable menibcrs.
It bas been said that in the other flouse,
and in the Senate as xvell, a great mass of
information bas been accumulated. 0f that I
amn not entirely ignorant. I have read everything that I have been able to lay my hands
on concerning the subjeet-matter of the motion.
I do not mean that I have read literally everything available-far fromn it-for in the matter
of national political economy I arn inclined
to value only what is clear, right to the point,
practical and custom-tailored for the person
for whom it is intended.
By the way, one of the most informative
briefs that have been filed with the flouse
of Commons Special Committee on Reconstruction and Re-establishment came fromn the
Premier of Saskatchewan. It is printed in
the proceedings of that committee for Wednesday, April 19, 1944. I should say that if the
whole ground had been covered in the samne
plain and practical manner, my motion would
have been worded differently--it would have
been redýuced to a warning against bureaucracy.

further information as to the possibility of

SENATE

which was given first reading in the other
House on April 17 this year. Clause 6 of the
Bill sets out the powers of the Minister in
these words:
The Minister, to enable him to perform the
duties imposed upon him by this Act, may:
(a) institute any inquiry deemed necessary by
him to obtain information respecting reconstruction plans, and for such purpose may, with the
approval of the Covernor in Council, appoint a
person to conduct any necessary inquiry and a
person so appointed shall have the authority of
a cominissioner appointed under Part I of the
Inquiries Act. and the provisions of the Inquiries
Act shall apply in respect of any such inquiry;
(b) require of any person in Canada a return
of information which the Minister may require
relating to reconstruction;
(c) ceonsult with representatives of primary
producers, industry, science and labour upon any
question connected with reconstruction;
(d) establish committees or boards and use
existing organizations and agencies to assist him
in carrying out the purposes of this Act;
(e) inaugurate conferences of representatives
of primary producers, industry, science and
labour as well as representatives of Dominion,
provincial and municipal authorities engaged or
likely to engage in any reconstruction plan.
Notwithstanding the mass of information
accumulated, it is evident that the scope of
the special inquiry which it has been found
necessary to empower the Minister to conduct
is by no means narrower than the one suggested in my motion submitted to honourable
members a month ago.
The wording of clause 6 in the very bill
creating the Department of Reconstruction is
so far the best reason I know of to justify
withdrawal of the motion on the ground of
embarrassment to the Government, although
the information secured by the Minister may
not be available to us when we are asked to
pass judgment on measures initiated by the
Department.
While on my feet I may as well reply to
some of the reasons which my esteemed colleague from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) brought
forward in a good-natured but direct appeal to
me to withdraw my motion. The honourable
senator possibly knew, or at all events now
knows through Bill 82, that the Government is
not satisfied with the information already on
record and does net consider that the questions
involved have been fully examined.
Besides that, a very important matter of
principle is involved in what the honourable
gentleman said as to the duty of the Senate
towards minorities and this being an inopportune time for intrusion by us into federalprovincial relations.
As to any such intrusion, I can hardly see
how the question is raised at all by the wording
of the motion. I thought I had made it amply
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD,

clear-not to speak of the ability of the Senate
to remove any ambiguity by a minor amendment-that my purpose at least was not to
disturb the present set-up of those relations,
but only to use in the fullest possible measure
provincial facilities for distributing employment to the four corners of each province. As
I sec it, to use provincial facilities is exactly
the opposite of seeking, by means of an
amendment to the British North America Act,
to turn provincial facilities into federal
facilities.
To my knowledge the Senate has made itself
well acquainted with various provincial problems-for instance, grain and coal questionswithout disturbing provincial rights. At first
sight it might appear that the mechanism of
any construction measure would disturb these
very rights if the federal Government sought
to invade permanently the provincial field
rather than take advantage of provincial
facilities.
The honourable senator from Winnipeg has.
quite properly, contended that the question of
minorities is invoived in the motion. But the
minority concerned is net a racial nor a
religious minority. It is not even the minority
of the smaller provinces only, but the minority
of the thinly populated areas-and these
happen to be in the larger provinces as well
as in the smaller-which has to he protected
through decentralization. The Senate is the
protector of every minority in this country.
For the purpose of executing its mandate, I
fail to sec why the Senate, as part of the
Parliament of Canada., could not, or should
not, take the initiative and give the warning,
even if minorities happen to be represented
in the other house.
If we dare net speak our minds on such
matters before full information is gathered
and the necessary measures are drafted, how
shall we, when those measures are presented
to us for our concurrence, have the courage
to reject them on the principle that they
appear to be inequitable to the minority in
remote districts or that they foster centralization?
My honourable colleague concluded his
remarks by suggesting that if the federalprovincial conference does not bring results,
or if the measures submitted by the Government are unsatisfactory, it will then be opportune for the Senate to take the lead and
force the Government and the Commons to
act. I am afraid the task will then be too
heavy and the time too late. Our opinions
as to what is a successful federal-provincial
conference may not agree, but that is another
question.

SENATE
THE LATE SENATORS POPE AND
B. F. SMITH

Hon. C. B. HOWARD: Honourable senators,
I rise to-night to pay tribute to the late
Honourable Senator Rufus H. Pope. Senator
Pope has been the Eastern Townships representative from Bedford district in this honourable House since 1911. By his passing ten days
ago the last connecting link between the
Eastern Townships and that great Canadian
statesmnan Sir John A. Macdonald has been
broken. Senator Pope knew Sir John intinately and was one of his personal friends
and supporters.

1896 and 1900. Again in 1904 and 1908, he
was a candidate, and in 1911 he was called
to the Senate. In politics he was a Conservative and an Imperialist; his outstanding service to Compton was in the role of "Greatest
Warrior" for his party. Always true to his
Imperialism and to the Conservative party,
he feared no one on the public platform and
was recognized as an outstanding orator of
his time.
The late Senator Pope lad thrce sons and a
daughter. The daughter, Ethel, has one son
serving in the Canadian Navy on convoy work
in the North Atlantic. Of the three sons,
Colin lias two sons who served with the
Canadian Army at Hong-Kong, and who are
now prisoners of war in the hands of the
Japanese. Henry bas a son in the Canadian
Army, now fighting in Italy, and the only
child of Ives, named Rufus for his grandfather, Senator Pope, gave his life in the
service of the Canadian Navy when the corvette Margaree was sunk on convoy duty in
the Bay of Biscay.
The passing of Senator Pope marks the end
of a definite epoch in the development of
that marvellous section of Canada, the Eastern
Townships of Quebee.

Senator Pope came from a distingushed
family, whose history is in great part identified
with that of the Eastern Townships. His
father, John Henry Pope, was Minister of
Agriculture prior to Confederation, and after
Confederation was Minister of Railways in
the cabinet of Sir John A. Macdonald. At
the time of Canada's first railway venture,
John Henry Pope went to England with the
then Premier, to secure funds for flie construction of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and
it is a well-known fact that it was due to
Pope's influence that English financiers invested their capital in what then seemed to
be a wild-cat gamble, but which since has
proven its great merit. To his long-range
vision, backed by his faith in the Eastern
Townships and his personal energy and ability,
is due the construction of the Megantic &
Kennebec Railway, now a part of the Canadian
Pacifie main line from Sherbrooke going East.
John Henry Pope had two children, a
daughter and a son. The daughter became the
wife of Hon. W. B. Ives, Secretary of State in
Sir John's cabinet, thereby causing a most
unusual coincidence, namely, that of a son-inlaw serving concurrently in the same cabinet
with his father-in-law. The son was the late
Senator
Rufus H. Pope,
our deceased
collcague.
The late Senator followed in his father's
footsteps, replacing him as member for
Compton in 1889, and being re-clected in 1891,

Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, after
associating myself entirely wvith the tribute
just paid te our late colleagoe Senator Pope,
it is my sad duty to say a word with respect
to the passing of my colleague from New
Brunswick, the late Senator Smith, whose
death followed within four days that of
Senator Pope.
Senator Smith was born at Jacksonville,
New Brunswick, in 1865. He was of United
Empire Loyalist stock, a son of Ceorge
Frederick Smith. Ic received bis early educatien in New Brunswick, at Collina school, and
later entered the field of business as a wholesale produce merchant, becoming President
and Direclor of B. F. Smith. Limited, and of
the St. John Valley Exchange.
The senator hiad a long and active public
life, first contesting Victoria-Carleton in 1903
for tihe Hou.se of Commons and the Legislalure. In al lie contestcd eleven elections,
botlh provincial and federal. and was succossful
in eiglht. He was Minister of Public Works
for New Brunswick in 1916 and 1917, and
provincial organizer for the Conservative party
in 1928. He was summoned to the Senate on
August 14, 1935.
Senator Smith was a man of kindly, simpathetic teimperment, and had many friends,
not only in his home province, but through.out
the Dominion. A few years ago he thought
he wouîld start in the lumbering business
again, in which he had been engaged in his

TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators, unfortunately, since the House took recess some
three weeks ago, two of our colleagues, Honourable Senator Pope and Honourable Senator
B. F. Smith, have passed from our midst. In
the absence of the leader of the House (Hon.
Mr. King) I am going to ask the honourable
member from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard),
a colleague of Senator Pope's in the Eastern
Townships, to make reference to his passing.

early days in New Brunswick. Hearing of a
good prospect in British Columbia, with charactcristic vigour and optimism he went to
that province and got under way a sizable
venture. Unfortunately a fire played havoc
with bis enterprise. The senatur returned to
the Eqýst, but during his brief residence in the
West made many good friends, who stil]
rernember him.
1 conclude by expressing on bohaîf of my
fellow-members of this Chamber our sincere
sympatby te the sons and dauýhter of
Sonator Pope, and te the widow and daugliter
of Senator Smith.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Henourable meinbers, I regret that the.leader on this side of
the House (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) is unavoidably absent, for hie knew both the departed senators much botter thýan I doý.
It is interesting to know, as was mentioned
by the honourable senator frein Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard), that Senator Pope was
the Iast remaining link with the Fathers of
Confederation.
I gather that hie was the
only man who sat in Parliament under every
Prime Minister except the Honourable Alexander Mackenzie-a truly unique record.
When 1 entered this Chamber Senator Pope
had passed his prime, and I did not know
hlma as well as some honourabie members did.
I have always regretted that hie dîd flot
see fit te, write bis memoirs, for even tbougb
we may neýt agree with men politically, their
memoirs are of great historical value. Sornetimes in bis room Senator Pope wouid teli
anecdotes -of years gene by, reiating incidents
in his association witb Sir John A. Macdonald
and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, two of the greatest
Prime Ministers this country ever had. His
recollections would have heen of very great
use te the historians of the future.
The life of Senator Pope ran beyond the
allotted. span. We know that he was a great
Canadian, and tbat hoe had a dauntless faith
in bis own country and wbat we caîl the
British Commonwealth of Nations, but wbicb
hie preferred to cail the British lEmpire.
I arn sure that I speak for every man on this
sido of the House when 1 say that botb
Senator Pope and Senator Smith rendered a
service te, Canada that has helped to make it
a great country. In this respect Senator Pope
made a very outstanding contribution. His
father wa»s one of the geniuses who belped te
finance the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and one
of the geniuses who helped te bind Canada
together. And the senator in a peculiar way
seemed te ho proud of our country, and te
have a strong faith that her future would
bea great one..

157

As te Senator Smith, I may say I had a love
for hum. He did a lot of tbings in the open
that I used te tbink I should like te do in
secret. I adrnired his outspokenness, bis
denunciation of things hoe did net believe in.
It may be more politic te soft-soap things
once in a while, but I rather envy the man
or weman wbo can say right eut what hoe or
she thinks. 1 presurne I was the last one te
speak te Frank in this Chamber. I was sitting
here as hoe was walking eut cf the Chamber
on the last day that hoe was present, and as hoe
passed by hoe said: "Good-bye, John. 1 may
nover be back." I went te sce him, and hoe
seemed te feel that hoe would nover again ho
able te corne bore. It was very sad.
Frank Smith made a great contribution te
our country. In bis earlier days hoe was a
strong political figbter, and I suppose hoe made
onemies as well as friends; but undoubtedly
hoe tee was inspired witb a great belief iii
Canada and its future,, and wanted te sec this
Dominion becorno one of the great nations cf
the worid. He was at one trne, active
in provincial politios, having been -a member
of the New Brunswick Legislature for many
years, a good part of the time as a mombor
of the Gevernment. Later on hoe was olecter!
te the Heuse cf Commons, and some nine
years ago was summoned te the Sonate. One
wishes that hoe could bave iived longer in the
detached position of an elder statesman, for
ho bad amply earned recognition by bis
country.
I arn sure I express the sentiments of ail
honourabie members on botb sides cf the
House when 1 say that theso sad events bring
us up short and make us think. Wo do net
know te wbom the cali wiil corne next. So
wben we feel a bot word slîpping eut, let us
bold it back. I admit tbat I mysoif arn one
of the worst offonders. Occasions sucb as this
also rernind us cf the wonderful mon and
women wbo tbrougb the years bave been
planning and working to. make our country
greater.
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAP AIS: Honourable
senators, wbile listening te my benourable

Henourable Rufus Pope, a werld ef mernories

the Honourable John Henry Pope. That
may hold very little moaning for certain
people of the present generation; my benourable colleague knows, bowever, iust as I do,,
what prestige surrounded that naine serne fiftyor sixty years age.
The Honourabie John Henry Pope was.

SENATE

of our great Canadian statesmen, the Honourable Sir Alexander T. Galt. Those whe are
slightly familiar with the political history of
the country know that during the period
immediately prior to the Act of Canadian
Confederation, that is during the union of the
Canadas, the Honourable Alexander T. Galt
stood out as one of the dominating figures of
our political life. Al through that period Mr.
Galt was the spokesman, the appointed representative-as Le was its very spirit-of the
Anglo-Protestant minority in the province of
Quebec.
After Confederation the interplay of circumstances caused Mr. Galt to transfer his
activities from one sphere to another, and he
ended by representing Canada in London.
And at that time, the Honourable John Henry
Pope-as my honourable friend is well aware
-became the appointed representative of the
Protestant minority in the Province of Quebec.
If I rose from a deep-felt sense of duty
towards the memory of our lamented colleague,
it was also, to a certain extent, because of
the train of recollections that tie words of
my honourable friend have evoked in me.
My colleagues will perhaps forgive me-old
people sometimes ramble a bit-if I recall a
personal incident.
The Ilonourable John
Henry Pope was a colleague of my own father
in the administration of Sir John Macdonald.
Both were sincere admirers and devoted
colleagues of that great Canadian statesman,
whom ail parties recognized, just as they did
Sir Wilfrid Laurier; those two outstanding
figures entirely dominated the history of
Canada.
Well, at the time I speak of, the father of
our lamented colleague and my own father
were colleagues in Sir John Macdonald's
cabinet, and both contributed to the building
of the Canadian structure. Who could have
told us, Rufus Pope a.nd myself, boys of about
the same age, that years later we, the sons of
these men, would one day meet again in this
honourable Chamber? I felt that this matter
might not be without interest for my colleagues
who, taking into consideration my age, will
forgive me for mentioning it. Having said
this, I wish to pay personal tribute to the
memory of the Honourable Rufus Pope.
Most of our colleagues, seeing him in the
course of our sessions laboriously enter this
House with impassive countenance and listless
eyes, would never have recognized the great
fighter, the valiant soldier, the gallant champion who for years led the struggles of the
Conservative party. He was a champion and
a soldier; he was an incomparable fighter who,
over a long period, carried with a firm hand
the Conservative standard which, in the EastHon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS.

ern Townships, was the prey of winds far less
favourable than those that prevail to-day.
Under a gruff exterior he was a man of fine
character. You know as well as I that his
rather rugged appearance hid a very noble
heart. He was a sincere and a devoted friend
and a political friend. He was certainly a
party man, and it would net become us te
conceal it.
This House still numbers party men whose
vigour bas been subdued by the flight of years,
but who remember the struggles of days gone
by. When I think of what I was at one time
and what I may become, I am inclined to
include myself as one of them. Thank heaven!
ail of us, in the atmosphere of this House,
have reached the stage where we make amends;
we utter our "mea culpa." There comes a
time in life, however, when we are no longer
young and dare net fight vigourously, but
when we can struggle for a cause. Perhaps we
do net spend enough energy on causes. Yes,
men are fighting ail over the world to-day, and
in the blood-stained provinces of Europe the
conflict goes on for a cause. That one overrides ail petty and peculiar disputes and
minimizes our party struggles. We can certainly throw ourselves heart and seul into this
great cause. My honourable colleague from
Wellington recalled, a while ago, that though
we shed our blood for a sacred cause we do
not shed it for political causes. There is none
the less a generous quality in the enthusiasm
of a man like Rufus Pope, who flung himself
into battle to defend bis point of view.
Honourable colleagues, I regret having allowed myself to be carried away by my feelings.
In recalling memories dear to me I thought I
would, after my own fashion, lay a wreath of
flowers on the grave of our departed colleague,
the flowers of memory, of regret and of the
deepest heart-felt sympathy for the members
of the family he has left behind.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY:
Honourable
members of the Senate, with ail that has
been said about our late colleagues I am fully
in accord. I must admit that I could not
understand the words spoken in French by
my honourable friend who immediately preceded me (fon. Sir Thomas Chapais), but I
have so high a regard for him ýthat I have no
hesitation in endorsing his remarks.
The late Senator Smith took an active part
in the business of the Senate for the last eight
or nine years. His many good qualities are
well known to ail of us. As was said by the
acting leader on this side (Hon. Hr. Haig), he
was willing to stand up for what he believed
was right. I always found him a kindly and
earnest man. I have a distinct recollection of

MAY 29, 1944
the very pleasant and cheerful greeting with
which he met me in the corridor the last time
I saw him. I left Ottawa the next day and it
was a shock to hear over the radio a few
days inter that he had passed on.
My principal reason f or rîsing at this time
is that I was more or less intimately associated
with the last Senator Pope for more than
forty years. The eloquent and kindly remarks
made by the honourable senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) have lef t me very
littie to say. I thank the honourable senator
for his kind references to my old friend. Senator Pope's interest in public life went back
many years. H1e was first elected to the House
of Commons in 1890-that is fifty-five years
ago, a long time. My first association with
him was in 1904, when we both were members
of the House of Commons. I may say that I
roomed with him for a time in the House of
Commons, as I did later for a time in the
Senate. Back in 1904 we lived at the samne
hotel, the old Grand Union-now a public
building-on Elgin street. If there was a
parliamentary restaurant at that time, it was
a very small affair. At the hotel there was a
long table, where eight or nine members met
for meals. Mr. Pope was the life of the party;
he was always cheerful, always had something
interesting to say, and in general helped to
make life pleasant.
One characteristie of bis that 1 remember
from these days was his fondness for the open
air. Hlis idea of spending a week-end was to
hire a horse or a teama and go for a drive
out in Canleton county or along the Gatineau
river. That was before the power development on the Gatineau, and the scenery along
the river was beautiful. I had the pleasure
of sharing many trips with him.
In those days members of the House of
Commons, except the leaders and two or three
others, did flot have private rmomns. Our
party, composed of seventy members-we
were in opposition at -the time-had one large
room, in which. there was a table about fortyfive feet long. After the addition was built
in 1906-07 private moins became much more
common. Perhaps this is a littie aside, but I
do net think the giving of mrnem te members,
either in the Senate or the House of 0Coimens, was an unrnixed blessing. It seeme to
me that the fellowship that resulted from the
meeting of seventy members in that large
room, where we spent most cf our time, had a
highly beneficial effect. We got to know one
another thoroughly, and a strong feeling of
comradeship developed; and et the same time
through those associations we came to learn
a greet deal about différent parts of the coun-

try. I personally have very pleasant recollections of the time we spent -together ini thaït
one large room.
Getting back a little more closely to Senator
Pope, I know that some people say his
language was characterized more by vigour
than by polish. When we hear that comment
we should rememnber ýthat Senator Pope really
belonged to, an earlier generation; to days
when, under the two-party system, political
v,îews were very strong. In eleotion campaigns
of those times there used to be joint meetings,
and if the opponents for office did net put up
a good show the electors felt they were mistreated, net being given a fair deal. Senator
Pope got his early political experience down
in the Eastern Townships, campaigning for his
father, who at that time was a cabinet minister, and cf course hie -adopted the methods
of the other campaign speakers. It would be
only reasoxiable if some of the characteristice
hie developed there remained with him throughout his life.
I do not think Senator Pope made any great
effort to get a large fortune together. H1e was
different from most people, in that hie preferred to give rather than to, receive. H1e got
mote pleasure eut cf doing gcod for his fellow
men than eut of .trying to accumulate wealth.
is home was an open bouse alike to neighbours and te people from distant parts,
whether friends or strangers. The high regard
in which hie was held by the then leader cf his
party was shown by the fact that when Mr.
R. L. Borden-afterwards Sir Robert Borden
--came to power, in 1911, the firet man whom
hie recemmended for a senatorship was Rufus
Pope.
A fellow member reminded me to-day of a
remark I made in this Chamber five or six
years ago, that Rufus Pope was a diamond in
the rough and made no effort te parade his
better qualities, in fact rather tried te o*bscure
themn. I thought at the time I was right in
my estimate of bis personality, and 1 still
think se. I had the privilege of being intimately acquainted with him, and I can assure
honourable members that he was kindly at
heart and a good-living man. I feel that in
the passing of Rufus Pope we have. lest a man
who. was one of the moet stniking characters
in the public if e of this country, vt least since
the early part of .this century.
I join with other senaters if extending
sympathy to the members of bis family.

SENATE

ately for the first time in 1896, when Sir
Charles Tupper, called back from England to
lead t-he Conservative party, addressed a meeting in the old Mechanics Institute at Saint
John.
I do not suppose that any member in this
Chamber or in the other ever fought so many
elections for his partv as did Franklin Smith.
He won and he lost, but alwavs lie met defeat
quite cheerfully. His first successful election
was for the New Brunswick Legislature in
1903, when he ran in Carleton county, where
he was born. There wore six candidates,
thirce Conservative and three Liberal, and
when the poll was counted the whole six were
within one bundred votes of each other. As
my friend frem Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Copp) bas stated, in March, 1908, Franklin
Smith was again a candidate for the provincial
Legislature and was again elected. That is
when J also became a meiber of the Legislature. In the following fall a federal general
election took place and Franklin Smith
resigned his provincial seat and ran for
Carleton county, but was defeated. In what
is now known as the reciprocity election of
1911 Franklin Smith was again a candidate for
the Conservative party, his opponent being
the late Hon. F. B. Carvell. As many bonourable members will recall, it was a very keen
campaign from one end of Canada to the
other, but particularly so in Carleton county.
Mr. Carvell was declared elected by a majority
of eleven. Many thought that Franklin Smith
was clected, for the returning officer, having
declared Carvell elected, next day took flight
to the United States, and never returned.
Some Hon SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: He believed in reciprocity.
Hon. Mr. JONES: At a by-election in 1915
Franklin Smith was again elected in his own
county as a member of the provincial Legislature. In the following year he was appointed
Minister of Public Works and was re-elected.
In the general election of 1917 he was again
successful, but his party was defeated. In the
general election three years later he was
defeated by a United Farmers candidate. At
that time the United Farmers party was quite
strong all over Canada, and especially in some
of the farming districts in New Brunswick,
although it never attained power in that
province. In the federal general election of
1921 he was again defeated by a United
Farmers candidate. In 1928 he was appointed
provincial organizer of the Conservative party
and visited every constituency. In the federal
general election two years later he was
Hon.

Mr. JONES-

returned to the House of Commons. As
honourable members are aware, he was
appointed to the Senate in 1935.
Franklin Smith was a good business
man. Early in life he opened a grocery business at Saint John. In 1S95 he decided to
go back to his old constituency, and engaged
in business at East Florenceville, where he
continued to reside. At one time ho was
carrying on one of the largest and most profitable businesses in the valley of Saint John, a
fine fertile country. The farmers in Carleton
county are large growers of potatoes, and
have their ups and downs. Some years they
have barrels of money; other years they are
obliged to give notes and other securities for
fertilizer and seed. Franklin Smith held a
large number of promissory notes when hard
times struck the potato farmers. One day he
made a bonfire of more than $40,000 worth of
their securities, and advised all those indebted
to him to forget their indebtedness and try
te make good from then on.
Franklin Smith also engaged in the lumber
business in New Brunswick and, as bas been
stated, he went ont
est, whr-e lie was very
successful in a similar enterprise, until burned
out. To my knowledge Franklin Smith was a
wealthy man on thrce or four occastions, but
he was a great plunger, especially in the potato
business. At one time he was reputed to be
the largest grower- and shipper of potatoes in
the Maritime Provinces.
Net only did Franklin Smith find time to
look after bis business affairs and run elections,
but he was also an active supporter of the
church of his fathers, the Baptist Church. He
contributed liberally to its support and took an
active part at general conferences.
I deeply regret the passing of Franklin
Smith. I knew that for the last couple of years
he had been in failing health, but his mind was
clear, and little did I think three weeks ago
that to-day we should be called on to mourn
his loss. I extend my sincere sympathy to his
wife and daughter.
Much bas been said in commendation of the
late Senator Rufus Pope. I had the pleasure
of knowing him for more than forty years. In
the general election of 1904 he came down to
the constituency that I had the honour later on
to represent, and spoke most effectively. He
was certainly a great campaigner and a forceful
speaker. Senator Pope's family hold a very
distinguished record in the Eastern Townships.
I join in the expressions of sympathy to his
relatives.

CANADIAN HISTORY-UNIFORM TEXTBOOK
DEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May 4,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. David:
That this House, acknowledging the teaching
of history as one of the fundamentals of
patriotism in every country, and anxious to
develop a better and more understanding
Canadian patriotism, expresses the wish that,
at the Interprovincial Conference to be held in
Ottawa, in the near future, the ýdelegates representing the nine provinces of our Confederation may be pleased to appoint a committee
eomposed of the most impartial and competent
historians as such'recognized in each province,
with the mission of preparing a text-book of
Canadian history that could be accepted and
adopted by all provincial Governments in all

schools under their direct or indirect jurisdiction or control.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
senators, I need not repeat what I said when I
adjourned the debate on the motion proposed
by my honourable friend from Sorel (Hon. Mr.
David). Perhaps, however, I sbould add a
word of sympathy to the congratulations I
addressed to him on that occasion, for it so
happens that the opportuneness of his motion
has since been challenged in a full-dress debate
on this issue in the Legislative Assembly of
Quebec. Replying to strongly voiced disapproval by the leader of the Opposition of
adoption of a uniform text-book of Canadian
history for use throughout the whole Dominion,
the Provincial Secretary, Hon. Hector Perrier
-who, ex-officio, heads the Conseil de l'Instruction publique in Quebec-took the same
stand as we do, and I compliment him also on
that score.
Perhaps I should say also that, at least so
far as I am aware, the motion which we are
now discussing failed to evoke in the daily

press of Canada at large the echo, which,
because of its paramount importance, one
would have expected. This is a matter of
regret. The weekly press, mainly the French
weekly press, commented upon it much more
generously, although, as a whole, not in
favourable terms. This is regrettable, because
there is nothing in the motion which justifies
apprehension on the part of the French
minority, or in any way threatens their rights
or challenges provincial autonomy, provided
the plan is carried out in a fair, impartial and
intelligent manner.
Let us, in order to refresh our memory,
look over the motion again. This is how it
reads:

That this House, acknowledging the teaching
of history as one of the fundamentals of
patriotism in every country, and anxious to
develop a better and more understanding
Canadian patriotism, expresses -the wish that
at the Interprovincial Conference to be held
in Ottawa, in the near future, the delegates representing the nine Provinces of o.ur Confedera-

'tion may be pleased to appoint a Committee
composed of the moet impartial and competent
historians as such recognized in eaeh Province.
with the mission of preparing a text-book of
Canadian history that could be accepted and
adopted by all provincial governments in all
schools under their direct or indirect jurisdiction or control.
I fail to find in that motion anything of a
provocative nature, or anything that should
either directly or indirectly arouse suspicion
or jeopardize the prestige of anybody. The
motion is purely and simply a respectful
recommendation by this Chamber to the
respective provincial governments, that they,
by collective action, do away with a method
of teaching history which so far has been in
no small measure one of the causes of the
general misunderstanding from which our
young and fast-growing nation has been suffering. The initiation of any step of the kind
suggested by the motion of my honourable
friend from Sorel is a splendid attempt te
remedy a situation which never should have
existed; in other words, it would lead to a
greater measure of national unity if, as the
honourable senator himself so aptly said, it is
properly carried out.
Following the kind suggestion of one of my
honourable colleagues, since we last adjourned
I have communicated with the Ministers of
Education in all the provinces of Canada. AIL
but two have favoured me with prompt and
courteous replies, sending me, as requested, the
text-books on Canadian history at present in
use in the primary schools of their respective
provinces. It is these books that I have before
me on my desk at this moment. My purpose
in asking for these volumes was to compare,
for the information of this House, certain
excerpts relating to the same historical events.
When I have done that I shall let my hearers
draw their own conclusion.
Before I do that, however, may I quote the
letter I received from the Prime Minister and
Minister of Education of my own province of
Ontario. It is dated May 13, and reads as
follows:
Dear Dr. Lacasse:
I am having mailed to you to-day the two
text-4books which are authorized in the elementary schools of Ontario for the teaching of
Canadian history. They are "A First Book of
Canadian History" by W. Stewart Wallace, and

"Reader
author.

in Canadian

Civies," by the

same

162

SENATE

I will be greatly interested to hear what
further developments take place in regard to
the discussion of this extremely important
subject.
Yours sincerely,
George Drew,
Prime Minister and Minister of
Education of Ontario.
Mr. Drew is not the only Minister from
whom I received a letter stating emphatically
that this question is of paramount importance,
irrespective of what some sections of the
Press may think.
Now let us corne to a few of the quotations
which J promised a moment ago. Here is a
table showing how the teaching of history
stands in at least six of the provinces of
Canada, taken more or less et randem, and
giving the narnes of the text-books used, their
authors, etc.
Nova Scotia-"The Story of Britain and
Canada," by Gilbert Patterson.
To tell the truth, and without wishing te hurt
the feelings of anybody, after having perused
the book I wondered why the title included
the words "and Canada." This volume contains 228 pages, on three of which-104, 106
and 10S-there are passages referring te the
French regime. I think that without imposing
upon the House I may read them. On page
104 there are five lines:
Henry VII of England sent John Cabot, in
1497, to explore the coa'st of North America,
and the French sent Jacques Cartier to the St.
Lawrence River in 1534, but outside the fisheries
there was no trade or settlement as a result.
Two pages farther on I find the following:
Champlain and other Frenchmen explored the
St. Lawrence, and it began to dawn on men's
rninds that this new northern continent night
be well worth possessing for its fur trade alone.
Colonies were begun, the French aloug the St.
Lawrence and the Dutch along the Hudson,
while the English settled the rest of the coast,
between the Atlantie and the Alleghanies.
Under courageous explorers such as LaSalle,
the French followed on down the Mississippi,
and laid claim to the whole 'river valley. Soon
a valuable fur trade developed in 'that region.
Then I turn te page 108, where there is a
little bit more. I shall not quote it all. Here
is what if says:

The Hudson's Bay Company had been founded
in 1670 for fur trading purposes in the lands
north of the French colony on the St.
Lawrenceand se on, for half a page. That is Exhibit
No. 1, as my learned friends at the Bar
would say.
The text-book used in the province of
Alberta is called "Our Country and its People."
It is by McDougall and Paterson, and consists of 235 pages. In it there is one passage
on page 57, and three pages-75, 76 and 77devoted te the French regime. I do not think
I need te read them.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

In Manitoba and Prince Edward Island the
book used is "The Story of Canada," by
Wrong, Martin and Sage. This is a book of
377 pages, of which 70-pages 13 te 82-are
devoted te the French regime, and 307 to the
English regime.
In British Columbia they use "The Romance
of Canada," by Professer A. L. Burt. This
book consists of 372 pages, of which 120-17 te
133-cover the French regime, and 250 the
English regime.
In Quebec the book used is "Histoire du
Canada," par les Freres des Ecoles Chrétiennes.
This is a book of 103 pages, in the form of
an historical catechisn.
In it 87 pages are
devoted to the French regime, and 11 te the
English regime.
Now, honourable senators. I ask you te draw
your own conclusions. I think you will grant
that the honourable senator from Sorel was
right when ho said that the method of teaching
Canadian history in Canada is wrong and
very mnuch ont of balance. Although the
figures just quoted are fairly accurate, I do not
think they show the exact and complete picture, because one must take into account the
varions systems of education in the different
provinces. But they do lead inevitably te the
conclusion that the teaching of history in
Canada to-day calls for more fairness and
more uniformity in more than one respect.
After all, what is history, if it is not an honest
record of past events for the information of
the generations of tomorrow, irrespective of
the personal whims and fancies of the historian
himself, and unaffected by transitory passions
which might influence readers as well as
authors?
There is just one passion which
should be tolerated in a historian-indeed it
is indispensable-a passion for truth.
A lot more could be said on this important
subject, but I leave it te others, as I do not
intend te take any more of the time of the
House this evening. May I be permitted,
however, to conclude my remarks with the
following invocation:
O Canada, O Beloved Fatherland, Thou art
a young country amongst the old and warscarred nations of the earth. As a political
unit, Thou art barely seventy-five years old,
although Thy glorious traditions as a civilized
land go back a great deal farther than 1867.
It was in the year 1534 that Thou received
Christian life from the hands of the humble
but daring explorer of Brittany, Jacques
Cartier, when he devoutly planted the Cross
on the rugged promontory of Gaspe. Many
changes have occurred during these iast four
hundred years. The flag of the first discoverers
went back te the shores whence it had come,
and the victorious standards of the Kings of

183

MAY 29, 1944
England replaced the fleur-de-lis on the citadel
of Quebec. And since the fateful year of 1759
-when Montcalm and Wolfe were buried in
common glory-Thou. suffered many a time
from the growing pains of a fast developing
country, always bravely forging ahead and
seeking Thy way thri>ugh the varjous forms of
government that were gradually to lead Thee
to beautiful nationhood. That legitimate goal
was about to be achieved when the bloodiest
war that ever tortured the world entangled
Thee in its vicious muares. Wilt Thou escape
from that new threat? 0f course Thou wilt.
Wilt Tho.u live through these new tribulations? 0f course Thou wilt. Wilt Thou
emerge from the present ordeal more confident than ever in the great future which ie
in store for Thee? 0f course Thou wilt.
O Canada, I believe in Thee, because 1 know
that eventually ail Thy gallant sons and heroic
daughters will generously sacrifice their petty
rivalries on the sacred altar of Thy sublime
destiny 1

THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Honourable senators,
I move adjournment of the debate.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON.- May 1 ask
the hônourable senator from Essex (Hon. Mr.
La-casse) a question? In the Ontario textbook, has he read the paragrapha on the
Senate?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I was not aware that
the Senate wa-s the subject dîscussed there;
I thought it was Canadian history at large.
It happene that I did flot bring the Ontario
text-book, although I should have made it a
point to have the book here if I had known
there would be a question about it. The book
was lost in transit, that je ail. My honourable
friend from Rockeliffe (Hon. Mrs. Wilson)
perbaps did not expeet that her question might
invite a second speech. I may tell her that
I discovered, in one of the .text-books, probably
the one used in Ontario, that the episode of
Dollard des Ormeaux was deait with in one
line and a 'heif. Yet that hero was great
enough to be used as a s$ýmbo1 in the FourtbVictory Loan campaigu, and haie motto
"Jusqu'au bout," was the officiai slogan. Moreover, many honourable senators must have
seen in the newspapers some time ago, as I
did, a fine adve'rtisement published by Penman's Limited, of Paris, Ontario, displaying a
tail figure of Dollard des Ormeaux. So that
great hero has become a symbol of veneration in commerce also. Yet, I repeat, he was
not thought deserving of more than a une
and a haif in a Canadian text-book.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Davies, the debate

of the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills on Bill T3, an Act respecting the
General Missionary Society of the German
Baptist Churches of North America, and to
change its name to the North American Baptist
General Missionary Society.
He said: Honourable senators, this Bull
relates to a missionary society which was
incorporated in 1922 by an Act of Parliament
entitled an Act respecting the General Mis
sionary Society of the German Baptiet
Churches of North America. The Bill has juet
one abject, to change the name of the society

SENATE

The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, when shall this Bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I understand that we
have resumed the practice of setting down
third readings of private bills for the next
sittiog of the House after the report from
a committee. Unless there is reason to the
contrary, in special cases, I think it is a good
practice.
Hon. Mr. KING: Right.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 3
SECOND READING
Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 111, an Act for granting to His Majesty
certain sums of money for the public service
of the financial year ending the 31st March,
1945.
He said: Honourable senators, this is another
interim supply bill, similar in form and in
amount to one we passed at the end of March.
Its purpose is to grant to the Government onesixth of the main appropriation for the fiscal
year 1944-45. The amount, $46,331,283.90, is
required to meet the ordinary expenditures of
the Government for the next two months.
May I digress for a moment? At the time
of our last adjournment we had hoped to
have the War Appropriation Bill before us
to-day, but unfortunately there have been
delays and the Bill is still under consideration
in the other House. The Minister of Finance
is hopeful that it may be sent over to us on
Thursday of this week. Should there be
further delay, it may be necessary to ask
honourable senators to remain until Friday, in
order that we may deal with this very important measure.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, as is
usual, we on this side reserve the right to discuss the whole Appropriation Bill at a later
stage. With this understanding we have no
objection to the motion.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

That the Senate do unite with the House of

HISTORY-UNIFORM

DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed fromn yesterday the
adjour.ned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
David:
That this House, acknowledging the teaching
of history as oue of the fundamentals of
patriotisni in every country, and anxious to
develop a better and more underatanding
Canadian patriotiam, expresses the wish that
at the Interprovincial Couference to be held in
Ottawa, in 'the near future, the delegates representing the nine provinces of our Confederation
may be pleased to appoint -a commi'ttee composed

as such recognized in each prvnc, witýh the
mission of preparing a text-bok of Canadian
bistory that could be accepted and ýadopted by
ail provincial goveruments in ail sehools under
their direct or indirect jurisdiction or control.
Hon, W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, when I heard the motion read by the
honourable gentleman from Sorel (Hon. Mr.
David) proposing a new Canadian history to
be used in the schools of our provinces, I
must confess that I instinrtiveIy feit opposed to
the idea. My snap judgment, I must say, was
that it would not be in the best interests of
this Dominion. I do not like "made to order"
histories, and I was afraid that if the suggestion of the honourable senator from Sorel
were carried out, we sh.ould have a history of
Canada whi'ch w ould be an innocuous sort of
thing written to please everybody. I wondered what sort of history Lord Macaulay
would have written and what sort of a history
of th.e English people John Richard Green
would have written if ea-ch of themn had been
writing his history to, please various groups
and sections. I am afraid that powerful interests in England would have prevented John
Richard Green from telling us how some of

165

the great aristocratie families laid the foundýations of their vast fortunes by plundaring the
monasteries during the reign of Henry VIII.
I arn afraid, too, that if Lord Macaulay had
been writing to please someone eise except
himself hie might not have been so explicit
with regard to the, doubtful ancestry of so4me
of the great English families. No doubt there
are people who will contend that the histories
would flot hava suflered if these things had
been left out. I do not agree with that viewpoint, however. I like history to ha written
in the samne way that -Oliver Cromwell wanted
his picture painted, warts and all.
However, after having listened to the
honourable senator from. Sorel, with whose
reputation as an educationist I am familiar,
I felt that this was a problemn to which the
Senate might weIl give some time and thought;
s0 I determined te look into it and try te,
find out just what the position is in our
various provinces to-day. I followed somewhat the samie course as did the honourable
senator from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse). I did
not, however, write to the Ministers of Education. Instead, I wrote to newspaper friands in
every province with the exception of Ontario,
in which province I dealt directly with teachers
and educationists. I sent along with my letter
a copy of the honourable senator's motion and
1 asked five questions. As the honourable
senator did not indicate in his motion whether
he was dealing with public school histories or
high school histories, I decided to get information about' both. I asked in eff ect the
following questions:
1. WilI you ha good enough to get for me
from a rehiable aducational authority in your
province the name and the author of the

SENATE

the French Canadian early settement and the
subsequent development of the province of
Quebec?
I received wonderful co-operation, both from
my newspaper friends and the authorities whom
they consulted, and I should like to give to
this honourable body as briefly as I can the
result of my investigations. In doing so it is
possible that I shall cover briefly some of the
ground so eloquently covered by the honourable senator from Essex last night; but in
some instances my figures may not agree with
his. I am sure you will be as much surprised
as I was at the variety of history books used
in this country and the different treatment
given in the various provinces to important
matters in the history of Canada.
I will start at the far East, with the province
of Prince Edward Island. I was told that the
official history books used in that province are:
"The Story of our People," by Gilbert Patterson; "The English People," by Jones; "The
Story of Canada," by Wrong, Martin and
Sage; "The History of Britain," by King. The
official history for grade eleven students in
Prince Edward Island is "The Story of
Civilization," by Seary and Patterson. The
two histories of Canada that are used in the
province's public schools are "The Story of
Canada" and "The Story of our People." In
"The Story of Canada" 82 pages are devoted
to the early history of French Canada, 150
pages to the history of Western Canada,
72 pages to the history of the province of
Ontario and 7 pages to the coming of the
Loyalists. In "The Story of our People,"
French Canada gets 50 pages, Western Canada
60, Ontario 20 and the Loyalists 10. With
regard to my last question, as to whether
there is a fair presentation of the history and
early settlement of French Canada, I am told
that it is good in "The Story of Canada" and
not quite so good in "The Story of our
People."
In Nova Scotia, the authorized Canadian
histories in use in the public and high schools
are Patterson's "Story of Britain in Canada"
and Bingay's "History of Canada." In the
former history 17 pages are devoted to French
Canada, 29 to Western Canada, and 7 to the
coming of the Loyalists. In Bingay's history
100 pages are devoted to French Canada, 64 to
Western Canada, and 16 to the coming of the
Loyalists. There are no separate schools in
Nova Scotia, and the same histories are used
by all the schools. It is the opinion of
prominent educational authorities of that province that the histories in use give a fair
presentation to the story of French Canada
and the early settlement in Quebec. In view,
however, of the important place which Nova
Hon. Mr. DAVIES.

Scotia played in the early history of this
country, the histories give quite a lot of attention to that province, but, in the opinion of
competent authorities, not more than the
subject requires.
In the province of New Brunswick a different
situation exists. In the public schools the only
Canadian history text is "A Canadian History
for Boys and Girls," by Emily P. Weaver.
Other texts are listed in the course of study
to be used by the teacher, if he or she wishes,
and also by the pupils as supplementary
reading. I am informed that in this history
the balance is fairly kept between the provinces. Of 392 pages, about 60 are devoted to
New France and its royal governors; quite a
fair amount of space is given ta the development of the West, about 35 pages to the
province of Ontario, and about 8 pages to the

coming of the Loyalists. My informant does
not think that in this history taught in the
public schools of New Brunswick the treatment of the early settlement of French Canada

is quite adequate.

He feels that that part of

the history dealing with the story of Quebec
after the British conquest is almost entirely
an account of the political discords involved
in achieving Confederation. I am informed
that Canadian history is not a subject taught
in the high schools of New Brunswick. In
addition to Emily Weaver's history, however,
the French-speaking schools use an "Elementary History of Canada," written by
Bourgeois.
It would be presumptuous on my part to
express any definite opinion on the teaching of
Canadian history in the province of Quebec, in
view of the fact that the motion was made by
an honourable senator from that province who

is well known for his scholarship and his keen
interest in education, he at one time having
filled the position of public instructor in the
Quebec Government. Nevertheless, I thought
I should like to make some independent
inquiries into the matter, so I wrote to a

friend of mine who is much interested in
education. He told me what other people had
told me, namely, that a committee of six

French and English historians has already been
appointed by the Canada and Newfoundland
Education Association to study the teaching of
Canadian history. A report is expected next
October. I assume that the honourable senator

from Sorel was well aware of this when he
made his motion, and that he feels the matter
should also be discussed at the coming

Dominion-Provincial Conference.
In the Catholic schools of Quebec province
seven different history text-books are used; in
the Protestant schools, two text-books. The
histories of Canada used in the Catholic

MAY 30, 1944
schools are by Desrosiers et Bertrand; Farley
et Lamarche; Rutché et Forget; Frères des
Ecoles Chrétiennes, cours élémentaire; Frères
des Ecoles Chrétiennes, cours moyen; Clercs
St.-Viateur, cours élémentaire; Clercs St.-Viateur, cours intermédiaire.
The two histories used in the Protestant
schools are Dickie and Palk's "Pages from my
Country's Story" and A. L. Burt's " Romance
of Canada."
I have had sent to me a translation of an
excellent paper prepared by Mr. Charles
Bilodeau, who was appointed special officer in
the Quebec Department of Public Education to
study the choice of text-books for all schools
within the jurisdiction of the province. I shall
not take time to read, to you Mr. Bilodeau's
analysis of the Canadian history text-book
situation in Quebec. I will say, however, that
Mr. Bilodeau has analyzed both the French
text-books and the English text-books very
carefully and fairly. He has by no means
minimized the tendency in French text-books
to be unfair to the British, and in British textbooks to be unfair to the French, nor has he
minimized the difficulties of providing a textbook which will be agreeable to all the Departments of Education across Canada. With
your permission I shall read his concluding
paragraphs:
At the present time, the ibest approach to
the problem is probably to refer it to historians
of the two races.

French- and English-speaking

historians should be able to agree on the main

historical facts to be ·taught in sehools, without
preventing any province from emphasizing cer-

tain facts, as well as -to offer useful suggestions

on the teaching of history. This might redress
-the present situation where numerous facts
mentioned in one series of texts are ignored in
the other. Care should be taken, however, not
to falsi.fy history in suppressing facts whieh
might displease one or t he other race. Truth
always retains its rights, if it does not entail
necessarily resentment.
Adult attitudes towards racial problems are
affected by impressions gained during youth.
Much progress will be aceomplished when the
two Canadian races will have learnt to know
each other better at school. The teaching of

Canadian history may contribute greatly to *a
stronger national unity, and in consequence it
should be used to further the attainment of
this objective.

Those noble sentiments indicate the broadminded and patriotic attitude with which Mr.

Bilodeau approached this very complex and
difficult question.

With regard to the province of Ontario, in
which I live, I feel that there could be an
improvement in the teaching of history. In
the first place, strange as it may seen, the
authorized history text-book in the public
schools and the authorized history text-book
in the high schools of Ontario are both written by the same man, Professor William

167

Stuart Wallace, a graduate of Oxford and at
the present time librarian of the University of
Toronto. Professor Wallace is a very scholarly man, and I am sure that his scholarship
is adequate for the writing of a history. I
have gone carefully through both his public
school and high school histories. His public
school history is intensely interesting and wellwritten. It is used in Grade 7 only of our
public schools. His high school history is also
very well written, although I think it needs
revision. However, I do not believe, honourable senators, it is in the best interests of
the children of Ontario that from the time
they start to learn history in the publie school,
probably at the age of ten or eleven years,
until they matriculate from the high school,
their opinions on the history of this country
should be formed largely by one man.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: That does not seem te
me to be a healthy situation.
Professor
Wallace's high school history is called "The
History of the Canadian People." I am sorry
to find that it is not up to date. It was first
Since that time fifteen
published in 1930.
new editions have been printed, two of them
as late as 1942. Yet what do we find? We
find on pages 333 and 334 the author undertakes to deal with Imperial Conferences. He
devotes about one page and a half to these
important conferences. He tells his students
that the 1926 Conference laid down the principle that Great Britain and the Dominions are
"autonomous communities within the Empire,
equal in status, in no way subordinate one te
another in any aspect of their domestic and
external affairs, though united by a common
allegiance to the Crown and freely associated
as members of the British Commonwealth of
Nations." The author then goes on to say
that the principle, though embodied in a
unanimous resolution of the ceonference, "has
not as yet perhaps the force of law." This is
what we are still teaching students in the high
schools of Ontario in 1944, despite the fact
that the Statute of Westminster became law
in 1931.
As to the teaching of :history in this province, I consulted a number of authorities,
including the heads of some of our best known
private schools for boys. We have in Ontario
four large private schools similar to what are
termed public schools in England, and I know

the standard of scholarship in these four
schools is very high. I therefore determined
to find out what their principals thought of
the situation, and I should like to quote
briefly from letters which I have received
from them. One headmaster writes:

edurotien under the British Norlth America

MAY 30, 1944
Act is under the ýcontrol of our provincial
Governments, and whether or flot the honourable senator's motion will be discussed at the
Dominion Provincial Conference will depend
largely upon the attitude of the Departments
of Education in our provinces. We have been
very fortunate in the province of Ontario s0
far as Ministers of Education, are concerrned.
During lis premiership the Hon. Howard
Ferguson was our Minister of Education and
took a very keen interest in that department.
While performing the onerous duties of the
prerniership, hie was by no means a figure-head
in the Departrnent of Education. Some years
ago we had as our Minister of Eduoation. a
distinguished Canadian and great educationist,
in the person of Dr. H. J. Cody, iat present
head of the University of Toronto.
Prior to bis death last August our Minister
was the Hon. Duncan McArthur. Dr. McArthur had had a wide experience. H1e was
for some years in the Archives at Ottawa
under Dr. Doughty. H1e was later head of the
History Department at Queen's University.
H1e was appointed Deputy Minister of Education for Ontario in 1934. Five or six years
Dr. McArthur
later hie became Minister.
during bis terni of office changed the teaching
of history in our Ontario schools, and it now
cornes under the head of Social Studies. In
Grade 7, three months are given 'to Canada
under French rule and Canada under British
rule, two months to Canada to-day, one
month -to the United States of Amerîca, and
one month tb discussing changing ways of
living. In Grade 8 of our public schools we
are teaching early Britain for two months,
-the growth of British freedorn for two rnonths,
Britain to-day, wbich includes England and
Scotland-and which I assume includes Wales,
altbough it does not say so in the curriculum
-for two months, Empire to-day for two
montbs, and tbe Empire and tbe world for two
montbs.
I give you that information without expressing any opinion on it. I arn not enough of
a practical educationist to know whether that
division of the subject is wise or unwise.
At the present time we in Ontario are fortunate in having Colonel George Drew, the
Premier, as Our Minister of Education. As
you are aIl well aware, Colonel Drew is
keenly interested in education, and since hie
became minister hie bas had certain intelligence tests made wbich I arn sure hie found
enlightening. I have explained to you tbat
Canadian bistory is taught only in Grade 7
of our public and separate scbools in Ontario.
About five bours a week are taken up with
this subject. In our high scbools Canadian
history and geograpby are combined under
"Social Studies." There are four history periods

a week and three geography periods a week.
This combination of history and geography is
taugbt in Grade 10, or the second foiým, only.
1 hope thîs information is not wearying
honourable senators.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Coming to the Prairie
provinces, I find that the authorized history
text-book in the elementary sehools in Manitoba in Grade 8 is "The Story of Canada," by
Wrong, Martin and Sage. I have told you
earlier liow much space this history devotes to
important phases of our Canadian development.* This saine history is used in Manitoba
in the Frencb, Roman Catholie and private
My information from Manitoba
schools.
cornes from a lady who is sornething of an
authority on history text-books, and one of
the best and rnost competent teachers of
history in the province. She is of the opinion
tbat this bistory. "Tbe Story of Canada,"
gives a fair presentation of the early settlement made by the French Canadians but that
it is flot quite adequate in its treatment of
modern times and modern problems. She feels,
also, that it is too difficult for pupils of Grade
8: The official bistory for tbe b-igb sehools of
Manitoba is Duncan McArtbur's bistory, wbiclî
is also used in Saskatchewan. I arn familiar
with this history. It is written in a very easy
and interesting style. Out of a total of 508
pages, it devotes 139 to the early history of
French Canada up to 1763 and 53 pages to
the history of Western Canada, its settlernent
and development. The province of Ontario
gets 27 pages, and the coiong of the Loyalists
il pages. This high schiool bistory is also.
used in the private schools of Manitoba. In
sorne Manitoba sebools experimental work is
being done with George Brown's new history,
"Building the Canadian Nation," to wbich I
have referred before.
From a history teacher in Manitoba I have
received a viewpoint diametrically opposed to,
the motion of the honourable senator from
Sorel. As I am sure we are ail anxious to be
fair in connection with this matter, I should'
like to read you two paragrapbs from a page
of comment which I received. They are as
follows:
In may opinion it would be most unfortunate.
to prescribe one text for the whole of Canada..
Modern teachers are trying to get away from
the olfi idea of one text as a bible in any
,subjeet. No history, and certainly no text of
the length and style suitable for stuidents in
elementary or high sehools, eao be the last word
on the subjeet. Prescription of one text for
the whole of Canada would have a tenclency
to exaît that one book as a complete and final
authority. First thing we know, we would find'
that to question it would be treason, or at least
subversive propaganda. It is difficoît enough,

SENATE
to rep]ace undesirabie texts or out-dated ones
in our provinces without the problem of having
to deal with it on a nation wide scale.
It wouid he 'better to have a committee of
competent and impartial historians (if sncli
beings exist) examine texts now in use and
others availabie, state wbere these texts are at
fanit, and come to an agreement as to wvhat
changes wouid be necessary te achieve an accurate and fair account. These suggestions shouid
,be submitted ta the authors, and to the publishers, who could probabiy be counted uipon
to make the necessary adjustmnents. T-hen a
comnittee of teachers shouid report cvhether
the subjeet-matter and the iiterary style is suitable for the grade for whieh the book is
intended. Sometimes iA may even be necessary
ta have a book translated frein the style of the
historian in order that it may be comprehlensihie
at the gracie leve] at whicb if is proposed to
use it. After these two committees have coinpieted their work, a list of books suitahie for
uise in any province ici Canada couid be scchrnctted.
Variations in emphasis wvouid stili
persist; variation lu style, one hop<es wouid alsu
continue; 'but ail the texte would have been
pronotinced accurate as far as tbey go.
In the province of Saskatchewan, the officiai
text-book used in the eicmentary sehools is
"This ie Canada." by Tombs. In this history
70 pages are given to the stery of French
Canada. and about 75 pages to the coming of
the Loyaliste and the settiement of the West.
Dr. McArthur's history is the authorized
text-book in the high schools. I analyzed this
bistory briefiy when dealing with the provincE
of Manitoba, se I shall net cal with it again.
In Alberta tliere are three Protestant
separate schoois in addition to tbe Protestant
public echools and the Roman Catholie
separate sehools.
Ail these schools use the
text-books set eut in the provincial regulatiens.
The teaching of history in Alberta, I am
informed, je deait with under "Social Studies."
These social studies deai with education,
working conditions, different races in Canada
and, particuiariy, the progrese of Western
Canada. I am toid very littie attention is
paid te the history of French Canada or te
the history of the province of Ontario. Ia
going through the liet ef the school books used
I notice that under social studies for Grades 10
and Grade il various history books are iisted,
but ne actual histery of Canada. My correspondent frem Alberta deals rather strongly
with the way in wbicb bie feels the teaching
of Canadian history hias been neglected for tbe
past generation in that province. As I cannot
speak on the situation at first band, I shahl net
read bis commeats. It might mistakealy be
assumed that I was endersing these views.
We have honourabie senators fromn evcry
province sitting in this Chamber, and no
doubt we shall hear fromn tbemn with regard te
the teauhing of histury ini thceir own provinces.
and aise as te their views on the motion of
the bonourable senator from Sorel. I wiil just
flln. Mr. DAVIES.

say that my informant tells me a prominent educationist toid him that hie thought
there was less Canadian history taught in
Alberta than in any of the other provinces.
This is due te the fact that in 1935 a new
educationai curriculum was drawn up wbich
eliminated a Canadian bistory course.
There are no separate sebools in British
Columbia, but I am informed there are junior
high schois.
Canadian bistory in British
Columbia, as in some ether provinces, is a
part of the social studies from Grade 7 te
Grade 9, the latter beinig the junior high schooi
grade. The text-hook used is, "Romance of
Canada," by A. L. Burt. 0f the 372 pages of
the main part of the book, 148 pages are given
te the Frenchi period up te the time of tbe
Quehec Act. The main portion of the textbook gives ne more prominence te British
Columbia than te the rest of Canada. As a
matter of fact, twice as much space is given to
tbe French period as is given to British Coluimbia history.
To correct this deflciency
there bias be-en addîed a 63 page .supplement
dealing with the deveiopment of the province
of British Columîbia, for use in that province
oaly.
An educationai autberity in British
Columbia thinks that French Canadian bistory
ia given a very fair presentatien. Net mucb
stress is laid uipon the bistory of Ontario, but
16 pages are given te the ceming of the
Loyali4s.
In tbe British Columbia bigli
sehools the course for senior matriculation is
fairiy heav y. The prescribed text-book represents only a smali portion of the reading wbicb
studcnts have te do before they get their
la tbe advanced course the
matriculation.
,ext-books are "The Canadians," by Wrong,
and "The History of Canada," by Wittke.
They are aIse referred te and advised te read
Dr. Trotter's Canadian hîstory and Brown's
"Readings in Canadian llistory." Dr. Trotter
is at tise preseat time head of the History
Department of Qucen's University, and I
discussed tbe whoie matter with him. H1e
succceded Dr. Duncan McArtliir, who hecame
Depiitv Minister of Education for Ontario.
Dr. Trotter is an outstanding historian and
a man of distinguishied schoiastic attainmeats.
I am sure anything hie wrete would be written
with the utmost fairness.
Now, I bave just a few more words te, say.
I hope that I have net wearied tbis henourabie
body. 1 have tried t0 centribute something of
value te this discussion by investigating the
teaching of history as it is carried out in the
various provinces at the present time. It is
quite evident fromn some of the letters I have
received that upiniun is divided on the
advisability of one official history -text-book
for the whoie of Canada. The honourable

171

MAY 30, 1944
senator from. Sorel is, of course, aware that
bis motion has met with considerable opposition in some of the French papers of his own
province. It seems to me, however, that after
this war is over new histories will have to be
written which xviii give considerable space to
the part Canada played in the first Great War,
and also in the present war. 1 feel, too, that
any new histories which are authorized in our
high schools should include the Statute of
Westminster and an explanation of Canada's
place in the British Commonwealth of Nations.
With regard to the motion, I fcel that it
might have been better if it had been worded
somewhat differently. The honourable senator
expresses the wish that at the Interprovincial
Conference,
-the delegates representing the fine provinces
of our Confederation m-ay be pleased to appoint
a icommittee composed of the moalt impartial
and competent historians as such recognized in
each -province, with ;the mission of preparing a
textbook of Canadian history that could be
accepted and adopted by ail provincial governments for use in ail Gehools under their direct

f air broadminded, authorized text-book for
the whole of Canada would be of inestimable
value in doîng so, particularly in our high
schools. As I said, I should have preferred
the motion to be worded slightly differently;
but having a high regard for the educationai
experience of the honourable senator who
sponsored the motion, and believing that he
gave it very careful thought before he introduced it, I shall support it.

I believe the motion would have a better
reception at the conference if it were changed
to read:
-with the mission of carefully studlying the
advisability of preparing a text-book of Canadian hi.story.
I cannot get out of my mind the important fact that education is in the hands of
the provincial governments. I wonder whether
this honourable body should go quite so far as
to urge the appointment of a commnittee te
prepare a text-book. It seems to me that
in doing se we might be trespassing on
provincial rights.
In conclusion, honourable senators. I should
like to congratulate the hanourable senator
from Sorel on introducing a motion full of
such far-reaching possibilities in the development of a sound Canadian spirit in this
country. Speaking as one who went to schooi
in the heart of the Empire, who during the
whole of bis school years was neyer taught
one line of Canadian history or Canadian
geography, and who came to this country
knowing absolutely nothing about it, I have
great sympathy with the object of the motion.
I do feel that we need a change. In the
public and high schools of Canada tio-day, including the French schools in Quebee, we are
using more than twenty different histories of
this country. It must not be forgotten that
ail these histories bring in royalties to their
authors. This brîngs up the .probiema of
vested interests. If we are going to build up
pride in our country-and we have a country
of which we should ail be very proud-we
have got to teach our children the history
of this country, and it is my opinion that a

CONFERENCE OF PRIME MINISTERSMR. CURTIN'S VISIT TO CANADA
JOINT MEETING 0F SENATE AND HOUSE 0F
COMMONS TO BE ADDRESSED BY PRIME
MINISTER 0F AUSTIIALIA

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
before we pro.ceed witb the Orders of the
Day, I shouid lîke to make an announcement.
For the last two months, ever since it became known that the Conference of the Prime
Ministers of the British Commonwealth would
take place in London, we ail have been greatly
interested. As every one is aware, the Conference was held this month and was attended
by the Prime Ministers of Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.
I am sure that ail honourable members of the
Canadian Parliament are not only interested

SENATE
but pleased that at this time, after the Empire
has been at war for more than four ycars, the
representatives of its vast domain have met
and arrived at conclusions of tremendous importance to the conduct of the war and to
peacetime affairs. No publie statement bas yet
been made as to the subjects discussed at the
Conference, but in good time there probably
will be one. As a member of this Chamber I
wish to express my own feeling of pride in the
part played at the Conference hy our Prime
Minister, the Right Honourable Mr. Mackenzie
King, and gratification at his safe return to
this country, which zentime nts I am sure are
shared by the people of Canada. The high
honour aecordced to him and to Canada in
inviting him to addcess a joint meeting of the
House of Lords and the ouse of Commons of
the United Kingdom was of a kind that is not
often conferred at the seat of Empire. I
believe the people of Canada are well pleased
with the manner in which the Prime Minister
acquitted himself at that meeting, and we
know that the remarkable address lie made
there has been largely concurred in by the
people of Great Britain and of the various
Dominions.
Canada is to be further honoured by the
visit of two delegates to the Conference, the
Prime Ministers of the most distant parts of
the Empire, Australia and New Zealand. The
Right Honourable John Curtin, Prime Minister of Australia, arrivcd in this country last
niglt. The announcement that I wish to make
now is that honourahle members of the Sonate
and of the House of Conmons are to have the
great pleasîure of hcaring him at a joint sitting
of the two Houses to-morrow afternoon.
Tlhough Australia. our sister Dominion, is
far distant from the centre of the Empire, lier
people carry on. during times of war as during
times of peace, in a manner that gives splendid
proof of the stock from which they come. It
was only three years ago that that great
Commonwealth was in imminent danger of
invasion. We all admire the way in which her
armed forces, with the help of the Army and
Navy of the United States, warded off that
threat to their freedom.
In order that there may be no misunderstanding as to the time of to-morrow's joint
meeting. I shall quote what the Honourable
J. L. Ralston, speaking on behalf of the Prime
Minister, stated yesterday in the other House:
It is proposed that when the Hoiuse adjourns
this evening the forinal session will stand
adjourned until four o'eloek on Thursday. lit
it is anticipated that the memihers will assemble
at the uual hour of tliree o'clock without going
int.o formal session so tlhat they may have the
privilege of hearing, along with the members
of the Senate, the address of Mr. Curtin.
Hon. Mr. RING.

I would suggest that we proceed to the
House of Commons shortly before 3 o'clock, in
order that we may be in our seats before
Prime Minister Curtin arrives.
His Honour the Speaker has already advised
us of a message reccived from His Exce'llency
the Governor Genoral in regard to Royal
Assent to be given te certain Bills at ten
minutes to six to-morrow afternoon. ln view
of this and of the joint meeting, I shall move,
when we conclude our business to-day, that
we adijourn until 5 o'clock to-morrow afternoon.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Can the honourable
leader give us any information in regard to the
subsequent adjournnent?
Hon. Mr. KING: I hope to be more definite
to-morrow, but I think there is every probability of our adjourning until TuîesdayJune 13.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, it is
a little difficult for me, as acting lead.er on this
side of the House, to say anything that may
represent the consensus of opinion of my
colleagues; I can do little more than express
my own personal opinion. I listened with a
great deal of pleasure to our Prime Minister's
address in London, and I am largely in agreement with it. There may be differences of
opinion, but I incline to the view that Empire
collaboration should. if possible, be closer.
However, tliere is no question at all of Canada's
being completely independent, and I think that
in this respect the Prime Minister adequately
expressed the opinion of our people. Naturally,
as ho himself said, much of the cordiality of his
reception was accorded to him as Prime
Minister of Canada, but undoubtedly he ably
acquitted himself in that address.
If the
policy he then announced is what ho put
before his fellow Prime Ministers, I think ho
correctly represented Canadian opinion.
I am delighted te join in the welcome which
we are to extend to-morrow to the Prime
Minister of Australia. I might suggest that a
sufficient number of chairs be provided for our
accommodation in the House of Commons.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think we should be in
our places at 3 o'clock sharp. We want te do
honour net only to Prime Minister Curtin
himself, but also to those whom he represents,
the greatest freedom-loving people in the
world. I believe I speak for the whole House
when I say we fully appreciate the opportunity
we are to have of listening to one of'the
Prime Ministers of the British Commonwealth
of Nations.
The Hion. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators. I might supplement the information
given by the lionourable leader of the House

MAY 31, 1944
(Hon. Mr. King) by stating that arrangements
have been made for our accommodation on
the floor of the flouse of Commons similar
to, those which were made when Mr., Eden
addressed the members of both Houses. There
will bc availahIe five rows of chairs, which will
provide accommodation for at least sixty
senators. Attendants of the Senate will be
present to see that the seats allotted to
senators are not o-ccupied by other persons.
Prime Minister Curtin will arrive at the main
entrance of the Parliament Building at te-n
minutes to three, and will be escorted to the
rooms of the Speaker of the flouse of Commons. fie will proceed to the Chamber by the
south entrance, so he should be there at
approximately 3 o'clock. It has been suggested
that honourable senators be in t'heir seats at
least five minutes before that time.

0F THE RIGHT HONOURABLE W. L. MACKENZE KING TO BoTH
HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AT WESTMINSTER, MAY 11, 1944

(Mr. King was welcomed by the Right Honourable Win.ston CJhurchill, C.H., M.P., Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom, and thanked by the Right Honourable Viscount Simon,
G.C.S J., G.C.V.O., O.B.B., Lord Chancellor, and the Right Honourable Cliiton
Brown, M.P., Speaker of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom)

Right Hon. WINSTON CHURCHILL: My
Lord Chancellor. Mr. Speaker of the House
of Commons, my Lords, ladies and gentlemen:We are met here to-day to give a hearty
welcome to Mr. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of the Dominion of Canada. We have
known him a long time, and the longer we
have known him the more we have loved him.
He cornes here from Canada to attend our
gathering of Empire leaders; hie cornes here as
ane who has played an unrivalled part in the
forward march of Canada.
Like most of us here, he is a party politician.
Well, there is nothing ta be, ashamed of in
that! But 1 say witlhout hesitation that there
ivas no other man, and perhaps there was -no
other career which any man could have followed, which would have enahled our honoured
guest this aftcrnoon to lead Canada united into
the heart of this world-shaking struggle.
H1e has brought Canada to the greatest dévelopinent of her power. It is extraordinary to
think what Canada has done in this war. This
unending crash of events, one scene of drama
succeeding and overlapping another, the intense absorption of people of every age, sect
and class in the war effort, hardly enabling
themn ta draw breath-all this makes us incapable of appreciating a tîthe of what is going
on, what bas heen going on in Canada, under
its Government headed by one who has been
twenty-five years the leader of a party and
eighteen years Prime Minister of the Dominion.
With aîl that is being done there, we may well
ask ta be excused if we have flot followed it
ail in the detail it deserves.
Canada, with her eleven million people, has
guarded the heart and citadel of the Empire
during the most perilious months in its bistory. There was a time when the Canadian
Corps stood as aur principal method of defence
between the enemny's gathering invasion hordes

and this vast City of London. And Canadians
have become a naval people. Thcy have gone
ta ses. Not only do they build ships, bath of
peace and war, but they man them, and fight
them, and have contributed in a notable degree
ta the destruction of the U-boat menace.
As for the air, Canada is the home of the
British Empire and Commonwealth in central
arganizatian. iler geographical and other conditions have facilitated this, and from the fields
of Canada have came a race of airmen who
have nat anly gathered unsurpassed honour,
but will continue ta be an asset for the greater
unity w'hich. underlies aIl written or legal
constitutions for the British Empire.
My friend, Mr. Mackenzie King, I have
known for well over forty years, first in politics and then in personal friendship, and I
know well the many steps be bas always taken
thraughout that period leading up ta this
great climax of the development and demonstration. of the power of Canada. Canada bais
a future which noue cani measure. TIhe representative of this magnificent people will give
us ta-day a conception nat only of the general participation of Canada in the Empire,
but of the particular character of bier contribution which, in aur vast and varied organization,
is always ta be welcomed.
Canada is the link which joins together
the old world and the new; which lin.ks the vast
American people with whom, I trust, we shaîl
ourselves develop a fraternal association.
Canada, bound by sacred ties ta the *Mother
Country, and also by termis of the deepest intimaacy and friendship ta the United States,
clamps the whole structure of this benignant,
unfearing, gloriaus British Empire together inta
one. homogeneous mass which, when criais
cornes for the world as a wbole, will neyer fail
in its duty.
I caîl upon Mr. Mackenzie King.

SENATE

Rigbt lion. W. L. MACKENZIE KING:
Prime Minister, Lord Chancellor, My Lords
-and Members of the Huse cf Commons:
Wbon I receivcd from you, Prime Minister,
tho invitation te address members of both
bouses of the Parliament of the United King-dem, Ifound myseif at aloss ferwordisin which
te acknowledge se higha an honour. Your kindness 10 presiding on thjs occasion, your words
of introduction, the traditions and associations
of Westminster, and the presence in such
numbers of the Lords and ýCommons add
greatly te my sense of obligation.
I arn only tee well aware of ail that it means
te be the guest of the people of Britain, and
te be speaking to them, and te others, from
the heart ef the British Commenwealth and
Empire, at this moment of supreme crisis ini
human affairs. Yoîir friendsIiip and mine over
many years of peace, and ocr close cernpanienship througheut the years of war, te
which you have made se kind a reference,
afford me a support I greatiy welcome in
addrossing this distinguished assc mbly.
As te my part in Canada's entry loto the war,
it wvas but the discbarge of the respensibility
which was mine te give expression, in a dccisive heur, te the will and spirit ef the Canadian people, and te serve their highest interests.
Four years hav e now passed since you,
Prime Minister, accepted the leadership of the
people cf Brîtain and the leadership cf the
cause of bumin freedom. Youi and your celleagues hav e led this country, and the cause
for which it stands. from the dark days of
extreme perd, te tbis heur when at last the
lighit is bcginining te break. It is a source
of confidence throughout the frce world that
you are continuing your leadership with a
vision and a courage which have already becorne a, legcnd.
I receguizo that, for me. this occasion is designcd as a welceme te Canada's representative at the meeting cf Prime Mini-.tcrs of the
Britishi Comouinwalth. Fer th Iigli compl~ ili
ment b(ing paici Canada te-day. I shouîd like
toecxpress my gratitude and pride.
I know that the weîceme yeu accord me is
equaîly heartfeît and generous tewards the
representatives ef Australia, New Zealand and
South Africa. I sheuld like te say
te Mr.*
Curtin, Mr. Fraser and Field Marshal Smuts
how great is the admiration cf the people cf
Canada cf their leadership, and of the bercie
part which their ceuntries have taken in this
war. I should aIse like te say te thema bow
gltd I arn that our presence in London at this
time affords te us~ ail net onîy exceptienal
oDortunities of conference wîth the Prime

Minister cf Britain and bis colleagues, but of
making clear te the worîd the oneness of the
nations cf the Commonwealth in the winning
ef the war and in seeking international ceoperatien after the war.
Perbaps I may be alîowed te ccevey a special
message from tbe people cf Canada te the
people cf Britain.
No memery cf happiness in the past is more
cherished than the recellectien of the visit cf
Their Majesties the iKing and Quceen.
In
Canada, as in Britain, the years cf war have
heightened the admiration and increased, the
affect-ion feit by men and wemen everywhere
for our King and Queen. We have been
inspiredý by their courage and devotien in sharing the dangers and serrews of the people. In
ail nations of the Commonwealth, their example
bas deepenPd the~ mPaning and significance of
our comrnon allegiance te the Crown.
The herele endurance of the people of
Britain is ever present in our mindis. We shahl
nover forget your resolution in the darkest days
of the war. Nor shall we ever cease te romember the doterminatien with which, amid destruction of yeur homes and in peril of yeur
lives, yeu, the mon, wemen and eildren of
Britain, bave centinued te carry on your werk
and te maintain your confidence in the future.
Ciearly the maintenance cf human freedom bas
deponded upon the prosorvatien of the froedom
cf Britain. It is our groatost pride, as it is the
groatest prideoef other British nations ropresonted bore, that whon, for se long a time, you
alene boe the brunt of the attack, wo stood
with yeu 10 arms against the might of Nazi
Cermany. TIhe free nations cf the world cao
nover forgot tbhat it was the indomitable resistance of the people of Britain that bought the
precieus time for the mebilizatien of the forces
cf froodem around the globe.
Britain bas aise been an e-xample te the world
of the erganizatien of a free people for a cemmon task. You hav e astonisbced the wurld by
the marvels of your industrial production and
by the skill and cfflcieney of your workers. You
bave nover lest yeur faith. A new onorgy, a
new cenfidence have been generatcd in your
people. These xviii endure. And yeur faith,
tested and tried in the fires of affliction, wili ho
firmer and strongor than it bas ever been.
When victory is won, yeu wilI stili possess
the same initiativ e, vigeur and endurance; the
same skilîs of hand and brain; the same qualitics of mind and spirit. These hav e enabled the
peopleo f Britain te make a contribution te the
winning of the war which, man for man, ne
other nation bas surpassedi. In peace as in war,

JUNE 1, 1944
these qualities will remamn. In the building of a
better world after the war Britain will be able,
by the force of her example, to give the same
leadership that she has given in the waging of
war.
It is, however, net of Britain but of Canada
that I arn expeeted to speak on this occasion.
I should like, therefore, if 1 may, to speak to
you particularly of the spirit of Canada, as
exemplified ini Canada's war effort. 1 do this
with less embarrassment as a like spirit, I know,
animates the war efforts of ail the nations
united in a common allegiance to the Crown.
I should like ta speak, as well, of what that
spirit signifies for the future of thé British
Commonwealth and of its relations with other
building of a new world order.
nations in the '
In speaking of Canada's war effort it is nlot
my intention to describe our contribution to
the present world confliet prîmarily in terms of
men and materials. What 1 should like to refer
to are certain aspects which, viewed collectively,
reveal the spirit of the Canadian people.
I place first the aspect I regald as most
significant. Canada's war effort is a voluntary
effort. It is the free expression of a free people.
Like the other nations of the Commonwealth
at wa.r to-day, we entered the war of our own
free will; and not as the resuit of any forma]
obligation. Ours was not primarily a response
to a caîl of blood or race. It was the outoome
of our deepest political instinct-a love of freedom and a sense of justice.
As aur decision was a voluntary decision, se
the effort of our people ini earrying on the war
bas been a voluntary effort, In Canada, as in
other countries, controls and restrictions have
been imposed in order to prosecute the .war
with vigaur and efficiency. But at every stage
these measures have received the overwhelming
support of the Canadiaýn people.
Canada's population numbers eleven and a
haîf millions. Tbree-quarters of a million of
our finest young men are serving li the armed
forces. This xnilitary demand on our manpower
resources has flot prevented aur country from
douhling its pre-war production. Thanks to
the skill and devotion of our men and wamen,
Canada is a granary, an arsenal, an aerodrome,
and a shipyard of freedom. Our country has
become increasingly proud of the fact that
every figbting maxi from Canada serving across
the seas, an the seas and in the air, la a volunteer. We can say, in very truth, that aur effort
in this war is a vol.untary effort.
Canada's declsion ta enter the war was an
immediate decisioxi. When, in 1939, the last
bopes of -peace were fading from the world, I
announceed that, if Britain took up arms in the
defence of freedom, aur Goverximexit would ask
Parliamexit ta place Canada at -Britain's side.

When war came, there 'was no hesitation. As
soon as Parliament could act, Canada was at
war.
lI those days few if any of aur people believed aur country stood in immediate danger
of attack. What we sexised immediately was
the issue. We saw that a bitter struggle had
begun betweexi freedom and domination and
that the canfiiet would certanly spread. For
'the second time in a gexieration Canada wexit
ta war to help prevent tyranny in. Germany
from extending its domination ta ather parts
cf thie globe.
Whexi the st war ended the people af
Canada, l1ike other freedkmr-laving peoples,
hoped and believed that peace and freedom
had been assured ta maxikind for generations.
kn aur National War Meinorial thaît hope and
that faith were symbalized by inseparably
joined figures of peace and freedom. But ahl
aur history, ail aur political experience told
us that freedom i Canada cauld net survive
i a world that was no langer free.
From the beginning, aur war effort was so
planned and arganized that we might reach,
as rapidly as possible, the maximum effort our
people could sustain during a long war.
We expanded our Navy as fast as we eauld
build or acquire the ships and train the meni.
We expanded aur Army ta the highest strength
we believed we could maixitain la a long war.
We expanded aur Air Force ta the limit of
aur capacity ta secure the needed equipment
and ta train personnel.
The British Commonwealth Air Training
Plan was expedited and expanded beyond al
anticipations. The one hundred thousandth
flghting airman bas just completed bis training.
The co-operative training in Canada bas vastly
increased the joint strength in the air of the
United Nations.
We have expanded aur war industries far
beyond tbe needs of aur owa armed forces.
Despite the witbdrawal of huxidreds of
tbousands of mexi from the farms, the fisheries,
the mines and the forests, we have greatly
enlarged aur production of foodstuifs anid raw
materials. We are devoting about haîf aur
total production directly ta tbe waging of war.
We are-paying about haîf of the finaxicial cost
of aur war effort out of current revenue from
taxation. Tbrough victary boans and war
savings, nearly every family is helping ta
finance the war.
In fighting men, in weapoxis and munitions,
in food anid li finance, we are sceking as a
people ta make aur utmost contribution ta the
flght for world freedom. Our objective has
been a total effort for total war, and we believe
that objective la being attained.

SENATE
Of the nations of the western hemisphere,
Canada was the first to defend in arms the
frontiers of the freedom of the new world.
For more than two years our country, alone
in the Americas, was at war. Intmore ways
than one our effort bas been a pioneering
effort.
Canada's contribution to the present war
has been the greater because we live side by
side with the United States. Without the
harmony and reciprocity which exist between
our two countries, neither could have achieved
so much in the common cause. The ability of
both Canada and the United States to defend
the North American continent and to fight
abroad has been g.reatly increased by our
arrangements for joint defence and by the
pooling of resources.
We have sought to make our war effort,
wherever possible, a co-operative effort. The
extensive military works undertaken in Canada
in conjunction with the United States have
provided a remarkable instance of close and
Ours is surely the
friendly co-operation.
supreme example of a smaller nation living
in the fullest security and harmony side by
side with a very powerful one.
As a part of our war policy, Canada is
sharing, with other of the United Nations,
ships, machines, weapons and other supplies
which, as I have said, we are producing far in
excess of the needs of our own armed forces.
Since the war began we have supplied to
Britain, and to Britain's armed forces, war
materials and other supplies worth nearly nine
hundred million pounds ($4,000,000,000). AImost half of these supplies represent an outUnder our system of
right contribution.
mutual aid, war materials have, for the past
year, been supplied without payment to the
United Nations, in accordance with strategic
need. Canada is now supplying mutual aid
to Britain, Australia, the Soviet Union, China
and the French Committee of National
Liberation.
As the war has progressed, our effort has
become more and more a world-wide effort.
Janadian-made machines and munitions of
war have been used on all the fighting fronts.
Canadian sailors and merchant seamen have
served on all oceans. Our airmen have fought
in the battle of the skies around the globe.
From the early days of the war our soldiers
have helped to guard this island. They have
seen active service in the Pacifie area, as well
as at Dieppe, and in the Italian campaign.
To-day our army awaits the word of command
to join with their comrades in the liberation
of Europe. The morrow will witness Canadian
forces taking part in a final assault upon

Japan. Canada's effort has truly become a
world-wide effort.
I need scarcely say that we are in this war
to the end. Canada's fight for freedom will
be a fight to the finish. It is clear to our
people that this war is all one war: a monstrous conspiracy of the fascist powers to
Having
dominate and enslave the world.
taken up arms of their own free will, the
Canadian people will not relax until freedom
is secure. Canada's effort will be an enduring
effort.
We have also sought to look beyond the
war; to make our effort a long-range effort.
The Canadian people, no less than the people
of Britain, whose sacrifices have been so great,
need the promise of a brighter future. To
sustain us in our endeavours, we all need the
vision of a new world order.
By co-ordinated action, by mutual aid, by
continuous co-operation, the United Nations
are achieving military victory. The widest
measure of co-operation will be no less needed
in the making and keeping of peace. While
our primary aim, like yours, is military vietory, our ultimate aim, like yours, is a better
future for mankind.
Above all, our war effort must be viewed
as a national effort. Our decision in 1939 was
more than the free choice of a free parliament.
It was the most solemn act of a free nation.
Our war effort appeals to our national pride.
We have sought to make it worthy of Canada.
I have spoken of the war effort of Canada.
May I hasten to say again that a like spirit
bas animated the war efforts of each of the
other nations of the Commonwealth. With
due allowance for varying conditions, the
several aspects of Canada's war effort have
been paralleled in Australia, New Zealand and
South Africa. When war came four nations,
all of them thousands of miles from the scene
of the conflict, ranged themselves at the side
of Britain. To each the issue was plain; from
each the response was immediate. Each is
seeking to put forth the utmost effort. The
contributions of all bear the imprint of the
initiative and self-reliance of the pioneer.
Co-operation has marked their course throughout. Each is making a long-range effort which
will prove to be an enduring effort. It is the
pride of each that its war effort has been a
national effort.
Nor have we far to seek to discover the
cause of this identity of effort. The spirit
of a nation is not readily defined. It is known
only as it is revealed. It resembles the flow
of waters hidden beneath the earth's surface.
From time to time and from place to place
the waters having their origin in some secret
source reveal themselves as springs, or streams,

JUNE 1, 1944
or rivers. So also, from time to time, a nation's
spirit wells up from its source and manifests
itself in the collective acta of a people. Such
collective action is quickened and heightened
at a time of war.
The war efforts of the nations of the
Commonwealth owe their inspiration to a
common source. That source is the love for
freedom and the sense of justice which,
through generations, have been nurtured and
cherished in Britain as nowhere else in the
world.
The terrible events of 1940 revealed how
great was the menace te freedom and how
suddenly freedom might be lost. So long as
freedom endures, free men everywhere will
owe to the people of Britain a debt they can
never repay. So long as Britain continues to
maintain the spirit of freedom and to defend
the freedom of other nations, she need never
doubt her own pre-eminence throughout the
world. ' So long as we all share that spirit,
we need never fear for the strength or unity
of the Commonwealth. The voluntary decisions by Britain, by Canada, by Australia,
by New Zealand, and by South Africa are a
supreme evidence of the unifying force of
freedom.
This common effort springing from a common source has given a new strength and
unity, a new meaning and significance to the
British Commonwealth and Empire.
Without attempting to distinguish between
the terme "British Empire" and "British
Commonwealth," but looking rather to the
evolution of this association of free nations,
may I give to you what I believe to be the
secret of its strength and of its unity, and
the vision which I cherish of its future. "We
. . . who look forward to larger brotherhoods

and more exact standards of social justice,
value and cherish the British Empire because
it represents, more than any other similar
organization has ever represented, the peaceful
co-operation of all sorts of men in ail sorts
of countries, and because we think it is, in
that respect at least, a model of what we
hope the whole world will some day become."
This vision, I need scarcely say, is not mine
alone; indeed, the words in which I sought
to portray it are not even my own. They
were spoken thirty-seven years ago by one
whose fame to-day is not surpassed in any
part of the world if, indeed, it has been
equalled at any time in the world's history.
They are the words of the present Prime
Minister of Britain, uttered by Mr. Churchill
in 1907. As they continue to reverberate
down the years, they bring fresh inspiration
to all who owe allegiance to the Crown and
increasing hope to mankind.

106-131

Visions of youth, sometimes, "die away,
And fade into the ligbt of common day."
They fade, not because -the vision is ever
wholly lost, but because -resolution wavers,
because determination fails, because of seemingly insuperable obstacles. It has not been
so with Mr. Churchill. He has not to ask
"Whither is fled the visionary gleam?
Where is it now, the glory and the dream?"
The glory and the dream-are they not being
realized, at this very hour, in the strength and
unity of the nations of the Commonwealth?
From time to time it is suggested that we
should seek new methods of communication
and consultation.
I believe very strongIy in close consultation,
close co-operation, and effective co-ordination
of policies. What more effective means of
co-operation could have been found than those
which, despite ail the handicaps of war, have
worked with such complete success.
It is true we have not, sitting in London
continuously, a visible Imperial War Cabinet
or Council. But we have, what is much more
important, though invisible, a continuing conference of the Cabinets of the Commonwealth.
It is a conference of Cabinets which deals,
from day to day and, not infrequentIy, from
hour to hour, with policies of common concern.
When decisions are taken they are not the
decisions of Prime Ministers or other individual
Ministers, meeting apart from their own
colleagues and away from their own countries.
They are decisions reached after mature consideration by all members of the Cabinet of
each country, with a full consciousness of their
immediate responsibility to their respective
Parliaments.
Let us, by all means, seek to improve where
we can. But in considering new methods of
organization we cannot be too careful to see
that, to our own peoples, the new methods
will not appear as an attempt to limit their
freedom of decision or, to peoples outside the
Commonwealth, as an attempt to establish a
separate bloc. Let us beware lest in changing
the form we lose the substance; or, for appearance's sake, sacrifice reality. I am told that,
somewhere, over the grave of one who did
not know when he was well off, there is the
following epitaph: "I was well; I wanted to
be better; and here I am."
In the passage I quoted from Mr. Churchill
a moment ago I gave only a part of what he
said. He set forth, as well, the means of
realizing his vision of peaceful co-operation.
"Let us", he said, " . . . seek to impress, year

after year,
clusive and

nations of which it is composed,
Commonwealth has within itself

180

SENATE

a spirit which is not exclusive, but the opposite
of exclusive. Therein lies its strength. That
spirit expresses itself in co-operation. Therein
lies the secret of its unity. Co-operation is
capable of indefinite expansion. Therein lies
the hope of the future.
It is of the utmost importance to the
Commonwealth that there should continue to
be the greatest possible co-operation among
its members. In like manner it is, I believe,
of the utmost importance to the future of
mankind that, after the war, there should be
the greatest possible co-operation among the
nations of the world.
Our wartime co-operation is not the product
of formal institutional unity; it is the result
of agreement upon policies of benefit to all.
Moreover, they are policies that make an
appeal "to all sorts of men in all sorts of
countries," provided only they are men of
good will.
If, at the close of hostilities, the strength and
unity of the Commonwealth are to be maintained, those ends will be achieved not by
policies which are exclusive, but by policies
which can be shared with other nations. I am
firmly convinced that the way to maintain our
unity is to base that unity upon the principles
which can be extended to all nations. I am
equally sure that the only way to maintain
world unity is to base it upon principles that
can be universally applied.
The war has surely convinced all nations,
frorm the smallest to the greatest, that there
is no national security to be found in the
isolation of any nation or group of nations.
The future security of peace-loving nations
will depend upon the extent and effectiveness
of international co-operation.
It is no less true that it is not the great
powers only that are needed to defend, to preserve, and to extend freedom. We should be
false to the freedom for which we are fighting if, at any time, we failed to remember
that no nation liveth unto itself; and that
nations, great and small, are members one of
another.
It is not merely the security of nations that
is indivisible. Their prosperity.also is indivisible. Few would wish to return to the years
before the war, when almost every nation
sought economic security in economic isolation from its neighbours. What happened was
that the economic security of all nations was
destroyed. Now is surely the time for the
whole world to realize that, just as no nation
of itself can ensure its own safety, so no, nation
or group of nations can in isolation ensure its
own prosperity.
For my part, I profoundly believe that both
the security and the welfare of the nations of

the British Commonwealth and, in large
measure, the security and welfare of ail peaceloving nations will depend on the capacity of
the nations of the Commonwealth to give
leadership in the pursuit of policies which, in
character, are not exclusive but inclusive. How
far such policies can be successfully pursued
will, of course, depend on the extent to which
other nations are prepared to pursue similar
policies. But let .us, at least, wherever that
is possible, give the lead that is in the interests
of the world as a whole.
You, Prime Minister, have referred to the
importance of strengthening the fraternal
association that now exists between the British
Commonwealth and the United States.
Over many years Canada's relations with the
United States have been especially friendly.
Throughout the war, we have followed the
path of co-operation. We like to think that
our country bas had some part in bringing
about a harmony of sentiment between the
United States and the whole British Commonwealth. That harmony is the foundation of
the close military collaboration which is proving so fruitful in this war.
It will ever be a prime object of Canadian
policy to work for the maintenance of the
fraternal association of the British and American peoples. When peace comes it is our
highest hope that the peoples of the British
Commonwealth and the United States will
continue to march at each other's side, united
more closely than ever. But we equally hope
that they will march in a larger company, in
which all the nations united to-day in defence
of freedom will remain united in the service
of mankind.
We are approaching, in the Europe-an theatre.
the supreme crisis of this long and terrible
struggle. In this fateful hour it is imperative
that everything be done to maintain singleminded concentration on the achievement of
victory. Thaýt is our first obligation. It is
our du-ty to the humble people in all the
Allied countries whose patient endurance, unremitting toil and ready acceptance of the
burdens of war have made possible the immense strength in war materials and supplies
of the United Nations. It is our duty, above
all, to the millions of fighting men who, with
their lives, are defending our freedom and the
freedom of mankind.
The assurance of unfailing support to our
sailors, soldiers and airmen is the supreme
objective of the present meetings of Prime
Ministers. We have met here, first and foremost, in order to do everything possible, by
co-operation and by united action, to assure
that support in largest possible measure on all
the fighting fronts.

3JNE 1, 1944
The present war is different from any war in
the past. It ie different ini ecale. In any
accurate geographicai sense, it je the first world
war i history. It je a war that is being fought
net only on land and at sea but aiea i the
eloude, miles a-bove the surface of the earth.
It ie, moreover, a war that ie not confined ta

The support of our fighting men and Our

My Lords anid gentlemen,

I cail upon the Lord Chancellor ta propose a
vote of thanks ta aur honoured gueet.
THEn LORI) CHANCELLOR (Right Hon. Viscount
Simon): My Lords and Membere cf the
flouse of Commans:
Mr. Speaker and 1 have been asked ta
express in a few sentences the gratitude which
we bath feel ta the Prime Minister of Canada
for hie presence and speech. The demonstratien which foilowed the close of hie address
shows that, ideed, na long argument je
needed. We are very grateful ta Mr.
Mackenzie King f'or saying, with sa much
eloquence and vigaur, many wiee and stimulating and hapeful things. I think we are
eepeciaiiy gratefui ta him. for the account
which hie gave-the brilliant accaunt which
he gave-bath of the epirit of Canada and of
the truiy stupendous contribution which that
Dominion je making ta the caxnmon effort. î
think Mr. Speaker wili jain with me if I
venture ta say ta Mr. Mackenzie King, on
behaif of this great campany, that we do moet
sincereiy express aur admiration for aul the
efforts which this great Dominion je making,
and we rejaice ta think that we have amanget
us the leader of that great people.
It wasn't sa many years ago that, when any
of us brought visitare into this part of the
Palace of Westmister, we were considerably
puzzled haw ta reply ta the question, "What
je this room for?" The moet hopeful answer,
I think, was that this large and splendid hall
was built in order ta find room for twe quite
enermous pictures which otherwise couidn't
be accommodated. That was an injustice ta
the architect whe designed this great hall one
hundred years age. Hie must have anticipated
what wouid happen. For, thanke now ta the
way in which Mr. Mackenzie King can icave
his country one evening and arrive here the
nxext merning, and other.astenishing excursions
hy ether Dominion Premiers, this great hall,
]ying as it were between the flo-use cf Coimmens and the flouse cf Lords, has become an
great occasions such as these a piece of comnmon ground where Members cf the twa flouses
may safely meet and where they can listen
ta an address without any breach cf the
ancient and preciseiy preserved priviieges af
either Chamber.
We are greatiy rejaiced that Mr. Mackenzie
King bas now been added te the liet of thase
who have thus add-ressed us. And with ahi aur

ta express ta him in the warmest termes aur

to the lrnity and the

the surest guarantee of ultimate victory and
the bcst hope of a peaceful world in the

Mr. CHURCHILL: My Lords and gentlemen:
It bias been my experience over a great many
years Io await the eall of Mr. Speaker, and I

this occasion, although
it may be slightly out of order, I arn pleased
indeed te, obey the caîl of the Prime Minister.
Now 1 second tbis vote of tbanks to Mr.
Mackenzie King witb great warmth indeed.
I am only going to latter two sentences to you.
In one I want to echo the warm appreciation
we have of aIl that Ouîr fellow Britishers bave
done in the Dominion of Canada, under the
leadership of Mr. Mackenzie King. We stand
lost in admiration of the effort wbich they
have put forward in this war. That's my first
sentence. My second is this: That 1 believe
Canada is building up somnething even greater
tban action in t bis war. I speak now, if 1
may, for Menobers of the House of Commons,
and I believe for' the Members of the House
of Lords, too,-we are lost in admiration, it
bas struck our imagination, the Air Training
sebeîm( whlîi Canada bas set up. Therein
you bave the cream of -3.l y oung men, not
merely from Canada but from ail the rest of

tbe Dominions and from tbe free nations of
the world, meeting together, training together,
forming bonds and links whicb I think the
P rime Minister of New Zealand described
tbe otber day as "invisible, yet stronger than
steel." Those, I believe, are the, links which
are going te, bind our Empire together in tbe
future-of incalculable strengtb and incalculable value te, the British Empire.
For ahl that work that the Canadians and
Mr. Mackenzie IÇing are doing on our bebaîf,
I tbank bim most xvarmaly and for tbe speech
whicb ho bias given to us, wbicb I beg to
second.
Mr. CHULRCHILL.: Ail in favour of the vote

Mr. MAcKEsziE KiNu: Lord Chancellor, Mr.

May 1 again tbank tbe Members of the

in being present this afternoon in sucb numbers. May I tbank you very w'armly for the

ADDRESS OF THE RiGHT HONOURABLE JOHN CuirTIN TO MEMBERS 0F THE SPINATE ANI) 0F THE
HOUaS 0F COMMONS, IN THE HOUS 0F COMMONS CHAMBER, OTTAWA, JUNE 1, 1944
(Mr. C'urtin was welcomed by the Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister
of Canada, and Mr. Gordon Graydon, Leader of the Opposition, and thanked by
the Honourable Thomas Vien, Speaker of the Senate, and the Honourable
James Alli.son Glen, Speaker of the Hceise of Commons)
Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister of Canada): Members of
the Senate and of the House of Commons:
We are greatly privileged to have as a guest
of our two Houses to-day the Right Honourable John Curtin, the Prime Minister of
Australia. Mr. Curtin bas kindly consented
to address us this afternoon. Before hie does
so 1 shou]d like, on behalf of the Parliament
and people of Canada, to say just a word
or two to him; and, through him, to the
Parhiament and people of Australia.
It is difficuit to bchicve that more than three
years have elapscd since members here assembled had the honour of being addressed by
Mr. Curtin's. distinguished predecessor, the
Right Honourable R. G. Menzics. At that
time, the war was far into.-its second year.
Nazi .Germany had subjugated most of
Europe. There was desperate fighting in
Egypt, in Libya, in Greece and in Crete, and
on thc waters of the Mediterranean. In al
these theatres of war, and over Europe, fromn
Britain, Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen
had been heroioally withstanding the onslaughts of the enemy, often at great sacrifice.
But not in Africa and Europe only were
the armed forces of Australia on active service. They were serving at that time in
Australia itself, in Asia, at Singapore and ini
Malaya, some, we are proud to say, were training as brothers in arms with our own airmen
here in Canada. On no less than five, continents and on many seas, Australia had dis
tributed bier fighting forces to help preserve
the world's liberties. 'A11 this was even befoxe
Russia had corne into the war. I mention
these things that you, Mr. Curtin, may knoiv
that the recollection of the ser vice rendered.
the world by Australia in those early and
perilous years is as vivid ini our miinds to-day
as ever it was. These memories will
never be effaced.
Appalling as the prospect appeared to your
countrymen, as, indeed, it did to ail the other
peoples of the British Commonwealth in those
first two years of war, that prospect, to you

and to the people of Australia, must have
seemed almost unreal by comparison with the
situation whieh confronted Australia within
two monthis of thé time you became leader of
the Go'vernment.
For years, the Japanese bad been waiting
for the day they might proclaim, themselves
masters of the Pacifie. While you were
denuding your oWn continent of its braveet -men,
and even of its own defences to help save
freedom, in Europe, Japan was extending hier
was stealthily
conquest of China. .She
encroaching on other territories which brought
hier, in full strength, ever dloser to your own
shores. After Pearl Harbor, after the fail of
Singapore, before aid could corne to you from
any quarter of the globe, you and the people
of Australia must have experienced terrible
anxiety. What Britain had to endure, when
she stood alone facisig the might of Germany,
Australia for many months must have feit in
facing the might of Japan. As Britain kept
open the gates of freedoni in the North Atlantic, so Australia and New Zealand kept Open
the gates of freedom in the South Pacific.
The free world will probably neyer realize
what it owes to Australia, what it owes, Mr.
Curtin, to your own sagacious and resolute
leadership. We are anxious, however, at this
moment to express what acknowledgment we
can of so great a debt. With this acknowledgment we wish to give to you the assurance that
just as your forces and ours have been exerting their strength wherever the cail was, most
imperative in this global war; just as to-day
we await with confidence the outcome of the
colossal conflict which will crush for ever the
menace of Nazi tyranny; so on the morrow our
forces will be found dloser than ever at the
side of yours, sharing with our allies in the
total destruction of the tyranny of Japan.
Before caling upon the Prime Minister of
Australia to address us, I shall ask Mr.
Graydon, as Leader of the Opposition, to
loin with me in extending to Mr. Curtin a
unanimous welcome, and our best of wishes for
the safe return of Mrs. Curtin. and himself,

184

SENATE

and the members of their party, to their homeland. We ask them to take with them to the
people of Australia the profound admiration
and heart-felt good wishes of all the people of
Canada.

So I say to you, Mr. Curtin, that it gives me
great pleasure and no small satisfaction to
make the words of the Prime Minister. who so
eloquently welcomed you to-day, unanimous
in the Dominion of Canada.

Mr. GORDON GRAYDON (Leader of the
Opposition): Mr. Speaker, I desire to associate
Ris Majesty's Loyal Opposition and, if I may
be permitted, other opposition groups in the
House as well, with the eloquent and gracious
words of welcome which the Prime Minister
has extended to-day to our honoured and distinguished visitor. We warmly welcome the
Right Honourable John Curtin as a statesman
with a long, honourable and successful parliamentary career, and as a prominent member
of Australia's "fourth estate." His keen concern for the welfare of the common people
and his deep attachment to the cause of
labour, whieh has made such a notable effort
in this wartime period, gives to his visit a
special significance to this Parliament and the
Canadian people.
May I express at this point, too. with what
great pleasure the Canadian people extend
their hospitality to Mrs. Curtin, who has
through the years been such a tower of
strength to her husband.

Right Hon. JOHN CURTIN (Prime Minister of Australia): Mr. Prime Minister, Leader
of the Opposition, Mr. Speaker of the Senate,
Mr. Speaker of the House of Commons, Members of the Parliament of Canada:
I do not propose in any way to fill out in
detail the broad picture of what has been done
by the people of Australia in the war. Indeed,
sir, if I were to speak at very great length,
with far greater power and energy than are
mine, I could not pay a tribute to the Australian people more handsomely than have the
Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the addresses which they have delivered
here to-day: It will be my great pleasure, as
indeed it is my duty, to attempt in some way
to convey to the Parliament and people of
the Commonwealth of Australia an indication
of the spirit that has marked the speeches
which have been delivered, and to express to
them how highly they are regarded in this
great sister Dominion of Canada. I know it
will give them great pleasure, but it will not
lessen in any way their energies. They will
not feel, "Well, now that other countries know
what we have done, there is not much more
for us to do." On the contrary they will
derive inspiration and encouragement from
the assurance we all must experience to-day,
to see to it that what has now been done so
magnificently by the people of the United
Nations will be carried through to completion,
so that those forces of evil which commenced
this struggle against liberty and freedom in
the world will be so decisively defeated that
in the future it will be impossible either for
them or for those like unto them to regenerate
conditions or to nourish ambitions which would
lead to a fateful calamity such as that which
has now overtaken the world as a whole.
You, here, come to this place, the lawmaking authority of a free people, as the
result of the decisions of your citizens. They
have their rights and they express them. They
register their decision as to who, among those
who offer themselves, shall become their representatives, along with other representatives
of the people of Canada, in this great hall of
legislation and, as their trustees, decide for
them the kind of laws that they will be
expected to observe. Nowhere in the world
outside the Dominion of Canada can anything
be said or done which can in any way lessen
the complete authority of this Parliament, as
the law-making authority of the people of

Australia's Prime Minister is just returning
from an important meeting of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers. This Conference has
given new encouragement and added determination to the British Commonwealth and
Empire statesmen, and to the people they
represent, to see this war through to a speedy
and successful conclusion. Our fervent hope
is that this Conference marks only the beginning of even greater things ahead for a
strengthened and more closely collaborating
Commonwealth and Empire in the closing days
of war and in that better world of permanent
peace and plenty which must follow.
We greatly admire and honour the record
of achievement in two wars of the powerful
and heroic Australian forces on the sea, on
the land and in the air. Their gigantie contribution to the fight for freedom, which came
at one critical stage to Australia's very shores,
constitutes an illustrious page in the history
of this war, as in the last.
On the civilian front Australia has a magnificent record to her credit as well, and we
ask Australia's Prime Minister to-day to carry
back to his nation's armed forces and to his
people in general the admiration and praise
of Canadians for all that Australia has meant
to this Dominion, the British Commonwealth
and the United Nations in these stern days of
test and trial.

JU1NE 1, 1944
Canada, to decide for the people of Canada
what it is that the people of Canada ghall be
expected to do.
This principle of the sovereignty of a free
people is integral ta the cause for which ail
of us went ta war. For it will be remembered
that among the very firat things the Nazis
did was to humn the Reichstag, ta destroy the
representative assmbly, ta prohibit the association together of the citizene of Germany
for those purposes for which association
generally is considered desirable. Before they
couid attempt ta destroy the freedom of the
world they had ta restrict it at home. And the
writing was on the wall for the world at large.
when despotism ini so great a country, with so
large a population, began ta plant its heel,
internally, on the civic rights af the people,
an the dignity of the individuai man or woman
ci Germany. From that day onward totalitarianism flot only marked the internai poliey
which Germany was pursuing, but was being
constantly extended across the frontiers,
infecting the states adjoining Germany. And
where that could not be done easily, then the
armed forces of Germany were projected
beyond the territorial boundaries ai Germany
itself.
The decisions that had been reached at the
Peace Co*nference were decisions no longer
respected, and, as a consequence, force became
the instrument with which Germany at home
and abroad proceeded ta, translate its expecta..
tions into what it hoped wouid be fruition.
I need not do more than summarize what
occurred. The rest of the world hoped that
war had for ever been abandoned as a
means of determining international disputes.
It was beiieved that reason could be used in
discussion-could be used, indeed, to decide
differences, of opinion between states as ta
their rights and their duties. Witbin the lives
almost of the present generation the civilized
world had had a bitter experience of the cast
ai war and af all that war means, apart from
its material cost. Therefore they believed
that by assoeiating together it would be practicable ta devise machinery ta prevent a
repetition of occurrences whîch in previaus
ages and, indeed, in quite recent times had
permaitted the peace ai the world ta be disturbed, threatened and destroy-ed. They
believed there could be this alternative whereby, without resort ta force, the righits and
dlaims of those who bad rights and dlaims
could be faîrly and impartially considered and
justly deeided upon.
As I bave said, force rules the world and
bas ruied it. That bemng so, notwithstanding
the great exertions af those who had haped
for a different state of affairs, the fact became

185

clear when Germany marched into Poland.
That march came almost as soon as arrangements could be made, notwithstanding the
fact that almost within a recent day or days,
50 quickly does t4me move now, an agreement had been made at Munich. The most
recent agreement was merely the instrument
whereby Germany had provided an anaesthetic
for the rest ai the world, lulling it into a sense
ai false security and uaing the time factor
in order ta have greater striking power when
it feit the moment had came ta make the
initial onslaught.
No post.-mortem is necessery ta adjudicate
upon world guiit. The facts are themselves
there for ail ta arc. It is true that not only
Australia but Canada and the whole British
Commonwealth were at war when Germany
marched into Poland, because Great Britain
had given a solemn undertaking ta protect
Poland against the intruder and aggressor. The
pledged word of gavernments is the moral
conscience of the world. There cannot be
agreements between nations, there cannat he
covenants between states, there cannot be any
hope for the future of the world, unless high
cantracting parties keep their undertakings.
It is not an easy matter ta arrive at such
agreements, covenants and treaties. A widé
diversity af interests has ta be commingled
in some general unity bef are that can be
reached. When it is reached it meâns so much
ta the world, because, aiter ail is said and done,
the social state of dignity and ai decency, and
the relationships af the cammon man within
his own order or beyond it, rest finally upon
the sanotity af contracts. Thus had Great
Britain given this undertaking-given it in
order ta ensure that there shauld not be resort
ta farce.
lie very fact that Poland was wantanly
invaded was not only a violation ai the word
'that Germany had given through its Government; it also violated the purposes and the
whole spirit which had marked Great Britain's
acceptance af the treaty ai Munich. 1'eace
was destroyed by that act. Who is there anywhere in the worid naw who sees the aggressor
on the mave, wha is able ta put a terminus
ta bis movement? Ie there immunity for yau,
but flot for me? Ah, no; it is not within
the wit ai mani ta circumacribe brutality and
ta limit violence so long as brutality and
violence are permaitted. without restraint ta
extend their boundaries.
Therefore the invasion ai Poland, while involving immediately the people and the territories ai that country, was ini fact an indication
ta the whale world that there was no place
which the Nazis could reach and desired ta

reach that they would flot seek to, reach
unless their strength could ho taken from
them. And war came, as we ail know.
But the list of the belligerents had flot
been made clear. Opportunism is one of the
arts of war-to take advantage of the chance
that cornes to yoli, to be ready to seize whatever be the effccts of geucral military dispositions and the ehh and flow of battie. As il
turned out, Gcrmany, having prepared for su
long against the powors that had made little
or no preparation, not only had the initial
advantage, but because of the sheer momentom of the offensive that liad heen exerted
was able lu miove to the East, thon to the
West and thon tu the South. In a little
while, as il werc, practically the whole of
Europe, territorially and from the point of
view of the econýomic structure of Europe that
was most vital, was under either direct or
indirect Qerman domination.
Yoti saw amid the wreck and misory of
nations the flag of Hitler superseding the
flags of coonitries that for many years had
been proudly practising nut only the prineiples
of liberty, but, in su far as their capacity would
admit, the arts of prugrosa. Norwav, France,
Greece-why add to the list? This gave to
Germany su tremendous a command of
resources that the battie flowed evecn into the
Atlantic.
Il would ho absurd for me to
ociîpy time in describing the strategy of il,
but you can see at once that having taken
control of practically the whole of Europe.
ail that was necessary thon to accore control
and complote the conqoest for Germany was
to isolate Great Britain. So the battle flowed
with the U-hoats and air power to eut off
froma Great Britain the supplies whichi would
enable lier 10 withstand onslaught. By day
and by night the air power of Germany
rained blows devastatingly upon the capital
city cf the motherland of the, British Comnmonwealth. By day and by night from the
depths of the ocean sceped up the ravagera
that soughit the destruction of slips su that
food and equipment which Britain necded
would nul arrive, and that wvhichi xas a
partial deficioncv hecause of lack of preparation would become a r"omplete dcficicncy
because of inability tu provide reinforcements
and frcsh supplies.
You have paid a tribute, sir, to Australia.
May xve nul horo. rovicwiug the world aspect
of this terrible struggle, jointly pay a tribute
to the peuple and ho the Goverroment of
Great Britain, which, standing alune againat
the fury and strengthi of Germany, withastood
the shock? Not only did they withstand it,
but more; they proved that there was in the
peuple of Great Britain thàý resource and
virility and determination and devotion and

gallantry which, at that stage at any rate,
would not permit the forces which awept
through France, which reduced Norway, which
completely decimated the Low Coeintries; the
for-ces which drovo, as it were,-Greece fýrom
its seat of ancient authority and apparently
had su largoly succeeded that the second
helligorent said, "I am in withi yoiL,"-it
would nul permit these forces tu go any
farther.
Ai-d ltaly iîaviag comec in, Great
Britain stili stood.
It is troc that Britain had frienda. There
was the whole British Commonwealth. You
have spoken, sic, of what the Australian
fighting man did. Bol here in thia place may
J now pay a trihue to what the Canadian
fighiting mani did, lu what the Canadian
airman did, lu your hiaving, althoughi unprepared, dcx cloped gi-cal naval strength; to the'
exporiences yoo have had in the war, and to,
your delermination ho do ail Lthal you humanlY
can to se0 il throughi.
Britain was the bastion, but lu that bastion
as opportunity allowed there came the airmon and the mililary strength-yes, and the
naval forces of the whole British Commonwealth; for if the heart should be mortally
attacked how could the nether limba survive?
Australia sent her men-Australian mon went
over long distances; the trulh is that they
xvent because they knew that in fighting for
the freedomn of the world and for the defence
of Britain they were in fact fightîng for
the defence of their own country. Not that
they would not have gone had they believed
that Australia was not menaced; fer being
kith and kmn of a commun ancestry and
ail that gues to make up that vast heritage
of freedomn which bas corne d.own to us
through the ages fromn our forebears who
strugglod for it where they lived in past ages
-ail that would have counled with us as il
would have counted with you. But Britain
stood firm; the forces of Hitler were dispersed
as the wave o~ the sea are broken upon a
f
rock. Hitler, however, foît there wore still
things hoe could. do to complote his purpose of
worl(l domination, which was the central core
cf t1e totalitarian concept that Germany
entertained. Ho turned East for a hreathing
space. su that, nul knowing what might
happen w-hon ho got too far in-volved: in the

Ihere may be ideulogical differences between
political syslems, just as there are economic
distinctions betwveen dominions cf the British Commonwealth-those in the north, Ihose
in the South, those in, the East, and au onyet despite these political and economie distinctions thero are fondamental principlek,

whieh are com-mon to ail and which. most certainly have to be de-fended if the realization
of the freedom of the State in the future, and
of jts hopes for the future, is ever to be made
possible.
Hitler fea.red Russia. Fear was an unwise
monitor; none the less hie drove to the ea-st
and brought Russia into the war. We can
here pay trilbute to Russia for ail that she
has done; ýbut we can do more. We can
express admiration for the colossal way in
which that mighty country has raiied, herself
and energized, herself and, organized herseif
and fouglit in order that the legions of Hitler
could nlot push so far into hier territory as to
destroy ber.
Why go on as a kind of incompetent historian? Yet one is tempted to do so. In time
Germany and Italy, because they had brought
themselves to face the walls of Britain and
the walls of Russia, decided it was desirable
tbat sometbing more should be done. Like a
boit from the blue, the third partner in the
Axis struck-struck like an assassin in the
night. The President of the United States was
having discussions with a special envoy of the
Japanese Government. He sent a direct appeai
to the Emperor of Japan, and the Emperor
repiied with bombing raids on Pearl Harbor
and with attacks on Singapore; replied with
the instruments of bis armed power to bit
simultaneously at two bastions of freedom in
the Pacifie, believing that if bie could neutralize those bastions there would then devolve
upon the United States, as upon Great Britain,
so very long a period for the rehabilitation of
tbose bases and those resources that,' i the
meantime, hie could consolidate his coprosperity spbere and, without very mucb
opposition, possibly be able to go as far as bis
ambitions led bim. If you wilI look at it

It was a very close cali that Great Britain
bad. It was a very close cail that Australia
bad. Just a little more here, a littie less there,
and.tbe resuit mighit have been different. The
margin was not sufficiently large for comfort
for either the Goverment of Great Britain
or the Government of Australia. But the
margin was on the rigbt side. The strengtb
came. The massing of resources in Great
Britain bas gone on steadhly. The battle of
the Atlantic bas now turned from the U-boat
hunting to the U-boat beiug hunted. And sO
in the Pacifie, where Japanese air and naval
power was continuously expanding, Japanese
air and naval power is now on the defensive.
The orientation of the war is different now
from wbat it was. Tbere are varying periods
lu the lives of men, and ail of us bave episodes;
and so it is in war. War is not a statîc thing.
If at the commencement of this colossal
struggle the United Nations -were on the
defensive, and tbe initiative and tbe power
to exert tbe offensive rested with the Axis,
imposing upon the United Nations a holding
strategy, that holding strategy bas been comnpleted. Behind it the requisite strength bas
been marsballed, and the time came, not
simultaneously everywhere, when it could be
empioyed lu limited offensives to weaken the
offensive of the enemny. So the akili and
genius of commanders in aIl theatres was
directed to that purpose, to the point where
the enemy was driven out of North Africabut not without cost, not without a great deal
of time being taken in the campaigu, and not
without a stupendous burden upon the productive resources of this and every other continent that is on the side of the Allied Nations
lu the effort to provide the materiai with whicb
the fighting: men in North Africa could at last
carry through the task of making seime return
for aul that had happened previously lu North
Africa, in Crete, in Greece and thereabouts.
Tben you saw the entry into Italy; and now
you see the battle in Italy raging, and you
know that the battie which has been started is
one wbich we confidently believe will represent the terminal point of German-Italian
collaboration lu any part of Italy. However,
let me do no more than generalize; for hours,
dais or weeks are noit for me to measure. The
cardinal fact is that where the enemy heid ail
the strategicai locations froni which to exert
attacks upon the forces of the Allied Nations,
to-day hie is going backwards, towards Berlin
lu Europe, towards Tokyo lu the Pacific. This
could not have been clone without imposing
upon the civil populations of ail the United
Nations the burdens of war. You canuot
escape the inevitable price which will bave
to be paid for wbat bas to be clone. Soldiers

SENATE
have to be fed; supplies for them have to be
transported vast distances; they have to have
equipment for war vastly different from the
equipment man uses in peace-time. Therefore,
in factories which were producing goods useful
to us as citizens to nourish our bodies, to warm
ourselves, to house us, only a portion of the
materials and the skill and the labour which
had been devoted to that end can now be
devoted to it, and this would be inadequate
to provide more than the minimum scale which
would ensure to the civil population the
measure of health and strength necessary to
the production of instruments of war. Here
that is broadly true; in Australia it is broadly
true. The people have agreed that the greater
claim upon industry shall be to produce the
essentials for the waging of war, that to a
minimum the civil population shall have satisfaction of its needs; that there must be a
drastic curtailment of its wants.
Taxation has been mounting. I am sure
that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the
treasurers of Canada and Australia are quite
delighted in discovering how infinite are the
resources of their various populations. This
burden has had to fall upon the people at
home. They have had to work long hours.
They have had all kinds of exhausting tasks
to carry out. It has been done cheerfully.
Yet no burden that is borne by those who
work in the factories, the fields, or the industries of the country is comparable to that
which has been imposed upon the fighting men,
wherever they are-in the deserts of North
Africa or in the frightful places of the East;
in disease-infected jungles, with no roads, with
fearful humidity, with conditions under which
white men have not been accustomed to live
m any great numbers, let alone to fight.
So that as the obligation which cornes first
to all the governments is that of satisfying and
maintaining the strength requisite to keep the
fighting men fit wherver they may be-and
the civil populations must provide that substance, because there is no other physical way
in whieh it can be done-when the war is over,
the obligations to the fighting men will not
have ceased. The burdens which governments
will carry will be dual burdens-to rebuild the
resources of the country so that the arts of
peace may flourish, and at the same time to
satisfy that solemn debt of honour which all
governments owe to the fighting men, and to
their dependents, for having stood between the
enemy and those at home and enabled those
at home to sleep comfortably at nights and
to be assured that their institutions and their
way of life would not be molested by an
invader.

As I look at this stage of the war I cannot
do other than express heart-felt gratitude to
the fighting men of the United Nations as a
whole and to their commanders, who have
done the most to keep the world from becoming the slaves of despots and of tyrants. Then
I would pay tribute to that quality for concert whieh nations of different political systems have developed, and which I hope and
pray-and will strive to see accomplishedwill be maintained when the war has ended.
You have said, sir, that I have been in
parliament for some years. We know our
parliamentary system. Leaders of the opposition, prime ministers, ministers of state, leading representatives of the Opposition, are all
engaged in what may appear to an outsider as
vain disputation and constant controversy.
The Government can never do anything right,
say the Opposition; and the Opposition has
no resource or capacity to be entrusted with
the Government, say the ministers. Well, that
goes on time and time again. But in all the
great matters of national duty, the maintenance of the social order and the promotion
of the true welfare of the people, the best
counsellor the prime minister has is invariably
the leader of His Majesty's Opposition. That
has been my experience with these political
parties. They bring out the truth as to what
is the right way to solve a problem. We do
not in our parliamentary system ignore discussion. We do not trample down minorities.
We are not overawed by numbers. As a
matter of fact the Opposition is always able
to speak eloquently and effectively-it does
not know quite so much about the problem as
the Government! That has always been so.
Yet you sec in times of crisis the unity of the
people in Australia, in Canada, in Great
Britain, with all our diversities of political
parties and practices and the like; none the
less, out of that discussion and that distinctiveness and that variation in the point of view a
unity emerges. It is the more permanent and
effective. because that is the way it comes,
rather than as a result of the ukase of a
dictator and the fears of those who must yield
to his demands. It is a unity born of the
supremacy of persuasion. It is a unity that
emerges to giv'e triumph to conviction rather
than to cowardice or weakness. It is the
strength born of the triumph of reason.
This being truc of each of our Dominions
in respect of the national unity of our own
people, then you have the representatives of
those Dominions going to a conference. They
are composed in their own countries of leaders
of parties, but they are also the heads of
governments. They meet in London. No
longer do they meet as leaders of parties;
they meet as heads of governments, respon-

JUNE 1, 194418
sible ini ail they de for the presentation of
what ie the considered view and consensus of
their Dominions as Dominions. They feel
certain that the view they put has to stand
not only the test of immediate criticismn but
the test of time; for by their agreements they
may commit their country to a point of view
-not to any surrender of the sovereignty of
the Parliament and the Government, but to
the promotion of a generie idea which wilI
lead to coneerted action and co-operative
endeavour.
Need I do more than just illustrate to you
how significant to students of history is the
fact that you could get at one table Mr.
Roosevelt, the President of the UJnited States
and leader of the Democratic party in that
country; Mr. Churchill, the leader of the
Conservative party in the United Kingdom,
and the leader of the United Kingdom, and
Mr. Stalin, the Premier of the Socialist
Republice of Russia. There they met. They
did not meet to discus whether Conservatism
is good or bad, or whether this particular type
of politîcal idea is better than another. They
met to concert measures to serve the world.
The British Commonwealth Prime Ministers
met, certainly with lesser problems and with
lesser status, but none the less as a microcosm,
as it were, a smaller association to promote
concord, to help each oCher to devise formulas
and to make arrangements, so that in a world
where noue of us is strong enough to stand
alone we shall discover how and by what
means we can best stand with and for each
other.
This brings me then to my final thought;
for there you have the problem of statesmanship in the years to come for ail governments
that are anxious, as ail should be, and 1
believe are, to have regard for the welfare of
mankind. What is the worst cvil that can
come to us? It is to be taken away from the
promotion of the social and economie progress
of our country in order that so many thousands, indeed millions, :of useful persons in
the fields, workshops, mines and the like shaîl
no longer be available to produce the things
that will minister to man's comfort, but be
set apart i a vast army to engage solely in,
resistance to another vast army, imposing
upon aIl those who have been left behind the
double burden of feeding them and feeding
with inadequate resources the whole population of the globe.
.We eee maa's history interrupted repeatedly
by warsby 'bitter strif e, by this ghastly loss to
civilization. Upon the great nations, then,
surely there falà the responsihility of making
it clear that that association wh'ich war has
meant for us--for Russis, fer the Uni'ted
States, for the British Commonwealth, these

three great powers, together with China, that
great land mass and teeming population in
the far east-these four who have subscribed
themnselves to the Charter-means that their
great resources ivolve also high responsibilities.
What is their major responsibility? Just as
they could agree and find ways and means to
pool their strength to reast a brutal foe who
threatened their homes, their liberties and the
sovereignty of their peoples ini their own affaire,
so surely this strength, s0 prodigious in the
present service of freedom, is a strength which
can be maintained and made use of in order to
prevent a recurrence of calamities such as
Hitler and his Axis collaborators have forced
upon an un-willî.ng, indeed a victimized world.
I make a -plea here in this free Parliament
for the average citizen, for the shopkeeper, for
the mother of forty years of age with sons and
daughters who may be eighteen, sixteen or
twel.ve; for the next generation; for tibose who
are unborn; for my grandchildren, if there be
any. Let us, since we have found fraternity
and association and collaboration so indispensable to get the strength with which to meet
the ettack, preserve that association and use it,
nourished by the genius of statesmanship, to
ensure that the world shail not have a recurrence of this dreadful and indeed abysmal
conduct whereby the sword has become the
instrument of governiment, instead of the light
of reason, which, despite ail that may be said
by the crities of de.mocracy, can give to a free
people nlot only as clear a vision of the future,
but a capacity for decision, for right decision,
which. the totalîtarians can neyer attain.
May I thank you very deeply for the great
honour you have done me this afternoon in
inviting me te speak to you. I come from a
country small in point of numbers, a couzntry
of seven million people. We have an area of
approximately three million square miles. We
are in the south Pacific. Think for one moment
about the map of the world and have a look at
the lands that are south of the equator-South
Arnerica, South Africa, Austrafla, New Zealand
and the number of emnaller islpnds scattered
about, mainly in the Pacifie. Consider the
characteristies of the people that live in those
parts, and Yeu will understand me when I say
that the struggle to preserve Australia was a
struggle to be of service to the worid.
Right Hon. MACKENZIE KING: I would
asIc the Speaker of tihe Senate and the Speaker
of the House of Commons to eiypress our
thanks to Mr. Curtin for the very eloquent
address which hie bas just delivered to us.
(Translation) :
Hon. THOMAS VIEN (Speaker of the
Senate): Mr. Prime Minister of Australia,
the Canadien people are, as you know, largely

SENATE
of British and French extraction. I arn very
happy to be given the opportunity of expressing te you in my mother tongue, one of the
two officiai languages of this country, the deep
gratitude of the Senators, of the Members of
the flouse of Commons, and, indeed, of the
whole people of Canada, whom you have
honoured by this visit at the conclusion of
the historie London Conference and by the
graeious and very moving words you have
just spoken.
Your great reputation, Mr. Prime Minister,
aas preceded you in this country. You ýcorne
f0 us in the radiance of the glory with which
your feliow countrymen covered themselves on
every hattlefield during the first Great Warand of the even greater glory which they have
achieved during the present confliet. Australia
has, carned the eternal gratitude of mankind
for. having heroically wifbstood the Japanese
onrush which swept in like a tidal wave from
the Far East.
Thanks to the wise and
courageous leadership that you have given bier,
your country lias brought bier war effort fo the
highest pitch, and made a tremendous contribution to the United Nations.
Canada has heen in the West the link
joining the Old World and the New. Your
country hias played an identical role in
Southern Seas, where you have created friendly
relations wifh the great Arnerican people,
while remaining united hy sacred and unbreakable ties to the heart of the Empire.
If gives me great satisfaction to express te
you the unbounded affection and admiration
of Canadians for you personally and for aIl]
our Australian brothers, and te convey to yen
our warmest thanks for tlie encouragýement
that we have receîvcd from your presence
among us and from yeur very comforting
words.
(Text): God hless Australia
and the
Australians and their distinguishcd Prime
Minister! Cod bloss our soldiers, sailors and
airmen! Cod givo us a glorious, speedy and
decisive victory, and a lasting peace to the
world.
Hon. JAMES ALLISON GLEN (Speaker
of the flouse of Commons): Mr. Prime Minister, it is with singular pleasure that we
welcome and thank yen for your presence with
us.
We have had many notable and disfinguisbed
visitors during the last four years, and to-day
we bchold two of the Prime 'Ministers cf the
great dominions speakîng from the floor of
the flouse of Commonis in Canada, our own
Prime Minister. the Riglit flonourable W. L.
Mackenzie King, and the Prime Minister cf
Australia, the Righf Honourable John Curtin.
To add te the importance of this gathcring,
these very distinguisbed gentlemen have ar-

rived in Canada fresh from a meeting of the
Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth of
British nations, in London, during whicb, if is
no exaggeration f0, say, issues affecting the
whole world and countless millions of people
for countless years have been the subjects of
deliberation. This is net the occasion te refer
te those issues, but 1 think it is permissible te
say that at no time in our hîstory were the
bases cf our democracy, and in particular free
and untrammelled speech, hetter exemplified
than in the recent meeting. It is eminently
proper that the central purpese-to win the
war--did net preclude that equally momentous
purpose-the vision cf a new warld order based
upen the policies of co-operation and good
neighhourliness.
Sir, ail will agree you made a notable contribution to that meeting, and yoeu are eutitled
te say that in the essentials, in the bro-ad
scheme, of affairs, having regard ýte the geographical, political and social prohlems, there
wvas agreement-a lesson for -ail the world te
note.
We shahl neyer forgef these tragie days when
your country wvas in serions and imminent
danger cf an invasion in force by the Japanese.
Those days were fraugbt with greaf peril, and
it must be a matter of justifiable pride te you
te refleet that under yeur leadersh.ip Australia
rose superier te the threat, withstood and
ultimately safcguarded bier shores from a crue]
and remorseless foc. Now your country and
the other United Nations are destroying that
Japanese menace.
You, sir, are not a stranger fo the floor of a
flouse cf Commons and, while the report bias
ît that fthe vocabulary cf your Assembly is
vivid as ifs southern sun, I think this gathering to-day of befli our flouses demonstrates
that, the coldness cf our northern words serves
but te conceal the warmtb cf our welcome te
yen.
I am glad te say that four of our colleagues
cf this flouse wvill soon bave an oppertunity fo
convey te your Assembly in sinicere and adequate terras our friendliesf regards and greetings te Australia, reciprocating those wbich
some cf your colleagues bronglit te us here
last year.
Sir, Canada tbanks you for yeur fine speech
aod yonr presence among us. We wish yGu a
safe return te your native land, and we hope
that the time is net far distant when we shahl
meet again in tbe happier days when this war
shall cease. Tewards that end your country
lias madle an enormens contribuntion, and when
you speak te your ewo people tell them that
ahl Canada fervently declares:
Well donc,
Austra lia!
The proceedings were concluded hy the singing cf God Save the King.

WAR APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2
MOTION FOR SECOND REÂDING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. J. H-.RING moved the second reading
of Bill 132, an Act for granting to His Majesty
aid for national defence and security.
Hon. Mr. KING.

H1e said: Honourable senators, Bili 132 is an
Act to provide the money necessary to sustain
the armed forces and other war activities of
the various departments of Governmnent. It
will he rernerbered that in March we voted an
rnterim supply bill of $850,000,000, which was
related to this main Bill. The resolution precedîng the present Diii was presented to
Parliament on February i1. No doubt this
is the rnost important messure that Parhiament
will have to deai with this year, and it was
only to be expected that there wouid be long
and protracted debate in the other Chamber.
The Diil itself was introduced onIy on the
6th of June. In order to serve the convenience of honourabIe members, as well as to
have the figures on our own record, I ask
permission to place the Minister's surnmarized
statement on expenditure on Hansard.
In presenting the resolution, on February il,
the Minister of Finance subrnittcd to the other
House a surnmary of estirnated expenditures
by the various departments during the current
fiscal year. As I think it wouid be a convenience to honourable members if these
figures were included in our own Hansard, I
ask permission of the House to have this done.
(Tables appear on following pages).

This session we bave followed the practice,
as adopted in 1942-1943, of referring bis
dealing with war expenditures to the Special
Committee on War Finance. That committee
bas hehd a number of meetings et which ministers a.nd their assistants or other qualified
departmental officers have been available for
i.nterrogation by honourable members. I arn
satisfied that honourable members Who found
it convenient to attend these meetings have secured vaiuable information, not only as to the
expenditures under this Biii, but in relation
ta the activities of the various departments.
The Minister of Finance was represented
before the committee by his Parliarnentary
Assistant, the Deputy Minister and other
officers from bis Departrnent. The Minister
of National Defence was represented by bis
Parliamentary Assistant and departmentai
officers. The Minister for Naval Services and
the Minister for Air attended in person, as
did the Minister of Munitions and Supply
the Minister of Labour and the Minister of
National War Services. Tbe Departments of
Agriculture and of External Affairs and the
National Research Council were represented
by Deputy Ministers or qualified departmental heads.
As honourable members will sec frorn the
statement that 1 arn placing on Hansard, the
estimated expenditure by the Department of
National Defence in the current fiscal year

JUNE 21, 1944
will be $3,057,000,000, as against 83,405,000,000
last year. The reduction does flot in any way
indicate a let-up in our effort to increase the
strength and efficiency of the fighting services.
The expenditure was larger last year because
of the neeessity to provide training facilities
for members of the services, to erect buildings,
construct air fields and so on.
The estimated expenditure by the Department of Munitions and Supply this year is
$183,000,000.
Last year this Department,
which acts as the agent for procuring supplies
for the defence services and for AlIied goverfiments, spent a total of $166,300,000.
To other departments of Government which,
strictly considered, are flot war departments,

193

the sum of $375,000,000 has been allocated for
this year, as against 8249,000,000 last year.
The increase is made up largely of additional
administration expenses' and subsidies to be
paid to the Commodity Prices Stabilization
Corporation, as well as subsidies to be paid to
food producers by the Department of Agriculture.
I think no useful purpose would be served
by my attempting to give a recapitulation of
the statements made by ministers in the other
Chamber. We know that to-day the three
defence services are manned by some 700,000
to 800,000 men and women. Ail these services
have demonstrated in actual combat their
superb training and dauntless courage.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I am sorry to interrupt
the honourable leader, but I do not think
Bill 132 is on our files.
Hon. Mr. KING: It should be; it bas been
in print for weeks.
Some honourable SENATORS: It is not on
our files.
Hon. Mr. KING: I will see that it is distributed. If honourable senators prefer to
wait, there is no reason why we should not
adjourn until copies of the Bill are available.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I should like to have
the Bill, in order to study it.
Hon. Mr. KING: Undoubtedly. I
only a few further remarks to make.

have

Some honourable SENATORS: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. KING: During the past year our
army, after long and arduous training in
Canada and Great Britain, bas been in action
in Italy and Sicily; and within the last few
days it bas, in conjunction with British and
American troops, been one of the spearheads
in the invasion of France. We are all justly
proud of the wonderful achievement of our
soldiers.
The Royal Canadian Air Force is a development of the Commonwealth Air Training
Plan. This plan bas become the backbone of
the combined air power of the Empire. Its
young men are found on every front. And
what a magnificent performance they are
giving!
The development of our Naval Service is
also an achievement that we all are proud of.
It has received commendation, net only
in our own country, but also in the great
republic to the south, and as well in Russia,
China and other Allied countries. I think
the Department is to be congratulated on having realized that though at the outbreak of
war we could neither build nor acquire cruisers
or battleships, we could build smaller types
of ships, sueh as the minesweeper, the corvette, the Fairchild, the frigate, and later, the
destroyer. We did se, and these smaller ships
have been among our most effective weapons
against the submarine, which, as honourable
members are aware, was at one time the gravest threat to our war effort. They have been engaged in patrol duty and used in amphibious
operations against Sieily; and a few days ago
they played a conspicuous part on the coast of
Normandy, where, as a compact naval force,
they protected and facilitated the landings of
our soldiers and their equipment. In that operation some ten thousand crew members and
seamen were Canadians. I am sure that we
Hon. Mr. KING.

in this Chamber, and the people throughout
Canada generally, realize that those men have
performed and are performing to-day a great
service in the interest of the Allied Powers.
It is our hope that within a short while
the efforts of the men in the three services,
who so ably represent Canada in this war,
combined wit!h those of their various Allies,
will bring the war to a successful conclusion,
and that our men will be returned to their
homes to enjoy the fruits of victory, for which
they fought so ably.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable rnembers I do not intend to enter into a detailed
criticism of the Government's handling of the
different departments of the war, and I want
to say at the outset that we on this side of
the House, as always for the last four and a
half or nearly five years, are prepared to support the war effort in every particular. We feel,
as does the leader of the House, that our
men in the Army, Navy and Air Force, already
have given and will continue to give a good
account of themselves. A great many honourable members of this House have their own
boys over there, and they speak with personal
feeling.
I do want, however, to call the attention
of the Government and of the members of
this House to one or two things this country
is drifting into. Already the manpower question bas been raised outside the House, and it
will be raised more persistently as time goes
on. There are three ways in which manpower
in Canada can be dealt with. First, it can be
dealt with by conscription-by sending men
any place in the world where they are needed;
second, men can be left to work on the farms
and in the factories, or wherever they may be,
and third, there can be a form of conscription
that will not send them to the fighting fronts,
but which will take them off the farms and
out of the factories. The last is the policy of
this country now, and to it I am violently
opposed. If it is the opinion of the Government and the majority of the people in this
country that men are net needed any more
at the front, or that they can be got by voluntary enlistment or in any other way than by
conscription, then the Conscription Act should
be withdrawn, and seventy thousand men who
are promenading up and down this country
should be allowed ýto go back to their occupations. That is as plain writ across the skies as
anything can be, and nobody can defend any
other course. I am net saying that we should
have conscription or that we should not have
conscription; but for the life of me I cannot

JUNE 21, 1944
sc why we shcvuld have a hy-brid sort of conscription which takes men away fromn their
work and does nlot send them where they cani
be of use.
We are asking our farmers, our lumbermen,
our fishermen and our miners to produce more,
and yet we are taking fromn them some of
their very best workers, and are putting them
into these camps. Take my own province, for
instance. I know of young men who have been
sent to camp there. You may ask: "Why
dont they go to the war?" That is nlot for
me to decide. But if they do flot go to the
war-and apparently the Governinent do
nlot think they are needed there, because they
do nlot send them-why take them off the
farms and leave behind such cases as one I
know of and shail describe? A man of ý52 and a
woman of 49 are left with a 'boy of 16 en a
section of land; their other boy, of 20 or 21,
is up at Shilo camp forming twos or threes,
or. whatever they form. That is the.situation.
Hon. Mr. KING :May I interrupt? ls not
that happening everywhere? You have a manpower situation in ail countries, whether they
have conscription or not. It is happening in
the United StatesHon. Mr. HAIG:

No.

Hon. Mr. KING: It bas ýhappened in Gerrnany; it is happening in ail coun-tries.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:- No, it does not happen in
the United States. True, there is a shortage
on the farrn in that country, but the United
States has declared, "We need that boy off
the farm. to go to Europe or Japan to fight."
If the Governrnent here says that, I have
nothing further to add. But why should. my
boy or yours go, and another boy who is
needed be left? If it is the opinion of the
GoveSnment that these men are needed to
go over and fight, I shall not have a word to
say against conscription. But the Government does not say that. These men have been
prornenading up and down the country for the
last two and a haîf yeaxs; they are lectured;
their officers tell them. they should join Up and
go overseas. That is not necessary. That is
what I object to, and what this country
objects to--and that was. one of the issues in
the Saskatchewan election. I live right alongside the province of Saskatchewan and know
the conditions there. The issue is clear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask the
bonourable senator a question?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Would the honourable gentleman favour disbanding the home
armyi at the present time?

20a

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I shahl answer that clearly.
The Government have ail the facrts, and
apparently think they do not need these men
overseas, because if they do they could send
thern there. If I had the facts and came
to the saine conclusion, I would let these men
?ut of the camps and send them home. That
is my answer. Give me the facts. If they
show the men are needed overseas, I will
be prepared to send them. If they are net
needed, as would appea-r to be the case, I
wouId send them home, to the factories, the
farms and the warehouses.
Inciden-tally I may say that of this
$3,650,000,000 something like $150,000,000 has
gone towards the cost of keeping that crowd
going. It is a sheer waste of money-worse
than waste-for these young felows are not
doîng anything. Se rnuch for maupower.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask if the
honourable senator knows how rnany men
are engaged in guarding power plants in this
country, and whether or not the provinces are
willing to take over the policing of these
plan-tg?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There are lots of experienced men in the Veterans Guard of Canada
who are quite willing and anxious to guard.
these plants. The men I arn talking about
are at Gordon Head, British Columbia, at
Shilo, ManitobaHon. Mr. KING: And in O'ntario.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -and ini Ontario, and
probably in Quebec and the Maritime Provinces. I -know only about the West. I am
talking about men who are net guarding anything and who are eating their hearts out.
You say: "Why don't they volunteer?" That
is not rny business. So far as the job you are
thinking about is concerned, the Veterans
Guard can do that, and do it very well too.
Now, the next problem we face is reconstruction after the war, and in that conneetien I -divide manpower into three classes.
First, there are the soldiers overseas, who when
they return mnust be given first consideration
in thîs country. They are the chaps who took
the chances, and they mnust be assured one
hundred per cent of employment when they
corne back. If they corne back wîth disabilities we have to take care of those disabilities,
and see that they are put into occupations
where they can earn, including their disability
pensions, as much as they would have earned
had they not been disabled. After the last
war rnen applied to the Canadian Pacifie
Railway and the Canadian National Railways,
and were told: "No. You have a rnilitary disability of ten, twenity or twenty-five percent."
The men said, "We will take a reduction of

SENATE
that arnount." But they were told. "We don't
want you at ail. You cannot stand up to the
struggle of life in this way." That is what we
have to protect our boys against. The second
class is cornposed of those people who went
into war industries from other occupations.
We have to see that they are ernployed. Mfter
that the rest of us corne in.
Now 1 corne to another problcm that we
are facing, that of free enterprise and socialism,
or whatever you carc to eaIl it. I arn not going
to discuss that issue, but I arn going to discuss
sornething which is Ieading up to it, narnely,
our present incorne tax. At the present timne
we tax corporations on their average income
over the years 1936 to 1941.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: 1936 to 1939.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Whatever the years may be
-and we charge 40 per cent on ail that is
O.K. and we take 100 per cent of the balance,
20 per cent of which we hold to give back to
the industry after the war. Then we say to
industry: "We want you to be prepared to
give these mnen jobs when the war is over." I
do not think they can do that. I think the
principle is wrong. It is my opinion that
excess taxes on corporations have to be
reduced, in order to release rooney so that
industry may be prcpared to change over to
peacetirne operations after the war. I may
tell you quite candidly that, if I were a socialist or believed in socialisrn, I would keep the
present incorne tax in force as far as corporations are concerned, for I know that so fiar
as rneeting the requirements after the war is
concerned they would be harnstrung.
Let rne digress for a moment. We talk about
this grandiose scherne proposed by that distinguished educationist frorn a city east of
here, Professor Jarnes. You will remrnber
that we asked hirn a question in the Comrnittee on Reconstruction, and his whole case
was based on an incorne of eight billion dollars. Now, we can only have such an incorne
by getting a large share of world trade.
Hon. Mr. IDUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: And we can only get a
large share of world trade by selling goods on
world rnarkets in coropetition with other
countries. We have raw materials to seli, I
agree, but they would not be enough. We
found out they were not enough before the
war, when our inccrne fell below four billion.
We can only have an incorne of eight billion
dollars by using the rnoet efficient mrachinery,
as developed during the war, for manufacturing goods that will be saleable in coropetition
with goods produeed by the rest of the world.
If we are to pay for the social security that is
talked so rnuch about, wc rnust capture world
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

mnarkets for our rnanufactured goods and for
our prirnary produets as weII. I shahl deal
with that later on.
As to incorne tax, I have already said what
I think should be done with regard to the
corporation incorne tax. I arn persuaded that
this will have to, be reduced if the cornpanies
in this country are to be ready to furnish the
required ernployment after the war and meet
world coropetîtion. May I say one rnore thing
about the incorne tax irnposed upon corpýorations? Suppose a rnan of sixty-flve years of
age has with bis savings bought a certain
arnount of International Nickel sto-ck, in the
hope of getting enough incorne froro it to keep
hirnself and bis wife. According to the cornpany's earnings he should receive frorn that
stock, let us sny, $1,200 a year, but the
Dorninion Government takes $600 of this frorn
the cornpany, so he gets only $600. Is that
fair? Another rnan, with an equal arnount
of International Nickel stock, rnay have an
incorne of 510,000 froro other sources, yet the
amount of the cornpany's earnings deducted
frorn bis sto-ck for federal incorne tax is the
sarne as is deducted froro the stock of the moan
who bas nothing else to rely upon for in,corne. Our principle of taxing corporations is
absolutely unfair. That fact will be recognized
in tirne. If I were a CCF'er and wanted f0
put the corporations out of business, I should
advocate a continuance of this kînd of taxation, for peuple will ne'.er put new money
into business enterprises so long as this sysfemn
of taxation is rnaintained.
Now I corne to personal incorne taxes. The
present exernption of 5660 a year for a single
person is not enough; if should be 51,000.
The exemption of $1,200 for a rnarried person
is also f00 low; if should be 52,000. The rernainder of the tax scale should stand as if is
unfil the war is over. The people on whorn
the present incorne fax fails rnost severely are
those earning $3,000 or under, and they are
the very persons who ought niot to be bearing
such a heavy burden. A rnan who earned
510,000 before the war paid a fax of 5650;
on such an incorne now he pays slight]y more
than one-third to the Governent, $3,400.
On an incorne of $20,000 the pre-war fax was
$2,800, and now if is 59,837. I do nof object
to taxing these larger incomes in this way
while the war is on, but I say that we are
faking too rnuch frorn the people in the lower
brackefs. Whaf is the result of the present
taxation? Every day we meet men who refuse
f0 work ýovertirne, hecause fhey say thaf the
Governrnenf would fake rnosf of their extra
earnings in taxes. Man after rnan bas fold rne
thaf.
I repent, honourable senators, that the
income exernptions should be raised f0 at least

205

JUNE 21, 1944
the limita I have suggested. Sornebody may
ask how much money the Government would
loac if that were done. I do not know; I do
nlot care. I amrn ft altogether imbued with
the idea that we should pay half the cost of
this war as we go along. I ar nflt sure that
that is correct. What about the coming
generation? If we are right ini saying that we
shall make a peace that wil last for one
hundred yeara--as we can do, if 'we make the
right kind of peace-should the coming generations nlot pay something towards the achievement of that great goal? Why should hall
the total cost be borne by people who are
living while the struggle ia going on?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Who is to pay for the
reconstruction after the war?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: According to what was
said in another place by the Prime Minister,
there will be plenty of money for that.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Where is it coming from?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He did not say.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Social Credit will
print the money, it la said.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There will be plenty of
money for reconstruction, if we sell our goods
on world markets, as we must do. But we can
only compete successfully on world markets if
we give business and industrial people a chance
to get ready for conditions after the war. If
we hold them down as we are doing at present,
they cannot get ready.
I ahould like to say juat a word about
individual initiative and effort. I do not
believe Canada will ever adopt socialism as a
method of governmnent. It may be that in an
election this year, or next year, or five years
from now, the majority of members elected ta
the House of Commons will be advocates of
the theory of socialism. I do not know;nobody knows. But I do believe that people
who have been used to free individual enterprise-mainy of whom have risen to the top of
their professions or occupation from humble
circumstances--will neyer consent finally ta
the establishment of socialism. However, we
have one Socialist government in our Canada.
That new government la ini Saskatchewan-it
is very emphatically there-and that province
îs a neighbour of Manitoba, from which I corne.
Now I want to say candidly to honourable
members of this House that I do not believe
the people of Saskatchewan voted for socinlism. And upon listening to statements made
by the Premier-elect after the election, I do
nat think that he voted for it either.
But, honourable senators, while we must
not do anything ta hamper or curtail individual
initiative and enterprise, we must sec that

these are properly controlled; we must do
alI we can to prevent unfair practises in trade
and the est.ablishment of large cartels. It la
our duty to see to it that the people of
Canada as a whole, the ordinary people, are
given a chance ta earn a good living. As
senators we have a great responsibility in this
crisis. The people of Canada will look to us
to help selve this country's great problems.
We need ta give serious thought to our
manpower problcm, to our taxation problem,
and ta the struggle between socialism and
free enterprise. I arn not a bit afraid of the
socialists' statement that the Senate should
not exist. I arn persuaded that the Senate
has a mission ta perform in our country.
Whatever political feelings we may have had
before we came into this House, they should
disappear here. We should try ta put ourselves in the place of people who are starting
life, people who have ta earn their living by
the sweat of their brow or by the use of their
brain. We must endeavour ta pass legislation
that will extend the opportunities for our
people ta earn their livelihoad. I earnestly
hope that there will be such an extension of
opportunities aftcr the war. In the meantime I say ta the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. King) that if the war in Europe
continues much longer and many more men
are needed for reinforcements, I arn persuaded
that the Governmcnt's present manpower
policy will have te be radically changed.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, my
honourable friend from Westmorland <Hon.
Mr. Black) expressed a desire ta study this Bill
before it was given second reading and sent
ta committce. As he is absent from the
House at the moment, I would move adjourument of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Copp, the debate

Owed to the Government

Hon. R. B. HORNER: bonourable sena;tors,
I do not know whether I arn in order, but I
would urge ýthat capital expenditure sbould be
made immediately the war is over, if not
before, on an addition to the Macdonald hotel
in the city of Edmonton, on one of the finest
hotel sites in Canada. Edmonton is short of
gond hotel accommodation and is asking for
new hotels. The hotel might very well be enlarged to the extent of two hundred additional
rooms. This would provide employment, and
the extra accommodation would certainly return a revenue on the investmenýt.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Do the Canadian National
Railways mun that hotel now?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Certainly. The hotel
already has adeqoate service rooma, and an
additional two hundred rooms would entail
comparatively little additional expenditure.
The city needs more hotel accommodation,
the railway needs it. and the cxpenditure
would be well justified.
bon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators. I
think a much more important undertaking
than that mentioned by my honourable friend
from Saskatchewan North MHon. Mr. borner)
would be -the elimination right in the centre
of the city of Moncton of five level crossings,
ahl within a distance of a quarter of a mile.
It is a double-track bine, whicb is being usedand abused-for shunting purposes, to the
grave danger of the citizens.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read tbe second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

bon. Mr. KING:
Honourable senators,
probably it would be well to refer this Bibl
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, wbich committee will, I thînk,

JUNE 21, 1944
WAR APPROPRIATION (UNITED
NATIONS MUTUAL AID) BILL
1944
SECO)ND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 138, an Act to amend the War
Appropriation (United Nations Mutual Aid)
Act, 1943, and for granting to His *Majesty
aid for the purposes of the said Act.
He said: Honourable senators, -1 may say
iis hoped that this and the other financial
Buis which were given first reading'hast night
may receive Royal Assent next Friday, and
therefore 1 think it would be advisable to
advance them a stage further this afternoon.
This Bill provides for a grant of $800,000,000.
It is similar in character to one which came
before us hast year, for a grant of a billion
dollars.
War finance has always been a, grave
problem for nations involved in war. Prior
to the Great War of 1914-1918 victorious
nations were usually able to recoup themselves
by way of cash indemnities, acquisition of
territory .or other concessions from defeated
nations. It will be remembered that Germany
claimed the indemnities imposed upon bier by
the Treaty of Versailles were beyond bier
power to pay. I believe it is the general
opinion to-day that had Germany made the
effort thnt she required France to make in
1870 she could have carried out bier treaty
obligations.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is right.
Hon. Mr. KING: As we ail know, Germany
succeeded in having an international committee set up to review the question of ber
ability to pay. That committee recommended
a reduction in the indemnities; and eventually Germany defaulted. We also know
that Germany prevailed upon the United
States and Great Britain to loan ber large
sums of money, ostensibly for the purposes
of reconstruction in order that she might be
in a position to meet her obligations to the
Allied Nations.
France and Italy and othier debtor countries
found it impossible to continue payments on
account of their war boans from the United
States, and the largest creditor nation had
to grant a .postponement of such payments.
This caused so much consternation among the
American people that the Congress enacted
legisiation prohibitîng the sale of arms and
ammunition to nations at war except under
special export permits. Subsequently this
prohibition was modified by a policy of "cash
on the barrel." That policy was in effect

207

when Great Britainand France found themselves in 1939 and 1940 opposing the armed
inight of Germany.
Later on it became evident to the people of
the great republic that if the French and
British armi,es were to be sustained in their
challenge of Hitler's plan for world domination
it weuld be necessary to devise means to
permit those nations to secure mu-ch needed
war supplies. The President of the United
Siâtes recomxnended, and Congress adopted,
what is known as the lend-lease principle.
Under the resulting legislation large amounts
of war supplies have been made available to
Great Britain, and we know from experience
and practice that as between the governments
of the two countries an operation bas been
going on which can be truly classed as lendIpase. Gireat Britain, when facilities are available and it is advantageous to do so, has been
making advances to the United States. The
United States have aided flot only Great
Britain in this matter, but since coming into
the war have sent large quantities of supplies
to Russia and wlso, to China. I read the other
day that somne ten million tons, I think, of
supplies, were shi.pped to Russia in American
ships by the northern route, largely protected
by British naval power.
In the first days of the war, we in Canada,
both in Parliament and throughout the country
generally, decided upon an all-out war
effort. We have buiît up our armed forces.
In addition to that, when Great Britain was
embarrassed in the matter of currency in
1940-41, we advanced one billion dollars by
way of boan, and made a free gift of one
billion dollars. These sums were voted by
Parliament, and 1 arn quite satisfied that this
action was approved by the people of Canadau.
We have arrjved at a point where our productive capacity in arms, equipment and food,
is much ýbeyond the requirements of our own
forces and our own people. We have found
that a very large surplus can be produced not
only in our factories but in our fields. This
being so, last year the Government decided to
set up a committee of the cabinet which, in
conjunction with similar committees in the
United States and Great Britain, were to
decide-where this surplus of production might
best serve the interests of the allied cause.
Last year the sum. of 3100,000,000 was appropriated for this purpose, some $75,000,000 of
which went to Great Britain, Russia, China
and Australia.
The present Bill calis for $80,000,000. This
is $200,000,000 less th-an was required last year.
If honourable senators think for a moment,
they will recall that at a previous meeting of
the Senate we passed a Bui authorizing the

208

SENATE

Government to advance $10,000,000 to UNRRA.
That $10,000,000 came out of last year's
appropriation for mutual, aid, and it is provided
that the moneys Canada has agreed to advance
to that organization will come from this appropriation of $800,000,000. Under the Bill
before us it is proposed to enlarge the committee, and an additional Minister will be
appointed. I think it is important that the
Minister of Trade and Commerce should be
a member of the Committee.
It will be recalled that some weeks ago,
we tabled agreements with the governments
of Great Britain, Australia, Russia, China, and
the French Committee of National Liberation.
In those agreements the terms are clearly set
out as the manner in which aid will be given
to those countries under this Bill. I consider
that those are the important matters in regard
to the Bill, and I would commend it to the
favourable consideration of the Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Does the honourable
senator intend to send this Bill to a committee?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. It is my purpose
to send it to the Committee on War Finance.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators. I should like to add a word or
two to what has been said regarding Bill 138,
because it relates to a subject which I think
should be clarified as far as possible for the
benefit of not only ourselves but the taxpayers of this country. For that reason I
am glad the Bill is to be referred to committee, where further details can be obtained
from the Minister who is in charge of this
matter. Incidentally, most of us, I presume,
have received a copy of the report of the
Canadian Mutual Aid Board. I would recommend to honourable members a perusal of its
details, particularly in relation to the mutual
aid operations with Great Britain.
I should like to point out at once that
to date $2,700,000,000 have been appropriated
under the heading of lease-lend and mutual
aid. The vote of $800,000,000 which we are
now asked to support brings the total up to
$3,500,000,000.
In the amount thus appropriated, as has been pointed out by the
leader, there is included $77,000,000 for the
United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
Association, $10,000,000 of which was generally
discussed and approved in this Chamber just
before the recent adjournment.
T-he mutual aid operations which are provided for in this Bill apply to our relations
with Great Britain, India, Australia, Russia,
China, the French Committee of Liberation,
and the West Indies. While these amounts
voted for mutual aid represent a part which
Hon. Mr. KING.

this country is proud to play in the prosecution of the war, in addition to direct participation through the Army, Navy and Air
Force, it should be borne in mind that each
year these amounts enter into our national
debt and have to be paid for in taxation.
The term "mutual aid" may seem somewhat
ambiguous to some, because our grants towards
the cause are being made without expectation
of repayment; but in reality there is a mutual
interest in all the Allied countries with which
we are dealing in this matter. The mutual
aid does apply to a greater extent to Great
Britain than to any of the other countries.
As I have pointed out already in this
connection, a most enlightening statement is
set forth in this report. It shows that while
Britain received munitions, foodstuffs and
supplies to a value of some $724,000,000 up
to March 31, 1944, during the same period
she bought goods in Canada, and paid for
them, to a value of over one billion dollars.
It is often pointed out in these days that
the technique applied and followed by the
Allied Nations in these mutual aid operations,
to serve our common cause in this war,
indicates that as soon as the war is over a
similar form of procedure will be followed
among the nations of the world in the cause
of peace. We may well hope that this will
prove to be truc. The future is being formulated in many quarters just now in a rather
facile manner by the statement that the vast
production and economic activity induced in
Canada by the war should be maintained in
times of peace, and that if countries like this
can give full employment in war-time they
are bound to find ways and means to do the
same thing in peace-time. Without attempting
to analyze or discuss that proposition, either
from the moral or economic point of view, we
can say that if this country, as well as the
United States, is to maintain and gradually
reduce the great public debt which the war
is creating, too much stress cannot be laid
upon the principles which underlie the farreaching international effect of existing mutual
aid relations. They present to the world, it
seems te me, the inescapable conclusion that
if order is to be brought out of chaos, and
production and employment are to be continued in countries like ours, an unrestricted
exchange of goods and services must develop
and prevail.
Two great factors in reaching this end will
obviously be required: first, as was pointed
out in our discussion on the subject of relief
just before the adjournment, the physical
availability of supplies of goods and materials
through production; and second, the will on

JUNE 21, 1944
the part of representative governments
throughout the world to distribute such
supplies as widely as possible. In the meantime, howcver, the common cause of the Allied
Nations must be served. For that reason we
have no alternative but to approve the
provisions of this Bill. I trust that when it
goes before the committee there will be a full
investigation of mutual aid operations, so that
we may realize for future use, possibly, rather
than for the present, the element of mutual
aid now involved in them.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.

SENATE

Hon. TELESPHORE D. BOUCHARD:
Honourable senators, I will beg leave of my
honourable colleagues who are more conversant
with English than French to speak a few
minutes in my mother tongue before making
my main remarks on the motion of the honourable senator from Sorel (flon. Mr. David). If
by chance my words are worth while and are
not fully understood by some of them, they
will lose but a few moments of their time,
as I shall repeat my French remarks in
English.
Monsieur l'Orateur,
Honorables sénateurs, une des principales
lacunes que l'on a mentionnées dans les diverses histoires du Canada des provinces anglaises, serait le fait qu'on laisse ignorer que
la langue française est officielle dans les deux
Chambres de notre parlement fédéral.
Au cours de mes remarques sur la résolution de l'honorable Sénateur de la division de
Sorel, je n'ai pas l'intention de m'arrêter
sur la critique des manuels en usage dans
les provinces anglaises. Je n'ai certes pas
les informations voulues pour rendre un jugement valable sur ces manuels et je crois que,
dans une matière épineuse comme celle-là,
il vaut mieux laisser aux citoyens de chaque
province le soin de signaler eux-mêmes les
faiblesses de leur propre enseignement de
l'histoire canadienne.
Si, au début de mes observations, je parle
en français, c'est que, me levant pour la
première fois dans cette honorable Chambre
pour prononcer un discours, je désire d'abord
rendre hommage à ma langue maternelle et
signaler ensuite ce fait important de la légalité de la langue française dans un parlement d'allégeance britannique.
Qu'il me soit permis de dire que je ne
conclus pas du fait que la langue française
est officielle dans ce pays, qu'elle y serait obligatoire; je ne suis pas de ceux qui voudraient
imposer chez nous, aux Canadiens d'origine
anglaise, l'obligation de parler notre langue
de manière à ce que sans s'imposer aucun
effort d'étude, ils puissent compendre tout
ce qui se dit dans nos parlements. La loi
constitutionnelle, et c'est juste, ne va pas
plus loin que de rendre les deux langues principales de ce pays facultatives dans nos parlements. Ceux qui désirent comprendre tout
ce qui se dit ici, dans la Chambre des Communes et dans les Chambres de la province de
Québec, restent dans la nécessité d'étudier
les deux idiomes. J'admets, et par là je ne
me rends qu'à l'évidence, que les Canadiens
d'origine française ont beaucoup plus besoin
d'apprendre une langue seconde pour leur
développement économique que les Canadiens
d'origine anglaise; l'anglais est parlé sur ce
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

continent par tout près de 150 millions de
population alors que nous sommes à peine
5 millions dont le français est la langue
maternelle. A chacun de décider si c'est son
intérêt d'apprendre les deux langues. Tout
Canadien en viendra à cette conclusion s'il
désire nécessairement comprendre les deux
idiomes officiellement parlés dans nos deux
Chambres fédérales; autrement il devra attendre la publication et la traduction du Hansard
pour savoir ce qui s'y est dit.
Au cours de mes remarques, je reviendrai
sur cette question pour signaler certains à
côtés que produit une mauvaise interprétation de l'histoire du Canada teille qu'on l'a
enseignée et que l'on continue de l'enseigner
dans les écoles de ma province.
Honourable senators, one of the gaps that
have been mentioned in the present debate
as existing in the various history manuals used
in English-speaking provinces of Canada is the
omission of the statement that the French
language is official in both Houses of our
federal Parliament.
In my remarks on the resolution of the
honourable senator from Sorel, I do not intend
to criticize at length manuals in use in Englishspeaking provinces. I have not the necessary
information to pass fair judgment on these
text-books and I believe that on a question
as delicate as the one under discussion it is
better to leave to the citizens of each province
the task of finding out and correcting for
themselves the weaknesses in their own teaching of Canada's history.
If I spoke in French at the beginning, it
was because, rising for the first time in this
House to address my honourable colleagues, I
wanted to pay tribute to my mother tongue;
and, secondly, I desired to point out the
important fact that the French language is
legal in this Parliament of a British country.
May I be allowed to state that in referring to
the fact that the French language is official
in our proceedings, I do not imply that it
should be compulsory. I do not belong to the
group of people who would force Canadians of
British descent in this country to speak a
second language so as to be able to understand
casily all that is said in Parliament. The
Constitution does not go farther than to make
both our principal languages optional in
Parliament, and it is only fair that this should
be so. Those who wish to understand everything that is said in the Upper Chamber, in
the House of Commons and in the Legislature
of the Province of Quebec are under the
necessity of studying both languages.
I am ready to admit-the truth is evidentthat for their own economie development
French-speaking Canadians need to learn a

JUNE 21, 1944
second language more than English-speaking
Canadians do. English is spoken on this continent by some 150 million people, while we
who speak French as our mother tongue number hardly 5 million. It is up to each
individual to decide whether it is in his own
interest to learn both languages. Any Canadian wilI inevitably come to the conclusion
that it is, if he wîshes to understand what is
said in the two languages offlcially spoken in
both Houses in Ottawa; otherwise, for the
meaning of what is saîd in one of these
languages hie will have to wait for the translation appearing in Hansard.
In the course of my remarks, I shail come
back to this question, to point out some of the
consequences resulting from a- false interpretation of the history of Canada as it was taught
and is stili taught in the schools of my
province.
I believe that speech was given to men to
enable them to communicate their ideas to
other men rather than to glorify the little
corner of the earth where they happened by
chance to be horn, and that, after ail, speech
is simply the vehicle of thought.
I also believe that when in "honest comnpany," as cultured people of the seventeenth
century used to say, it is becoming to speak
the language understood by ail, and so I
take the libcrty of carrying on in English.
I aum little concerned with the opinions of
narrow-minded people who, 1 know, will not
fail to critîcize me severely for having delivered
the greater part of my maiden speech in
English. Such attacks will not be the first
ones of this character that I have had to meet
in my long career.
In spcaking- this language I shall be coinpellcd, much to my regret, te folIow the
advice of Monseigneur Laflèche, who once
said-I was young then-"ýSpeak English, but
speak it badly". Our educators necessarîly
translated these words indo "Teach English,
but teach it hadly". They heeded the. advice,
and applied it faithfully, not only in our
elementary sehools but also ln our secondary
schools and universities.
It was a bad
philosophy, borrowed from a badly taught
history of our country, which inspired with
this false attitude those to whom our former
legisiators had entrusted the education of the
masses. As a result, after leaving elementary
school, 1 learaed praetically ne English whatever in what we called our secondary studies.
The little English that I know I have assimilated from English newspapers and books
which I have read in order to keep
myseif informed of current events and to
study the trend of ideas. Bo I apologize if I
arn offending the cars of honourable members
106--151

who are accustomcd to hear the heautiful
language of Shakespeare spoken as it should
be by those who know its secrets.
This motion has as its main purpose the
placiag in the hands of our children of any
language and creed a text-book in which the
main facts of our Canadian history shaîl be
related according to truth, with due perspective, and interpreted in a way that will tend
to create a real Canadian mind in ahl sections
of this vast and promising country. Though
there may bc differences of opinion as to the
best wording of the text so that it may have
a better chance of producing its full effeet, I
believe there is among us unanimîty of
opinion on the necessity of attaining its ultimate end-Canadian unity.
la this Hlouse no doubt we all sincerely
desire Canadian unity; for we know that
Canadians have everything to gain 'by beiag:
united. But can we make the saine statement
for ail those outside these four walls, even
though there seems to be unanimity in the
declarations of fidelity to Canadian allegiance
and of a sincere desire for unity between our
distinct racial groups?
I am sure that it is the lack of unity la the
minds of our people on national questions and
in somne of the actions of our younger generatien, whose concepts of unity are as far apart
as the two opposite poles of a magnet, that
have prompted mny honourable colleague to put
this resolution un the Order Paper la bis earnest desire to serve bis country. Ia my short
speech I shaîl, I1hope, prove that he is to be
congratulatcd on having hro*ught this matter
so opportunely before this bEluse and the
,country at large.
Like my colleague from Sorel (Hon. Mr.
David), I believe the time has long since
corne to improve the tcaching of Canadian
hîstory in the sehools of the province of
Queibec. We have to judge a tree 'by its fruits,
and I am sorry to state that the results we
are actually reaping are far freim being satisfactory.
An Hon.. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hlon. Mr. BOUCHARD: In fact they are
rather discouraging to those who thought we
could, and stili persist in thinkiag we can build
a country in which the descendants of two
great nations and two great cultures will live
and thrive la peace and harmony.
It is by exposing in the open what actually
exists in my province, by showing our true
history in the making, which proceeds fromn
the false history that the past and the present
generation have been taught ln our own
sehools, that I shail show how u.rgent it isto,
make a radical change in this teaching. Canadian history sho-uld not serve as a tool of sub..

versive propaganda in the hands of those who
are aiming to. disrupt Confederation and overthrow our form of democratic govern.ment.
1 sec, honourable senators, that most of you
are astonished at these declarations from a man
who bas been in active polities for more than
forty years. I amrn ot a visionary, far fromn it,
but 1 believe that, as was said long ago,
eternal vigilance is the price of safety. It is
heause they have forgotten this rule that the
democratic nations are now plunged in the
worst inferno of war ever known to humanity.
To superficial minds the question of recommending a uniform text-book on Canadian
history may seem of littie avail, but if we go
to the bottom of things we shall clearly realize
its vital importance.
Nobody will contest
that opinions, even firm beliefs, on national
and religious questions are formed nearly a
hundred per cent in our schools, mainly fromn
thue teaching of hist-ory.
I will show that Canadian history is badly
taught in our sebools, flrst by reading some
excerpts from the lessons sought to lie iýmpressed on the receptive minda, of our yo-unger
generation, and, secondly, by describing the
subversive tendencies we actually find in a
surprisingly large number of our educated men
up to the age of forty-tendencies created hy
the way in which Canadian history is taught
in our public sehools.
1 do not ýpurpose to dwell at length on
Can-adian history as tauglit in the sebools
of the Province of Quebec and, as I have said,
1 shall not; venture to comment on the merits
or demerits of the text-book of the English
provinces. In this case, as in many others,
I thinlc it wise for everylbody to, follow the
adrvice of t-he old philosopher: "Medice, cura
te ipsum."
"Doctor, cure thyseif!" If in
every province we do cure our own ilis the
nation at large will be healthy. I do not;
mean that a consultation of experts would
not be justifled; far frDrn it. I believe that
the consultation recommended by this resolution is even necessary. But I just want to
point out that at this stage of the question
laymen in history, as 1 arn one, should restrict
themselves to deploring the deficiencies of
bistory teaching in thieir own lingual realm.
Wýhet.her or not this resolution is adopted
in its present or some amended form, whether
it, will -have full effect as adopted by this
buse or remain in t.he records of the Senate
as a dead letter. 1 believe it will he of some
help to those who are trying ta build up a
real Canadian mind in the two most important groups of our fellow citizens, the founders
and main builders of this country-Canadians
of Frenchi and of English descent.
The question of having a uniform manual
of Canadian history appears simple ta those
Hon. Mr. BOUCHARD.

who have lived long, have studied much and
have realized that they are in a new world.
Most of them have been led to sec the great
benefit that would accrue to both races and
crerds if this country of ours were permeated
with a real modern and North American
ideology as to the relationis th-at should exist
between people of different onigin and differcnt creed. They see in a proper teaching
of Canadian history a sure way to attain that
goal. -A manual of basic facts accepted by
each province would necessarily tend to
smootb the road to good understanding
between us aIl.
But in reality the question is rather complex when we consider that in any section
of this vast country we are far from having
dissociated ourselves from the old European
clannish ýmmd. In fart some of our people
axre trying to, rebuild in our country one of
the small provincial kingdoms we had in
France in days of yare; while others, unsuspectingly led by a latent but powerful
colonial mmnd, will not realize the fact that a
few d-ecades aga we became a real nation, fiat
the scion îssued from a noble plant has itself
grown to be a noble tree.
Rome was not built in a day. It is no
wonder that we do not vîew in the same light
the important problems on which there should
bce unity of mind among those who have a riglit
to dlaim diversity in things wihere diversity
not only can but in fart should exist. It is
whcn wr have to make distinctions between
the tbings on which we should bave unity and
those in which diversity can exist without
prejudice to the common interest that we can
sec the complexity of the question now raised
in this Ilouse.
A unan of honest purpose bas to concede
that important frictions exist between Canadians of Frenchi and of Englisb descent.
Differences of religion and language are,
thougli thcy should not be, fertile fields wbere
the sowcrs of the se-eds of discord work day
and night, but mostly in the dark. Tbey
forget that the founder of our Christian
religion lias said, "Be brothers" and that on
t.he British Commonwealth coat-of-arms we
see the Frenchi motto, "Dieu et mon droit".
Our colleague fromn Sorel sees in the past
and present teaching of Canadian bistory in
our French and Englisb sebools one of the
main causes of these frictions, and to my
mind lie is perfectly rigbt in bis conclusions.
The little I was tauglit in schools from my
carlier days to my graduation in science and arts
did not tend-no, far from it-to give me the
Canadian mmnd whicb my post-sebool studies
and the realities of if e bave since inspired
in me. I pursued my science and arts etudies

JUNE 21, 1944
as a day-boy, and was less subjected than the
boarders to cramming on language and creed
matters. This is most probably the reason
why when I left the seminary, I decided to
look around before closing my mind on some
of the most important problems of life. 1
was fortunate in having as my first boss a
Canadian of Scotch origin, although you would
flot have recognized him as such by the perfect French he spoke. In bis office I learned
that Canadians of English descent were flot
ail cloven-footed and did flot aIl bear horns,
but on the contrary entertained the very samne
good sentiments as did we of French descent.
Why had I been led to believe those siljnesses? Why, like my young comrades, was
1 full of prejudices against those who were
flot speaking my language and flot going to
the samne church? Since my infancy I had
been taught that everything the FrenchCanadian had to suifer came f rom the fact
that he was of French and Catholie descent.
By referring to two or three paragraphs
of one of the most circulated Canadian histories in our Quebec schools--this history
bemng typical of those that have formed the
opinions of the French-Canadiari on race questions-I wiIl show the reason why I had been
înduced to fiee as much as possible the coinpany of Canadians of other racial origins, and
I will clearly prove that one of the most
important school subjects for the forming of
the -national mind is far from being taught
in the way it should, be taught in our French
province.
As I want to give mýr hearers the opportunity of verifying the accuracy of my quotations, I shall refer them to the text-book
entitled: "History of Canada, Elementary
Course, by the Brothers of Christian Science,
approved by the Council of Public Instruction for primary scbools, elementary grade,
on the llth of May, 1910-3rd edition". On
page 72 I read:
Paragraph 134-The Englieh without taking
into consideration the act of capitulation,
abolished (1763) the French laws to replace
them by those of England; ail the Canadians
were compelled under penalty of baniffhment to
swear the Oath of the Test, or of supremacy,
the heretioni formula of which was revolting to
the conscience of Catholica.
Paragrapyh 135--General Murray, named Governor General (1763), mitigated the rigor of
the new regulations and did not exact theuTest
Oath.
We have to note that these two conflieting paragraphs are on the, samne page, <72)and follow one another.
On the next page, (73), we read under the
title "Canadian Clergy", paragraph 2:
The clergy gave direction to the courage and
the good-will of the still inexperienced Cana-

213

dians; it helped them to withstand oppression
and injustice and inspired a loyalty which
forced England ta give back to French Canada
ail the privileges conccded by the treaty of
Paris.
May I point out that thîs treaty of Paris,
which the author cites as a document by
which England had conceded most important
privileges to Canadians, is the very samne
treaty of which, on the opposite page it is
said:
-all the Canadians were compelled under
penalty of banighment to swear the Oath of the
Test, or of supremacy, the heretical formula
of whioh was revolting to the conscience of
Catholics.
How is it that the author can find some
good in a treaty in whicb, accordîng to the
page following, he bais seen only bad things
for the Canadians?
On page 74 we read:
Paragraph 137-General Murray was recalled
in 1766; Guy Carleton, who replaced him,
adopted towards French-Canadians the wise and
impartial policy of his predecessor.
From this paragraph and paragraph 135,
which I have already quoted. a man having
the slightest sense of reasoning would infer
that under both our two first Governors
General the French-Canadians had been fairly
well treated.
Let us see what our public school historian
says of them, in his appreciation of their
conduct. On page 75, exactly opposite paragraph 137, which I have just quoted, we read:
1. Since 1763 the Canadians 'had to complain
of a government which did not do justice to
their rig hts. Public places were given to a
crowd of soldiers of fortune w-ho ignored the
French tangue; the Test Oath was keeping them
away from state businesses; even their religion
was hardly tolerated.
If the Governors had some say with the
government of the colony, how can ynu set
this rash statement against the fact that the
author had just said that Murray did not exact
the Oath of the Test; that he had toned down
the harshness of the new regulations, and that
bie had. adopted towards the French-Canadians
a wise and impartial behaviaur, as did bis
successor Guy Carleton?
Now before closing this Canadian History,
let us proceed to page 79 headed, "NarrationAnglici.zation."
There we aee the general
appreciation of the author on the first decades
of the English regime and the trend of the
whole book. Here ia the first paragraph in ail
its crudity:
The end pursued by the policy of England in
the early times of its administration in Canada
was ta anglicize the Freneh-Canadian nation,
to rob it of its religion, of its language and of
its national customs.

SENATE
It is true that at the end of the narration,
after seventeen lines of the type of those I
have quoted, the pupil can read:
England ended .by granting to the FrenchCanadians ail the privileges possessed by free
and inrlependcnt pceoples.
It is cîcar that the writer was forced by necessity to put these two lines in bis text-book,
because even a cbild of ten years could neyer
have understood how it came about that after
se many years of tyranny and oppression bis
race and religion were as free and prosperous
as he found themn in bis own time.
The first point I wanted to make in my
remarks was that ouir bistory was not written
as it sbould be for tliose wbo believe that
barmony bctween the two great races living
in this country is possible and most desirable.
I bave given a typical example of our
Canadian bistory as it is taugbit in our
Quebec scbools. Tbe contradictory statements
1 bave quoted clearly demonstrate tbat tbis
teacbing cannot be according to facts, but is
intended to prejudice young minds against our
compatriots of a different tongue and creed.
It is un-Canadian, even unchristian.
The
founder of Cbristianity bas neyer preacbed
tbat one man sbould rise against anotber
because of differences of race and language.
Tbe second dernonstration I wanted to make
was tbat those wbo tauight Canadian bistorv
to divide the Canadian nation on racial and
religicuis lines biad now attained tbeir ends
to sucb an extent as to imperil our internai
peace. It is the perrneation of tbe souls of
,otr past and present generations of sebool
children, college pupils and students by a
false Canadian bistory and a still falser
interpretatien of its real events, that bas
hrouglit us te this point. Among Canadians
of Frencb descent tbere are some of us who,
uinlike the bird of the dcsert wbichb unies its
bead in tbe moving sand 50 as to avoid
faeing danger, are willing to open our eyes
to any serious situation. We tbink the time
bias come-let us pray God tbat even now
it is flot too late-to stop a subversive
prepaganda, intensified by tbe state of war
whicb bas existed for over four years, wbich
tends to bring us before long to mob rule
and perhaps to civil war.

SENATE

The movement against teacbing English in
our primary schools was intensified, and it
came fo a point where fathers of familles noted
that their sons and daugbters were making
no progress in the Englisb language. One day
one of my neighhorrrs came to see me. 11e
wanted one of bis boys to Icarn English;
be was discouraged at bis slow progresa, though
he was quite an intelligent lad. He did not
know why in the school whicb bis boy attended
Englisb was taught by a teacher who bardly
could say "Ycs" or "No," when one of tbe
brothers who had come from the United States
was fully conversant witb tbis language. I
told my ncigbbour tbat if was probably because the good brotbcrs did not want fbeir
pupils to learn English.
Later on be returned f0 my bouse and told
me this sfory. A cousin of bis from a city in
Ontario, a teacber in the same congregation,
had come to Saint-Hyacinthe t0 visit him.
My friend bad told hima that it seemed
tbe teacbers in tbe scbool whicb bis elder son
was attending did flot seem to be willing f0
bave their pupils lcarn Englisb despite the
necessity for Frencb Canadians f0 learn this
language. Tbe cousin was astonisbed and said
he did nof undcrstand if. 11e added tbat as
he was to meet the brothers tbat very night
he would discuss the question and make inquiry about it. The next day. my friend
related, his cousin came to sec bim, bis mmnd
entirely changed as regards Englisb teaching.
With a radiant face, as if bc liad rcalized the
moat ardenfly soughit object of his life. lie cxclaimed: "What would yo-u say, my dear cousin,
if in fifty years there would net be left in the
province of Quebec one solely Englisb--speakîng citizen?"
My friend, complet ely dumbfounded, retorted: "Have you become crazy?"
"No," he answcred. "Tbe orders come from

man of tbe upper clergy, now dead.

In the edition of L'Emerillon from whicb
1 have taken these excerpts, May-June, 1937,
tbere is a long article promoting tbe adoption
of a national flag for the Frencb-Canadians:
royal blue background, large white cross and
fleurs-de-lis et the four corners. In this article
the writer reminda bis readers tbat the Order
lias sîîcceeded in cbanging tbe iname of the
Montreal Harbour Bridge f0 Jacques Cartier
Bridge, and of Fletcher Fields f0 Jeanne
Mence Gardens.
Tbrce weeks ago, the
war bcing in full swing, the Order elso succceded in pcrsuading the beeds of the Montreal University to consecrate this fiag as the
real labarum of the noný.existing FrenchCanadian Catbolic state by raising it to tbe
mast of fbe ten million dollar building crccted
witb governmcnt money, thet is money belonging not only to those favouring tbe sce&sion
of our province, but mainly fo Cenedians truc
f0 their political systcm and the British Commonwealth of Nations.
This was done on the top of the mountain
overlooking the largest cif y in Canada, in the
presence of tbousands upon tbousends of
citizensq, hy the blcssing, by an eminent
Catholie pricst, of the old fiag of Louis
the XV as ftbe national fleg of Canadians of French desccnt. Evidently there are
lots of people wbo play witb fire witbout
knowing it.
The deformation of the mind of some of
our fellow-citizcns bas gone so far that those
whio went to corrert facts of our history that

JUNE 21, 1944
have been rnisrepresented are treated as
traitors to their race and religion. One of
our most eminent historians, Abbé Adélard
Mabeux, a member of the Royal Society of
Canada, professor of Canadian history at
Laval University, a year or two ago wrote a
book entitled "What Keeps us Apart?" This
volume followed one bearing the titie, "«Our
Beginnings under the Englisb Rule". Because
Abbé Maheux wanted to be honest about the
rmal facts, because his .philosophy of Canadian
history is that we should be good neighbours
witb our compatriots of different origin, he
bas ip. the last few years been the centre of
an unparalleled stormi of abuse fromn our
separatists and isolationists of every description. That most respectable priest was banned
as a traitor to bis race because hie spoke the
truth. The terrorismn against hima went so
far tbat lately a meeting before wbicb he was
to give a lecture had to be cancelled tbree
times in the week preceding its delivery.
The lecture was given, however, but under
tbe protection of municipal, provincial and
federal police.
One of the most active and open organizations of the Jýaques Cartier Order is the Young
Laurentians. In May last they published a
manifesto. To give you an idea of what our
reactionaries think of Abbé Maheux, a true
Canadian, I read on page 7 these silly words:
A cat is a. eat, Abbé Maheux is an extinguisher, an obscurantist.
And now to show the real objective of ahl
the political, religious and co-called patriotic
organizations controlled in secret by the
Jacques Cartier Order, let me read a few
paragraphs of the message of the general
president under the titie, "Our reasons for a
revolution":
I will tel] you that it is our duty to hold
the situation in hand. I wil tell you morè;
it is pressing to forin leaders. Leaders, it is
the only reason for our movement. For a
revolution that srhah] ho ours, for the true
interests of the French-Canadian people.
And t-his revolution that we want shall be
practical, efficient, cahm and good, because it
calîs for pure, fundamentally Catholic and
French men. It is the revolution of the
liberated Spain, or the organized Portugal, of
France under Pétain.
The paternity of the association is easily
traceable to the Order of Jacques Cartier when
we read on page 12:
.and especially, Discretion! Do flot commit
the error to pronounce yourself as a Young
Laurentian. We formulate this request to the
individual flot to the member.
I do not think it i s necessaxy for me to dwell
much more on the subject to convince honourable members that a wrong teaching of Cana106-16

dian bistory ini our province bas already done
nearly ail the harmn tbat could be desired by
those who are ini favour of disunion ini this
country between peoples of different languages
and creeds. Their ultimate aim is flot only to
disunite the people on lingual and religions
matters, but also to disrupt Confederation, to
abandon the more human Nortb American
concept of a -large nation composed of- people
of different religious beliefs and racial origins,
and to revert to the old European concept of
smaller nations of the saine religious and
racial descent.
As I bave shown, the field is fairly well
prepared, at least for a flanking attack on our
political institutions. The underground workers
have already succeeded in destroying the
Quebec Liberal-Conservative
party.
The
former association of Liberal Conservatives
witb the "castors" or ultramontanists of the
old school made this job an easy one for the
leaders of our hidden Fascists. Anti-war
preaching against democracy and liberalism
has not yet succeeded in breaking the Quebec
Liberal party.
What effeet thse efforts of the enemies of

thse Jacques Carties Order; and it may be that
at the last moment, if the liberty-loving
people do not open their eyes in good time,
they will see to what extent underground
work bas undermined our free institutions.
Some will 'blame m~e for having openly
expressed rny thoughts on Canadian History
as taught in our Quebec scisools, and especially for having shown what is going on in
our upper and lower classes on thse political
situation behind thse curtain, wbere tbe actors

to be hoped that the representatives agreeing

association to take the mnatter in hand and
see that at least everything tending to disunite the people of this country shall be
eliminated from text-books of Canadian bistory and that only the real and proven facts
shall be taught to our younger generation.
We have to huild our new generations along
different ]ines front those that have prevailed
up to now, and, speaking for my province, I
hope the day will corne when English and
French citizens will realize that they have
everything to gain by being at least good
neighbours if they cannot corne up ta
the evangelical perfection of being good
brot-hers. I must confess that I should like
to have painted another picture of the situation in Quebec; but I thought it my duty

DEBATE CONTINUED-SECOND

READING

The Senato resumed front yesterday the
adjourned dehate on the motion for the second
reading of Bill 132, an Act for granting to His
Majesty aid for national defence and security.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
when this Bill came hefore the House yesterday, my honourable friend frorn Westrnorland
(Hon. Mr. Black)-I do not sec him in his
seat to-day-asked that the second reading ho
delayed, as at that time, owing to an omission,
the Bill had not heco distributed. Conse.
quently, I moved the adjournment of the
debate. Therefore, inasrnuch as I arn now
on my foot out of regard for what my honourable friend said, I think it may not ho out
of place for me to take a fewv minutes of tirne
this afternoon to answer sorne of the remarks
made yesterday.
This Bill is one of several of a sirnilar nature
which have corne to us during the hast four
years to provide the requirernents necessary
to carry on the war, as we pledged ourselves
ta do in the beginning and have atternpted to

JIJNE 22, 1944
do since, so that it may be brought to a successful conclusion. In order to do that, as
everybody knows, it is necessary to spend
large sums of money from year to year, and
it is very gratify-ing to notice that while se
criticisms may have been voiced during the
four years these bhills have been coming' to us
from the other chamber, nobody has made
any objection whatever to the size of the sums
asked for.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COPP: This has been lef t ta the
Government, which is responsible for providing the materials necessary to the proper conduct of the war and, in fact, the bis have
been passed unanimously.
As far as this Bill is concerned, a very long
debate took place in the other Huse, continuing, I think, frorn the llth of February
until the &th of June, when the Bill was finally
passed there. So far as I have been able ta
read the report of the speeches in that
House, there was very littie, if any, criticism
of the amount asked, huge though it may be.
There was, however, a great deal of discussion
as ta how this amount should be broken down,
and as to what proportion should go ta one
service or another. There was criticism also
along the lines af what my honourable friend
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) said yesterday with
respect to the contrai and management af the
man-power of Canada.
In his opening remarks yesterday my honourabie friend referred to the ways and means
by which man-power could be obtained in
Canada. He mentioned the conscription of
men generally-s-omething which bas been open
to question ever since the last war. He
referred also to voluntary enlistrnent, the
mnethod upan which we depended very largely
during the asat war and also this war. In this
connection, I think 1 should say that the
young men of Canada are to be commended
on the high spirit of patriotism they have
shown in volunteering ta go ta the front to
defend those of us who can only do aur part
by paying taxes and maintaini«ng the supply
of the munitions of war and whatever else may
be ueeessary ta bring us ta final victory.
Speaking of the Mobilization Act, my honourable friend said:
Such is the policy of this country now, and
ta it 1 arn violently opposed.
1 may say that hie did not speak as violentiy
as his words would indicate. Nevertheless hie
took strong objection to the Mobilization Act
and ta the manner in which the man-power of
Canada was being handied. He continued:
If it Wsthe opinion of the 'Government and
the majority of the -people in bhis country that
106-16j

219

men are flot needed any more at the front, or
that they eau be got by voluntary enlistmnent or
in any other way than by conscription, then the
Conscription Act ahould be withdrawn, and
seventy thotisand men who are promenading up
and down ti country should be all-owed ta go
back ta their occupations.
In the first place, I 'want ta say ta my
honourable friend that ta some degree I agree
with him as regards that situation, but 1 would
suggest that we must keep ini mind the conditions that have existed since the outbreak of
war. When the Mabilization Act was passed
Canada was i a more or 1ess perilous state.
U-boats were then lurking around aur shores;
in fact, ships were being sunk by U-baats in
the guif ai St. Lawrence. The steamer Caribou,
which sailed between Cape Breton and Newfoundland, was torpedoed in the Gulf, with the
bass of a number of lives. U-boats were discovered within a few miles of the safety gates
protecting the entrance ta Halifax harbour.
I do not ueed to mention any other f acts, for
I arn sure honourable senators will agree that
with conditions as they were at that time the
Government, which. is responsible for the
protection af the country, proceeded wisely in
seeking the advice of military and naval
authorities and acting upan it.
The Mobilization Act was passed and as a
result a cansiderable number of men were
conscrîpted, if I may use that term-perhaps
1 shouldsay, enllted-for home defence. Fortunately aur country bas not suffered greatly
from enemy attack, and I arn bound ta admit
that possibly the risk of aur being attacked,
bas been lessenig from time ta time. I hope
it will continue ta lessen. Nevertheless I feel
that at this time, when we are facing the
greatest criais ai the war, it would be a mistake
ta repeal the Mobilimàtion Act and thereby
destroy the nucleus of au army which we
naw have in readiness ta go overseas, if
required.
I repeat that the members af this army are
in readinesa ta go overseas, if required. The
decision as ta whether at any time they are
required must be left ta persans who knaw
more about the facts than 1 do. My honourable friend said that we have about 70,000 men
in training here, and I presumne that number
is approxirnately correct. If the Departmen t
af Defence and other powers that be sho'uld s I
any time conaider that those men are neede' I
ta replace casualties among aur fighting men
overseas, I arn sure the Mobilization ActI
wouid authorize the sending of them ta the
places where they would be ai moat service.
The men in this army have been given very
valuable training, and it seems ta me it wouid

be the part of wisdom to maintain thei nat
thoir present point of efflciency until they are
needed elsewhere.
We have the most conclusive evidenco that
woll-trajned mon make the best soldiers whon
they go to the front. We know what splendid
work is being done by our Canadian soldiers;
in France to-day.

Well, wo ail are asking for facts. We ail

reqîiired these men for reinforcemonts ovorai as. Think what would happen in the meantimne. The men would have become scattered
ail over the country, and their value as soldiers
would have greatly depreciated because of the
lapse in their training. Furthermore, ail the
training camps wýould have been closed. To
obtain reinforcemonts it wouid ho nccessary to
pick up these mon again, whierever they could
be found, reopen the camps and thon do our
best to get the mon back into as good shape
as tbey were when discharged.

Continuiing bis anîswcr to the question as to
wiîetiîr hoe would disband the mon in the
ho.me defence army, my honourable friend
went on:
If tiiey show tbe mon are nuedcdl overseas, I
w iii bc propaîod te seiid tlîemi.
If they arc not
nieodod, as woild appoar to ho the casp. I would
senti tlieinî homo, te the facorieý. the ternis aad

I repeat my opinion that now, of ail times,
it would ho a groat mistake to repeai the
Mobilization Act and disband ail these men
who stand trainod anti ready to ho sent oversoas, if requii-ed as reinforcements.
My honourable friend bas spoken not only
in this House but in variaus parts of the
country in regard to the Government's responsibility in carrying on this war. We ail realize
that the responsibility doos rest upon the
Goverament. but it is well known that ever
sinco the war began the Government bas
sought counsel from the ablest mon available
in ail the different branches~ of war activitv.
Everyone knows that not aIl members of this
or any other Government are supermen. I
spcak frein exporionce when I say that some
very ordiaary men are at times to ho found
in the counicils of governinent. But, as I say,
the present administration lias foilowed the
practice of cngaging the hest available mon to
supervise and carry through the numerous and
important undortakings made necessary hy the
war. Somo of these men have served without
salary-they are commonly known as dollara-year-mnen-and othors have been paid for
their services. I thin-k it will be agreed that
in general they have carried on their respective tasks with a high degree of suceess.

My honourable friend paid oloquent tribitte
to our soldiers for the splendid mannor in
which they have conducted themselves in the
various theatres of this war. I join with him
wýholc-hoartedly in that tribute. We arc proud
to know that our soldiors, sailors and airmen
are doing mucb to help bring this war to a
sucecessful conclusion. Their great contribution towards victory is recognizcd flot only in
Canada, but throughont the world. The statesmon of ail the Allied nations have paid high
tribute to the splendid work that bias been
donc and is being donc by the fighiting forces
of Canada, and have testificd over and over
again that in this respect our mon stand
second to none.
My honourable friend also made tome referonce to conscription, but as hoe did not say
just what ho feit about that question I do
not propose to discuss the matter. It bias not
become an issue in this country.
When the honourable gentleman was speaking in regard to domnobilization, the bonourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
asked hum this question.
WVould the 'honourable gentlemuan favour disbanding the home army at the pr'esent timo?
The honourable gentleman's reply was as
follows:
I shail answer that ciearly. The Governm ut
have aIl the fac-ts, ani apparently think t-hey
do not need these moni o%-ers"as, because if thev
do they could send them. t.here. If I had the
lon. Mr. COPP.

No one would suggest that the Government
lias net made mistakes. It bas made many
mistakes in this war, just as the thoen Governinent made in the last war. The making
of some errors in times like these is unavoidable. Neverthcless, I feel that when evorything is taken into consideration it bas to ho
admitted that the Governinent, supported as
it lias been by the people as a whole, bas done
a splendid jo-b in the conduct of this war. And

JUNE 22, 1944
I believe the Government will continue to
prosecute the war effectively and in the best
possible manner until victory is achieved.
We have very much to be thankful for in
this country. In saying that I do not wish
to be understood as giving all the credit to the
Government. Much of the credit is due to
the people as a whole, for the way in which
they have backed the country's war effort. Of
course there has been criticism from time to
time, and rightly so. Sometimes a good
deal of prominence has been given to complaints that are relatively trivial. For instance,
at times we have heard the cry: "There is
not enough sugar." or "There is not enough
tea." or "There is a shortage of .gasoline."
But any one who stops to compare our lot
in Canada during the past four and a half
years with the privations and sufferings in
some of the countrie's of our Allies, must admit
that we have been subjected to nothing more
than slight inconveniences, hardly severe
enough to justify complaints.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I do nat think I need say
anything further in regard to my honourable
friend's criticism of the man-power situation.
My honourable friend also referred to incorne tax and reconstructioh. When the budget
bills are before us we shall be in a position to
discuss the question of whether the income tax
should be reduced or increased. We are all
prone to think that our income taxes are too
burdensome; but, after all, the only way in
which the great majority of our people can
help the war effort, and so supplement the
great services of our fighting forces, is by
paying taxes in order to provide the money
necessary for carrying on the war.
My honourable friend said he was not altogether imbued with the idea that we should
pay half the cost of this war as we go along,
and he asked whether the coming generations
should not pay something on this account. I
differ with him. I think that we should to the
full extent of our financial ability pay every
dollar of war expenditure and leave the smallest possible proportion as a liability on future
generations, for, the Lord knows, future generations will have enough to do in carrying on
after the war ends. I think the greater the
proportion of war expenditure we can pay at
the present time the better it will be for the
future well-being of Canada.
As to reconstruction, it will corne before us
when another bill, now in the other House,
reaches us. Then we shall have ample opportunity to diseuse the question in ail its
bearings.

221

In his criticisrm of the manpower situation
my honourable friend cited the case of a man
of 52 and a woman of 49 with two sons, one
16 and the other 21. He said the elder boy
had been sent to camp and was promenading
up and down, doing nothing for the good of
the country. I take issue with my honourable
friend's statement. Men in training camps are
not doing a great deal of ,promenading; they
are undergoing training so that they may give
useful service to the country. When a farmer
requires the services of one or two sons on the
farm, a board established for the purpose
makes a careful investigation of -the circumstances and, where found necessary, young
men are allowed to return to farm work. Of
course, mistakes may be made now and again,
but one cannot fairly judge the situation by
picking out an individual case. From the
little experience I have had in acting for
parents, I have found that quite frequently
men in the home defence army remain in
training in preference tQ going back on the
farm. That is an unfortunate situation from
the farm-production standpoint, but we have
to recognize it. I am informed by officials of
the Department of National Defence that men
are being released from time to tirme, and
that about 5,000 have already been let out on
compassionate grounds in order that they may
assist their parents on the farm. While it
might be well to have more men released for
farm work, it seems to me that at this time,
when we are facing the greatest crisis of the
war, we should be prepared to reinforce our
fighting men whenever the need arises.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senator,
I do not rise to take part in this debate at all,
but rather to ask one or two questions resulting from the speech of the honourable member
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp).
In the first place, he intimated that if the
Governrment feIt it was necessary to send
reinforcements overseas the men now in the
national defence army would be sent. But
he added that the Government is not in a
position to say whether reinforcements are
necessary. I ask, if reinforcements are not
necessary, why do we -have speeches by
Brigadier General Mess and other high military officials from time to time over the
radioAn Hon. SENATOR: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: -- calling upon the
youth of this country to enlist because reinforcements are so badly needed?
My second*question is this. The honourable senator based his defence of Government

I think, on the 15th of July. What is the purpose of this training? It is to fit him to go
into the Army-something he can never do.
Yet he is going to be clothed and fed and kept

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do not know whether
he is a member of the Reserve Arny or not.
He is 42 years of age, is classified as medically
unfit, and has a dependent mother 82 years of
age. He is performing a very useful service
in Canada's war effort where Le is, and I cannot see the necessity of calling himn up. That
is an illustration of what is happening to
many men all over Canada. I felt that I
should call attention to it and similar cases.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: But am I correct in
assuming that the soldier to whom the honourable senator las reference is not a draftee?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No, not at all.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What difference does
that make.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: He is a volunteer member of the Reserve Army of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The militia.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Would it be possible
that the man referred to is an instructor?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No, it is not possible.
He never was trained as an instructor; never
had a corporal's stripe on his sleeve. I am
sorry to say that these questions are not
pertinent to this case. This man is going to
be taken out of an occupation in which he is
useful to his country and put into one in
which he is not, and in which he will be maintained at the cost of the people of Canada. I
think this condition should be corrected.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: He is doing it of his
own free will.
Hon. Mr. BLACK.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: This same condition will
be found throughout Canada.
Those are the only remarks I propose to
make with regard to man-power.
Now I want to join with the leader of the
Government and the honourable member from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) in paying
tribute to the men in the armed forces. We
have gone far since 1939; the United Nations
have been exceedingly fortunate in the progress
they have made.
There is no question that we have been particularly fortunate in our leaders. At least
three great men have arisen in the world
during this war. I refer first to the President
of the great republic to the south of us, the
United States of America. I should not be
surprised if President Roosevelt were to go
down in history as the greatest President the
United States has ever. produced. Another of
these great men is Stalin of Russia. A few
years ago we looked upon him with suspicion
and fear; to-day Le is a world figure. He has
proved himself a great statesman and a great
tactician.
Finally I come to "the noblest
Roman of tbemc all," Winston Churchill of
Great Britain, a man who las been and is the
greatest political leader of our time. I doubt
that history has ever produced a greater.
Now, speaking of our own men, I am not
able and do not wish to make comparisons.
One thing I can say, however, is that the men
we have sent overseas are as good fighting men,
as good soldiers as any nation in the world
Las been able to produce. Only a few short
years ago these men-who came from the
farm, the factory and the office, from the
fishing fleet, the lumber camp and the minehad no thought in their minds of battle and
no training for military service or fighting;
yet, in a few short years they have been
turned into as fine a fighting force as the world
las ever seen, and Canada las reason to be
proud of every one of them.
They're the men who man the cannons,
They're the men who scout the sky;
Theyre the men who storm the beaches,
They're the men who do or die.
They're the men who win our battles,
They're the men who sweep the sea;
And with the help of the Almighty
They'll win final victory.
Every Canadian should be grateful and
proud that we have such fine and valiant
young men defending our country on the
battlefields, on the seas and in the air. Our
plain duty is to support them with every
dollar we have and with every man who can
be spared from essential work in Canada.
There should be no holding back of financial

JIJNE 22, 1944
assistance nor of rnan-power for the reinforcernents necessary to bring about complete
victory.
Hlon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
should like to say a word or two in reply to
the honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis). To give a full answer to
my honourable friend would take sorne time,
and I feel it is not desirable or necessary to
do that this afternoon. Anyone who wishes to
review the manpower situation in Canada
must start with the beginning of the war. In
September of 1939 there was no doubt in the
minds of our people as to whether we should
take part in the conflict. Parliament and the
people were alrnost unanirnously in favour of
the step that was taken. Now, it must be
remembered that the Government had the
advantage of the experience that had been
gained in the handling of matters relating to
the last war, and the endeavour bas been to
avoid such errors as were made at that time.
I believe honourable members will regard that
as a fair statement. It is flot suggested that
this Government is better than the one that
was in office during the last war. The fact is
sirnply that the Government has tried to do
what reasonable people do in their everyday
affairs, narnely, to avoid repeating mistakes.
When the first great war began, Canada
called for volunteers, but after a certain period
it serned that conscription was necessary. The
matter was debated in Parliament, where it
was decided that conscription should ha put
into effect, and that was done. No one who
bas had experience of those days will say that
the conscription measure added to the effectiveness of this country's war effort. I mention
that sirnply by way of saying that when
this war began we had that experience to
guide us.
Two years ago the Japanese were threatening our western coast and the subrnarine menace was a very real one. Ships were being sunk
in the gulf of St. Lawrence, and off the coasts
of Nova Scotia and New England-not
merely one a day but sornetimes many ships a
day. Honourable members of this House who
had ships in those areas then know how
he-avy the toll was. The people of Central
Canada may not be familiar with these facts,
but their fellow-citizens on the Pacifie and
Atlantic coasts were in no doubt as to the
seriousness. of the situation that then existed.
The defence authorities and the Government
realized that both coasts had to ha protected.
The Governrnent knew, as everybody rnust
have known, that arnong our population there
would be sorne young rnen who could neyer
be trained to rnake good soldiers, sailors or
airmen, and who consequently would be of

225

very littie use ini any arrned service. Such
young men are not peculiar to any race or any
province; they are to be found everywhere in
Canada. Again, there are men who would
refuse to fight in Europe, but would respond
quickly to any cails to repel an enerny froni
this country.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Would theyHon. Mr. KING: Just a minute, please.
We conscripted men for overseas service in the
last war. Did they rnake creditable soldiers?
Were rnany of them sent to the battlefelds
of France? A few of them got to Eingland,
but they did not make a very good showing.
Many a young nian has taken this position:
"I do not want to go overseas to fight, but
if the enemy should corne to rny own country
I will figlit." That attitude is not peculiar to
any race. I know of young men who carne to
Canada from the Old Country within the last
tan years and who. say that t'hey would not
go back to Europe to fight, but that they
would fight wherever required in this country.
As I say, it did becorne necessary to protect
the shores of this country, and we passed a
conscription measure-for that is what it is-which makes men liable for service for home
defence. Under that Act a large body of rnen
has been called up and trained. Many of
these young men have volunteered for service
overseas and have fought in Africa and Italy,
and a considerahie number of thern are in
France to-day. I arn not drawing on my
imagination; I arn siniply stating facts, which
can ha verifiad at the Department of National
Defence.
The men in the home defence arrny are
subi act to eall for service abroad should the
necessity arise, and Parliarnent will have to be
consulted as to that. I arn not rnaking that
staternent on my own authority; the statement bas been made in anotheïr place, and
there is no rnisunderstanding about 'it.
Whether the meni will at any time be required
to serve ovarseas is a question that will have
to be determined hy the Governrnent, acting
in its best judgrnent and in the light of the
requirements as set forth hy its rnilitary
advisers. Cornplaint has been made that
officars are now going about and saying to
these young men: "You are trained soldiers,
and you had better go ovarseas." Well, is that
not what you would expect a good officer to
do? I should expeet it.
The fact that the home defence arrny provides a pool of well-trained soldiars was shown
not many months ago, when some of them
were sent to the Alaskan coast for active
service. It is adimitted that they were among
the hast men that landad on the Aleutian
islands. Before they and their American

226

SENA'rE

com.rades arrived, the Japanese troops had
apparently got word of their coming and
rnoved out, so wc were fortunately spared any
casualties. Our troops did flot get a chance
to show what they could do when faced with
the enerny, but officers who bad served in
Europe say there could flot have been hetter
soldiers for that special duty than those who
were trained especially for it in Western
Canada.

that question, for that bas already been done.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain bas
assured the United States Government that
once the forces of Gerrnany are defèated in
Europe the whole power of the British fleet
and other British forces will he directed against
Japan. A similar statement bas been made
by the Prime Minister of Canada with respect
to the armed services of tbis country.
So
wby ask that question?

As to the manpower question, we ail know
that that is always a prohlern in war-time,
and even in peace-time. Wben there has been
a boom, with a great deal of railroad construction and business activity in general, the
farmor, the industrialist and ail other employers.
including housekeepers, have found difficulty
in sccuring sufficient labour. Is there an
honourable member whn will stand in bis
place and say that it was within the ability
of any individual or of any group of individuals
s0 to arrange the manpower poiicy during tbis
war that every Canadian would be put at the
job for which lie or she wvas best fitted, and
thiat in conscquence the public would he 50
well satisfied as to make no complaint? No
honourable member will go so far as to say
that.

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I did
question.

It is truc that wc hcar much complaint
about the manpower policy. Yet we know
that we hav'e succceded in building up three
armed serIvices-not one servie *only, as
Canada bcad in the iast war. No one bas ever
suggested that young men should be compelled
to join the Air Force. It is eommoniy agreed
that service in that Force must be voluntary.
Similarly, no one bas suggested that young
men should bc conseripted for the Navy.
There again il seerns to be agreed that
voluntary serv ice i5 10 be preferred. But for
sorne reason or other il is said that the
cornpulsory rnethod is necessary to obtain mca
for the Arrny. That attitude couid be hetter
understood if we liad not been told that we
have reserv es to support our men in France
and ltaly. And we know that if tliese reserves
should pros e insufficient we can draw upon
the pool of trainied men in our borne defence
army, the maintenance of which bias heeîi
criticized by mv hionourable friend opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). I arn satisfied that if my
honourahie friend hiad the information to
which he is probahly entitled-but information whieh is not given to him nor to mehe would prohably commend the Department
of National Defence for the course il is
following,
My honrurable friend from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) raised a question with
regard to Japan. It is flot for me to answer
Hen. Mr. KING.

not ask that

Hon. Mr. KING: I know what the implication was.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I arn sorry, but the
honourable leader bas misunderstood me. I
quoted the Prime Minister of Great Britain
as saying that the war with Germany mighl
end this summer, and that thon we should ho
fighting Japan. My question was this: If the
Government of Canada pursues ils present
policy, as was intirnated by the honourable
senator frorn Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp).
will the same group of mon who have fougbt
in Sicily, Italy and France bave to go on to
Japan, while the members of our home defence
arrny are allowed 10 remain in Canada? I did
not raise the question as 10 whether Canada
would support the cttack against Japan.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend is
talking of Governrnent policy, sometbing of
wvhich neither she nor 1 cari ho fully advised.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I did flot mention
Goverrnent policy. May I just sayHon Mr. KING: I understand the question
thoroughly.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: My honourable friend
bas misquoted me, and Ibis is the time and
place to set hirn right. I did not isuggest
that Canada would flot be figbting against
Japan. 1 rnerely asked wbether the saine
soldiers wbo have borne the heat and burden
of the war in North Africa, Sicily and Italy,
and arc now figbting in Norrnandy, are to he
expectcd to continue to bear the hurden after
Gwerrnany is defeated and the full military
powver of the Allies is turned against Japan.
My bonourable friend failed to nnswer that
question and proceedcd as tbough I had asked
whether we intended to fighit Japan.
Hon. Mr. KING: I understand my honourcble friend's question, which is plainly put.
The Canadian Govcrnrncnt, along witb the
British Government. is coinrnitted to assist,
not only tho United States, but other Allied
Governments, in eontinuing the war against

TUNE 22, 1944
Japan until she is utterly defeated. What
soldiers shall go from Canada or from Great
Britain, or what portion of the Navy or the
Air Force shahl be sent to fight Japan, are
questions that must ho Ieft to those who are
My
fully conversant with military matters.
bonourable friend knows that our Army is a
volunteer army, and that such an army is
always eager to go where fighting is to be
done, if they think the cause is just. The
Government bas absolute confidence in the
fighting spirit of our yioung soldiers, and consequently is not worried lest on their retura
fromn Europe they rnay say: "We have beaten
Germany to ber knees. We do not care about
figbting Japan." Our young men are flghting
for a just cause, and they are determined to
sec that that cause is triumphant,Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I did not raise that
point at ail.
Hon. Mr. KING: -and
establisbed in the world.

that peace

is

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Those soldiers will
not bave a word to say about it.
Hon. ,Mr. KING: We must leave the Governme nt and its advisers to decide what
forces shall be sent to carry on tbe war
against Japan.
As to the question raised by my honourabie
friend f rom Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
with regard to militia camps, he as a veteran
military man must know tbat even before
Confederation we 'bad a militia force. To
some of us non-military men it may seem
rather unneceasary that these camps ehould
be continued during the war period, wben
large bodies of men are being trained for
active service. I asked the Department a
similar question. The answer is that tbe
commandants in the varions districts have
iitia
found it advantageous to continue
training camps in order to maintain the
morale of the public and keep it înterested
iu military matters. As to the instance cited
by my honourable friend, I believe that if
the man in question wîil go with hie aged
mother and state bis case to the commandant
in New Brunswick, the order to attend camp
will not be insisted upon.
Hon. Mr. BLACK:,May I say that the
young man to whom I referred did make
application to be relieved from attendance,
and be received a reply, signed by the adjutant of the battalion to which he had been
called, saying that he could not ho excused
and must report by JuIy 15.

22"d

Hon. Mr. KING: I shall be giad to bring
the case to the attention of the Minister.
1 cannot conceive of such a thing happening.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable leader
opposite bas nlot yet answered the question
of my honourable frîend from Peterborough.
She cited the statement made over the radio
by Brigadier General Mess that about 40,000
men were needed for overseas reinforcements,
and she asked: Why cail up men without any
training at ail for overseas service, when we
have 70,000 higbly trained draftees?
Hon. Mr. KING: T-hat question has been
answered, and effectively. We have the voluntary systemn for overseas service; we have
conscription or enlistment for home defence.
Many men in the home defence army are today eniisting and going overseas. But we must
also continue to enliat volunteers for overseas service. My honourable friend complains of boys of 18 and 19 being accepted
for active service. The experience of militmr
men is that youths of that age can be more
readily trained than men of 25 or 26 years of
age. These youtbs are being called up in this
country, as in the United States and in al
other Allied countries. I tbink I have answered
my honourable friend. Her question does not
relate to the wbole war picture.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: My question was based
on the statement by the honourable member
from, Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp), that if
the Goverument needed reinforcements it
wouid send oversees men of the home defence
army. My question is: If reinforcements are
not required, why sbould Brigadier General
Mess have stated over the radio that 40,000
men are needed for overseas reinforcements.
I cannot reconcile the two statements.
Hon. Mr. KING: My honourable friend
must leave that to the jtidgment of Department of National Defence officiais who are
advising the Government in this matter. I am
confident that were my honourable friend
administering that Department sbe would not
for one moment tiake tbe responsibility of
saying that since we have 40,000 men suffici-.
ently trained for overseas service, we will not
enlist any more.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: That was not my
point.
Hon. Mr. KING: But we know these men
will be available when the occasion arises.
My honourable friend referred to two or three
gzeat leaders of the Allied nations. Let me
accord myseif the privilege of referring to a
fourth-Right Honourable Mackenzie King.
He bas given Canada brilliant leadership

SENATE
throughout the war years and is respected by
the public men of the United States, Great
Britain and the other Allied countries. I
do flot hesitate to say that we as Canadians
would be depreciating ourselves if we failed
to recognize this outstanding leader.
I do flot wish to pursue the matter further,
for 1 arn anxious that this Bill should be
given second reading, affer which. I suggest,
it should be referred to the Special Committee
on War Finance.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable sellators, in view of some of the romnarks of the
bonourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. King),
I wish to say a few words. The honourable
gentleman ehallenged any member to tell bim
whet.her conscription was nccessary or worked
to the advantage of the Army in the 1-ast
war. I arn one person whn is prepared to
say tînt it dîd, and that it wvas absolutely
nocessary for the morale of our men thon
fighting in France.
Hon. Mr. KING:

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Let me repeat, I have
ail ýalong been in favour of conscription as
the o-nly way of conducting war. When yen

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Did the honourable

Hon. Mr. HORNER: I bew my head in

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The bonourable

that it is not only our right but our duty to

Hon. P. R. DuTREMBLAY: Honourahie
members, hy bis resolution, the honourable
senator fromn Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) suggests
that a greup of Canadian historians in eacb
of the provinces ho asked te devote the necessary timo te the preparation of a uniform
text-book of history for Canada. This would
give the different boards of instruction in this
country a new text-book of histery for acceptance by eaci province. The proposition would
he tmade at the next meeting of thc DominionProvincial conference te ho heid in Ottawa at
some later date.

JUNE 22, 1944
the resolution andi the eloquent speech
delivered by its sponsor and the interesting
debate which followed have aroused the
interest of many newspapere and reviews
tliroughout the country. Problems which
might arise if such a manual were published
are being discuss-ed.
This idea is flot entirely new, for some years
ago the Association of Education of Canada
and Newfoundland decided to have a history
of Canada written by the best historians of
the provinces.
Four provinces agreed to
engage in the enterprise, but the war prevented its realization.
There is no doubt that the adoption of such
a manual would be a delicate innovation. It is
an important question. Any manual of history
has a powerful effeet on the minds of young
people, and it is most essential that the textbook placed in their hande is the proper one.
Would sucli a manual be sufficient and
acceptable for each and every province? Is it
reasonably possible ta hope that the group of
historians of Canadian History, although well
disposed, could arrive at the 'writing of sucli a
book? Would they ail approve of the same
version of certain contentious events of our
hiatory which would necessarily have to be
written? And would such a version be accepted
by the educational authorities of each of the
provinces?
Many dlaimn such an enterprise ta be
Utopian, and that we should not entertain hope
of its realization. But before discussing this
angle of the problem, I would draw the attention of this honourable Chamber to the opposition which this resolution bias aroused in many
quarters. 'A few weeks ago it was discussed in
the Quebec Legisiature. The chief of the
Opposition was emphatically against uniformity anid, according to a report of the
debate which appeared in a Q'uebec newspaper,
he asked the Provincial Secretary, Honourable
Mr. Perrier, how he intended ta arrive at a
uniform Canadian history. Mr. Duplessis said:
As for myseif, I neyer heard about t-his before.
If the Secretary of the Province thinks -lie eau
pour ail Canaclian souls into the same mould.
'he i8 greatly mistaken. The uni'formity of
history is an im*possibility.
Mr. Perrier then gave the folloowing answer:
When I spoke of the history of Canada, I
said it was not complete 'because it does not
give to the populations of the other provinces

the notion 'that would inspire and create a true

Canadian epirit. It does not speak enougli of
the role we 'have played in this country, when
it should im.press upon the minds of young

Canadians the efforts that were made 'by the
Frenchi and the English of this land.
Mr. Perrier goes on ta say that if we want

to progress in harmony, we muet put aside ahl

prejudices of race and religion, and that the
only way we can attain this goal is by the
teaching of a complete history. Other honourable rnembers of that House took part in the
discussion, and at its conclusion, Mr. Perrier
said:
Hîstory is truc in itself. It is the manual
which is at fault.
We desire to -have a
generation that will flot 'have the prejudices
which we possess liccause of the poor teaching
whieh we reeive in the history of our country.
A Resolution was adopted by the Knights
of Columbus, Lafontaine Council, at their
regular meeting on l3th June last, favouring
the resolution presented ta the Senate by
the honourable senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr.
David). They also resolved that the Prime
Minister of the Province of Quebec be
informed of their position, and expressed the
hope that the resolution of our honourable
colleague would be supported by him at the
Interprovincial Conference.

In a review called "Relations", printed in
Montreal, I read a very interesting article on
this question.
This was analysed by the
Montreal Gazette, as follows:
Senator David's recent proposal for one
history text-book for all Canadian schools was
brouglit up by Press Information Bureau in
a recent bulletin. The idea 'las etirred up
just as rncl lively critidamr as; it lias support.
Ahl nationaliet nevwspapers and speakers have
sliown themselves resolutely against theplan.
Among thesle latter, we m'ust quote the article
in "Relations"', whicli, contrary to so ma-ny
of the others, lias shown a somnewliat moderate
toue liy aeserting tliat "80 long as Englisli and

Frenchi Canadians do not feel that Canada is
their fatherland, the whlole of Canada, and
oothing but Canada, national unity is not
possible." In order to justify its stand against
a single textbook for history teaching,

"Relations" relies on the following arguments:

Several countries where a wide libcrty of
history teaching is allowed-and teaching of
the rest also-hlave realized a profound unity
of action and thouglit. England sud Scotlaud
eci lias its own educational system.
The
Stuart Odyssey is not told in thle same way
at Ediuliurgli as 'it is at Oxford. Just the
same, Scots and Engliali understaud eacli ot-her
.perfectly in 'forming the United Kingdom.
Among our neiglibours, education is a matter
for eacli state. Tlie 48 coutracting parties
have neyer ex'perienced tic ueed for imposing

one single conception of their 'history. The
southerners have tiheir version of the War of
Secession, whicli is not tic same as t-hat lield
by the Northerners.
But Northerners and
Southerners, Californians and Bostonians are
as one in tlieir common love of their fatlierland.
In Switzerland .two religions are to lie met
witli; three cultures face eachl other; 25 cantons
and demi-cantons eut up a country whicli miglit
stretcli betweeu Quebet. and Montreal, and
share in a population of 4,000,000, one-third

systems, and each departmnent, looks after in its
ow-n way the oî ganization of history teachiing..
. .

Several associations in the province of Quebec have signified their opinion against the
resoJution now before this honourable Chamber. Se honourable members of the Senate
may see for themnselves that this suggestion
doas nlot meat with the unanimous approval
of our population. Personally, 1 de net agre
with the resolution, as written. It should be
amended to restrict the scope of this manual
to the principal avents of our Canýadian bistory, leaving to each province the task of
completing it as it sees fit.
How can we arrive at the writing of a history
that would be sufficiantly completa in itself to
be useful and satisfactory to aach and every
province? I do neot heqieve it possible. This
manual is supposed te serve in the primary
sehool for pupils up to the age of, say, 16 or
17 years. Man-y of these young people,' probably the great majority of them, will gain
their only knowledge of Canadian history
from. this manual, hecause af-ter that age they
generally Icave school foraver. Would the
aducational authoritias of each province ha
satisfied to leave their students with only t-ha
knowledge acquired frein such a book? I
doubt it. Thora je no doubt that each province is anxious te have its children recpîva a
knowledge of the history which relates to their
own anecstors.
We have in this country two. important
naitionalities, English and French. I repeat
that I believe that each province would want
to enlarge on certain facts of history which
would appeal .9peifically te them, and which
they would consider necessary to kaep up the
spirit and maintain the mentality of heir
peoples. Eacli province will desire, no doubt,
to insist that the first love of their people be
for Canada. At the same time. they will want to
meculcate in their minds a pride in their origin.
Some provinces will desire te add certain imeportant facts of history written on this soul by
their forefathers. For instance, I ventura to
think that Nova Scotia will want many pages
written on Scet]and and the part it played in
the establishient of that province. Ontario
will wan't te say much on the history of the
Loyalists who contributed to the foundation of
that province. The great establishment of
Lord Selkirk in Manitoba would fill many
pages which would be of interest to some of
the Western provinces, and similarly, the province of Quebec would insist upon its children
being well acquainted wjth the history of their
ancestors in the thon New France. Ail this is
right. It should be the aim of each nationality
Hon.

Mr-. DuTREMBLAY.

in this country to maintain ail its traits and
cbaracteristics. for thasa are of great value to
the country as a whola.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourabla
member permit me to asic him a question about
a point that is troubling me? Would, it noît
ha hetter if the boys and girls in Manitoba
knaw fully as much as those of Quabec about
the founders of New France; and, in turn, if
tha boys and girls in Quehec ware as wall
informed as thosa of the West about Lord
Seikirk's settiemenýt in Manitoba?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: There is no douht that
it wopld.
Hon. Mr. DuTREMBLAY: I shall try to
ansiver that question as I go aiong. Diversity
has its menit and advantages and does net
impair nation-al unity. The first thing that
sholuld be taught children is a spirit of patriotism, and we meust sea to it that our teachers
are prope-rly qua]ifiled for creating in their
pupils a love of this country. Therein lies a
question of importance. As we say in French,
vaut
vaut
le
maître,
autant
"Autant
l'instruction."
If we succe.ed in creating a text-book as proposed by rny honourable friend froin Sorel, it
wiIl be useful only to a certain degree. It wilI
neyer ho a complote history of Canada and its
p)rovinces. It wiil not cover sufficientiy the
requirements of each province. To achieve that
goal w'ould necessitate a velume of 600 or
800 or perhaps aven 1,000 pages.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: May 1 asic my hionourabie friand a question?
Would nlot a
history text-book hased on the truth ha a good
one for the whole ef Canada?
Hon. Mr. DuTREMBLAY: I was simply
pointing out that a text-hook which wouid
nmcet the requircments of aval-y province would
l'un te porhaps 1,000 pages. This wouid not
ho practicable. Sueh a voluminoxe book eouid
ba employed usefuily in high schools, but not
in primary schooýls.
I am not opposed to
the spirit of the motion, but I want what is
done to ha practical. In ýmy -opinion the oniy
practical course w-ouid ha to hava a manuiai
covaning the principal events of histery in a
generai way, and to leave it to each province to
add what it faIt to ha necessary for use in its
own sehools. Such a manual would ha practical
and acceptable to avery province. It wouid
contain facts which aach province considered it
necessary te taach its own people in ordar to
ensure the maintenance of the spirit of patriotism to which I hava -referrad.
The mançual
wouid of nacassity ha incempiate. As I have
said, nothing short of a text-hook so volumin-

231

JUNE 21, 1944
ous as to be impractical could contain a
complete history satisfactory to every province.
The intention of the honourable senator
from Sorel is meritorious, but we must consider
this question f rom ail angles and weigh the advantages of his proposai from, the point of
view of the various provinces. I arn sure my
honourable friend has no desire to inçUroduce
a manual which would curtail the teaching of
complete history in our schools. Well, I
repeat, no history text-book would be acceptable and practical unless part of it were written in conformity with the requirements of
eaeh province in which the book is to be used.
Honourable senators, let me say in conclusion that I arn opposed to this motion as it
is worded, for I understand by the wording
that the honourable mover bas in mind a
uniform and complete history for every province. If this proposai were put to the forthcoming Interprovincial Conference, I presume
that it would not be acceptable to ail the
Prime Mînisters. I arn under the impression
that the first condition imposed by them
would be that the uniform text-book should
contain an outline of general history, and that
to the respective provinces be left the responsibility of adding the material required to ensure
that their residents retain ahl their own characteristies.
Hon. Mr. DAVID. Would the honourable
senator sHlow me? Does he mean to say that
when the Prime Ministers of the various provinces meet at Ottawa they wilI not then make
a distinction between a text-book and a complete history of Canada?
Hon. Mr. DuTREMBLAY: I say that a
complete text-book as proposed.in the motion
would flot be practical in every province.
Hon. Mr. D.AVID: Will the honourable
senator allow me again? Is there in the
motion anything that would prevent a teacher
of history, in any Canadian school, from making bis own comments upon any historical fact?
Hon. Mr. DuTREMBLAY: No; I did flot
say there was. The honourable gentleman's
purpose, as I understand it, is to have prepared a uniform history text-book for use in
ail the schools of Canada. The complaint
is made that in certain provinces the chuldren are not told enough about the history
of French Capada, and that in at least one
province the children are not sufficiently informed as to the history of the rest of the
country. The honourable gentleman's objeet
is to make a contribution towards national
unity. Then, Jet us try to get a text-book
that wiil be practical and acceptable in every
province. In my opinion the only kind of
text-book that would meet these requirements

would be one outlining the great events of
history; and every province should be left
free to add what it considers necessary for its
own individual use. A manual of that kind
would be very valuable, and if we succeeded in
having it introduced in the schools we shouid
have accompliéhed something.
It is often said that this country ia rich
because of the varied contributions made to
our national welfare by our different nationalitics and groupe. Let us, then, maintain our
different characteristics.
Subject to the restrictions and conditions
that I have specified, I arn in favour of the
motion.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt, the
motion was adjourned.

FELICrITATIONS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
inay I be permitted, on bebaîf of all bonourable members on this side of the House, to
extend heartiest congratulations to our bonourable friend from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs.
Fallis)? We greatly admire ber and appreciate ber presence in this Chamber; and it is
a special pleasure to see ber among us this
afternoon with a very beautiful bouquetindicating, I suppose, a birtbday. I would
ask the bonourable senator to accept our
sincerest felicitations.
1h' Hon. the SPEAKER.

Honi. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable eenators, on bebalf of bonourable members on
this side of the House, I have much pleasure
in conveying to our honourable colleague
from Peterborough
hearty congratulations
upon the attainiment, of her thirty-ninth birthday. I take it that she must be thirty-nine,
for one cannot become a member of this
Chamrber before the age of thirty, and it i8
now aine years sincc she first came here.
Prier to bier appointmcnt, those of us wbo
used to visit the Senate galleries-J was not
a senator thcn-obscrved how the other cide
of the House xvas graced by the presence of
the honourable senator from Rockcliffe (Hon.
Mrs. W-ilson) and wondered whether the day
would corne when a lady of equal distinction
wvould glace this side. That day did corne
wlhen our honourable friend from Peterborough
was surnmoned to the Senate. We on this
side feel very bappy at baving bier as one
of our number. Her high mental qualities
would appear to be constantly improving:
she can make a speech or ask a pertinent
question that puzzles even those of us over
here, to say nothing of honourable members
opposite.
In ofiering ber our hearty congratulations, may I add the assurance that,
next te, lier husband, bier strongest admirers
tire lier colleagues on this side of the House.
Hon. TVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators,
I deeply appreciate the kind remarks of the
honourable leader of tbe Govern.ment (Hon.
Mr. King) and also those of the honourable
acting leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig)I am very glad that he did not pursue bis
calculations furtber, and was njot .too accurate
in bis aritbmetic.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: As I gazed on these
beautiful roses in delighted surprise, tbey
reminded me of a day six years ago wben I
also celebrated my birthday here, and Rigbt

Honourable George P. Graham-whom I shall
always hold in affectionate remembrance-led
the House in offering me appropriate congratulations. May I again assure honourable
members; bow deeply I appreciate tihis kindly

SURPLUS CROWN ASSETS BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 137, an Act respecting Surplus Crown
Assets.
He said: Honourable members, in explaining this Bill I shall have to recount what the
Government bas been doing in regard to the
subi ect-matter of the Bill during the past
three or four months.
In order that Canada might carry out ber
war policy as laid down by the Government
and confirmed by Parliament, it bas from time
ta time been necessary for the Government ta
acquire for war purposes various assets, sucb
as lands, buildings, shîps, tools, raw materiais,
and even the necessities of life. Some of these
assets have since become surplus assets fromn
the point of view of ordinary departmentai
requirements. A few months ago tbe Government decided. to dispose of sucb surplus assets,
and by Order in. Council set up a committee
composed of senior civil servant&--Deputy
Ministers and Assistant Deputy Ministersfrom, the three Departments of Defence and
the Departments of Public Works, Pensions
and National Healtb, Munitions and Supply,
Trade and Commerce, and Finance, as well as
representatives of agriculture, labour and
consumers. On instructions from tbe Government, anything in a department that is found
to be in excese of its requirements is repovked
ta this committee. If the committee finds
that tbe surplus in one depas'tment xnay
he of material use in another, a transfer ta
that other department is recammended. If,
'however, any surplus assets are found ta be
of no further use ta the Government service,
the camrnittee recommends their disposai. In
the meantime the Minister of Munitions and
Supply bad set up a corporation known as the
War Assets Corporation. After the committee
reports ta, the Minister that surplus assets be
sold, the Minister, on the recommendation of
Council, instructs the Corporation ta dispose
of tbemn at the highest price. The committee
also advises the Government what priori-

ties sball be given ta provincial and municipal
governments or other public bodies for the
purpose of aiding in the disposai of surplus
assets ta the public generally.
This practice bas been followed for the last
three montbs, and the Government is s0 well
satisfied with the work of the committee and
tbe Corporation that it bas decided to continue their services; but since these bodies
are functioning under the War Measures Act,
tbis legisiation is necessary ta enable the
disposal work ta be continued in post-war
years.
The several clauses of the Bull are selfexplanatory, so I shahl not discuss tbem. in
detail. I would suggest that the Bill, after it
is given second reading, be referred -te the
Committee on Banking and Commerce, wbere*
certain departmental officiais wiil be in attend1ance te furnish full information te bonourable
niembers.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Is there any objection ta
setting forth, confidentially or otberwise, the
names of those who compose tbe committee?
Hon. Mr. KING: I have not their'names,
but, as I bave indicated, the committee's
principal membership is drawn froni the
Deputy and Assistant Deputy Ministers of the
va-riaus departments -concerned with the
disposai of surplus assets. As ta the Corporation, Mr. Carswell is Chairnian, and be
will be President of the new organization.
He bas been associated with the Government
sgince tbe early stages of the war, and at
present is Director-General of the Washington
office of the Department of Munitions and
Supply.
A contractor, he bas had wide experience in
purchasing variaus materiais, and is familiar
with the avenues for disposal of surplus assets.
On the recommendation of the Minister, the
names of the other members of the Corporation will be submittcd ta the Government for
acceptance or rejection. I understand that the
Government intends ta reappoint the present
committee.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is there any provision for publicity in regard ta what will be
offered for sale? How will the public be
informed?
Han. Mr. KING: I have no doubt there
wili be the fullest publicity. The Bill provides
for the setting up of sub-committees, ta be
located in variaus parts of Canada. Any of
the surplus assets that cannot be utilized will
be converted into scrap and sold at prices
under the contrai of the Wartime Prices and
Trade Board. If material can be reconditioned,
this will he dope by the CÔrporation, and in

234

SENATE

its reconditioncd forma it will be shipped to
various parts of Canada for sale to the public.
Thiere is a very large quantity of material to,
be disposed of, and its disposai will continue
for somo years. In order that the business
may be considored more or less distinct frorn
governrnent business, the set-up of the Corporation will be similar to that of the
National Harbours Board and the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation. True, there will ho
contact with the Ministor and with the
Govornor in Council, but the Corporation will
devote its timo to sclling these surplus assets
to the best possible advantago.
The Ministor has intimated to the other
House that, with the objeet of trying ta
prevont the flooding of one country by goods
from anothor, conversations have already
taken place with the governments of the
Ujnited States and Great Britain in regard
to the disposai of war assets. It is hoped that
arrangements may ho worked out so that the
respective go>vernments will receive the býest
possible value for their surplus assets.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Did the Minister say what
would bappen to, the airfiélds aIl across this
country? Are they included in the disposai
too?9
Hon. Mr. KING: Thcy would be.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would he also be able ta
inform us, when the Committee nicets, as to
what assets still remain in Canada? I do nat

mpan that ho should give us ail the details.
1 know that in certain places these assets have
been piled up for a year or more. Are they ta
be used or to be sold?
Hon. Mr. OOPP: That will be decided by
the Corporation.
Hon. Mr. KING: It is part of the duty of
the Corporation to make investigation and
advise the Governinent. The Government bas
indicatcd that action is brirg taken in this
matter se, that the sale may take place. As ta
the amount and sa forth, I am not qualified
to make a statement; it has been ostimatod at
some $800,000,000.
In the press there bas
appeared an estimate of three billion dollars,
and one as higb as ten billion dollars. I tbink
these estimates are exaggorated, but I helieve
that in the Committee we can obtain information that will clarify the matter to the satisfaction of my bonourable friend.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second timo.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the Bill was

referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

HISTORY-UNIFORM

DEBATE

The Sonate resumed from Tbursday, June
22, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. David:
Tint týhis House, acknowlcdging the teaching
of history as one of the fundamentals of
patiotisni in cvcry country, andi anxious to
develop a better andl more unnlrstanding Cana(han pati iotism, expresses the wish that at the
Interprovincial Conference to ho bell in Ottawa,
in tie near future, the dologatos representing
the nine provinces of onr Confedoration may ho
pleaqe(d to appoint a committee composed of the
most impartial and competent historians, as

miis.sion of preparing a text book of Canadian
history that eould be accepted and adoptcd by
ail prov incial govcrnmnents in aIl scbools under
their direct or indirect jurisdiction or control.

(Translation)
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT: Honourablo senatars, may I ho permitted ta offer
aur colleague fromn Peterborough (Hon. Mrs.
Fallis) my hest wishes and those of rny
Quebec fellow-citizens. We are happy ta extend ta ber aur greetings on the occasion of
ber hirthday.
I ar n ot an expert in pedagogical matters,
and it was flot my intention ta speak an the
motion of aur calleague fram Sarel (Han. Mr.
David), but nftor the speech delivered on
Wednesday by the bonourable senator from
the Laurentides (Hon. Mr. Bouchard)-and 1
regret that hoe is nat present naw-I deem it
my duty ta participate in this debate.
The desirahility of baving in Canada a single

bistary text-boak which could be used in the
scbools thraughout tho country, is a moot
point. Somne believe that the plan would be
impassible ta carry out; others consider it excellent. Sa far as 1 arn concerned, I lack tbe
nocessary 'pedagagical qualifications for passing
*iudgment on that matter.
If any one will read again the motion of
the honourable senator from Sorel, he will
bave no doubt about the spirit in which it
ivas made; it is a spirit of good und-erstanding.
harmony and ca-oporatian.

What is the abject

of tbis resolutian, if not to make the Quebec
people aware of what bas been dane outside
Queboc, and ta lot othor provinces know what
we and aur forefathers have done ta establish,
build up and develop Canada, aur common
motherland? If Canadians knew and understood one inother botter and had a Botter
knawlcdge of wbat bas been done by ail for
the motherland, would there not ho among
themn mare harmony as well as a greater and
mare constructive unity?

JUNE 23, 1944
Unfortunately, I arn afraid the speech
delivered by the honourable senator from the
Laurentides will not be of much help in the
attainment of that objective. On the contrary,
I fear that it may do much to aggravate
among Canadians the division which should
disappear in the national interest. What
amazes me-of course, I come from Quebec-is the importance the Press bas given to that
speech. If it bad been delivered in our
province it would bave caused us little
surprise. We have known our colleague for
twenty-five or thirty years, and we are used
to bis outbursts and bis exaggerations. But
I am alarmed at the importance that bas been
attacbed to bis statements outside our province. Wben our honourable friend spoke
about secret societies, I wondered whetber
there înight nlot be somewhere a secret organization interested in sowing the seeds of discord.
I quite readily admit that there are among
us people who are pronc to exaggerate, but I
do not believe that sucb people are to be
found only in Quebec. There are also in other
provinces people who exaggerate, who have
no senise of proportion. However, I do not
wish to venture too far on that grouhd,
hecause we know that those are exceptions
and that no general rule can be based on
isolated facta. For instance, do the attacks
which are launched every Sunday by a certain
pastor against the province of Quebec, and
which are reported the following day in a
certain publication, represent tbe feeling of aIl
Canada? No; far frorn it. If they did, there
would be practically no hope. Once again,
I agree that arnongst us tbere are people wbo
exaggerate, but we must flot base our judgment
of the situtition as a whole on individual cases.
My honourable colleague from the Laurentides
said to me the other day, "Did I not tell the
truth?" "Maybe so, to a certain extent and in
some respects," 1 answered, "but you have
quoted a few words uttered by one man.
taken an excerpt from one speaker, borrowed
a passage from a book, and a few extracta
frorn some magazine or other, and you bave
loosely knit together aIl these ill-assorted
patches, and finally you have made an
incendiary torch wbich you bave hurled across
That, to me, seems very
the country.
dangerous.".
Napoleon it was, I believe, wbo said one
day. "Give me three words in a man's handwriting and I will have him hanged." Is that
not the kind of thing that happened here on
Wednesday? Yet, I sbould not want to givo
tit for tat by using similar methods, because
to do so would be no less reprehensible. May
I mention, instead, an incident whîch concerna
me personally and which will show that

235

exaggeration is nlot ail on one side. A few
months ago one of my Caisses Populaires
inspectors happcned to be ini a parish close to
the American border. Bis day's work over, he
came back to the hotel for dinner, and around
ten o'clock went up to bis room. About thirty
minutes later he heard a commotion beneath
him, caused by anywhere from two to ten
persons carryîng on a conversation. Then, a
gavel struck the table, and silence ensued.
Next, he heard a voice saying: "A Caisses
Populaires inspecter is here; now, these bodies
are trying to organize the French-Canadians
so as to guarantee them economie independence. That must not be tolerated. We shall
put a stop to the activities of aIl the groups
we can prevent from operating, in order to
crush these Caisses Populaires and keep the
French-Canadians from attaining economie
independence."
When I was told the story, I paid no attention to it. The world continued its course as
before. This is the first time I have mentioned
the incident, and I do so only to show that
fanaticism is not ail on one side. Since then
our Caisses Populaires have developed and
expanded, and I ýhope they will continue to
prosper, for the greater good of my own people
and for the prosperity of the whole of Canada.
It is not permissible to consider a few isolated
cases as the general. rule. Such a procedure
would be far too dangerous. It is no doubt
possible that among us there may be, as in the
midst of every group everywhere, a few fanatics, visionary, exalted and quixotic people.
Among the twelve apostles, although they had
been chosen hy the Son of God, one proved
unwortby of the trust reposed in him.
You, my English-sýpeaking colleagues, have
a great quality and I often point you out as
an example to my children, to whom I say,
"When one of you has sometbing against bis
brother, try to settle the matter between yourselves, and do not wash your dirty linen in
public." You have your own faults, just as we
have ours, but you settle your quarrels privately. 1 congratulate you upon that. It is a
factor of strength; and I hope my fellowcitizens realize that the best way to correct an
error, to make good an omission, to redrees a
wrong, is to be constructive, to attempt to
buiki up instead of to pull down. I say "to
build up"; but my bonourable colleague's
speech, it seenis to me, is negative. Wben a
bouse is being built, the stones must be carefully placed one on top of another and wefl
bound together by a good cernent. You cannot
erect a building by throwing atones bere and
there, without even taking the trouble of
mixing the mortar. So it is with a people, a
nation: to build it, yo-u require good will,

236

SENATE

charity, co-operation and friendly understanding: without these prerequisites no nation cau'
live, prosper and grow.
A re-reading of my honourable colleague's
speech brought to my rnid tihe picture of a
public speaker on the hustings wishing to
bring discredit on our whole educational system, and especialiy on the relîgious educators,
of our province.
Since the debate is on a motion concerning
the teaching of history in Canada, Jet us recail
a few historical facts. In 1760 when conquered France abandoned us, we were only
about 60,000 People of French stock in Canada.
We had neither professors nor legal men to
give us leadership. But we did have someone:
in each parish there was a man te defend our
intereste, the country parish priest. H1e bas
been our sole educator for many decades. It
was he. I must add., who, after having taught us
te love our country, urged us to defend it and
keep it for the British Crown, in 1812.
We are the descendants of those brave people
who on several occasions saved Canada, and if
we can prove ourselves worthy of our forefatlhers, it is because of the education and
training given to us by our religious and ]ay
teachers.
I wish to pay the most sincere
tribute to our parish priests, to our clergy, to
our educationists who have heiped us to survive in this land of America, and to maintain.
in Canada, French civilization and culture.
The following- phrase, coined, by a man who
had gained some measure of fame in bis time,
was quoted: "Learn English. but do not learn
it well." I shali quote another, from one of
our distinguished men, Honoré Mercier, who,
in 1890, at the distribution of awards at the
Quebec Academy, said bo the young graduates:
"Learn English, learn it as quickly as possible,
and learn it well.?' Honoré Mercier was then
à leader among our people.
At a time when the people of the whole world
are striving to enliat the energies and good
will of ail men, when efforts are being made
to ensure the triumph of the Christian spirit, the
spirit of charity, I feel we should do our utmost
to -foster that Christian spirit of fraternîty,
mutual help and love. As ba8 been said is it
not truc that Cbristianity is now struggling
against paganism? Well, Christianity is based
on charity, the love of God and the love of
our nieighbour. I believe that instead of listening to the isolated and discordant voices of
persons devoid of any authority, we should
heed the advice of wise and level-beaded men,
and get together to promote a spirit of
co-operation, mutual assistance and fraternity.
I do not believe thoae who dlaim thst faseism
is rampant in Quebec. For thirty years I
bave listened ta the speeches of my honourable
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT.

friend, and he seems to be labouring under the
fear of certain associations, especially of secret
societies. Fear not! Subversive movements
will not spring from Quebec. Our province is
stili the last bulwairk of stability, loyalty and
faithfulness.
Do noV be afraid of Quebec;
you will always find there common sense
and moderation. A famous man, whose name
I do niot recaîl at the moment, said: "The lat
shot fired in America for the defence of the
British Crown will be fired by a French-Canadian." Indeed, to us Canada is our mother
country.
You have been told about ail kinds of
imaginary dangers such as subversive movements ailegedly launched with the connivence
of the clergy. I look at what is happening in
my own province. Wbat bas my Arcbbishop,
His Eminence Cardinal Villeneuve, donc since
the outbreak of war? Has he done anything,
uttered a single word that might jeopardize
victory? On the contrary, as recently as last
week he requested bis clergy to offer public
îpraycrs every evening for victory and peace.
His autbority is .respected in our province.
Some may bold different opinions; that may
happen in our province as cverywhere else;
but ail should know what respect and prestige
such an autboiity enjoys among us.
We are now fighting on French soul. The
other day. I heard over the radio that Major
HugiieQ Lapointe. the son of one of our

greatest Canadians, had distinguished himself,
at the head of bis men and in the eompany of
British and American broops, in the liberation of France. Major Sauvé, the son of our
late lamcnted colleague, who was with him,
and Major Triquet, V.C., afford additional
examples to show wbat we arc. »These are
no idl-e statements. These mern are doing
dceds wbieh prove the worth of their race
and the menit of the educators by whomn tbey
wcre sehooled. I would rather quote sucb
noble examples than spread vague charges that
engender disunion.
I read in two newspapers this morning that
the speech delivered on Wednesday in the
Senate wvas an evidence of courage. To my
mind, courage consista in forging ever ahead,
against aIl opposition; in building up and
developing, not in destroying. Destruction is
easily wrought. Constructive work is much
more difficult and requires much more time.
In conclusion, I wisb to say this to my
colleagues: If bistory cannot, some day, be
taugbt throughout Canada f'romn a single textbook, Jet ten text-books be prepared, if need
be, but at least Jet aIl young Canadians bave
an opportunity of learning wbat we bave done,
not in order Vo destroy our country but, on the

JUNE 23, 1944
contrary, to develop it and make it greater,
happier and more prosperous, to the end that
we may all join in the heart-felt cry, "Long
live Canada."

DEPARTMENT 0F VETERANS AFFAIRS
BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading of Bill 83, an Act to establish a Department
of Veterans Affairs.
He said: Honourable senators, in giving a
brief explanation of this Bill, I may say that
it is new hegislation only to the extent of
creating a new Department te administer existing legislation. The Bill does not initiate
new policy with respect to the welfare of exservice men.. It merely places the responsibility of administering present and future
hegislaticm for veterans in the hands of the
Minister of a new Department.
I believe the Bill meets the repeated demand
of veterane' organizations throughout the
Dominion that ahl measures affecting the care
and welfare of ex-service men and women be
consolidated in one Department under one
Minister.

239

It wilh be remembered that the present Department of Pensions and National Health,
established in 1928, administers two separate
and distinct types of services: one connected
with publie health, and the other with the
care of veterans. It is proposed to divide that
Department into two. AIl the activities having
to do witb ex-service personnel will be assigned
to the> Department of Veterans Affairs. To
that new Departmcnt also will be assigned
the administration of the Veterans Land Act
and the old Soldier Settiement Act, at present
adrninistered by the Department of Mines and
Resources. There is aIse provision that the
administration of any other statutes relating
to veterans may b-e assigned by Parliament or
the ýGevernment to the Minister of Veterans'
Affairs. The other haîf of the present Department of Pensions and National Health
wiIl be assigned to the proposed new Department of National Health and Welfare.
As far as practicable, the functions assigned
to the Minister of Veterans Affairs are identical with those describ ed in Part I of the
Department of Pensions and National Health
Act of 1928. The same language has béen
followed. Somne phrases wbich may appear to
be obsolete have been retained fromn the older
legishation, because their omission would terminate the Department's power to perform
certain services originating many years ago
and still essential and important in relation to
certain groupa of veterans. I refer to unemployment relief. This was initiated in the
depression period, and some ex-servicemen
who are not eligible for any other type of
assistance would be left destitute if it were
eut off.
Then there is reference to the canteen funds.
This is carried over from the old Act, because
an Act cf 1925 requires that the trustees
of canteen funds of the former war must
present annual reports to the Department of
Pensions and National Heal-th. 1 may say
that ne provision is made in the Bill for the
administration of the canteen funds of the
present war.
The Bill gives ne new powers te the Government, nor does it affect the administration of
the Pension Act, the War Veterans' Allowance
Act or any other Act affecting veterans, except
to substitute the name "Veterans Affaira" for
"Pensions and National Health."
It is intended to bring the services pert.aining to the Soldier Settlement Adt and
the Veterans Land Act, which are now under
the Department of Mines and Resources,
within the purview cf the new Department
when it is set up.
It is perhaps unnecessary te say more in
explanatien of this Bill. I would suggest that
after second reading it be referred te the

SENATE
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce. We might then ask departmental officials
to be present to explain certain matters which
may require some thought or consideration by
the members of the Committee.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
I desire to make a few observations with
regard to this important measure. In the
first place, I wish to congratulate the Government for having acceded to the wishes of the
veterans by bringing in legislation which has
for its object the consolidation, under one
department, of the many activities relating
to war veterans. This, I believe, is a move
in the right direction, because it will afford
the gallant ex-servicemen and. women of this
country, to whom we all owe so much, the
facility of dealing directly with one department, which will be charged with the responsibity of administering matters pertaining to
their affairs.
May I at this time be permitted to pay a
tribute to the departmental officials who have
been associated with the administration of
veterans' affairs? It has been my privilege
to have taken some interest in the problems
which have confronted ex-servicemen of the
last war, and I may say that at all times I
have found these officials both courteous and
helpful, and always ready to do everything
within their power to assist ex-servicemen.
I am sure we all realize that the post-war
period will be a very critical one in the history
of this country. It seems to me, therefore,
that the sooner this legislation is in operation
and the sooner this department is functioning,
the better it will be for all concerned.
In this connection, I should like to place
on Hansard a resolution adopted at the recent
Dominion Convention of the Canadian Legion,
held in Vancouver a few days ago. The resolution is as follows:
Be it resolved that this Convention urges
the Government to proceed forthwith with the
passage of the Bill to establish the Department
of Veterans Affairs. and immediately following
its enactment to commence the building of an
organization that would be capable of giving full
effect to the Government's rehabilitation programme when general demobilization takes
place.
I am very glad the honourable the leader
has suggested that this measure be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, for in that way we shall be able
to get a clear picture of the legislation to be
enacted.
Hon. Mr. COPP: My honourable friend
spoke of the resolution passed at the last
meeting of the Legion in Vancouver. Was
that a direction or an application to the
Government?
Hon. Mr. KING.

Hon. Mr. WHITE: Perhaps my honourable
friend will be interested in the following
paragraph:
This Convention desires to express appreciation to the Government for accepting the
proposal of the Canadian Legion for setting up
a Department of Veterans Affairs, and for intro-

during legislation to give it effect; but now
urges upon the Government the necessity for
establishing

such a department

forthwith,

so

that the administrative machinery to give effect
to the department's rehabilitation policy can
be set up well ahead of the general demobilization period, in readiness to deal expertly and
expeditiously with the problems of the returning
veterans of this war.
We particularly desire to warn the Government against permitting a state of unpreparedness to deal with the return to civil life of large
numbers of veterans of this war, and falling
into the same mistakes that occurred during
the post-war period following the First Great
War.
I think I may say, in answer to my honourable friend, that this matter is one which has
occupied the attention of the Canadian Legion
for some time, and I believe it was that
organization which first brought it to the
attention of the Government.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING: I would move that this
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee

amendment was very badly drawn.
I do flot want ta say much about the regulations at. this time. It would seem that some
111
of them w have ta be amended. I notice
that one says a candidate should flot be disqualified for uncertainty. if it is certain. That
does not make sense to, me. Another regulation provides that the Auditor General shall
pay the bills. It does flot say whether certain
funds wil1 be available for this purpase, or
whether he is ta use his own money. Other
amendments are obviously necessary throughout the regulatians. With these remarks and
with the assurance of the honourable leader
opposite <Hon. Mr. Ring) that the Bill will be
referred to a committee, I have no objection
ta the motion.
Hlon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, I wish ta say sa few words bath in
regard ta the Bill itself and ta, election practice
in general. As will be gathered fromn the titie
of this measure, it is reaily an amendment ta
the Dominion Elections Act of 1938, although
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
King) has seen fit ta treat it as a substantive
bill.
A perusal of the debate in the other House
discloses that the Bill provides for active
service voters exercising their franchise, during
the war and six months thereaftcr. But it
goes farther. It deals with regulations which
will be operative after that time. I do not
think this proposed legisiation is necessary,
but I have no objection ta it. In common
with ail my colleagues, I am anious that
members of th~e services, bath men and wamen,
shall have a vote, and that that vote shall
be secret. For soins time I was not sure that
the Bill provided for absolute secrecy af
106--17J

voting, but after scrutinizing its various provisions and listening ta the honourable leader's
explanation, I have came ta the conclusion
that there is not very much we can do in this
regard. After the ballot bas been marked
and placed in an inner envelope it ia ta be
enclosed in an auter envelope, an which wiI
appear the voter's name. There is anly a
remote possibility that a man's or woman's
vote could be traced. I am at a loss ta understand how a Service voter is to know what
the candidates stand for, and I hope that when
the Bill is 'before aur Committee on Banking
and Commerce an explanation will be forthcoming on this point.
This Bill provides for amendments ta the
Dominion Elections Act, and s0 gives me an
opportunity of diecussing a reformi that I
think is long overdue, namely, reform of aur
whole system of electing members ta Parliament. I have noticed recently that there is
quite an agitation in the Press for such reform,
and my observation of recent provincial
election results leads me ta the opinion that
this Bill should have provided for a change
in aur voting system.
Under aur present system n party may,
though receiving substantial support, fail ta
elect a single candidate. For instance, in
Saskatchewan in 19.%, 105,000 votes were cast
for one party, without its 6ecuring a single
seat in the legislature. In 19M about 85,000
votes were cast for the same party, and again
it failed ta secure any representatian. In the
recent election ini that province one party
elected almost ail ita candidates, thaugh it
received only 53 per cent af the total vote.
Undoubtedly on that very account aur
present system is faulty andL should be
reformed. As is evident from the figures I
ha-ve cited, where there are mare than two
candidates in the field, frequently the win'ning
candidate polis only a minority of the total
vote. The other votes are completely last.
In order ta remedy this defect an amendment ta the Dominion, Elections Act is long
past due.
I may be asked what other system of voting
I would propose. First, I would suggest that
Parliamýent should prescribe that the single
transferable vote ha used in ail single.imember constituencies, with proportianal representatian in multi-member constituencies.
Perhaps I can best boîster up my argument
by referring ta the resuits in certain, Ontario
canstituencies in the last elec-tion. Everyone
here knows that many candidates were elected
by a minority vote. For example, in Rami]ton-Wentworth the C.C.F. candidate polled
6,433 votes; the Progressive Conservative,
5,850 votes; the Liberal candidate, 5,453 votes.
If the single transférable vote had been in

SENATE
effect, if is quite likely that the Progressive
Conservative candidate would have been
elected, because many of the votes which went
to the Liberal candidate would have been distributed to the Progressive Conservative candidate. In Hastings West the Progressive Conservative candidate polled 6,530 votes; the
Liberal candidate, 4,107 votes; the C.C.F.
candidate, 2,944 votes. The Liberal and C.C.F.
candidates had betwecn them the majority of
tlie tc s. Who knows but what the Liberal
candidate might not have been elected if the
votes for the C.C.F. candidate had been
distributed?
Hon. Mr. KING: The voter indicates his
first, second and third choices on the ballot?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes. In Nipissing
the C.C.F. candidate received 5,642 votes; the
Liberal candidate, 4,005 votes; the Progressive
Conservative candidate, 2,327 votes. and another Liberal candidiate, 1,871 votes. Under
the single transferable vote system the votes
cast for the candidate at the bottom of the
list would probably have gone to the Liberal
candidate, and lie would have been elected; or
certain votes which were polled by the Progressive Conservative candidate might also
have been distributed to the Liberal candidate in sufficient strength to elect him. I have
under my hand thirty or forty similar cases,
but I shall content myself with these few
examples.
Proportional represent ation applies in multimember constituencies, such as Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, where the system has been
found to work out very satisfactorily. The chief
objection to proportional representation is that
it tends to the creation of more parties. But
I do not think we need fear such a tendency
at the present time, for right now there are
approximately ten parties in the House of
Commons.
I believe, honourable members, that our present electoral system is antiquated and should
be reformed, if the prestige of Parliament is to
be preserved, and I submit that the Government should at this session further amend the
Dominion Elections Act by prescribing the
single transferable vote ballot in all singlemember constituencies. If this were donc, no
votes would be lost and the candidate elected
would represent the najority of the voters.
To emphasize how defective our present
system is in that it tends to the exclusion
from Parliament of some of our most eminent
public men, I would remind honourable senators that in 1921 Mr. Meighen and eight
members of his Cabinet were defeated; that
in 1925 Mr. King and eight members of his
Cabinet were defeated; that again in 1935

electors' directions-iii this way preparing thent

This change should be made at tiis session.
unless Parliament in its wisdom, is r eady to
modernize the electoral system completely by
grouping single-menber constituencies into larger
I.R. constituencies cadi electing three, fouir, five
or more members.
Then I go down to New Brunswick, and I
quote from an article in the Moncton
Transcript. This article, entitled "Making all
Votes Count," is as follows:
One of the chief arguments against the
adoption of proportional representation has beei
that it tends to encourage the formation of
more political parties, thus getting farther away
from the simple and effective two-party systen.

JUNE 28,1944
In the Canadian House of Commons, as presently
constituted, no less than ten parties are represented. We have attained a multiplicity of
parties without adopting proportional representation. It is doubtful that its adoption would
lead to the entry of many, if any, more. If
that objection no longer is valid, the way may
be open to consider the merits of the plan
unhampered by the fear of ýfurther compiieating
the political situation.
When the next federal election is held it is
probable that there will be at least three
candidates in a majority of the constituencie6;
in some, there will be more. Under the present
system, it is inevitable that a large number of
the candidates will be elected by a minority
vote. If the 'ballots were almost evenly divided,
thirty-four per cent of the vote would be enough
to place a man in the lead and thus ensure hie
election. Under proportional representation or
by the use of the transferable vote, this would
be an impossibi.lity. Each member elected would
gain his seat only 'by the wisli of a majority
of his constituents.
The voter
The system is simple enough.
indicatee on bis ballot his first choice, 'bis second
choice, and so on. If no candidate receives a
clear majority of first ehoice ballots, the second
choice is 'takzen into consideration and the
process is continued, if necessary, until the
returning officer finds the candidate whom a
majority of the voters wish to represent them.
That in brief, honourable senators, is aIl I
have to say at this time. Under the peculiar
conditions that prevail ini Canada at the
present tirne, and which are likely to prevail
at the next election, I think the Government
should take this matter into consideration
before Parliament prorogues; and I for one
should like to sce the single-transferable vote
tried out in ail single-member constituencies
in the Dominion at the next federal election.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Heýr, hear.

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, in view of the very appropriate
observations of the honourable senator who
lias just taken lis seat, I should like to add a
word or two to what lie has saîd, and also to
make sorne other references to this Bill.

There are those, possibly, in this Chamber,
who feel that, because tliis Bill is entitled "an
Act to provide regulations enabling Canadian
War Service electors to exercise their franchise,
...and to provide amendments to The
Dominion Elections Act," there shoul d be some
disinclination or indisposition to discuss a
question which, as we ail know, directiy and
vitally affects the members of another place in
a way in which it cannot affect the members
of this Chamber. On the other liand, over
and against that, I should like to empliasize
that one of the principal traditional responsibilities of this Chamber is that of safcguarding
the riglits of minorities, and sectional interests
in this country.

After alI, the main purpose of this Bill is
a technical one-to provide facilities for the
taking of soldiers' votes during war-timeand one of my chief objections to it is that
clauses 5 and il inject into it a subject whicli
should be deait with more adequately in a
consideration of the Dominion Elections Act
as a whole. The features that have heen

dealt with by the honourable senator from
(Hon. Mr.
West Central Saskatchewan
Aseltine) should also lie supplemented by a
consideration of the whole scope of the application of the franchise in this country.
We have in clause 5 a provision to dis-

franchise a section of people in this country,
many of whomn are only too anxious to vote,
if they had the chance, whereas, in my
opinion, the Dominion Elections Act as a
wholo should be amended so as to obligate
a great many people who now do flot vote
at ail to go to the polls.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: On the one hand,
through this Bill, in what I eall an insidiaus
way, we are taking the votes away from
peuple who are wiihing to vote, whereas the
whole projeet of amending the Dominion
Elections Act, so as to bring home to the
people of this country some of the obligations of democracy, is being cntirely overlooked.

I am opposcd to this Bill largely on the
ground that clause 5 is irrelevant to the real
purposes of the Bill, and that there is an
overdue need of an amendment to the
Dominion Elections Act. Further, if it is
neccssary t0 deal with the fundamentals of
naturalization and the franchise, it should be
(lone in circumstances altogether different
from those which surround this Bill.

In the second place, I arn opposed to this
Bill because it delegates to the provinces the
federal authority in reference to the applica-

tion of the franchise.

I arn not going to
but I
think it is most objectionable to establish in
any dominion legislation the principle of
relinquishing the rcsponsibility which helongs
to the Dominion of Canada in the conferring
of the franchise on its citizens.
develop thiat point at the moment,

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: In the third place,
I am opposed to the Bill because it violates
the principles underlying the most sacred
contract that Canada enters into with respect

to its citizens. It suggests that those who
have been naturalized under the provisions
of the Naturalization Act shall be deprived
of the franchise in provinces wherc they now

246

SENATE

have the vote, purely on the ground that
they are members of a race with which we
are at var.
My fourth ground is that it represents the
most hateful feature of Hitler's Nazi doctrine
of racialism.
The fifth point I would make is that, in contrast with the attitude of our great democratic
neighbour towards its American citizens of the
Japanese race, Canada, with is much-vaunted
claims to nationhood, is intolerant and reactionary in its dealings with this war problem,
which alse is one of vital international importance. If any one has taken the trouble to
follow the statements of President Roosevelt,
be will have seen that he not only bas indicated
to American citizens of the Japanese race the
prospect of their return to their own lands and
properties, but bas opened the door to their
enlistment in the American armies serving
overseas. As a result of this many have enlisted, and have given valuable service in
Italy, in North Africa and on the shores of
France.
I do not intend to discuss the implications
of clause 5, and its subsidiary, clause 11, because the main point of the clause, as is made
clear by the explanation on the adjoining
page, is to disqualify from voting at a
Dominion election persons of the Japanese
race. As the clause stands, of course, the implications are that any racial group with which
Canada is at war may be disfranchised in any
province where the provincial authorities sec
fit to disqualify them-Germans, Italians, Bulgarians and Rumanians. Even the French, by
a certain stretch of application, might be disqualified as being supporters of Vichy. In
such a case none of those groups in any of
the provinces would be able to vote in a
Dominion election.
I am glad that this Bill is to be referred to
committee for discussion. I hope that then,
and in the meantime full consideration will be
given to the very important principles underlying it.

Honourable
Hon. CAIRINE WILSON:
senators, I should like to support everything
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) bas said; and in the committee
I hope to bring forward sone further instances
of ýparticular antagonisms.
I have received all manner of representations
protesting against this measure. I am pleased
to say they come largely from youth organizations. There seems to be a feeling that a
few at least of the Japanese citizens are given
an opportunity to acquire certain rights, thereby relieving, perhaps, what bas been a problem
.n British Columbia. But the Bill gives them
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

rights nowhere. Further it retards the causes
for which we are supposed to be fighting in the
war. If we support such a clause as the one
to which objection is taken, I do not think
we can claim to be opponents of racial discrimination and upholders of democracy. This
clause seems unjustifiable, because it would
apply not only to wartime elections or six
months thereafter, but would remain in perpetuity on our statute books.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I have listened with a great deal of interest
to all that bas been said in reference to this
Bill. It seems to me very strange that it
passed the House of Commons unanimousIy.
Prom what bas been said here, it would appear
that a very great injustice is likely to be
done, and I think the Leader of the House is
wise in having the Bill referred to Comnmittee. Undoubtedly there are some phases
of it which should be looked into.
It is quite true that this Bill is essentially
a House of Commons measure; nevertheless,
we are here to look after minorities, and it
may be that they will be dealt with unjustly
by this measure.
There is only one other point I wish to refer
to at the present time, and that is the statement made by my fellow-member from West
Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine). It
seems to me the time bas come when the
Parliament of Canada should seriously consider
the passage of legislation designed to ensure
that the representative of every constituency
will be chosen by a majority of the people of
the constituency. My honourable colleague
from West Central Saskatchewan bas pointed
out what happened in the past and what will
happen at the next election.
In the old days, when we had two main
political parties in this country, the situation
was relatively simple: by far most members of
Parliament were then elected by a majority of
the people in their respective constituencies.
But to-day we have three or four major
parties, and under existing law there is not
only a possibility but a likelihood that many a
man who bas not been voted for by a majority
of the people in his constituency will come to
Parliament to act as representative of that
constituency. I submit to honourable senators
that that is not responsible government. Men
who are sent to Parliament by the votes of
half or less than half of the people in their
constituencies are not truly representative of
those constituencies. I repeat that the time
bas come-in fact, it bas long since comewhen Parliament should seriously consider
amending the Dominion Elections Act, with a
view to avoiding this undesirable situation.

JIJNE 28, 1944
Hon, W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
I do flot intend to speak at lengtli, but I wish
to explain briefly my position with regard to
the motion for second reading of this Bill.
Before doing that, though, I should like to
endorse what lias been said by the honourable
senator from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) with regard to the single transferable vote. I arn entirely ini favour of it,
and I think his argumenta are unanswer>ble.
I shail not object to the second reading of the
Bill, but if I had not the assurance of the
honouraible leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. King) that the Bill will go to a committee, where an amendment to clause 5 will
be offered, I should fight clause 5 to the last
ounce of my strength. I may flot support the
Bill even if that clause is amended. In my
opinion it embodies-I was going to say the
worst principle that one could conceive, but it
is really a lack of principle. The clause is
thoroughly unsound and unfair.
If other honourable members had not referred to the implications of the clause as it
now stands, I should have mentioned some of
them, as I was prepared to do. Just to show
what could happen under that clause, I wifl
merely say that in certain eventualities it
would disfranchise people born in this country,
even people whose fathers and grandfathers
were born in this country. It could d.isfranchise
probably haîf of the people of Waterloo. If
that clause were carried, then in certain eventualities the present Member of Parliament
for North Waterloo would flot be entitled to
vote.
Hon. Mr. KING: If the province of Ontario
took certain action.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes; if the province of
Ontario passed a law disfranohising, for purposes of a provincial election, all people whose
racial origin is that of a country at war with
Canada. The Legislature of Ontario would
probably not pass so foolish and unfair a law,
but it miglit do so.
I would also support wbat was said by the
honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Lambert). It seems to me most anomalous and
incongruous that Parliament should empower
provincial legislatures to deprive certain citizens of Canada of the right to vote in a
federal election.
I was just going on to point out some things
that might happen if clause 5 cwere carried and
the province of Ontario were to pass a law
sîich as is contemplated by that clause. I
select Ontario only because it is my native
province. As I say, the Member of Parliament
for North Waterloo could not vote- nor could

247

the Member for South Waterloo vote. The
Senator from. Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) could
not vote. One of bis sons could vote, but
the other could not. My wife could vote,
simply because, unlike mei she is not of the
Gerrnan race; but she would not have had
the riglit to vote if she had not become my
wif e. I believe that a certain Canadian
General, who was signally honoured by the
King about a week ago,.could not vote. And
if the present Supreme Commander of the
invasion forces in France were living i
Ontario under such circumeatances, lie could
not vote. I suspect that the AdmiraI of the
United States Navy also, if living here under
those circumatances, could not vote. To show
how absurd this thing miglit become-for I do
not know how far back racial origin would be
traced-may I point out that if His Majesty
the King were living over here, even lie could
be prevented from voting. As I said at a littie
gathering-Hon. Mr. HAIG: That wss not at a caucus?
Hon. Mr. EULER: My honourable friend
ahould net be so inquisitive.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I just wondered.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have spoken about this
matter to some colleagues who sit on my
honourable friend's side of the House. In my
possession are the names of some forty men
of the German race who have been killed in
this warHon. Mr. LACASSE: Men from Ontario?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes; from the district
which I used to represent in another place.
I have the names of some forty men of the
German race who have been killed in ths war,
and of many more of that race who have heen
wounded. If clause 5 were carried and the
LegisIature of Ontario passed au Act disfranchising the people of that race, then the
father, probably the mother, and certainly the
brothers and sisters-except those having military service-of every one of those men would
be unable to vote in a federal election. Can
honourable mnembers conceive of a more unjust
piece of legislation? Whoever was responsible
for the framing of clause à could not possibly
have been seized of ail its implications.
I apologize to the honourable leader of the
House (Hon. Mr. King) for mentioning these
things. I was .prepared to say ail this and
more if an effort had been made to adopt
clause 5 as it stands. I could flot possibly
have taken any other position. Now that
the Bill is to be referred to a committee, I
hope the clause will be so amended that it
will flot confer sucli powers upon provincial
legislatures. For my part, I should like to

248

see it eliminated altogether, because in rny
opinion every man and woman born ia this
country, and every man and woman who bas
moved here and become a citizen-whether
born in Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia, Polnnd or anywhere else-îs a Canadian citizen and entit]ed to the rights of
Canadian citizenship. Wc tax these people
and impose upon themn other responsibilities
of citizenship; we have no right te deprive
tbern of its priviieges.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: lionourable senlators, I do nlot want to lose this opportunity
of placing myself on record as opposed to
the disfranchisement of the people of any
nationality wlio play their part as citizens
of this country. It is questionable whether
conscientious objectors should be aliowed to
vote; but with that qualification, I strongly
support the remarks of the bonourabie gentleman who lias just taken bis seat (Hon. Mr.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is under the
proposed amendment?
Hon. Mr. HAIJG: No; that is in the present
law.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Then, what is the purpose of clause 5 of this Bill?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The purpose of clause 5
was to prevent Japanese people from voting
anywhere in Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Why should it not say
so?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what was intended
to to be said by the clause. It is very badly
drafted, that is ail. Mfter reading it carefully
I saw that it did not have the meaning that
the explanatory note ascribed to, it.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Was my honourable
friend reading a moment ago from the Act
of 1938 ?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes; from section 14,
subsection 2, paragrapli (i).
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is worded differently,
but it means the same thing as this clause?
Éon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. 1 do noV intend to
deal further with it; but I must say, candidly,
that I for one ai not so sympathetic towards
the Japanese as some of my honourable
friends have stated themselves to be. I arn
speaking for myself only.
I will try to answer the question asked me
by my hoinourable friead from Kingston
(Hon. Mr. Davies). Without boasting, I
believe I can dlaimn to be the only member of
this Chamber who was ever elected under a
a system of proportional representation. I ran
in four elections conducted under that systcma.
Ever since 1920 the city of Winnipeg has been
what we cail a multi-member constituency,
electing ten members to the Legislature by
proportional representation. The trest of the
province is composed of single-member constituen.iýes, which elect their representatives by
the single transferable vote. The principles
underlying the two systems arc diametrically
opposed. TJnder the single transferable vote
you may have four, six, ten, or any number
of candidates in a constituency. The man who
receives the smallest number of votes is
dropped, and that process is continued until
there are only two candidates left, when the
man who then has the larger number of votes
is declared e]ected. Governments are opposed
to this system -because
they fear, quite
wroagly, that the dividîng-up of the vote will
resuit in a divided opposition to the party
elected. That has always been the fear of
goveraments in Canada, Great Britain and
elsewhere.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Is the single transferable vote systema used in Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It has been in effect there
since 1924.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: For the election of
memibers to the Legislature?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. It has worked most
satisfactorily.
Hon Mr. DAVIES: Does it entirely obviate
the election of a minority goverument?
'Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ia Manitoba there are
forty-five single transferable vote constituencies, and the mai ority of the people of those
constituencies elected the government. There
is no question about that. An important fact
is that this systemn helps to kill outright partisanship, and makes people want to choose
better types of candidates than would be
chosen under other systems. Suppose that in
the constituency of Minnedosa there are three
candidates. That is a constituency rwhich for
some years lias sent a Conservative member
to the Legislature, with the Liberal candidate
running second, and the C.C.F. candidate third.
It may be that the electors who are in favour
of the C.C.F. would ordinarily like to see a
member of the Liberal party elected ini preference to a Conservative, but proba;bly the
Conservatives have been fortunate in choosing
as their candidate a man or wolnan of exceptional qualifications, acceptable to nearly
everyone. Under the single transferable vote
system, that is the kind of candidate they try
to get. You do not have a hole-in-the-corner
convention, because every party knows it must
nominate the *hest candidate who can be
secured, a man or woman of real standing in
the community. As I say, the system lias given
entire satisfaction in our province.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I do not quite understand this. In Manitoba there is a coalition
Government supported by varions parties
because no party did secure a mai ority.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh no, no-tut, tut, tut.
There are forty-nine members on one side of
the Legislature, and five on the other. It is
j ust as oné-sided as is that of Saskatchewan.
The coalition Government was formed in the
faîl of 1940. When the election came ini the
spring of 1941, if the member for Minnedosa,
for example, had heen a Conservative, the
coalition nominated a Conservative caà~didate,
and all the Liberals and C.C.F.'ers voted for
him; if the seat had heen represented by a
C.C.F. member-the C.C.P. originally belonged
to the coalition-a C.C.P. candidate was
nominated, and everybody voted for hima.

SENATE

Only one constituency elected a candidate in
opposition to the coalition, and that was
Assiniboia.
Hon. Mr. KING: Was that a party arrangement within the constituency?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. The coalition said,
"We cannot control the nominations in any
constituency, but we would suggest that if
the sitting member is a Consorvative or a
Liberal, ho or some other Conservative or
Liberal should be nominated as the coalition
candidate." Sometimes the sitting member did
not want to run again, but that was the general
way in which, the arrangement worked out.
Ia twe or three constituencies candidates in
opposition to the coalition candidate were
elccted, but where it was a fight between two
candidates of the samo party the better man
got elected.
I am opposcd to proportional representation. I was elected under that system every
time I ran, se it is not a case of sour grapes
with me; my objection is that it puts minority
parties into the Huse, and is therefore a bad
system.
1 suggest to flhc honourable leader of this
House (Hon. Mr. King), and to the Government, that they give serious consideration to
the proposaI of the honourable senator from
(Hon. Mr.
West Central Saskatchewan

Aseltine).

bouse and made a notable contribution to
the discussion of polities in this country when
he urgcd that the adoption of the single

that the Dominion Elections Act should be

would help toecliminate ail the little "isms"
thaft are wont te 'become vocal during election
camnpaigos, for with the single transferable

but the rank and file members of the Conservative and Liberal parties believe in free
enterprise. That idea is challenged, and
bitterly challenged, rîght now in this country,
and will continue to be bitterly challenged
until the issue is decided. I do net know how
we are te get an accurate. reflection of the
opinion of the country if 40 per cent of the
electorate can eleot the next federal Government.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: ls it found in practice
that there are more spoiled ballots under the
single transferable vote system than under
the old system?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In the firat. elections, but
net afterwards. This is what happened. Everybody was used eo marking bis ballot with a
cross, and it took a little while te get over
that habit. Lot us suppose that you and 1
and two other candidates are running. I meet
Mr. Jones and ask him, "Whom. are you voting
for?" Ho replies, " I intend to vote for Mr.
Sinclair." Then 1 say te him, "Well, you
give him No. 4; he will be delightcd with
that big number. Give me No. 1; 1 enly
want "P' after my name."
Somne hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
bon. Mr. HAIG: Quite a number of candidates in the first election got votes they were
net entitled te, of course, but in subsequent
elections the voters had learned how te mark
their ballots in the order of preference.
bon. Mr. SINCLAIR: But that would flot
ho a spoiled ballot?
bon. Mr. HAIG: No. We amendcd the law
later on, and now we have ne more spoiled
ballots than wc had under the old system.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In Manitoha under
the systcm of the single transferable vote ean
an elector mark his ballot for just eue candidate; that is, plump for him?
Hou. Mr. HAIG: Yes, ho can plump for
one candidate, and the ballot is good for that
name.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: If thore is ne other
choice?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct. From 1922 on
net a single momber in Manitoba has ever
protested against the system. It is nover even
mentioned. Ever since we have had a coalition
Government the single transferable vote has
solved every election probleni. In a constituency where you have several coalifionist candidates and one opposition candidate, what are
you going te do? Under the single transferable voe system you vote one for the first

JUNE 28, 1944
coalition candidate, two for the second, three
for the third, according to your choice, and
the successful candidate gets an aibsolute
rnajority of the votes.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
resuit prior to the coalition?

What was the

Hon. Mr. HAIG: There were oniy two
parties up te that time.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: But where there
were three candidates?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Suppose a candidate bas
a majority of 100, and the third candidate
bas oly 150 votes. Some of those votes will
die, and some will go each way; so there are
neyer enough votes to overcome the majority
of 100. But ini the case cited by niy honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) of 6,400 for
the C.C.F. candidate, 5,800 for the Progressive
Conservative candidate, and 5,400 for the
Liberal candidate, I do not know how those
5,400 wouid be allotted. You may think you
know, but you don't. It would depend largely
on the candidate.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
to be second choices.

There would have

Hon.' Mr. HAIG:
I know. But whom
would the second choice be for? That is the
crux of the matter. Ail I arn saying is that
the system elirninates the danger of a minority
government being elected. There may be a
minority government as a resuit of the next
federal general election, 'because Manitoba,
Ontario, British Columbia and Cther provinces
rnay retumn minority groupe of twenty-five
members each, making up the total memberslip of the House of Commons. I do say that
if you had the single transferable vote in
effeet, ail the members frorn Manitoba would
corne here with a majority of their constituents behind them. If a C.C.F. candidate
gets 6,000 votes, a Liberal candidate 5,000 and
a Progressive Conservative 4,000, no one can
stand up and say to the C.C.F. rnan, "You
don't represent the mai ority in your constituency," because if a mai ority of the
second choice votes went to him hie would be
elected; or if they went to the Liberal candidate hie would be elected. In city voting you
would be surprised at the number of candidates who lead at the start and later are
crowded out. We have not had to meet that
condition in the rural parts, because until
recently we had only two parties.
I arn strongly in favour of the single transferable vote, and that is why I have intervened in the debate.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
Honoursile
senators, I do not thin-k adoption of the single
transferable vote would solve the problern, as
rny honourable friends seem to think it would.
Sorne years ago I was a member of a commirittee of the House of Comrnons which made a
very extensive study of voting syeteme ini
various parte of the British Commonwealth
of Nations, ini the United States and in other
countries. Mr. John MacNicol, who was
chairrnan of that cornrittee, is, I think, one
of the best posted men in Canada on the
ayatems of voting now in use in every country of the world. The committee was alrnost
unanimous in the conclusion that the single
transferable vote would not solve the problem we were -tIen studying, and tInt proportional representation in rural constituencies
would necessitate constituencies of such an
extensive area, that it would be almost impossible for any member te keep in close contact
with any large percentage of the electorate.
Take the province of Manitoba. The honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
said that no meniber frorn that province could
corne to the House of Commons unless lie
represented a majority of the electors of his
constituency. If I arn not correct in my interpretation of his rernarks, I hope lie will set
me riglit.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
voted.

A mai ority of th ose who

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: In Manitoba we
have the single transferable vote, and it
applies where there are more than two candidates. We find that the successful candidate
is elected because lie gets a few transfers from
the votes cast for the third candidate. But
if you look at the election records for the
province you will see that in every constituency where proportional representation and
the single transferable vote are in effect a large
percentage of the votes cast for the eliminated
candidate are not counted, for no sccond
choice lias been made, and consequently the
member elected lias not the support of the
mai ority of the electors. If my honourable
friend. the acting leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) will look et the Manitoba figures, I
think hie will find that very situation.
Another subject that was studied very
extensively by the committee was compulsory
voting as they had it in Australia. I arn very
much in favour of compulsory voting, but
it is alrnost impossible to apply, because you
have to give exemptions. You cannot prosecute ever-3nbody wlio, for certain reasons, fails

ta vote. The exemptions were so numeraus
in Australia that they have discontinued
compulsory voting.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT. Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I think they
have.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: No, no. That is
net true.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Wel1, they certainly have not been ahle ta put it into, effect
as they would like ta do.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: As the honourable
senator lias mentioned Australia, I may say
that compulsory voting bas been in force in
that ceuntry since 1926, and the percentage
cf votes polled there bau increased froma 1088
flian 70 per cent te over 90 per cent. \Vhile
there were a number of spoiled ballots, they
were net sufficient te offset the increase.

DEPARTMENT 0F RECONSTRUCTION
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
:)f Bill 82, an Act to establish a Department of
Reconstruction.
Hie said: Honourable senators, consideration
of the subject-matter of this Bill bias gone far
beyond the bounds of Parliament; boards of
trade, City councils, provincial governments
and various other public bodies have devoted
considerable time to its discussion.
In 1939, within the flrst few months of the
war, the Government set up committees of
speciaiists to study projects for reconstruction
and re-establishment after the war. This Bill
i3 based on recommendations contained in
Thý 11-n. the SPEAKER.

reports which those committees have made
toi the Gavernýment. It wiil ho, observed that
the proposed Department of Reconstruction
wiil be under the control of a Minister, who
wvili have the assistance of such officiais as may
he required to carry on lus executive work.
It mwili b hlis responsibiiity to study the vanious projects suihmîtted and to hring them to
the attention of the Covernor in Council for
acceptaflce or rujection.
The Governor in Counceil having decided
%vhat,projeets shaîl be undertaken, those projects will be referred to the Department of
Governmient bcst suited to carry thcmn out.
Where a provincial Governument is concerned,
the federal authorities wviil confer with it as to
the most efficient w'ay toï administer the
undcrtaking. A similar praetice will apply
where municipalities and other public bodies
are interested.
I do not think any useful purpose would ho
served by my reviewing what has been donc by
the varions committees that have studied the
problems of reconstruction and re-establishiment.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Will an additional Minister bc appointed for this new Department, or

wili it ho in charge of on& of the present
members of the Cabinet?
Hon. Mr. KING: The Prime Minister intimated in another place that no new Minister
would ho appointed, but that the proposed
Department of Reconstruction would be placed
in the hands of a present member of the
Government.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I have followed very carefuily the debate on
this Bill in another place, and while I have no
objection to the motion for second reading, it
struck me that throughout that debate many
oï the members did not appear to bave any
realization of what conditions will ho when the
war us over.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mn. HAIG: That realization seems
also to ho lacking throughout the country.
Take my own province. I do not know the
exact figure, but the cost of the projeets suggested to the legishature would exceed $100,000l,000. When I lef t Winnipeg two weeks ago
the figure for Saskatchewan was much higher,
and now, wît.h a new Government in office, it
wiil probably exceed $200,000,000.
Hon. Mn. RING: I do flot want to interrupt the honourable senator; but I would
remind bim that certain post-war projects have
been studied by a committee of the other
flouse, and the bniefs and other information

JUNE 29, 1944
subrnitted in support of those projecte will be
turned over to the propoaed Department of
Reconstruction.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I toldi my honourable
friend at the outset that I arn not objecting to
the Bill. What I arn objecting to is the recklema spirit that la a'broad in this country. For
instance, although I forget the exact figure,
the coat of varii>us worke propoeed for my
home city oi Winnipeg runs into millions of
dollars. That spirit prevaila right acros
Canada. In fact, the provincial governrnent la
criticized if its suggested programme does flot

attitude of mind towards this subi ect.
I understand that certain political parties
are geing up and down the country voicing
this theory: If we can raise money to conduct
a war and put everybody to work, we can
raise money in peace-time and put everybody
tD work. I arn not sure that theory la sound.
In wartime our backs are to the wall. Moet
honoura;ble -members will recail the anxious
days cf 1940, when frorn about the lat of
April to the end of October we found it difficuIt to sleep at night because we were worryiflg over our extrernely critical situation. In
fact, everybody in this country worried until
the Germans launehied their attack againat the
Russians on the 21st cf June, 1941. Then we
knew we had a chance cf survival. Prior to
the war we haed an annual icorne cf about
84,000,000,000; now it is more than $8,000,000,000. No one knowe what it wil be after the
war. We shail have te seIl our raw materials
and our manufactured gooda in the markets of
the world. True, a portion of thern wiil be
used at home, but the overplue we shail have
to export. In return, we shahl have to buy
goods in the markets cf the world, because,
like Great Britain, the continental countries
cf Europe will have few fereigu invegtrnenta,
little ahipping, and ne capital for financing on
an extensive scale. These substantial sources
of incorne, called invisible importa, have nearly
ail disappeared. Instead cf encouraging people
te corne ferward with granidiose schernea, I
should like te have sornebody tell the idealiste
who have been running wild up and down t.i
country for the paat two years, that under the
conditions which wiil exiat at that tirne ail we
shall have to spend la what the country carne.
I think it was the province cf Saskatchewan
which .paased an incerne tax law providing that
ainybody who got lem than $10,000 waa te pay
ne tax. Weil, the result was that they did not
get enough inoney by the tax te pay for the
rnachinery necessary to coilect it. What la the
situation under our own systern of taxation?
We are able te get the large arnounta we do
hecause the minimum taxable incorne la placed

255

at a very low figure and large numbere of
people have been brought under the tax. We
should get down to a realistic basis, and the
people of thia country should realize that
nothing can be done to take care of our men
when they return frcom overes more than we
can do ourselves. I hope the Minister, whoever hie is, will be a realist, and that when the
war ia over we shall know what we are doing.
It may be said by sorne that because I amn
a senator I do not appreciate the ideaiism. of
these times. Well, honourable senatore, we
have ail lived long enough to bie farniliar with
some things which have taken place. For
instance, ini 1934 the people of Alberta were
gemng to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
I remember one man saying, "Income for the
year is so much-say about 5200,000,00yon can divide it in any way you like, but
that is ail there is to divide, and you cannot
get more than that." Canada has sorne eight
billions of incorne to divide arnong the people
of thia country, provided the figure does not
go down, and. that incorne dependa upon our
outside trade. That being so, I want the Minister te see what can be done with the
machinery we already have, our induatrial and
fariùing communities. The Departrnent of
Soldiers Civil Re-establishment is going te
buy up land ln Manitoba to re-eatablish soldiers after the war. But believe me, at the
price it is able to pay it is not going to
get the best land. Any farmer ini thia House
will. tell you that is a iitake; that no
matter what you pay for it, first-class land is
cheap, and second-class land alwaya dear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That la the miatake that
was made after the last war.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I admit that, and I say we
should not be caught twice ini the saine error.
I arn supporting the Bfi. I hope an able
man la appointed to adminiater it. If I
may sound a political note, 1 would say that
no one knows now who that man Mnay be,
because before the Act la put into full operatien there will be a general election in this
country, and anybody who can forecaat the
resuit la a better prophet than 1 amn.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You would flot expeet
hie naine to be inserted ini the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I certainly ehould not.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD -(Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Why wouldn't you?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I were ini the confidence
of Mr. Coldweil or Mr. Bracken, I rnight be
able to tell you who that man rnight be,
though even then I should flot be very oertain.

256
Hon. Mr. COPP:
guess?

SENATE
Would you hazard a

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, I would not hazard a
guess.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It might come too close
home.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: After going through six
general elections one learns that things sometimes slip and do net turn out as desired.
I am net going to say any more. I stand
four-square, as we all do, for the principle that
the men and women who come back to this
country must be our first consideration. No
other issue is so important. It was an important issue after the last war,.but this time
it is doubly important. It is true there might
have been trouble after the last war, but the
situation to-day is entirely different, and the
men and women who have gone overseas and
offered their lives-and the number of these
people is large-must be taken care of. At
this time, also, there are the people who have
gone into industry. Women will not want to
go back from offices and factories to the ordinary affairs of life. There is no doubt about
that. They have grown accustomed te
regular hours, and it will be a little difficult
for them te become satisfied with domestic
life again, as many did after the last war.
I am in entire accord with the Bill, but I
maintain that in working out our problem we
should not overlook the machinery already in
this country, and we should not fail to get the
co-operation of our industrialists, manufacturers, farmers, fishermen, and lumbermen. I
would rather have the opinion of a Manitoba
farmer on the problem of reconstruction
than that of the principal of McGill College.
I would rather have the opinion of a Nova
Scotia fisherman as te what can be done in
the fishing industry than the opinion of any
professer in the country; and I think that is
the basis on which we should work.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I have only a word or two that I should like
te say in reference te this Bill. I am net going
te oppose it or object te it, mainly because
I do net know the background of its origin.
We all agree that from coast to coast throughout this country there bas been a tremendous
amount of discussion on rehabilitation and reconstruction. That is all to the good. The
discussion of this subject by various organizatiens has undoubtedly been very helpful. As
my honourable colleague te my left (Hon. Mr.
Haig) has said, there is a great deal of idealism abroad at the present time. That is net
a bad thing, either. But many people are
looking for a sort of golden age for themHon. Mr. HAIG.

selves, their families and their communities.
A golden age, with increased salaries and all
sorts of benefits for everyone, would be very
fine, but it is net realistic. I listened over the
radio the other night, te a group of artists discussing community centres for the advancement of art and that sort of thing. That is
desirable. But this country and every other
country participating in the war is facing a
problem that ona day will be very real, and
it will net consist of all the dreams that are
floating about in the world to-day.
Let me briefly illustrate what the conditions
may bc a very few months from now. As we
all know, the war at this moment is progressing favourably on every front. The Germans
have not won a major victory anywhere for
probably a year and a half or two years. On
the contrary, they have met with great reverses on every front. The might that has
been brought into existence by the Allied
Nations is se vast that the German forces are
net able to stand against it anywhere in the
world to-day. It bas been said, or at least it
has been strongly hinted, even by Mr. Churchill
himself, that this struggle may end comparatively soon. If that is se, then Canada and
every other nation fighting the war should
prepare as far as is humanly possible te meet
the situation which will follow. It will corne
suddenly. As we all know, the end of the
last war came over night. Nobody expected
victory in 1918, yet it came; and the same
thing may happen again. Therefore the main
task for our Government to-day is te do
what?
Hon. Mr. KING: Te get ready.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Te get ready just as
early as it possibly can, and for the time
being te forget these dreams, because we shall
have some very real problems that will have
te be taken care of, and that very soon.
Have I made myself clear? I am sure I have.
I am sure there is net a member of this House
who fails te recognize what the situation is.
What is the picture to-day? We have in
the armed services to-day somewhere in the
neighbourhood of eight hundred thousand men
who have been taken away from their homes
and vocations, some of whom have been absent
from Canada for four years. When this war
ends they will have te be properly taken care
of as soon as they reach Canada, and any
government which is net concentrating on that
problem before every other problem is net
doing its duty.
The soldier problem will not stare us in the
face immediately, because very few of those
men will be home within six months after the

JUNE 29, 1944
war ends. It will prohably take a year to
bring them home, and the chances are that
some of them will have to remain behind for
a time. But there is another problem which
will face us immediataly, and that is the
problem of those people who, by the thousands,
have been taken fromn their homes and put
into industry. That is a problemn which will
corne upon us over niglit.
When the wa-r ends, wbat is going to happen
to ail the industries in Canada which to-day
are making ail sorte of thinge for the war?
They are going to, close their doors. There
will be no more neadý of their making trucks
and tanks, munitions and shahls and so on.
To continue to do so, would ha wasteful.
Consequently these factorias and plants, which
are now working at top spead, will of nacessity
close down. So our firet problem when the
war ends will be to take care ini some way or
othar of the very many thousands throughout
Canjada who will be turned out of the industries in which they are working. That
situation is one upon which the Govarnment
should concentrate, in consultation with industry-it may alraady ba in consultation with
the provinces; I don't know-so that a departmaent, or saveral departmnents, will know
exactly what thay have to do whan tha tima
comas. I am only giving the haart of the
problam.
One feature of the Bill I do flot like. The
departmnent which is to be set up is more or
less a consultative departmnent. Well, I hope
aM laast that the departmient, wil begin ite
consultative work very soon, and make recomnmandations to the Government at tha
earliest possible moment, and that inu tur
-the Government will waste no time iu providing machinery to carry out those recomnmandations.
Thera is another point ta ha considared.
Tha work of the departmant will ba largaly
along naw lines, and the executives in charge
of it should know just what ought ta ha
dona, aud where, when and how it ought to
ha doue. Training of men for the key positions cannot be done in a day or a waak
or a month, aud the Govarnment should
undertake it without furthar dalay. I know
somaething about rehabilitation and reconstruction problams, for, as I remarked on a
previous occasion in this Housa, 1 worked on
such prohlems aftar the last war anded. In
that work I was associated with Mr. Vincent
Massey, the present High Commissionar at
London. Our efforts iu many respects wara
not entiraly successful, and the reason is not
bard ta find. iFor probably a century the
world had not axparienced anything like what
happaned in the Iast war, and thare was iioth-

257

ing ta guida us in aur post-war programma.
But inow wa know tha mistakes that ware
made after that war ended, and so far as
humanly possible we should avoid making
them again.
If the Bill in its present fori is passed 1
should like ta sea an able man appointad
at on-ce to head the departmcnt. Rie should
ha a man of sound judgmeut, who is riot
afraîd ta act, and as soan as hae makes his
racamniandations the Gavernment should
frame a programme in readiness for the postwar period.
The motion was agreed tu, and tha Bill
was read the second tuae.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. KING: Hanourable senators, our
Parliamentary Counsel, after consulting with
the Government, bas suggested two or three
amandments to this Bill. I would therefora
mave that the Bill ha raferred ta the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, for
consideration ta-morrow morniug.
The motion was agreed to.
NAVAL SERVICE B3ILL
SECOND

READING

Han J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 112, an Act raspectmng the Naval Service of Canada.
Ha said: Honourable sanators, as this legislation is of a highly tachuical character, ralating Vo niattars on which faw if any of us are
w.eIl inforxnad, I feel it would. ha wise ta
confina my remarks ta a summary of the statament made by the Minister of Naval Service
in anothar place. The purposa of tha Bill is
ta amend and consolidata the Naval Service
Act, which was first passed in 1910 and now
appears as Chapter 139 of the Reviscd Statutes
of Canada, 1927. Sinca the original Act was
passed thera have beau only threa aninor
ameudmneuts ta it, and changed conditions,
brought about mostly by the war, hava made
necessary the revision now proposed.
The Dapartmant of Naval Service has beau
operating undar the present Act and -tha
United Kingdom Naval Diseipline Act of
1866, as wall as under a number of Canadian
and British ragulations and orders. Considerabla difficulty has at times arisen because
of the cuxubersoma procedure of consulting a
large numbar of orders and regulations in
searcli of authority for decisions, and the difficulty bas been increased by the fact that on
certain points Canadian orders and ragulations
confliet with British orders and regulations.
The Naval Discipline Act of 1866, with minor
modifications ta suit Canadian requirements,
will ha incorporated in Part II of this Bill.

25S

SEN'1ATE

During the last four and a half years Canada
bias built up a considerable naval force.
Throughiout that period the Department of
Naval Service hias heen subjected to heavy
stress and strain, and it seems to me that in
such circumstances it should he higbly cernmended for going ahead with the framing of
this important measure. Passage of the proposed amendment will enable the naval authorities to consolidate the great, mass of legislation whieh is now applicable te our Naval
Service. ilonourable members will perbaps
bo surprised to know that provisions applicable to this service are to be found in no fewer
than eleven different sources. It is hoped
that when the new Act is passed the Department will be able to embody the whole of our
naval laiw and regulations in two volumes.
Certain amendments to the Bill have been
suggested by the Department and hy the
Parliamentary Counsel of the Senate. After
second reading is given I shail move that the
Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking- and Commerce, where honourable
members will have an opportunity to question
departmnental officers.
Hon. WILLIAM DUEF: Honourable senators, I hope that on this very warm day you
will allow me to devote a few moments to this
Bill, and aIse to speak to 'a matter wbich is
very closely connected with it.
I hold no brie! either to support or oppose
this Bill, nor bias any person asked me to speak
on this measure. However, as one who
tbrougbout bis life bias heen interested in
marine and naval matters, and who, especially
during the last few years, bias watched with
great interest wbat Canada and Great Britain
bave been doing ina regard to naval nifairs, I
feel it my duty to approve this measure. I
have bad an opportunity of looking over it.
As the honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. King) bas said, it is practically a
regulatory bill to hring the Naval Service of
Canada into dloser touch with the practice of
the British Admiralty. And I do not need to
tell you that so far as the British Navy is
concerned we are always proud to regard it as
the senior service of this great Empire and
'le leading Navy of the world. Under God's
wisdom the British Navy bas always been
the bulwark of freedom, and with aldue deferonce taoaur soldiers and airmen, the senior
service is playing a major part in hringing
victory to the Allied nations.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, bear.

lion. Mr. DUFF: Tbe honourable, leader
cf the House has said that the Bill will need
to be amended in a few particulars. I came
ta t.he saine conclusion after perusing its
Hon. Mr-. RCING.

clauses, yet I thought we might well pass the
measure in toto and give it third reading at
the next sitting of the House.
But, honourable senators, I rose not so much
to discuss this Bill as to direct attention to the
buman element which must be guided by rules
and regulations laid down hy this Parliament.
I remember in 1938, before the outbreak of
war, baving the honour, and perbaps the
pleasure of discussing what part Canada sbould
play if war should be declared. Honourable
senators know as well as I do that when Canada entcred the war by the side of Great
Britain and France we had virtually ne Navy.
But, te the credit of the Parliament and the
people of Canada, we voted immediately, not;
millions but hundreds of millions of dollars
te place our Navy on a war footing. At tbat
time, as honourable members will recaîl, the
British Government gave us a certain number
of ships, and these were manned by Canadian
officors, most of whom. had, somne years previously taken courses in the British Navy,
and by ýour boys fromn every province. Immediately steps were taken te put our shipyard>g
into operation, and soion they were busy building small naval vessels, such as corvettes and
minesweepers, and it is te the credit of the
workmen that the ships were launched in a
very short time. For the past two or three
years those ships have heen active on all the
seven soas, assisting ina the successful fight
againat U-boats and in convoy duty.
For a country like Canada, with a emaîl
merchant marine and few facilities for training seamen for the Navy, the building and
manning of these new naval craft was quite
an undertaking. But aIl difficulties were overcorne; the blood of the sea ran in 'the veins
cf our young men from the Atlantic te tbe
Pacifie, and the lads of British Columbia,
Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario.
Quebec and the Maritime Provinces responded
promptly when the caîl came te join our naval
forces. They proved apt sailors, and their
seamanship and fighting qualities seon placed
tbem ina tbe forefront of the Allied navies.
This aftcrnoon I rise te pay tribute te those
boys. When their names appear ina tbe casualty
lists we find that those boys were killed or
wounded in action in the North Atlantic
protecting our convoys from U-hoat attacks.
or in the Bay of Biscay fighting German naval
vessels, or in Norwegiau waters, assisted hy
those gallant Norwegians who came over here
te finish their training for naval service se
that tbey might fight the comnmon enemy. We
remember with pride that some of aur Canadian destroyers helped to sink the great
battleship Bismarck, thus seriously crippling

259

JUNE 29, 1944
Gerrny's naval strength. Many of our
gallant lads in the Royal Canadian Navy came
from the farms of Western Canada and had
neyer seen the ocean until they joined their
ships. To-day as we read in the newspaper
reports that aur siaips are in the Straits of
Doyer and in the North Sea, guarding the
transporta carrying Ailied troops acrose to
France, we lift our hearts in thankfulnesa to
Providence that at the outbreak of war the
people of Canada rose tc, the occasion and,
discharging their duty to the full, organized
a Navy which for its size ie second ta none.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Han. Mr. DUFF: 1 do not intend ta give
statistics showing the development of aur
naval strength; it je not necessary. But I
deern it rny duty to pay this tribute to our
gallant lads of the Royal Canadian Navy, and
to extend zny sympathy to their mothers and
fathers, wives and sweethearte, who, I arn sure,
must be thinking-"jWhere is my wandering
boy to-night?" 1 arn confident that ail honourable senators will join in the prayer of those
parents that God in Hie own good time may
bring back the boys who had the courage and
the guts to join the Royal Canadian Navy
and fight sa that frcedom shaîl not pcrish.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I repeat, honourable
senators, we must extend our synipathy ta
those whose boys are facing the perils of the
sea while on active duty in the Naval Service
of this country. The anxious feelings of their
parents are, 1 thinlc, beautifuily expressed in
this noble hymn:
Eternal Father, -strong to save,
Whose arm hath bound the restiess wave,
Who .bidd'st the mighty ocean deep
Its own appointed lirnits3 keep;
O hear us when we ory ta Thee
For those in peril on the sea.
O Christ, whose voice the waters heard,
And hushed their raging at Thy word,
Who walkedât on th foaming deep,
And calrn amidst its rage didst sleep;
0 hear us when we cry to Thee
For tihose in peril on the sea.
Most Holy Spirit, who di*dst 'brood
Upon the chaos dark and rude,
And bid its angry tumuit cease,
And give, -for wild confusion, peace;
O hear us when we cry ta Thee
For those in peril on ta-le sea.
O Trinity of lave and power,
Our brathen shield in danger's hour;
Frorn rock and tempest, fire and foc,

Protect thema wheresoe'er they go;

Thus evermore shall rise ta Thee
Glad hymne of praiee from land and sea.
Honourable senatore, I salute the baye of
the Canadian Navy.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The motion wae agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second time.

CANADIAN

HISTORY-UNIFORM
TEXT-BOOK

DEBÂTE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed frorn Friday, June 23,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Han.
Mr. David:
That this House, aicknowledlgiug the teacling
cf history as oiie of the fujidamntale of
patriotism in evcery counitry, and anxious to
develop a hetter and more understanding Canadian patriotism, expresses the wieyh that at the
Interprovincial Conference ta be held in Ottawa,
in the near future, the delegates representing
the nine provinces cf aur Confederation may be
pleased ta appoint a committee composed of
the most impartial and competent historians as
such recognized -in each province, with the
mission of preparing a textbook of Canadian
history that could bc accepted and adopted iby
all provincial governiments in alI schools under
their direct or indirect jurisdiction or control.
Hon. C. B. HOWARD: Honourable senators, my intention je ta support the resolution presented by the honaurablie rienator
froni Sorel (Hon. Mr. David). The founders
of this great country of ours aimed ta maintain two civilizations, each with its own identity, within the barders of one domain. That
was an experimental ideal, but it bas becai
realized. Do 1 need ta rehearse to you the
rnany and immense advantages of living in
this land of ours which has two languages, two
creeds and two hereditary traditions? You
know ail tac weil to what extent each of
these cultures has made its contribution -ta
the coanmon cause of building one of the

forerneet lieral demnocracies of the world,
where freedom of thought, speech and action
prevails in fullest degree. Let me say -right
here and now that freedom. is net synonymous
with licence, but ratIer with li.berty under
just and dernocratie laws.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Someone has well
said, "The price of liberty ie eternal vigilance!'
Let us then rededicate ourselves ta vigilance
and more vigilance, lest we hase the dearest
possession we have, the thing which aur sons
and daughters are now giving their very lives
ta preserve. Let us neyer lose sight of aur
common purpose ta direct our united efforts
toward maintaining these high ambitions of

260

SENATE

our ancestors. In my humble opinion that
unanimity of purpose can be best fostcred by
the freest possible functioning of eacb nationality in ifs own best way, and by each element
contributing what is essentially its very own
toward building a composite, colourful unique
whole, incorporating in its body politic so
many varied national facets.
In making available for our schools a uniforma history text-book, I feel we are taking
n decidcd stop in the right direction. Let
us make no mnistake: both civilizations bave
reason to be proud of their respective roles
in the development of Canada to its present
high, and stili bigber-soaring place in tbe
world commonwealth of nations. I suggest
that fhree French-speaking and flirce Englishspeaking historiens of the higlicat calibre lie
selected at once t0 collaborate in drafting a
real national Canndian history. 1 can sce no
reason whly the chronology of such a work
cannot be preserved and even enbanced by
the interpolation of any events of interest to
the particular province in which they occurred.
The basic bistory could bie supplemented by
additional subject-matter pertinent to the
province in wbich it is to be used. Such a
policy would furnish a complete and comnprehensive bistorical record of the roles
played by tlic various provinces in the entire
Canadien pageant.
Any person, no matter of wbat nationality,
admires tbe stories of French heroismn during
thec first settlements in this country, the heroic
figlits of the pioneers against the Indians, flie
stories of Madeline de Vercheres', Brebeuf's
and Dollard's heroism, and of those thousands
of unnamed French-Canadians who cleared
the ground, and raised the crops in that tben
unknown land, the Canada of to-day. Let us
flot forget that invading American army comning flirougli the wilds of tbe Kennebc river
country, erossing at Lake Megantie and
coming down fthc Chaudière, oxpecting to find
tlic Frencli-Canadians disloyal to the British
Crown and eager to belp them in their attempt
f0 take Canada, only to diseover to their surprise, when fbhey reeched tbe faets of
Beauce,'
that the French-Cenadian farmers of the whole
district were loyal f0 the British Crown. Their
descendants have remained so ever since. Lot
us not forget that the affack on Montreal
was thrown baek by French-Canadians loyal
to flic British Crown. Let us nlot forget the
contribution of Frencli-Canadiens in art, in
music, end in other cultural developments up
Lo the present day. Lot us also nlot forget
what fthe English-Canadien bas contributed te
develop tbis country of ours. Everyone reads
with pride the history of the construction of
the Canadianl Pacifie Railway. Everyone
Hon. Mr.

HOWARD.

knows that it almost bankruptcd the wbole
country. Yet because of one man's idealism,
and bis belief that Canada could not achieve
its appropriate national status without a railway connecting aIl tbe provinces of the
Dominion, we have that great transcontinental
system to-day. Lot us not forget what EnglishCanadians have done in the Canadian West,
the financial institutions they bave set up
througbout the country, the mining ventures
fbey bave entered into, and the advances they
have made in medical science and the establish-.
ment of universities and educational systems.
I cannot agree with the honourable senator
fromn the Laurentides (Hon. Mr. Bouchard)
that the existence of certain elemonts in our
midst sbould cause us undue alarm. There are,
and undoubfedly always will be, apparently
subversive organrizations ini a free and liberal
democracy; but contrary f0 his fears, they may
well signify a liealthy normalcy of governmenf.
To my mmnd these secret elements in our
society are comparable to, the fearful child wbo
ettempfis f0 hide some new experience frm
bis parents. At that particular stage of bis
immaturity ho does not or cannot comprehend
flic scope or intent of fthc parental plan for bis
present or future welfare and development.
Sucli a state of mind on the part of any
sîzable group calîs for, indeed challenges, flie
undersfanding of our present leadership ta
educate and direct it towards the broad coinprehensive idea of "aIl for one"~ and flic
sacrifice of "flic lesser for the greater."
Up fa flie present time history bas proven
ho0w futile is any attempt to confrol human
emotions. Rather than try to suppress what
appears ta ho undiesirable group agitations,
experienced leaders bave found it wise ta let
these feelings have some sort of outiet. Such a
group as the Jacques Cartier Order no more
represents fthe publie opinion of the province
of Quebc then other secret organizations in
Ontario, tlic Maritimes, or Western Canada,
ropresont flic opinion of the people of thoso
provinces. Sucli under-cover groups flouriali af
present, not only in Canada but in ah flic
countries of the world. Tbey denote a forwardlooking, visionary trend axnong the masses, as
yot unfempored by experienced judgment and
mature intelligence. The truc sentiment of
the mai ority in Quebec, as elsewhere, is
expressed by its leaders.
Wlien we speak of leaders. it is known to
everybody in this Chember, and f0 most
people throughout this country, that ahl parts
of Canada have heen favoured by flicir ebility
to provide great leaders. Amo-ng the leaders oif
Frencli-Canadian extraction in fthc federal field
bave been the famous Cartier and Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, bath fron flic province of Quebec.

JUNE 29, 1944
Among the leaders ini the provincial field in
that province, who stand out with the leaders
of aüy cou.ntry, I would mention the Merciers,
the Parents, the Gouins--one of whom we have
in this House-and Alexandre Taschiereau,
whomn everybody in this House knows as
one of the greatest statesmen Canada lias
produced.
Then, coming to the leaders of the present
time, I want to say a word about the Prime
Minister or Leader in the province of Quebec,
Mr. Godbout. Here is a man who springs
from. the common people of one of the lower
counties in Quebec. H1e' is from the people,
of the people and for the people. Only one
Who has lived among them, who, knows their
traditions, their background and their interests,
and who can understand and interpret their
thouglits and feelings, can imbue them with
enthusiasm for the larger prospect-the advantage of a co-ordinated Canada. Premier
Godbout can accomplish the seemingly 11crculean task of orientation of this large and
important group in Canada's bilingual set-up.
H1e it is wbo can enlarge their vision to
inclucle the other viewpoints so, necessry to
that desired co-ordination.
(Translation):
Mr. Godhout is not only the first citizen of
his province; hie symbolizes as it were the
Quebec citizen. Not only does lie represent
bis people, but lie personîfies them. Through
hutn I extend tu the province of Quebc the
tribute of a citizen who does not belong to
the mai ority in that province, but whose riglits
are just as surely protected and guaranteed
as if lic were himself one of the majority.
The Prime Minister of the province of
Quebec symbolizes those who have chosen him
as the leader of their provincial government.
Tbrough bis tastes, his gif ts, and even his bents,
if flot througb bis failings, he is the very
image of bis people. First among bis failings
is his diffidence, which sometimes compels bis
best friends to go against his wislies in order
te do him justice.
To the inborn qualities wbich Mr. Godbout
has inherited from bis race, must be addcd
those lie bas acquired tbrough extensive
studies. H1e bas dedicated himself wholly to
agriculture, and during bis entire life that
basic industry whicb is the very essence of
Canadian life, the tilling of the bountiful and
life-giving Canadian soul, bas held the flrst
place in bis thouglits.
After receiving a classical education at the
Rimouski seminary, wliere lie graduated as a
Bachelor of Arts, lie obtained the degree of
Baclielor of Science in agriculture after a course
of studies at the Agricultural College of

261

Sainte-Mnne de la Pocatière and st the Massachusetts Agricultural College. H1e tauglit for
many years at his alma mater and ini 1922 lie
was appointed agricultural expert for the
county of L'Islet.
Elected te the Quebcc legislative assembly
in 1929, lie was, on account of bis personal
qualities and his extensive studies, the logical
choice for the position of Minister of Agriculture. He cntercd the cabinet in 1930. His
work as Minister of Agriculture earned him
tbc attention of the whole provinoe. Six years
only after bis entrance into polities, lie becaxue
leader of bis party and afterwards Prime
Minister of bais province.
It was especially as Prime Minister that lie
made lis influence felt. In order to convey
some ides of bis work 1 shahl give an incomplete and skctchy list of the measures wbicli
tbrough *im were implemented in the province
of. Quebec: family allowances, old age pensions, pensions to the blind, improvemnent in
the working conditions of the labouring class,
coinpulsory education in the sebools of the
province, free school-books, provincial assistance to farmers, fishermen and settlers; and
protection of public health tlirougli hcalth units
that are a model for public health services in
America.
Tbat work, the effect of which lias been
felt in the remotest corners of the province,
and wbich makes tbe Quebec administration a
model tbat many otlier goveruments endeavour te imitate, lias net passed unnoticed.
To pay tribute to Prime Minister Godbout is
te honour the wbole province of Quebcc, the
Frencli-Canadian as reprcsented and exemplified by Mr. Godbout, tbe typical Quebec
Frencli-Canadian tliat Mr. Godbout is.
Hon. ANTOINE LEGER: You have paid
tribute te him as if lie werc deadl
Hon. CHARLES B. HOWARD: H1e is by
ne means dead yet.
(Text) :
Now, benourable senators, the reason wliy I
have taken tbis opportunity of speaking is tbat,
in a small way, I want te counterset some of
tbe sentiment tbat lias been raised tlirough..
eut tbe English-speaking provinces of Canada,
and te appeal te tlie citizens of tbose provinces and challenge tliem te emulate, if thcy
can, wbat bas been donc by the people of
Quebec. It is an historical fact that Joly De
Lotbiniere, a Huguenot, was elected in the
county of Lotbinierc for bath the federal and
the provincial lieuses, and for a short time, in
1878 and 1879, wvas Prime Minister of the
province of Quebec. In the Eastern Townships, in the county of Shefford, the first
man elected ivas the uncle of the Honourable

262

SENATE

Jacob Nicol. In 1882 Michel Auger was
elected, and, although over eighty per cent
of the electors of Shefford were FrenchiCanadian, he was su.cceeded by a Baptist
Minister, Mr. Bullock, who -aas returned at
five general electàions to represent that eounty.
His son, Carl Bullock, an English-speaking
Protestant, is the member to-day, although the
population is n-ow some ninety per cent French.
When it cornes to municipal polities, riglit
in Sherbrooke, my home town, English and
French mayors are elected turn about every
two years. There is a French-Canadian mayor
for two years, and then an English-speaking
mayor. I could, tell you of one election in
which a French-Canadian, who had been
mayor for two years, decided to run again.
Remember, this was in a locality which is
to-day eighty-three per cent French-Canadian.
That man did not receive a mai ority in one
single, solitary poli in the city of Sherbrooke.
An English-speaking Canadian was elected
because it was his turo. In Ditton some years
ago an English resident, by the namne of
Caswell, was elected mayor for a number of
terms; and in the township of Weedon, a
ninety-nine per cent French constituency, an
English Protestant, named Skinner, who as
far as 1 know wvas the only English resident,
was clected mayor. The Honnurahlç' Jacob
Nicol, who is known to most people in Quebec
and to many throughout other parts of Canada, was choson as provincial treasurer. He
was elected in the county of Richmond, a
French-Canadian constituency. At a later
election he wvas returned in Compton, which
has a large majority of French-Canadîans. I
was elected to the Huse of Commons at four
consecutive general elections, in a constituency
where eighty-two p~er cent of the people were
Frencli-Canadians.
I mention these facts because I arn one of
those Canadians who want the people in ail
parts of this country to be Canadians, and 1
deprecate any remarks against Quebec, Ontario, or any other part of this Dominion.
'lo my English-speaking fellow citizens in
Quebec and other parts of Canada, I want to
say that they do not need to worry about
Quebec. The ambition of our people, whether
English-speaking or French-speaking, is to
contribute Our share towardýs making Canada
one of the great world powers of the future!1

respecting the Naval Service of Canada.

JUNE 30, 1944
Hon. WM. DUFF: Honourabile senators, I
have no objectionk te tihe aanendments proposed by the Banking and Commerce Committee, but it seeme ta me that one of the
paragraphs in section 2, the interpretatian
section, sbould nlot stand as it 110W is. I refer
ta paragraph (f), which reads:
"man" meane a persan in the Naval Forces
hiolding the rating of <ibief petty offleer or below.
That replaces paragraph (n) of the aid law,
which reads in thia way:
"'seamnan» includes petty afficers, seamen and
ail other persoa engaged in the Naval Service
of Canada, other than officers.
1 ar n ft sure whether I should move that
this Bill be referred' ta Committee of the
Whole sa that I and others interested may
have an opportunity af stating our views
in regard to amending this interpretation
clause.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion
before the Chair is that the Bull, as amended,
be 110w read the third time. The honourabie
gentleman may move that the Bill be not
now read the third time, but be referred ta
Committee of the Whole-or ta the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce-with
instructions ta amend it as follows:--setting
forth his amendment.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Then I move that,
instead of the Bill being now read the third
time, it be referred ta Çommittee af the
Whole for reconsideration.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I arn of opinion
that the report of the committee has nlot yet
been adopted.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Yes, it bas been
concurred in.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable members, the bonourable senator from Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duif), was on bis feet and speaking when the motion for concurrence in the
I
committee's report was being adopted.
think ini fairness to bim we should treat the
report as nlot yet adopted.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I did neot sec
the honourable senator at the time. If I amn
ta understand that be is speaking to the
motion for concurrence in the report of the
committee, then this motion would be in
order:- It is moved by the Honourable
Senator Sinclair, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Wilson, that the Senate revert ta
consideration of the report ta the committee.
Is it the pleasure of honourable senators to
adopt the motion?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Agreed.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Carried.

Tbe Senate bas naw reverted ta cansideratien of the report of the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce an Bill 112.
Hon. Mr. KING: Tbat permits my honourabie friend ta suggest an amendment or
ta move the House into Committee of the
Wbole.
Tbe Hon. the SPEAKER: Tbe honourable
senator bas not proposed any specific amendment. He bas moved that the Bill be referred
ta Committee of the Wbole for tbe purpose
of reviewing it and giving bonourable mcmbers the opportunity of suggcsting amcndments. This is in order.
Hon. Mr. RING: Question!
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I dlaim I arn entitled
ta represent the people of Canada wbo are
interested in this Bill, and that instead af
the report of the committee beîng concurred
in and the Bill then being read the third
time, we sbould go into Committee of the
Whole on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
doing.

That is wbat we are

Hon. Mr. DI.FF: But the motion before
the House is for third reading of the Bull.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; we reverted ta consideration of the report of the committec.
The Hlon. the SPEAKER: Tbe motion
before the House is a motion by the bonourable senator, that the report of the commnittee
be nlot concurred in, but that the Bill be
rcfcrred to Committee of the W-hole for
reconsideration.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Are you ready
for the question, bonourable senators? la it
your pleasure ta adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. RING: I do not abject ta it.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: No.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The Hon. tbe SPEAKER: In my opinion
the "No's" bave it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Surely, bonourable senators, in 'a free Parliament no one is going ta
say "No," and refuse me an opportunity ta
present my views with regard te certain
matters in this Bill. Surely that is not goîng
ta happen in tbe senior branch of Parliament.
I say that I bave a right ta speak on
the report of the Cornrittee, or, if you do not
agree ta tbat, ta ask that this House go into
Committee af -the Whole, so that I may express my views. I shahl not take very long.

264

SENATE

Surely, as the representative of some people
whom I believe I know as well as any honourable member in this Chamber, I have some
rights.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentleman
can speak now as long as he likes.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am net sure that will
satisfy the honourable senator. He suggests
that he has an amendment.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He can move it on third
reading.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, and I think that
would be proper procedure. However, if the
honourable gentleman wishes the House to go
into Committee of the Whole, so that he
may then move an amendment to the section
he speaks of, I have no objection. I do think,
however, we should remember that we are to
adjourn to-day for two weeks. This Bill is
very important to the Naval Service of Canada. A great deal of labour has been expended at a very difficult time to prepare an
Act which will be convenient and valuable to
the service. I should like to sec the Bill
moved into Committee so that the honourable
gentleman, who is not going to speak at great
length, I understand, can make his suggestion
and move his amendment, which will be dealt
with as the Senate sees fit. The Bill would
then go on to third reading.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
agreed to?

Is the motion

Some Hon. SENATORS: Agrced.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It has been moved
by Honourable Senator Duff, seconded by Honcurable Senator-Who seconds flic motion?
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I do.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: I will second it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: -seconded
by
Honoiu-alble Senator Sinclair, that the report
of the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce on Bill 112, be not now concurred
in, but that said Bill be referred te Committee
of the Whole for re-uxamination.
Is it your pleastire Io adopt the motion?
The motion was agreed to.

on the

On secton 2,-Definitions:
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Mr. Chairman, I am
-dire WC all appreciate the fact that his honour
:he Speaker lias seen fit to select an old
parliaimentarian like yourself te take the
Chair on this occasion.
Hon. Mr. DUFF.

In view of what the leader of the Government has said about trying to get certain
measures
through
this Chamber
before
5.50 p.m., I may say it is not my intention
to speak at length. In fact, what I have to
say should take only a few minutes, and my
argument is going to be so reasonable and,
if I say it myself, so correct, that this
Chamber should adopt the suggestion I am
going to make.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Now, Mr. Chairman,
paragraph (f) of clause 2 reads:
"man" means a person in the Naval Forces
holding the rating of chief petty officer or below.
The paragraph in the old act read as follows:
"seaman" includes petty officers. seamen and
all other persons engaged in the Naval Service
of Canada, other than officers.
That is clear cut.
Now, there are two definitions, and the
question is whether a naval rating, or what
in naval parlance is known as a "gob," should
be designated a "seaman" or a "man".
Of course, Mr. Chairman, all ratings and
all others in naval service on the seas are
men. They are all of the masculine gender.
But w-bat I want to point out is this. When
war was declared, boys from every province in
the Dominion-from the farms of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba, from the cities
of Toronto and Montreal, and from the fisheries of the Maritime Provinces and British
Columbia-applied to join the Naval Service.
I do not have to tell you what these boys have
donc. They were wonderful! They are wonderful. They were splendid! They are splendid.
But what I want to say is, that when these
boys come back from their work of convoying
food supplies and munitions fromi Canada to
England, the Mediterranean ports and Russia.
perhaps after having been torpedoed and
having spent days in rubber boats, they will
come back to tleir mothers and fathers with
their chests stuck out, and will want to be
known net as men but as seamen. Yet in
this Bill you are designating them merely as
men. Thcy are supermen.
I ask very little. In the Committee on
Banking and Commerce this morning someone
referred to the boys in the armed forces: I
ask, Mr. Chairman, bow you would describe
a boy fron Prince Edward Island who had
enlisted in the Air Force? Would you call him
a man? No, you would call him an airman.
An I right or wrong? If he had enlisted in the
Arny, yoi would call him a soldier. Therefore I say that these boys, who have given
their lives and their blood fighting the battles
of Canada, the Britisb Empire and the United

JIJNE 30, 1944
Nations on the seven seas of the world, should
nlot be designated merely as men. It will nlot
hurt anybody to give them a littie kudos «by
calling thern what they are.
1 arn not ahiecting to any clause i the
Bill which affects the policy of the Goverument or the Department. Ail I say is that
these boys, who. enlisted and served i the
four corners of the earth, should receive some
recognition for what they have done. Why
should we not cali themu seamen-either
ordinary seamen or A.B's, which means able
bodied seamen? I may say with ail modesty
that I have been associated with seamen of
the Navy and the Merchant Marine ail my
life. I arn not raising this question just to
be controversial or ta make trouble for anybody.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Would the honourable senator tell us, then, what is the meaning of the explanatian of the terni he refers
te, which appears on the opposite page of the
Bill? It says:
The terni "t3eaman" is noa longer used ta
designate aIl Naval personnel other than officers.
It is now more commonly used to designate a
branch of the service, L.e., the "Seaman Branch,"
as distinguished, for example, from the "Engineroom braneh." The word "man" is the term in
use ta-day ýto designate personnel who are nlot
officers.
Hon. Mr. KING: Mr. Chairman, is there
an amendment 'before the Chair?
The CHAIRMAN: Not yet. We are ini
Coffmittee of the Whole on clause 2.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I would point out ta the
honourable member from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) that the explanatory note he bas
read contradicts itself. I say this with al
courtesy ta my honourahIe friend, as hie perhaps does nlot know as mucli about sait water
as I do.
Han. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not know
anything about it.
Hlon. Mr. DUTFF: I do not want ta he
offensive. AIl I arn saying is that the expianatory note cantradicts itseîf, hecause it
speaks of the "Seaman Branch." Why should
that terni be used, if not ta distinguish it from
the "Engine-room Brandi?"
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will tlie hanourable
gentleman allow me ta interrupt him? It wauld
be a great help ta us if hie would move an
amendment, for we shauld then know what
change lie is suggesting. I understaod the
representative of the Department of Naval
Service ta say at the committee meeting this
mornilg that in the British Acts tlie word
££man" is used.

265

Hon. Mr. COPP: In the Acte governing the
Rayai Navy.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. And lie said it was
desirable ta have the saine nomenclature used
in aur Act. Until my honourable friend states
his amendment, I do nlot know what bis
remarks are addressed ta.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I arn nat aware that it is
necessary for me ta move an amendment
before I complete my resnarks. I say ta my
honourable friend, with aIl caurtesy, that at
this morning's committee meeting lie did flot
seem ta appreciate that a boy who enlists in
the Air Farce-at Winnipeg, or anywhere else
in Canada-is called an airman.
Han. Mr. HAIG: No; lie is called a man.
Hon. Mr. DIJFF: 0f course, lie is a man,
and a goad man.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the finest compliment lie can be paid.
Hon. Mr. DUEFF: Why should these boys
on aur naval vessels flot *be designated as
"seamen"? The distinguished soldier (Hon.
Mr. Grieshacli) sitting behind my honourable
friend will tell him that members of the
militia are called soldiers.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not in the Act.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: "Militiaman" may be the
designation in the Act, but in any event tliat
is hetter than the plain word "man." What
harm could he done by changing the Act so
that the boys in aur naval service-boys from
the farms of Manitoba, Saskatchiewan and
other parts of the country, as well as from the
fishing fleets of British Columbia and the
Maritime pravinces--would be callcd "seamen"?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is the honourable senator speaking ta an amendment?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I arn speaking ta clause 2
of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is my honourable friend
suggesting that we reject the committee's
report?
Hon. Mr. DTJFF: No.
Han. Mr. FARRIS: Wliat is the honourable
gentleman asking us ta do?
Hon. Mr. DUFE: We are nat considering
the report now; we are mn comrnittee on the
Bill. Ail I arn saying is that the boys fram
ail aver Canada who have enlisted in aur
Navy sbould he called "seamen" instead of
«men."
Hon. Mr. EULER: To hring about that
change, you should present an arnendrnent.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Then, I will move that
paragraph (f) of clause 2 of the Bill be
amended, ta read:
"seamnan" means a person in the Naval Forces
holding the rating of chief petty officer or beiow.
That could flot do any harm. These boys,
who are risking their lives on the Atlantic and
the Pacific and in other parts of the world,
are heroes. Why sbould they flot be recognized as such? It seems to me that it is only
proper ta cail themn "seamen." just as the boys
wbo enlist in the Air Force are called
"ýairmen."
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: May I a.sk the honourable senator a question? Does my honourable
friend intend that no person holding a rating
higher than that of chief petty officer shall
be called a seaman? That is what bis amendment means. H1e bas movcd that paragraph
(f) be cbanged to read:
"seamani" meoans a person iii the Naval Forces
holding the rating of ehief petty officer or below.
If that amendmcnt carnies, anyone holding
a rank bigber than cbief petty officer would
cease ta be known as a seaman.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: Tbat is the trouble,
honourable senators, witb these lawyersHon. Mr. FARRIS: We try ta put some
sense into the statutes.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is the trouble witb
these lawyers, these land-lubbers, who would
get seasick if tbey went on the Rideau canal.
0f course, the captain and tbe engineer on a
ship are seamen, and I am willing that tbey
should be s0 described.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That would be contrary
ta your amendment.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: I am principally interested
;n the men who are sacrificing their lives for
you and me. Surely we can at least pay them
the compliment of calling tbem "seamen," sa
that when they bave completed tbeir service
on the "Iroquois" or the "Huron" or any
other vessel and, return ta, their homes ini
Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and elsewbere, they
will be welcomed, flot merely as men but as
seamen.
Hon Mr. COPP: ilonourable senators, it
seems ta me that the preference of my hanourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif)
for the word "seamen" instead of "man" is
based purely on sentiment. For myscîf, I
cannot see wbat diff erence it will make whether
men serving in our Navy are known siniply as
.,men" or as ' seamen." Commander Read,
wbom I know to be an outstanding lawyer and
draftsman, was questioncd on this matter at
our committea meeting this morniag, and hie
lion. Mr. EULER.

explained that it was desirable ta use the
word "man," in clause 2 and other clauses of
this Bill, in order ta coincide with the language
used in the statutes governing the Royal Navy.
But for the explanation made by Commander
Read I should bave no objection to the amendment propased by my bonourable friend from
Lunenburg, although if bis amendment carrnes
it will be neeessary ta go tbrougb the whole
Act and substitute "seaman" wberever "man"
occurs.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That would flot be much
trouble.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I do not think my honourable friend sbould press sentiment quite so
far. Nevertheless, it is bis privilege ta do so.
I suggest that it would be better for us to
accept the Bill as it cames fromn the Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
Tbe ameadment of Hon. Mr. Duif was
negatîved. The section was agreed ta.
Hon. Mn. HAIG:- Report the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No. Go through the whole
Bill, clause by clause.
Sections 3 ta 124, inclusive, were agreed to.
The preanible and, the title were agreed ta.
The Bill was reported, withaut amendment.

Naval Services of Canada, be now considered

The motion was agreed ta.

SUSPENSION 0F RULE
WITHDRAWAL 0F MOTION

Hon. J. Hl. KING: Honourable senators,
yesterday I gave notice of motion ta set aside
ruie 24 (b) in regard ta Bill 135. As I inti-

JUNE 30, 1944
mated at the time, my purpoee was not ta
force the measure through its concluding
stages. Ilt is the practice of the Senate when a
Bià is referred ta a committee ta, accept the
committee's report and, unless there is geod
reason to the contrary, to proceed with the
third, reading. Yesterday, my henourable friend
from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) objeeted,
and quite rightly, to the adoption of the report,
and I gave notice cf the motion to which 1
have referred.
I hesitated to take such a course, but, after
ail, to a certain extent, I arn responsible for the
conduet and business of the House, and I felt
that as we were about te adjourn for two
weeks it would be unwise to leave this Bill on
the sheif, since it provides for regulations
enabling Canadian War Service electors te
exercise their franchise and Canadien prisoners
of war to vote by proxy at any war-time
election.
I hope honourable members, though flot
entirely in sympathy with the report cf the
Banking and Commerce Committee, will agree
te its adoption, se that we may give the Bull
third reading to-day. I cannot ask for an
undertaking te this effeet, but in expectation
of our being able to accomplish this, I do net
intend te proceed with the 'motion.

267

Bill 135, an Act te provide regulations
enahhing Canadian war service electors ta
exercise their franchise, and Canadian prisoners
cf war ta vote by proxy, at -any general
election held during the present war, also ta
provide amendments te the Dominion Electiens Act, 1938, consequentiai te such regulatiens, or made necessary by the advent cf
the said war.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
hefore this report is adopted I should like te
ask the honourable leader cf the Government
(Hon. Mr. King) whether he wouid prefer
discussion on this motion or on the motion
for third reading cf the Bill? We desire ta
facilitate the proceedings as far as possible, in
view cf Royal Assent having been set for
5.50 this afternoon.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is the procedure we
usualy follow on the motion for third reading.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure
ta adopt the motion, honourabie senators?
Hon. Mr. DUEF: Before the motion is
agreed ta, it seems te me, we ought te know
specifically what amendments were made ta
this Bill in the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The report cf the
committee was before us yesterday. I judge
that I amn responsibie for holding up its
adoption until to-day.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I should like te have
time te study the amendments. Clause 5 is
very important.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The honourahie
member has had since yestcrday te study the
amendments.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: I have flot had the report
before me since yesterday.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The report bas been
before us since -the Chairman of the Committee (Hon. Mr. Black), presented it ta
the Senate yesterday. On the motion for
for third reading, those who so desire will have
an opportunity for further discussion. I shail
hope te say a few words at that time. The
question now is on the motion for the adoption
of the Committee's report, whîch possihly
the honourable gentleman and I disagree with,
but which muet be considered.
Some Hon. SENATORS:- Question!1
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senatoes, I
certainly disagree with the report of the
cemmittee. I do net think the amendinent
gees far eneugh, and my own idea is that
clause 5 shouid be struck eut altogether. I de
net know who is responsibie for the clamp,~

268

SENATE

but in the interests of flic people of this
country from the Atlantic to the Pacifie I say
that no clause of this kind shouid be embodica
in the legisiation of a democratie country acu
as Canada. I amn opposud to the report, and
if I cannot speak on it now, then on the
motion for third reading I shahl again objeet.
Hon. Mr. RING: Honourable sonators, I
do not want to bc misunderstood. I merely
said that it le custonîary to proeeed witb the
motion for adoption of the report. I have
made no objection nor tried to bamper any
member from speaking on the Bill at this
stage. If miy lionourable friend desires te

Hon. J. J. BENCU: Honourabie senators,
I recognize, aiong with other honourable members, tbat these are difficuit and dangerou5
fimes wlin the safety of tbe State and of ocr
Canadian people may require that riglits ordinarily enjoyed by one or more sections of the
eommunity shouid be temnporariiy suspended.
I unqoalifiediy endorse the view that, for the
purposes of tbe prosecution of this war ho a
speedy and successful conclusion and of the
adequafe dcfence of Canada, ne action shouid
bc withheld, even if it recuits in the restrictioni or total abnegation of the peacetime
priviieges or imnionities of any group of or

as is Japan? Have we nlot been advised that
Germany is our principal enemy?-that the
iink which hoýlds together the .whole chain of
terror let loase on the world is Germany?that upon the prime defeat of Germany
depends the early despatch of our other
opponents? Why then do we see fit to qualify
for the ballot those of German, Italian,
Roumanian and other enerny origin, and with
the same stroke of the pen say to persona of
the Japanese race who have been born ini
Canada that they are not ta, vote? 1 submit
that unless some reasonable ground can be put
forward for sucli differentiation this Chamnber
cannot logically canry this Bill with its present
section 5.
I dcsire to, make clcar my agreement with
the report of the Committee on Banking and
Commerce to, the extent that its recommended
amendment of the section bas the effeet of
removing the possible restriction upon the
rights of persans whose racial origin is that of
the people of Germany or Austria, or one of the
many other countries with which wc are at war.
1 arn happy that the Senate lias recognized the
great injustice which otherwise miglht have
been inflicted on a very large section of the
Canadian population, some of whom are of
the third or fourth generation of residents of
this country. My only complaint is that,
having gone this far, the Committce dîd nlot
see fit to suggest to this House that the
entire section should be deletcd from tlie Bill.
I was in attendance at the sessions of the
Banking and Commerce Committee when the
legislation was being considered by that group.
1 listened carefully to, aIl of the arguments
put forward in support of the distinction proposed ta be made between native-bora Canadians of Japanese arigin. and Canadians of
other racial origin with whose, countries
we are now in confliot. With every degree of
respect for the opinions of other honourable
senators, I acknowledge a complete lack 6f
conviction that the arguments put forward are
either sound or compatible with the action
taken by the Committee, and which now bas
been approved in a limited way by this
Chamber. To the extent that be is an enemy
I certainiy hold no brief for the Jap: His
method of conducting warfare, bis reported
inhumanities perpetrated upon fellow-creaturcs
in China and elsewhere, and bis complete disregard of international conventions of war, al
make it ahundantlyý clear that be is wortby of
the utmost contempt and entitled to no special
consideration whatsoever. Nevertheless, we
are not purporting ta inflict a penalty upon
an enemy in the true sense of that word. We
are proposing ta discriminate against people
who have been bon in this country or who

have been granted the right of citizenship by
tbc sovercign autbority of Canada. Again I
repeat-when I realize that this is the situation, I find it extremely difficult ta draw the
line between the Canadian of Japanese arigin
and the Canadian of other enemy racial
beginnings.
It lias been urged in this Chamber as well
as before the Comm-ittee that already aimce
this war began Canada bas treated the
Japanese differently from persona of 'other
enemy country origins; and .by some stretch of
logic which I cannot understand, it is said
that we are only following precedent in
enacting section 5. It is pointed out, for
instance, that the Japanese bave been removed
front their usual places of residence on the
Pacifie Coast, and bave been distributed in
segregated communities across Canada. This
is the exceptional treatment whicb, it is said,
bas been accorded to, Canadians of Japanese
origin and has not been meted out to other
members of the community who are comparable
in the sense that their countries of origin alsa
are at war with us. It seems needless ta, point
dut that removal of the Japanese fram Britishi
Columbia was a measure adopted in the
interests of the defence of Canada; that it was
entirely precautionary, and was in no sense
connected with a design ta deprive persoa
born in Canada of their ordinary right of
the ballot. Nor does it seem necessary ta
remind honourable senators that many persoa
of German, Austrian, Itallan and other enemy
racial origin have been canfined i internment
camps across the breadth of Canada. It seemns
ta, me that the different treatment of the
Japanese in this regard-if there is a real
difference-has been one only of degree. The
principle underiying the segregation of al such
elements of aur Canadian community bas been
a common one-that of the safety of the
State. No one bas yet been able ta ýconvince
me that the denial of the franchise ta
Canadians of Japanese origin, wbile we grant it
ta athers whose origin is ini other countries
with whicb we are at war, will in any way
make the national safety mare secure. I cannot overlook the fact that as recentiy as last
August we had a provincial election in the
province of Ontario, and that no sucl restriction applied ta Canadians of Japanese origin;
and I have yet ta hear of any untoward
inc ident occurring as the result of the lack of
legislation of this character.
Again, it is argued that the Ca.nadian of
Japanese origin is different from the German,
the Austrian, the Roumanian and the Bulgarian, i that lie dace not subscribe ta or
enjoy the benefita of aur Christian philosophy,
and it is urged that this is a sufficient reason

270

SENATE

for making a distinction. Apart from the
circumstance that many Canadians of other
racial origin are doubtless non-Christian in the
fuilest sense of the term, this argument impresses me as putting the granting or withholding of the franchise entirely upon religious
grounds, and I venture to suggest that this
Parliament should be slow in acting upon such
a principle. If, however, the point is well
taken that there should be some distinction
drawn between Christians and non-Christians
for this purpose, then I have difficulty in
ignoring the circumstances that representatives
of the Christian churches in Canada have
been among the foremost in protesting against
the enactment of section 5. I am informed
that all across this country the Christian
churches have raised their voices in opposition
to this proposed discrimination against Canadian citizens of Japanese origin. Only last
Wednesday, when discussing this Bill, the
honourable leader on this side of the House
made reference to a telegram which he had
received from a certain committee representative of several churches. As I also received
this message I do not doubt that it was sent
to all honourable members of this House; and
for purposes of my submission I desire to refer
to it at length at this time. It reads as
follows:
The undersigned members of the National
Interchurch Advisory Committee on Resettlement of Japanese Canadians protest vehemently
against section 5, Bill 135, on the ground of disfranchisement of Canadian citizens of Japanese
race now in process of satisfactory resettlement
out-ide of British Columbia. The resentiment
aroused among these thousands of Canadian
citizens of Japanese race who know no other
'home, and who had hoped to live and die in
this country. and who by this Bill wil be left
without nationality, will be shared by thousands
of fair-minded Canadian citizens. We believe
this undeserved disfranchisement of Canadian
citizens will reflect on t-he honour of Canada
long after the war has been won.
That is signed by representatives of the
following churches, in order named: the
Catholic Church, the United Church of
Canada, the Baptist Convention of Ontario
and Quebec, the Church of England Social
Service, and the Presbyterian Church in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You had better read the
names of those who signed.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should be glad to
do seo.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Put them on the
record.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: They are as follows:
Father A. E. MeQuillen, Roman Catholie
Archdiocese, Toronto; Rev. Dr. George
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

Dorey, United Church of Canada; Rev. C. H.
Schutt, Baptist Convention Ontario and
Quebec; Canon W. W. Judd, Church of
England Social Service; Rev. E. H. Johnson,
Presbyterian Church in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask the honourable senator if he does not think it is fair to
assume that these men are only expressing
their own views? Have the churches been
called together to discuss the matter, and are
these people fully authorized to speak for
them?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It is my understanding
that these gentlemen were elected to the
Committee of Management of the organizatien at a regularly called convention.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: If they were, I suggest
te the honourable gentleman from Kingston
(Hon. Mr. Davies) that we must take them
as speaking in an official capacity.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES:
with that.

I would net agree

Hon. Mr. BENCH: What the honourable
senator now says may be correct, but I should
like to say that as recently as the past week
I saw a news report of a meeting of one
branch at least of the Assembly of the Presbyterian Churcli, at which, according to the
Press report, a resolution similar i'n character
to this wire was passed.
With such representations before us from
the people best qualified to judge of any
anti-Christian mentality on the part of those
of Japanese race, how can we proceed on the
principle that these citizens should be deprived
of the right of the franchise because, fundamentally, they do not believe in our God?
It seems unnecessary to add that many of
the persons who would be disqualified by this
Bill probably adhere to one or other of the
Christian faiths.
I understand, honourable senators, that it is
the wish of the honourable the leader of the
Senate that I should now adjourn this debate.
to afford opportunity for the Royal Assent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Until 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Go ahead. Don't interrupt
your speech.
Hon. Mr. KING: I would move that the
Senate adjourn during pleasure, so that we
may have the Royal Assent.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the honourable gentleman move the adjournment of the
debate?

J-UNE 30, 1944
Hon Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do
nlot think the honourable member can move
to adjourn the dehate, for if the motion should
carry, the debate would be ended for to-day.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Io it intended
that we should sit to-night?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I understand sa.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He cani move that the
continuation of the debate be postponed until
the House adjourns during pleasure.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The procedure
would. be for the leader to move that the
Senate adjourn during pleasure. The debate
would then continue when we resume.
Haon. Mr. KING: That is the intention.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, it is rnoved by Hon. Senator King,
seeonded by Hon. Senator Euler, that the
Senate do now adjourn during pleasure.
The motion was agreed to, and the Senate
adjourned during pleasure.
THE ROYAL ASSENT
The Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, Chief
Justice of Canada, the Deputy of the Governor
General, having corne and being seated at the
foot of the Throne, and the House of
Commons having been summnoned, and being
corne with their Speaker, the Honourable the
Deputy of the Governor General was pleased
ta give the Royal Assent to the following
Bis:
An Act teaemeiid the Bank Act.
An Act ta amend the Quebec Savings Banke
AÂct.
An Act ta establiali a Departmnent of Veterans
Affairs.
An Act respecting Surplus Crown Assets.
An Act ta establish a Department of Reconstruction.
The House of Commons withdrew.
The Honourable the Deputy of the Governor
General was pleased ta retire.
The sitting was resurned.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: When the Senate took
reces I was attempting ta ment nome of the
arguments put forward in support of section 5
as now amended. 1 had just mentioned that
amangst other resoens submitted as justifying
the distinction drawn between persoa o~f Japa.nese origin and those of other enemy country
origin was lack of Christian faith on -the part
of the Japanese.

I have heard it argued also that legislation
of this kind lies peculiarly within the purview
of neimhers of the elective chamber. While
conceding, for the purposes only of this discussion, that this may be the case, it seems ta
me that the Senate in not thereby absolved of
its basic obligation ta protect the rights* of
minorities and minority groupa in Canada.
Further, I submit that the proponents of
section 5 as it now stands are an very thin
ground with this argument when this Chamber
already has seen fit ta delimit in a very
marked degree the disqualification as enacted
in the other place. If, however, we are te pay
heed ta the suggestion that the other House
should take the chief responsibility in matters
of this kind, then in view of the fact that the
Senate regards the section as it cornes ta us
as being in large measure inappropriate, I
venture ta suggest that the wise course ta
follow would be ta delete section 5 in its
entirety and send the Bill back ta the other
place, there ta be reconsidered by the elected
members of Parliarnent in the liglit of the
opinions expressed hy honourable members of
the Senate.
I have anather fundamental objection to
the enactmient of section 5 as now amended,
in that it seeks ta make applicable in the
matter of Dominion elections, without in any
way consulting the Governments of those
provinces, a disqualification presently in effect
only in British, Columbia. As pointed out the
other day by the hanourable the acting leader
on the other side (Hon. Mr. Haig), and as 1
recognize, the Dominion Elections Act, 1938,
is the basis for the British Columbia disqualification. Here I would pause to remark that,
in my opinion, if there was justification for
the enactmnent of section 14 Wi when the Act
was revised in 1938, it would have been better
for Parliament ta assume the responsibility
of directly disqualifying persans of certain
racial origin. rather than ta delegate this
authority ta the provinces in the matter of
Dominion elections. However, that section is
now on aur statute books and no present
advantage is ta be gained by my further
criticismn af it at this time. I point out, however, that the Act of 1938 does vest discretionary power in the Legislative Assemblies
of the various provinces; and that this was
acted upon by one province only. What; is
naw proposed by section 5 is ta make applicable ta ail of the other provinces of Canada
the result of the exercise of this power by
British Columbhia only. I think that this is
wrong. Sa far as I amn able ta determine,
there has been no general demand from these
other provinces or fromn aur citizens residing
therein for legialatian of this kind. It lias
been said ta me that the very fact that the

272

SENAT~E

other flouse enacted section 5 is prima facie
uvidence that there is such a demand by the
Canadian peopie for this restrictive legisiation.
Assuming such to bie the case, is it necessary
for me to refer again to the fact that this
Chamber, acting upon the recommendation of
its Danking and Commerce Committee, hias
'leen fit substantially to resist that dlaim?
Surely even the Senate of Canada cannot blow
1hoth lhot and cold. If t-bore is sucli a demand
in the province of British Columbia as evidenced by the existence of its legisiation
s.uppiementary te clause 14 (i), then that

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I shall he happy te

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved by

Committee cf the Whole, with instructions
te delete section 5, and aise te renumber the

JUNE 30, 1944
Bill accordingly, and to amend section 11 by
striking out the words "and eight" where they
appear in the first line thereof.
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
cannot see any great advantage in the honourable senator's suggestion that this Bill be
not now read the third time, but be referred
to Committee of the Whole. The Bill bas
already been before a standing committee, one
of the largest and most important of our
committees. The committee discussed this
section very fully. It has generally been the
practice of parliamentarians throughout the
Empire to exercise great caution in discussing
matters of this kind, and therefore I decided
it would be better to present my view before
the committee rather than before this Chamber. If it would serve any useful purpose to
go into Committee of the Whole I would say,
by all means vote accordingly; but on the
motion for third reading my honourable
friend and those who are supporting him will
have full opportunity for debate, and I see no
reason why we should not proceed now with
the third reading after adequate discussion has
taken place. I have no desire to limit
discussion, but I think it would be unfortunate
if we adjourned before this motion is either
carried or defeated.
I think it would be inopportune and unwise
to carry this matter over for two or three
weeks in order that certain influences might
get to work and indicate that they have a
higher moral character and standard than have
others. I think that is unfair, and I would
now suggest that we proceed to the debate on
the third reading. I cannot see the advantage
of going into Committee of the Whole. It
may be that there is more liberty in committee, and that one member can interrogate
another freely. But these matters have been
gone over already. However, I am in the
hands of the Senate. We have had the advantage of a fair discussion on second reading,
and have had the report of the committee.
There is only one amendment that would be
referred to committee, and if any useful purpose could be served thereby, I would have
no objection to it; but as far as I am concerned I will oppose my honourable friend's
motion.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
gentlemen, I think the question should be
cleared up as to whether the last proposal
is a motion or an amendment. I am satisfied
that it is an amendment.
Hon. Mr. KING: A motion.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is an amendment to the motion.
106-19

273

Hon. Mr. KING: The amendment was
made later.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
It
is
an
amendment.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable senator
from Edmonton is right. He should go ahead.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We find ourselves
in a difficult position. There are those who
examine this matter from the moral point
of view, and who apparently are very sensitive on the general question as to whether
we should take the franchise away from
anybody who lias it. Some people take the
view that the franchise is a sacred thing,
but they are forgetful of the fact that it is
a matter of contract, that when one becomes

naturalized lie swears to behave as a good
citizen of the country, and agrees that if he
does not the franchise should be taken from
him.
This discussion is just beginning. It is
going to last for some time. As I sec it, the
whole question is whether the individual
Japanese is a desirable immigrant, the sort
of citizen we can make use of. I take the
view that the Japanese ought never to have
been admitted to this country. They were
admitted because we sought to pacify and
appease certain people. We hoped in the
earlier stages that the Japanese empire was
going to become a great power in the Orient,
and would ease the situation with Russia
and others. So the Japanese were allowed
to come in.
I imagine that many Japanese now in
Canada came in surreptitiously-sneaked in,
or came in with false papers--and that many
of them are here unlawfully.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Has the honourable
senator read the report of the Security Commission appointed by this Government to
inquire into the very thing he has referred
to? That Commission has reported that there
is not one shred of evidence to prove what
the honourable gentleman suggests.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have not read
it, but I know that many of these people
have been interned for misbehaviour, so I
am not inclined to be impressed by what
my honourable friend says.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It has been disproved that any number came in surreptitiously and are still here.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not think
anybody knows. In Honolulu these people
were exchanging their papers. A fishing boat

would go out with one man, and another
would corne back with the papers of the man
who originally held them.
This is the very beginning of the discussion,
and to my mind the whole question turns on
whether or not the Japanese is a good citizen.
I contend that he is not. He is constitutionally unable to understand the principles of
democratie government.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Is that essential to the
exercise of the franchise?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It should be.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Perhaps it should be,
but I ask if it is.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He should understand it.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I think he cannot
intelligently discharge bis duties as a citizen
unless he understands what it is all about;
and these people clearly do not understand.
The next thing I want to say about the
Japanese immigrant is that he cannot be
assimilated. I venture to think that the test
of his assimilability is not only his understanding of our systein, but the likelihood of
his intermarrying and entering into the body
politic, and leaving no trace of his origin.
This man is a coloured man. Furthermore,
very few Japs marry white women. Their
whole training is against it, and our scruples
are against it. I do not know whether there
are any half-caste Japanese in British Columbia or not. I have never seen any. We cannot look forward to assimilating the Japanese
through the medium of marriage.
When our troops return from this war and
all the facts are made public, it will be demonstrated that the Jap is an uncivilized savage,
and that his treatment of our people who are
his prisoners bas been probably the cruelest
recorded in history. I venture to say that of
the two thousand military prisoners the Japs
had a year or so ago but a sorry remnant of
fifty or sixty will return. The remainder will
have been starved, or killed deliberately in
We have
Japanese concentration camps.
enough information on that subject now to
prove what I say. There are many books in
the library which deal with the conduct of the
Japanese toward their prisoners, and authentic
information as to the manner in which they
have treated captured American airmen and
soldiers discloses that these people are uncivilized savages at best.
We never should have admitted the Japanese into Canada. When we undertook to carry
out defensive arrangements in British Columbia we found that the task would be impossible if we left these people in the neighbourHon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

hood. They had to be moved out, or our
efforts would be nullified. They had to he got
rid of, and this was undertaken by the Security
Commission, and they were all transported to
back areas-and even there they have net
behaved any too well.
Ultimately we are going to be confronted
with the demand that all of their race in this
country be deported, those who are naturalized
as well as those who are not. The fact that
they have become citizens and have settled in
Canada does net alter the situation. They
still remain an unassimilable and objectionable people with whom we can do notbing.
Therefore I say we are going to be confronted
with a demand that they be got rid of.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Does the honourable
senator suggest that such a demand would be
made with regard to those born in Canada?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes. I do net
think that makes any difference. The whole
question is whether we want these people or
not, and I say the demand will be that they
all go, because nothing will be gained by
expelling only tbose who are unnaturalized
and allowing the others to remain. That is
why this is a problem, but it should not
prevent us froin acting in self-defence.
One principle is larger than anything else:
in self-defence we have to get rid of these
people; and we never will have a better
chance to do it than will come at the end of
this war. I cannot understand the attitude
of people who, knowing quite well that the
Japanese are a bad lot, can advance arguments
which might be applicable to other races, but
which are net applicable to the Japs. After
all, these other people are white, and their
forebears have been living in Canada for many
generations and are fairly good citizens.
Hon. Mr. EULER: They are better than
fairly good.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My friend behind me (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach) is of the same extraction as
you are.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It is suggested
that if we disfranchise these people now under
section 5, in some curious manner it is going
to annoy the Japanese and they are going to
take it out on the prisoners in their hands.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I made no such
suggestion. I was very careful to avoid doing
sO.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I did not mention
my honourable friend, but the argument was
advanced in committee that if we were to
take this action now we shall be endangering
the lives of prisoners who are in the hands of

JIJNE 30, 1944
the Japaniese. I do not believe the Jap will
attach any great value to enfranchisement.
H1e does not understand it, does flot believe
in it, and is flot likely to be impressed by
anyt.hing we do in the niatter. The more
firmness we show, the better headway we shall
make with the Jap. H1e is of a people which
is beyond the pale. It is al] a matter of
seif-defence, flot of what we shall like to do.
I submit that the opportunity now presented
may neyer occur again, and that we should
avail ourselves of it and get rid of these people
as soon as we possibly can.
The honourable gentleman did make the
statement that there is no widespread demand
for this action; but if you consider the
atmosphere in which this question arises, that
is quite understandable. There is an atmosphere of secrecy; there is no public discussion
of what has happened-in fact, public discussion is forbidden. Only those wbo live close
to the situation which. has existed have any
conception of it. The publicly expressed
disapproval of this clause is limited to those
very remote from the situation. They cons-ider
it purely fr.om a moral point of view-and in
that way may have some argument-but -from
the point of view of real responsible opinion
they are not in the picture at all.
I shahl vote in favour of this clause and of
the third reading of the Bill.
Hon. WILLIAM DUJFF: Honourable senators, it seems to me that at this moment we
should be discussing a point of order. The
honourable senator fromn Lincoln (Hon. Mr.
Bench), who made an excellent speech, moved
an amendinent that the Bihl be referred to the
Committee of the Whole flouse. My honourable friend the leader of the flouse (Hon. Mr.
King) suggested that instead we should dJiscuss
the Bill on the motion for third reading, and,
if I understood him correctly, then vote either
for or against the whohe Bill. I take it that
my honourable friend from Lincoln is not
opposed to the whole Bill. Neither am I, nor
do I think anyone else in this Chamber is.
But a number of us are opposed to clause 5.
If the honourable, leader's suggestion were
carried out and a mai ority voted against the
motion for third readting,; the whole Bill would
faîl to the ground. Nobody wants that to
happen.
I therefore feel it is only reasonable and fair
that this Bill should be referred to the Committee of the Whole flouse, where there wouhd
be ample opportunity for discussion of clause 5.
Surely it would be better to take that procedure than to, rn the risk of defeating this
Bill, whose objeet is to enable the members of
our armed forces to vote. As firee British sub'~-106-9j

jects, our soldiers, sailors and airmen have a
right to express their views through their votes;
and as free British subi ects we bere have a
right to express our opinion on clause 5. On a
point of order I respectfully submit to. you,
Mr. Speaker, that the motion to refer, the Bihl
to Committee of the Whole flouse shouhd
be put.
flonourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
senators,-I should like to point out that the
motion before the flouse was that the Bill as
amended be now read the third time. In
amendîment it was moved that the Bill be not
now read a third time, 'but be referred to the
Committee of the Whole flouse, and that
amendmnent is now before the flouse. If the
amendmaent passes, the Bill will not be rend the
third time, but will be referred to the Committee. Should the amendment be negatived,
the flouse would then vote on the main
motion, that the Bill be read a third timeI wish to correct a ruling which I made a
short while ago. I amn afraid, it was inspired
by my flouse of Commons background. In
Bourinot, 4th edition, it is stated, at page 530:
Third Reading.-When the Order of the Day
for the third reading 'has been rend, it is coinpetent to inove that it be discharged and the,
bill withdrawn, or that it be re-committed..
Formerly it was net unusual when the motion!
for the third readiýng had been agreed te, t(>
add clauses, or inake other amendments; but
of late years the flouse has followed the modemn
practice of the Englieh Connnons, which is
stated in a standing order: "No amendment&,

not beiug inerely verýbal, shahl be made to any
Bill on the third reading." Whenever it is
proposed to make important amendmnents, it is
usual te move te discharge the order for the
third reading, and te go *hack into committee
for the purpose. Or the House may be asked,
at this as ai any other stage of a bill, to (ivide
on a resolution relative te the principle of the
wvhole measure.
That is the pfocedure in the flouse of
Commons. But in the Senate there is a rule,
No. 65, which states:
A senator may, at any time before a bill is
passed, move for reconsidemation of auy clause
thereof, already passed.
On this point Bourinot says, at page 531:
In the Senate, bis are constantly amended
on the third reading without going back to
committee.
I find this is based on the practice foliowed
in *the flouse of Lords. May, l3th edition,
says, at page 422:
The queetion -for the third reading may benegatived: but, as previously stated, such aý
vote is not fatal te the bill. In the Lords, new.
clauses xnay be added, and amendînents madete the bill, at this rtage.
In the Lords, the original tithe of a bill is
amended at any stage at whioh amendments areadmissible, %rhenalterations in the body of the
bill have rendered any change in the tithe-necessary.

276

SENATE

I thought it well to place this authority on
record. My ruling will be amended accordingly. Therefore, in the Senate, as in the
Lods, amendments may be proposed on the
motion for third reading.
Hon. J. T. HAIG: Honourable senators, the
argument expressed by the honourable senator
from Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) coincides with
the sentiment that, according to letters I have
received. prevails in many parts of the country.
A great many people, apparently thinking that
the House of Commons inserted in this Bill
an entirely new clause which prohibits the
Japanese from voting, have urged us to reject
that clause. But what is the fact? As I
stated yesterday, the Dominion Elections Act
of 1938 contained a section disqualifying
certain classes of people from voting. The
honourable senator from Lincoln seemed to
imply, though he did not say so, that the disanalifving section was inserted for the first
lime in 1938, but I find that section in the
Revised Statutes of 1927, a year when the
Conservative party was in office. There was a
further revision, but the disqualifying section
remained. I find that the Dominion Franchise
Act of 1934 disfranchised the following persons:
the Chief Electoral Officer; the Franchise
Commissioner; the Assistant Chief Electoral
Officer; the Secretary of the Franchise Commissioner; every judge appointed by the
Governor in Council; every Esquimau person,
whether born in Canada or elsewhere.
.ion. Mr. MURDOCK: And every Japanese
person?
Ion. Mr. HAIG: I shall come to that in a
moment. The Esquimaux were in this country
Every Indian
long before the Japanese.
ordinarily resident on an Indian reservation,
unless Le served in the military, naval or air
forces of Canada in the war of 1914-1918, also
was disfranchised. Yet the Indians were here
before any of us.
In the disqualifications section of that 1934
Statute there is this paragraph:
Subject to subsection tvo--

That subsection refers to the Indians.
-every person who is disqualifiel by reason of
race froin voting at an election of a member
of the Legislative Assembly of the province in
which lie or she resides and who did not serve
in the military, naval or air forces in the war
of 1914-1918
is disqualified from voting in a Dominion
election.
The Parliament and the people of Canada
have always desired that the Dominion franchise should be restricted to those persons who
are qualified to vote in provincial elections. I
Tii,

Hon. the SPEAKER.

believe that the province which would most
strongly resist any intrusion upon that principle is Quebec, with Manitoba a close second.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is a strange
principle.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is a practical one. We
want the provincial franchise to govern in
Dominion elections, because the provinces
know best what is in the interests of their
people. We bave a relatively small population,
scattered over a large territory: the situation
would be different if we were a compact
country like Great Britain. The question we
are dealing with now affects only about four
thousand or forty-five hundred Japanese, in
various parts of the country outside of British
Columbia. Ninety-seven per cent of them were
originally in tliat province, but during the war
have been removed by the Government. Prior
to the war there were very fow Japanese elsewhere than in British Columbia. In Manitoba
we had a few, who were in business, and there
was a small number' in Ontario and other
provinces. Those Japanese who were born in
British Columbia never had the right to vote.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: They had if they
came to Ontario.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But they never had the
riglht to vote in British Columbia.
In my opinion most of the protests against
this clause 5 come from people of one type, a
type which all down through the ages has been
responsible for our most difficult problems. It
was such people who after the last war pleaded
that we should not be too hard with Germany.
Because I and others like me blundered in 1918
and later years, my boy and thousands like
him have had to go overseas to continue the
fight against Cermany. Well, if I can help it,
my grandchildren will not have to take part
in another war.
As J stated in committee, I appreciate the
religious sentiments of men and women who
have served as missionaries in Japan and in
China.
Honourable members opposite are
not the only ones acquainted with these people.
I know a few-some of them graduated from
the same university as I did-and they will
tell you that they were dumbfounded by the
cynicism rampant in Japan. The Japanese
regard themselves as the master race; they
are far worse than the Germans in that respect,
and we had better recognize that fact.
It is impossible for us to assimilate Japanese
people. Whatever we do, they will always
remain Japanese. My honourable friend said
in committee that I had not come into close
contact with those people, and ho wanted to
know how many of them we had in Winnipeg.

JUNE 30, 1944
It is true we have flot a large number in that
city. But Winnipeg and Quebec have about
1,000 prisoners of war at Hong Kong. If I
supported this arnendment I could not walk
down the streets of Winnipeg and face the
fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, wives
and sweethearts of those men. They know
what happened to them at Hong Kong. What
happened to the niece of my honourable friend
here (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)? She was starved
to death in a concentration camp over there.
She left two littie kiddies behind. That is
wýhat we face, and the sooner we realize it the
better. You will find that the people of
British Columbia, with the exception of one
smali group, are unanimous in declaring, "We
don't want the Japanese in our province."~
When the people of Ontario wake up they
too will not want the Japanese in their province. This amendment wiIl apply only until
the war is over; then we can reconsider the
whole matter. I feel very keenly about it.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Does my honourable
friend agree with his colleague that ail Japanese
ought to be deported after the war?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That ia not the issue
before us. If my honourable friend knows me
at ail, he knows that I arn not afraid to take
n stand, but I do not want to be distracted by
n false issue.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: What do you mean
by a false issue?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Whether the Japanese
shall be deported after the war. That has
nothing to do with the present issue.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That wns the issue
declared by the previous speaker.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is his own business.
Side issues only complicate the question.
'rhere are arguments on both aides. When
the time coifies my honourable friends from
Ot.tawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) and Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) will have no difficulty
in finding where my vote goes. I regret very
much that I was not in the committee when
the vote wvas taken. I was called out, and
before I could get back you*had taken the
vote. You were too fast for me.
Ail we are doing by this Bill is disfranchis3ing
people who, outaide of a few people who were
in this province before Pearl Harbor, should
neyer have had thé franchise. How, after
Pearl Harbor, anybody can vote to give the
Japanýese the franchise is beyond my ken. My
head won't work that way. The representatives of the Japanese Government were negotiating with the American representatives at
Washington at the very moment Japanese

277

bombers were over Pearl Harbor. Such
treachery is unthinkable to us; it is not to the
Japanese. That is our difficulty.
Hon. Mr. MU.RDQCK: "Vengeance is mine,
I will repay." saith the Lord.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Sure. But that bas nothing
to do with this matter.
Ion. Mr. BENCH: Will the honourable
gentleman indicate what part Canadian-born
Japanese may have had in the treachery
perpetrated at Pearl Harbor?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is the type.
lIon. Mrs. WILSON: Why don't you hold
Germans responsible for the atrocities of
,German soldiers?
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: I do.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: But they get the
vote.
Ion. Mr. HAIG: Germans are flot disqualified from voting in any of our provincesHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then why let eight
provinces prevent the Japanese from voting
.iust because British Columbia diafranchises
them?
Ion. Mr. HAIG: Because only one province
knows the Japs. As a Canàdian, I arn prepared to accept the judgment of that one
province, because its people know the Japs,
and we do not. The fundamental difficulty
is that we cannot assimilate the Japs; we
can the Germans. There are two distinguished
members in this House of that racial descent.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Icar, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: After listening to the
stories of returned missionary leaders of the
church to which both my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) and I belong, I arn
forced to the conclusion that the cunning Jap
is a Jap wherever you find him. The-rei are
a few men in Japan, as there are in aIl countries, who detest and condemn the atrocities
encouraged by the militarist. I might mention that great Christian Japanese, Kagawa;
but lie is a voice crying in the wilderness.
What the soldiers of Japan have done in the
Philippines, in Hong Kong, and in China i&
evidence that they do not umderstand our
way of life at alI. But that is not the issue
here. The issue is that the Japanese in Canada
shahl not have a vote in this war-time eleation. After the war is over we will take up
the question again.
I feel very sympathetic towards British,
Columbia. It is one of our great provinces-.
Had we allowed the Japanese to carry on

SENATE
in that province there would soon be no
British Columbia so far as Canada is concerned; it would be an outpost of the Empire
of Japan. Virtually all the opposition to this
section comes from Ontario. I can appreciate the reason. The people of Ontario are
far away from the Japanese problem. But
mark my words. When the war is over and
our men and women come back from Hong
Kong, no member of this House will want
to say a word for the Japanese. I know how
fathers and mothers, wives and sweethearts,
feel about this thing. I say we should vote
against the amendmient, and give the Bill
third reading.

Hon. Mr. HAIG:
After the word "disqualified" we added "at the time of the passing
of this Act." Then in section Il we inserted
section 5. So the statute will only be operative
while the war is on.

lon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, I have listened very carefully to the
rather heated remarks-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know. We made the
clause comply with the explanation.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Net heated.
the honourable
Hon. Mr. DUFF: -of
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig). I do not
think lie has any special prerogative to say
what he did say against the Japanese. I am
as much opposed to the Japanese as lie or
any other member of this House can be.
We have no use for the Japanese. Why should
the honourable member for the last twentyfive minutes in an excitable mannerHon. Mr. HAIG:
twenty-five.

Twenty

minutes,

not

Hon. Mr. DUFF: -argue about something
which (toes not relate to this clause at all?
He did not refer te the clause.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, lie did.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Like one of those gentlemren learned in the law, lie worked all around
the map in order to make seme political
capital. It is net a matter of the Japanese
or anybody else.
Hon. Mr. COPP:

What else is it?

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Let me read clause 5:
5. Subsection two of section fourteen of tle
said Act is amended by adding the following
paragraphi thereto:
"(n) every person residing in Canada whose
racial origin is that of a country at war wi th
Canada if such person at te tine of a Dominion
election would be disqualified by reason of race
in any one of tie provinces of Canada while
residing therein, fr.om voting :at an election of
a meniber of the Legislative Assenbly of that
province, and who did not serve in the naval.
-nilitary or air forces of Canada in tIe war of
1914-18, or in the war that began on the tenth
day of September, 1939."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We amended that clause
in committee.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
Hion. Mr. HAIG.

How?

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Then why did my honourable friend spend so much time discussing the
Japanese?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We excluded the Japanese.
The section across the page reads:
This provides a disqualification froin voting
at a Dominion election of persons of the
Japanese race.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is not a clause at
all, it is an explanation.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: But my honourable friend
does net appreciate my objection. I should
like to be able to say what I would do with
the Japanese if I had my will. I certainly
would net call a Japanese naval man a man, as
my honourable friend did a Canadian naval
seaman.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
seaman, I suppose.

Yeu would call him a

Hon. Mr. DUFF: No. My language would
net be parliamentary if I were talking about
a Japanese naval man. That is net the point
at all. My honourable friend is running around
the ring. My objection is to the wording,
"every person residing in Canada whose racial
origin is that of a country at war with Canada," and so on. Let us lave some intestinal
fortitude. If we don't want the Japanese to
vote, let us say se. Let us come out plump
and plain. If the C.C.F. or the Bloc Populaire got into power in Nova Scotia and
passed a disfranchising bill, then 10 per cent
of the people now in my county would be deprived of their vote because of their racial
origin.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That bad feature
is deleted. The application of the clause is
limited to Japanese only.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
ment that way.

I do not read the amend-

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:

That is the fact.

Hon. Mr. EULER: That just shows that
the clause should be redrafted to read Japanese only.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: The amending words "at
the time of the passing of this Act" do net in
my opinion clarify the clause. That is just
passing the buck. Why should the people in
my constituency who came to this country

JUNE 30, 1944
from Hanover, Germany-where the ancestors
of the King of England came from-bave this
sword beld over their heads? For if the legislature of Nova Scotia saw fit to pass the
necessary bill, no person whose racial origin
is that of a country at war with Canada would
'be qualified to vote.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The words you
have quoted look after that.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Why not delete the section
altogether and insert a clear-cut clause showing that we do not want the Japanese to vote?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Then say so.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I would have ail the
Japanese commit hara-kiri. Let us insert a
clear-cut clause disqualifying the Japanese
from voting. Let us not put it in the minds
of the people of this country whose ancestors
came here a hundred or two bundred years ago
that some legisiature may pass a bill to
disfrancbise them.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question.
bonourable members, is on the amendmentHon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 thought there were
to be sev'eral ýother speakers.
Hon. Mr. KING: There will be on the
motion for third reading.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It bas been
rnoved by the Honourable Senator King, seconded by the Honourable Senator Copp, that
this Bill ba now read a third time, to wbicb
the Honoiirable Senator Bench, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Lambert, bas moved
an amendaient, that the Bill be net now read
a third time, but that section 5, be deleted
and that consequent upon sucb deletion the
subsequent sections of the Bill be re-numbered
accordingly, and that section il be amended
by striking out the words "and eight" where
they eppear in the first line thereof.
The question is on the amendment. Those
in favour?
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Bonourable senators, if I arn in order, I should like
to speak in support of the amendment. In
so doinig 1 do not propose to recapitulate any
of the reasons wbicb I gave on tbe second reading of the Bill, and whicb I repeated in the
e
Committee, for my opposition to clause 5
either in its original form or as amended. I
should like to discuss some of the broader
political aspects of this question as it applies
to Canada, but before doing so I sbould like
to refer to what was said by the leader of the
other sida, the bonourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Craig). and also by the hionourable senator from Edmonton (Bon. Mr.
Griesbach).

I appreciated, and I think we ail appreciated,
the point of view expressed by the bonourable
senator from Edmonton, wbo spoka as a
soldier with a creditable recordý. Bis analysis of the defence problems that are involved
on the Pacific Coast was, .1 think, a sound
one; but 1 cannot agrea with lis general diagnosis snd proposed treatment of the Japanese
problem in tbis couxntry as a peacetime
solution of our social snd political problams.
If Canada ware to be govarned and dominated
by a military autocracy, then I should follow
very definitely the suggestion made by the
honourable senator from Edmonton that every
undertaking entered into with regard to these
people during past yeers sbould be tbrown
overboard, and that the people themsalves
should be deported the day after the war is
over.
As fer as the bonourable senator from Winniîpeg is concerned, I should have expected a
much more tolerant and much broader point
of view than bie axpressed on tbis question.
For one thing, bie spoke about what bappened
et Pearl Harbor, and could not understand
how, efter that incident, anybody could say a
word for tbe Japanese. Peculiarly, bie was
speaking ýabout sometbing that affected the
United States much more closely tban it
affected this country, and witbout entering into
a long dissertation on tbat country, I would
suggest to him, if bie bas tbe, interest and tbe
inclination, that hie familiarize bimself with the
books wrîtten by the Honourable Josepb Grew,
the recenit American ambassador et Tokyo.
In them he will find a very different and
enligbtened opinion-not a diatribe, but a
broad-minded view of world problems between.
the United States of America, et least, and
the people of Japan.
,Now I should like to proceed witb the discussion of clause 5 from the- point of view
of what I intimated in tbe beginning was the
broader political aspect of tbe problem wbich
confronts this Bouse. First of ail I might express a good deal of gratification on the fact
that the debate on clause 5 in this Chamber
and also in committee bas eut directly tbrough
party lines. I migbt edd tbat this is as I
tbink it should be, in the Senate et laast, in
considering such broad national questions as
tbe one before us. Also, I sbould like to
consider this aspect of the matter a littie
furtber, and discuss certain outstanding facts
of the present political situation in Canada
in a way that will leave me free, I hope, from
any charge of indulging in any narrow
partisanship.
Let -me say et once that I bave no apologies
to mnake in approacbing tbe subjeet wbicb bas
been con-cerning us bere. As a liberal-minded
citizen of this country 1 bave for a long time

280

SENATE

been interested in the development in this
Dominion of an all-Canadian type of society
composed of the many different elements of its
growing population, such as has been built in
the United States in so shoTt a time out of
diverse races and elements which have sought
to establish homes for themselves on the
southerly half of this continent.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What about the
negroes in the United States? Are they being
assimilated in that fashion?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think any one who
has been interested enough to follow the negro
problem in the United States, particularly since
President Roosevelt and his wife have assumed
their high place in Washington, cannot but
come to the conclusion that there is a great
deal of democratic hope for the advancement
of negro culture in that country. One does
not need to refer to the many names favourably mentioned not only in the United States
but in Great Britain. as well. My honourable
friend knows very well about one man whose
name has stood out in bold letters in the world
of art and letters in both New York and
London, Mr. Paul Robeson.
Now I come to the main part of what I
have to say. Some of my honourable friends
around me have said repeatedly, in recent
months and years, both within the Chamber
and outside, that the Senate must stand as a
bulwark against certain revolutionary tendencies which would seem to them to be
appearing in this country and to be finding
form and expression in a new political party
which, unfortunately, does not happen to have
representation in this part of Parliament at
the present time. Fears have been expressed
that drastic changes may be made in the
economie and financial order of this country
by reason of the rise of the C.C.F. party. We
have recentIv seen rather spectacular results in
an election in Saskatchewan, while in the
legislatures of British Columbia and Ontario
the C.C.F. forms the official opposition. Do
honourable members think that the present
strength of the C.C.F. party in Canada is due
to socialistic planks incorporated in its platform? I for one do net believe that to be so.
On the other hand, I should like to point out
that the C.C.F. has made, and is making. many
friends in this country, particularly in the
older provinces, by reason of its consistent
position in reference to the status of Canadian
citizenship. The C.C.F. party has not yet been
doing business long enough in this country to
have had registered on its escutcheon some of
the black marks which history can record
against both of the old parties in relation to
Hon.

M.

LAMBERT.

their handiling of problems in the province of
Quebec. If the C.C.F. party ever assumes the
reins of government in the federal field, it will
have a more difficult task in keeping its record
clean on these racial matters than it has had
while in oposition. But the fact remains that
on the question of racial discrimination as
related to Canadian citizenship, the position of
the C.C.F. has been consistent, and in my
opinion, sound. I make that statement from
the point of view of a Liberal who is glad to
see the C.C.F. adopting a liberal point of view
with regard to that social and political
situation.
I am not in a position to prophesy what
will happen in British Columbia in the next
federal election. It is quite possible that. by
introducing the anti-Japanese cry, candidates
representing the older parties may be able to
defeat their opponents for the timie being;
but it is my opinion that for every temporary
advantage which may be gained out there a
corresponding disadvantage will be registered
in the provinces east of British Columbia
because of the introduction of this anti-social
and bad political measure into the public
issues of this country.
An observer of the operations of propaganda
in the last great war wrote these cogent
words:
.
As war prbgresses and the strain increases,

the sense of justice which makes men indignant
degenerates

into

the

spirit of

revenge

which

makes them vindictive.
"If we cannot use a maîn's virtueS, let us
use his vices," was one of the famous phrases
of Junius in his filght for the frecdom of the
press in England. The tendency in this racial
issue is to read everything bad into the character of the Japanese, and to induce an intolerant arrogance of mind which will react with
damaging effect on those who hold it. especially in the fast-changing international picture
which confronts the world to-day.
I prefer to follow the wise and statesmanlike advice of Joseph Grew to the Government and people of the United States. He
points out that among the

people of Japan

there is a fine cultured and pocce-loing element of large proportions which -hould be
preserved and cultivated by the people of the
world; and he recommends that as soon as the
hateful military gangsters who for ten years
have dominated that country as well as China
are eliminated root and branch, the United
States and other Allied nations should help to
re-orientate the international outlook of
Japan through return to office of the peace
party in that country, a party which in the
early thirties and twenties, and indeed previously, expressed itself in very strong terms
and exercised great influence.

JIJNE 30, 1944
Before concluding I should like to express
high commendation of my honourable friend
frorn Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) for the quaIity of his maiden speech in this flouse.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It is greatly to be
ýregretted that, on account of iii health, hie was
prevented frorn speaking carlier. Another
cause of regret is that there was flot a full
attendance of honourable senators on this
occasion to enjoy his splendid address.
I suggest that in considering this Bill the
guiding influence of the Senate should be a
sense of justice, and flot a spirit of revenge
or narrow partisanship.
Honourable
Hon, W. A. BUCHANAN:
senators, 1 intend f0 occupy only a few
minutes in diseussing this question. which I
approach fromn a standpoint that has not been
mentioned in the debate so far. In my
opinion, there is involved in this question a
principle affecting the citizenship that we have
besfowed upon people who came to Canada
from other lands. I took a similar position
when a measure of wider ramifications was
introduced during the last war, and my opinion
has not changed in the meanfime. Large
numbers of people have corne here f0 live,
taken the oath of allegiance and pledged
thernselves to our laws. My contention is
that so long as they obey our laws and cornply
with the requirements of Canadian citizenship, their rights should flot be disturbed. We
talk much about the pledged word. Truc,
these people have made a pledge to us, but
was flot fthc giving of cifizcnshiýp to thema a
pledge on our part? If, as good citizens,
they keep their pledge, why sbould we break
ours? To get down to the question now
before the flouse: why should we deprive
them of one of the rights of citizenship, the
right f0 vote?
Sorne reference was made f0 the attitude
ef the Unifed States of America fowards the
Japanese. The traitorous attack on Pearl
Harbor caused -the Arnericans to enter into
the war; fhey probably have suffered far more
frorn the Japanese than have we. I made
special inquiry f0 ascertain whether any steps
had been taken f0 disfranchise Japanese
eitizens of the United States, and was advised
thaf nothing of that kind. had been donc nor
was expected fo be donc. Why should we,
who boast of being second fo none in our
love of liberty and justice, fake a step which
could only be rcgarded as backward in comparison with the policy of our neighbours to
the south?
I repeat that the people who came here from
other lands and assurned responsibilities of
citizenship. not only made a pledge to us
106-20

281

but in rcturn received a pledge. So long as
fhey conduct themselves as good cifizens, no
matter what their colour or race, they should
have none of the rightfs of citizens taken away
frorn thern.
I fried to ask a question of the honourable
senator frorn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), but
for &orne reason or other hie sccrned inclined
to 'pay less attention to it than to questions
frorn other honourable members.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn sorry; I did flot
hear rny honourable friend's question at ail.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I understood him
to say hie belicved that the provincial franchise should goverfi in Dominion elections.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the law, and bas
been the law for a long tirne.
Then is rny
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN:
honourable friend in favour of lowering the
votîng age to eighfcen years, in accordance
with fthc recent move in Alberta?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn quite willing that
people should vote at ciglifeen years of age
in Albierta, if that is the wish in that province.
I have no objection at alI to that. The law
lias always been thaft the provincial franchise governs in Dominion elections.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Suppose the Legislature
of Alberta decided f0 allow Japanese f0 vote
Would my honourable
in that province.
friend be satisfied fo have fhem vote in
Dominion elections?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If the Alberta Legislature
took that action, fthc Japanese could vote in
that province under the Act as it now stands.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: This Bill would
not allow fhern to vote.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The law as it stands is
thaf the Japanese cannot vote in British
Columbia, and this Bill would extend that
restriction f0 the Japanese fhroughout Canada
for the durafion of the war. Most of fhern
who are outside of British Columbia were
rnovcd frorn that province since the war
began.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I understand that.
But would this clause à flot establish a dangerous precedent? In any province a race,
of people might for some reason or other
becorne disliked, and if fthc Legislafure disqualified fhem frorn voting in provincial eecfions they would be disfranchiscd in Dominion
clections as well. Týhen ail the people of that
race throughout Canada would bc disfranchised in Dominion elections. Suppose that
were applied f0 Danes or Swedes.

REVIBED EDITION

SENATE
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Clause 5, as amended by
the committee, could not apply to them.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I know the amendment would restriet clause 5 for the time
being, but my point is that it would establish
a dangerous precedent. In the future some
government might wish to take advantage
of that precedent and sponsor a disfranchising section far wider in its application than
this one is.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
senators, I should like to say first that I have
been much encouraged by the way in which
this question has been dealt with by the
honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon. Mr.
Bench). I am sure we all feel that in him
the Senate has acquired a powerful addition
to its debating force, an addition which should
enhance the prestige of this Chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: I have a distinct
recollection of a remark made to me when I
-hanced to meet the late Senator Pope in the
corridor, shortly after I was appointed to the
Senate. He said: "You had better hurry into
the Chamber. Your leader is talking about
rigbts of minorities, a question on which you
nust be well informed." Well. since I came
here I have been treated -n the manner that
my then leader recommended as suitable for
minorities. I have never been made to feel
that I was in a minority, except when some
special privileges or courtesies have been
accorded to me. as in the seating arrangements
provided in another place this afternoon.
I am deeply concerned about the question
involved in clause 5 of this Bill. The honourable senator from Provencher (Hon. Mr.
Molloy) asked me, "How would you feel if
your son were in Hong Kong?" I said, "I am
pleased that my son is not in Hong Kong, but
if he were there I should most certainly vote
against this proposed racial discrimination, for
I should net wish the Japanese to have any
grounds for ill treating him." I have been
told on good authority, by a returned traveller
from Japan, that the suggestion te deport the
Japanese from Canada was hailed with delight
by the Japanese militarist party, which used
it as a weapon of propaganda among all the
other yellow races. The Japanese have always
thought of themselves as leaders of the
Orientals, and, as honourable senators know,
are calling for an Asiatic bloc against the rest
of the world.
It is interesting that our discussion of this
matter should have coincided with the visit of
the Prime Minister of New Zealand, who is
noted for his tolerance of all races. It has
been said that if the post-war settlement of
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

Pacifie problems is left te the Right Honourable Peter Fraser and the Honourable Walter
Nash, it will be in safe hands.
A number of references were made to the
United States policy with respect te the
Japanese. I have read that, on the testimony
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, there
was net a single case of sabotage in the
Hawaiian Islands, that the Japanese there
have carried on in an exemplary manner since
the attack on Pearl Harbor.
I am still
puzzled to know why we should hold the sins
of the Japanese militarist party against peaceful citizens of Canada. The honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) alluded
to the testimony of Joseph Grew, who spent
many years in Japan as United States Ambassador, and who had perbaps more reason than
any other person to be critical of Japa nese
policies. I nust say that the other dav I had
the great pleasure of meeting Lady Marler, who
had come to Ottawa for the special purpose
of assisting in the setting up of a hostel for
Canadian-born Japanese. She earnestly feels
they should be given as generous treatment
as possible.
We have been reading with interest some of
the reports of our nationalities committee.
One recommendation which thiev stress is that
we should make sure to weleorne immigrants
who in our judgment will become assets te
this country, and that these people should be
instructed in good principles. How can they
have confidence in our principles if we go back
I
on an agreement that we have made?
should like to see much more formality introduced into the ceremony of naturalizing newconiers, with a view of impressing upon them
the importance of their new, privileges and
responsibilities. I have been deeply touched
by the way in which some new-comers have
accepted our gift of citizenship. Their satisfaction lias been keen. All with whom I have
corne in contact seem to be determined to
make a contribution to the welfare of our
country.
We should not do anything to give the
Asiatie peoples cause to believe that we intend
to discriminate against them for ever. Our
prestige in the Orient has sunk very low
during the last fifteen years, as I think all
honourable members will agree. Strongholds
that were considered impregnable have fallen.
For years I strove to prevent the continuous
expert of weapons of war to Japan. We knew
that country was waging a very cruel war
against China, yet we did nothing to help the
Chinese defend themselves against the aggressor.
In the immediate pre-war years the

JUNE 30, 1944
volume of that export business was at least
trebled, a fact that will be an everlasting
reproach against our national honour.
I should like to place on record a telegram
that has come to me from Vancouver: it is
not the only proof I have received that opinion
in British Columbia is not all on the one side.
The telegram reads:
Executive Committee Vancouver Consultative
Council requests your active resistance of section
of House Bill 135 disfranchising on racial
grounds evacuated Canadian citizens. We deplore apparent exploitation of wartime passions
to commit Parliament to policies involving
principles hostile to democracy and Christianity.
Discount any assumption that extreme views
expressed by exponents of racial antipathies
represent any matured consensus of British
Columbia opinion.
Norman F. Black, President.
We have the testimony of the Social Service
Councils of the churches in favour of the
Japanese in other parts of Canada. We may
regard this as a British Columbia problem.
Certainly, that province does not appear to
wish the aid of other provinces in solving the
problem.
I have two very strongly-worded telegrams
from the National Council and various
local councils of the Y.M.C.A. The acting
president of the Y.W.C.A. has telephoned me
from Toronto that she was very much exercised when she heard of this Bill. I have also
received a strongly-worded telegram from Mrs.
Agnew, president of the National Council
of the Y.W.C.A., and a number of telegrams from Winnipeg and other cities. I
should have to detain the House until midnight if I read all the telegrams I have
received.
iI should like to state some of my reasons
for objecting to the Bill. First, it in no way
contributes to the war effort. Many Japanese
are doing valuable war work and a considerable number would like to have volunteered
for service in the armed forces, had they been
permitted to do su. Second, it denies fundamental rights of citizenship, on purely racial
grounds. Third, it surrenders to any single
province authority to determine who shall and
who shall not vote in all of the provinces in a
Dominion election. Fourth, it is a denial of
the principles of justice and democracy for
which we are supposed to be fighting. Fifth,
it will create difficulties in racial relations,
particularly with all Oriental races after the war.
Sixth, it discrimates unjustly between Occidental and Oriental enemy races with whom
we are at war.
Canadians of Japanese racial origin are
no more responsible for the actions of the
Japanese militarists than are Canadians of
German racial origin responsible for Hitler
106-20j

283

this
Notwithstanding
and his outrages.
obvious truth, Canadians of Japanese origin
are denied rights of citizenship which are
accorded to Canadians of German origin without question. Among the rights denied to
Canadians of Japanese origin are:
(a) The right to make the contribution to
the war effort which they are qualified to
make.
(b) The fundamental right to education on
the same basis as other Canadians.
(c) The right to own property and engage
in any lawful business or profession anywhere
in Canada.
(d) The right to security and equal treatment before the law, free from the threat of
deportation or any other discrimination.
The honourable senator from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) alluded to the coloured
races. I may say that the French Republic
gave equal treatment to all races in its colonial possessions, and it was owing to this
that we were able to hold a very important
part of Africa. I hope it will not be necessary
for our grandsons and granddaughters to go
through the experiences which our sons and
daughters are now going through. I urge again
that we consider this question very carefully
before sowing the seeds for future wars. I
certainly hope that my sons will not have to
give their lives perhaps in vain, in the present
struggle.
Honourable
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
senators, we have heard many arguments pro
and con as to whether this Bill should pass,
and a little while ago I understood my
honourable friend the acting leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) to suggest that the ministers
whose joint telegrarn was read might do well
to leave the matter alone.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I never said that.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Read what you
said. You intimated that they had no business to butt into it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I never said that at all.
You go ahead and make your speech, then
read mine, and we shall both be happy.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Don't change your
speech.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not changing it at
all. You read it, and you will be happy.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I think the ministers of Canada have some rights in the
premises. I believe they have a right to
advise us. I imagine that on this particular
question a considerable number of ministers

284

SENATE

throughout the length and breath of Canada
will preach sermons on the first verse of the
24th Psalm:
The earth is the Lord's and the fulness
thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
Some honourable gentlemen want to question
the Lord's authority over the human beings
on this earth. My honourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) suggested:
"Pass this Bill as it reads. We shall never
have a better chance to get rid of the
Japanese after this war."
That is what is
involved. I do not know a single Japanese
anywhere, but I have some conception of the
horrors that the whi'te man has imposed on
the Japanese. How? On Sunday, November
12, 1905, I was in a western city, breathing the
.air off the Pacifie Ocean.
At the lodge
meeting I was attending I saw a policeman
in uniform. After the meeting he came up
and shook hands with me, and said: "Would
you like to see some of our town to-night?
I am going on duty pretty soon." I said,
'Sure."
He took me to where he was on
duty for, as J recall, eight or ten hours.
Where was it?
In a four- or five-story
building, with halls running all around on
each floor. The rooms off these halls were
about eight feet wide and ten feet long, each
containing a couch and one chair. The bottom
half of the door was closed, the top half
open. In this building there were, I should
judge. about four hiundred of what looked to
me like beautiful little Japanese girls. Who
brought about that condition? The white man.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
No. It is a
national custom in Japan, as any man who
bas read about the country knows.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All right. I will
put it in another way.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What did you do
about it?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I walked with the
policeman to the several floors to see what
was going on.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh Jim! Oh Jim i
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What did you
think I would do about it? My honourable
friend from Edmonton denies that the white
man is responsible. I do not know, but I am
pretty certain a white man was collecting the
gold that cameHon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I will guarantee
that when the bell rang and, before the top
door was closed, someone came up to
get the money, as happened quite often, and
that the money went into a white man's pocket.
Now we are confronted with the question
of having eight provinces pull British ColumY'm. Mr. MURDOCK.

bia's chestnuts out of the fire, so that, as my
honourable friend from Edmonton suggested,
"We shall never have a better chance to get
rid of the Japanese after this war." That is
what is involved. The earth is the Lord's and
the fulness thereof, and if these human beings
are made in the image of God, surely they have
some rights on this earth other than to b
exploited.
By the way, how did the Japanese come
bere in the first place?
Merely because
individuals in higher walks of life, desiring
cheap labour, got men who would work from
dawn to dusk for about 75 cents a day and
a couple of bowls of rice. That is what
brought it about. Those who originally were
responsible for bringing the Japanese here
are probably gone to their judgment. Now
we are* seriously discussing a proposed law
which contemplates that "we shall never have
a better chance to get rid of them after this
war."
Disfranchise them now as they are
disfranchised in British Columbia under the
law in effect in that province, but get the
other eigbt provinces to acquiesce and say,
"We will not let thern in."
How many Japs are involved outside of
British Columbia? Here are the figures. When
the war with Nippon broke out there were
seme 21,349 persons of Japanese ancestry living in coastal British Columbia and about
1,200 elsewhere in the same province, or a
total of 22,549. There were 600 in Alberta,
and approximately 370 in the rest of Canada.
For the sake, it is alleged, of disfranchising
970 Japs eight provinces are asked to put their
support behind this particular bill.
On the editorial page of the Toronto Daily
Star of last Tuesday I find this letter, signed
by, I presume, a Japanese:
What The Bill Means
To the Editor of The Star.
Sir: I was amazed, indeed shocked, to learn
that the federal Governiment at Ottawa bas
adopted a bill a few days ago; nanely, disfranchising Canadian citizens whose forefathers'
countries are at war with Canada. It is horrible
to think tbat a demrocratic nation, as Canada,
would pass such legislation. It is truly contrary
to ber principle. I hardly think there i.s any
other democratie nation in the world taking such
a step at this time. One often wonders what
we are fighting for and why these men and
women are laying down their lives. It looks
as though their efforts in the front are futile
and meaningless. I would like to call attention
to men and w omen of every walk of life to see
what this Act neans, not so muelh in the light
of minorities affectel at this moment, bot to
the future well-being and progress of our fair
Dominion. This may mean an end to transcending moral obligation as a leading nation. It
looks to me that we are destroying the very end
we are trying to attain.
J. John Kumagai.

JUNE 30, 1944
It is my opinion that the amendment should
pass. I think clause 5 should never have been
presented to Parliament at all, because it is
a case of racial discrimination against the
people of only one of the countries with which
we are at war. I submit that we should vote
for this amendment and so prevent racial
discrimination being charged against Canada
in the future.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, are you readly for the question? It
has been moved by the Honourable Senator
King, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Copp, that this Bill be now read a third time,
to which it has been moved in amendment by
the Honourable Senator Bench, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Lambert:
That this Bill be not now read a third time,
but be amended by deleting section 3, and that
consequent upon such deletion the subsequent
sections of the Bill be renumbered accordingly.
and that section il he amended by striking out
the words "and eight" where they appear in the
first line thereof.
The question, honourable senators, is on the
amendiment. Is it your pleasure to adopt the
amendment?
Some hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Some hon. SENATORS: No.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those in favour
will please say "Content"; those against will
say "Not Content."
Some hon. SENATORS: Not content.
Some hon. SENATORS: Content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In my opinion
the "Non-contents" have it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Can we not have a

APPENDIX
THE PRIME MINISTER OF NEW ZEALAND
ADDRESS OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE PETER FRASER TO MEMBERS OF THE SENATE AND OF THE HOUSR
OF COMMONS. IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CHAMBER, OTTAWA, JUNE 30, 1944
Mr. Fraser was welcomed by the Right
Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, Prime
Minister of Canada, and Mr. Gordon Graydon,
Leader of the Opposition, and thanked by the
Honourable Thomas Vien, Speaker of the Senate, and the Honourable James Allison Glen,
Speaker of the House of Commons.

Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister of Canada): Your Royal
Highness, Members of the Senate and of the
House of Commons, ladies and gentlemen:
We are delighted to have as a guest of
Canada to-day the Right Honourable Peter
Fraser, the Prime Minister of New Zealand.

286

SENATE

I desire, Mr. Fraser, to extend to you the
warmest of welcomes on behalf of the people
of Canada; and on this occasion more particularly to welcome you on behalf of all the
members of both Houses of Canada's Parliament, members of all political parties, and,
perhaps I should add, one or two who for
reasons best known to themselves claim they
are not members of any party.
I am sure I may also be allowed to express
a word of personal welcome.
During the years of war you and I have
shared like responsibilities, and recently have
been closely associated in the meetings of
Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London. I
have greatly looked forward to the honour
of introducing you, as I did quite recently
Mr. Curtin, the Prime Minister of Australia,
That great
to ny fellow-parliamentarians.
pleasure and honour I have to-day.
You will be interested to know that
Mr. Churchill, who presided over our meetings
in London, also spoke from this table to
mombers of our Parliament on a visit he paid
to Ottawa in December, 1941. Ottawa has
also had the honour of a visit from Field
Marshal Smuts. That, however, was as long
ago as '1930. I regret it has not thus far been
possible for the Prime Minister of South
Africa to pay us another visit. We shall hope
to welcome him at some time in the near
future. The welcome will be all the greater
should the defeat of our common enemies have
been accomplisbed meanwhile.
This is Mr. Fraser's third visit to Canada
during the present war. It is, however, the
first time be bas been in Ottawa when our
Parliament was in session. We are delighted
that he bas consented te address us this afternoon, and I wish to thank him at once for his
kindness in se doing. Our interest is redoubled
by the knowledge that he has recently visited
the battlefront in Italy where fighting mon of
New Zealand and Canada have been in action
side by side.
Before I ask Mr. Fraser to speak to us, I
should like to say a few words intended not
oniy for the Prime Minister, but equally for
the Parliament and people of New Zealand.
When Mr. Fraser visited Canada in the late
summer of 1941, the war might well have
seemed to his countrymen remote and distant.
In miles, no country was farther from the
battlefronts than New Zealand. Yet no country had entered more whole-heartedly into the
struggle. Early in the war, naval forces of
New Zealand had taken a brilliant part in the
battle of the River Plate, in which an end was
put to the Graf Spee. Soldiers from New
Zealand had already covered themselves with
honour in the Western Desert, in Greece and
Hon. Mr. KING.

in Crete. The young airmen of New Zealand,
many of whom had been trained in our midst,
had already distinguished themselves in the
unending battles in the skies. I cannot tell
yen, Mr. Fraser, how favourable is the impression which the young airmen from New
Zealand have made upon us all in the course
of their sojourn in Canada.
It will ever be remembered that New Zealand
did net wait for the forces of tyranny to
approach her shores, that she recognized that
freedom threatened anywhere meant freedom
threatened everywhere. From tie outset, the
young men of New Zealand went forth te
uphiold freedom wherever it was assailed.
When, a year later, Mr. Frazer visitcd us a
second time, the war in terms of geography
was for New Zealand no longer distant and
remote.
While to Australia the threat of
invasion by Japan was more immediate, to
New Zealand it was also perilously close.
Despite their great anxiety, the people never
faltered. The fighting men of New Zealandthose who were not already serving in European
and African theatres-took their place beside
their comrades from Australia who were
resisting the invader.
Together they held
him at bay until United States forces were
also in the firing line. In turning back the
Japanese tide the New Zealanders have played
a valiant part.
We are indeed prend to-day to recall that
armed forces of Canada and armed forces of
New Zealand have throughout the war fought
side by side in many parts of the globe. I wish
this afternoon te give you. Mr. Fraser, the
assurance that this comradeship in arms will
continue until, in both hemispheres, the defeat
of our common enemies is accomplished.
Thereafter the comradeship between our
peoples at a time of war will become a partnership, closer than ever, in all that pertains to the
arts of peace. Meanwhile, as a further evidence of the community of interest which
exists between Canada and New Zealand, there
will bu tabled to-day, in your Parliament and
in ours, copies of a Mutual Aid Agreement
between Canada and New Zealand which was
signed at Ottawa on the eve of your arrival
in our country.
May I add how pleased we are that on
your present visit you are accompanied by
Mrs. Fraser and General Puttick, Chief of the
General Staff, New Zealand Forces. To Mrs.
Fraser and to General Puttick I would also
extend a very cordial welcome. We wish you
all, and all of your party, a pleasant sojourn
in our capital and a safe return to your homeland. We wish your stay in Canada might
have been a little longer. We would ask you
te take with yen to the people of New Zealand
an expression of the admiration of the people

JUNE 30, 1944
of Canada for their outstanding contribution
to the war effort of the United Nations. We
would like you to tell them of the pride
Canada feels in the deepened friendship of our
two countries. And we should be pleased if
you would convey to the members of the
armed forces and to all the people of New
Ze.aland our best wishes for the success of their
great endeavours.
I shall ask Mr. Graydon, the Leader of His
Majesty's Loyal Opposition in the House of
Commons, to join me in the welcome being
extended to-day on behalf of all members of
the Parliament of Canada to the Prime
Minister of New Zealand.
Mr. GORDON GRAYDON (Leader of the
Opposition): Mr. Prime.Minister and honourable members of the Senate and of the House
of Commons, ladies and gentlemen: I deem it
a high honour to be granted the privilege of
making unanimous the courteous and cordial
welcome accorded se fittingly to New Zealand's
distinguished Prime Minister on this wartime
occasion by the Prime Minister of Canada.
Although that small but mighty island
member of the British Commonwealth is
widely separated by distance from this
Dominion, no people stand higher in Canadian
esteem. No people anywhere are closer to
Canadian hearts. The exemplary character
and conduct of those fine lads of the Royal
New Zealand Air Force while here in training
during this war have served to unite more
firmly than ever the bonds of friendship
between us.
New Zealand has strained ber last sinew to
lay her all on the altar of liberty. More than
one out of every ten of her population will
be found making their magnificent contribution in the armed services, while major decoratiens for gallantry awarded to her valiant
fighters exceed in numbers those won by the
forces of any other nation of like population
in this war. Added te this, she had the
distinction and honour of being the first of the
Commonwealth powers to range herself at
Britain's side when the present world-wide
conflict came. On the home front too, her
workers, her farmers, her industry and ber
citizens in general have shown the world, by
their high level of wartime production and
their personal sacrifices, what total war really
means.
Mr. Fraser, we honour you to-day net only
as the wartime leader of the New Zealand
people and a power in commonwealth affairs,
but for what your life and your example have
meant to us all. Truly it can be said, as it
has been said of many another Sceotsman, that

you are one more honour graduate of the
school of hard knocks and experience who has
made good in the broader field of public
affairs. Your preparation for the heavier
responsibilities involved in national leadership,
gained as it was in the ranks of the workers,
in the trade union movement and in the field
of journalism, gave you a foundation and
furnished an inspiration which cannot fail to
be of inestimable value.
We in this Parliament and country extend te
you and Mrs. Fraser a royal welcome to-day.
May you both experience a safe and pleasant
journey home, and may I suggest that you
carry with you the greetings and best wishes
of the Canadian people, who join with yours
in a fervent prayer that God may speed the
day when the war drums throb no longer and
the battle flags are furled in the parliament of
man, the federation of the world.
Mr. Fraser, I join with our Prime Minister
te make this nation's welcome unanimous.
Right Hon. PETER FRASER (P-rime Minister of New Zealand): Your Royal Highness,
Mr. Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Speaker of
the House of Commons, members of both
Houses of Parliament:
I wish to thank you most sincerely for the
welcome you have extended te me, first of
all as the representative of New Zealand. I
wish to thank Mr. Mackenzie King and Mr.
Graydon for the all too kind words about
myself, and for the friendly and hospitable
references to Mrs. Fraser and General Puttick
and our other friends who are with me.
I am gl'ad te have this oportunity of speaking under this historie roof, in this home of
the representative institutions of the oldest
and the largest British dominion. I thank
the speakers for their kind references to
New Zealand's part in the war effort and the
fight for humanity and freedom. But I also
know what your country has done. I know
its great contribution, and I wish to extend
to the Government and Parliament of Canada
my very sincere thanks for their co-operation,
and for the help they have invariably extended, when requested ;by New Zealand, in
the forme of munitions and other war requirements. We never ask in vain. I echo the
sentiments of your Prime Minister when
hè expressed the hope that this co-operation,
trust and good will may extend far beyond the
utmost boundaries of the war period and prevail in the future, contributing to the success
as well as the friendship of our two peoples.
I wish to express a word of appreciation of
the latest instance of that co-operation, comradeship and assistance. The Prime Minister
has announced that during the present week

SENATE
New Zealand and Canada have signed a
mutual aid agreement. This gives me an
opportunity to express appreciation of the
mutual aid principles that have been so carefully worked out by the Canadian Government. And I think you will join with me,
Mr. King, as all others will, in paying tribute
also to a great man, the President of the
United States. Of course I step aside from
politics, both in the United States and Canada; but irrespective of political parties or
leanings, we pay a sincere and heart-felt
tribute to President Roosevelt, as a true friend
of humanity, as the man who evolved the
plan under which a most generous contribution was made by a neutral nation to the
cause of those of us who were fighting for
freedom. History does not record any more
gencrous action on the part of a non-belligerent country toward countries which, as they
knew, were fighting the battle of humanity.
The principles embodied in the mutual aid
agreement just signed between Canada and
New Zealand are appreciated greatly, because
of the clarity with which they state that
mutual aid transactions carry with them no
hampering post-war financial liability. The
agreement is for mutual aid. I stress "mutual
aid," because while Canada with its great industry bas made a remarkable contribution
to the needs of the United Nations, and while
the agreement will extend aid to the country
of which I am privileged to be Prime Minister, New Zealand in turn, wherever and
whenever Canada can be helped by the use
of our resources, will gladly make them available. She will be proud to reciprodate within
the means at her disposal.
This war requires a common effort, in which
we all are pledged to join, individually and
collectively, to the utmost extent, in order to
achieve victory for all. In that pledge of unremitting effort we in New Zealand, with you
in Canada, hope to carry out to the fullest
degree the truc spirit of mutual aid.
May J mention another important contribution of this country toward the solidarity of
the United Nations? I refer to the good
neighbour policy which bas been in effect for
so many years with our friends in the United
States. If in the whole world there is one
example more striking than another of the
benefits of such a policy, it is to be found in
the St. Lawrence river, the Great Lakes, the
long miles of western prairie, on which there
is no fort and no gun, and where on both
sides of the line there is friendship and ceoperation. That example of two great countries on the North American continent, with
the understanding which in the past has been
established between them, has stood us in

good stead in our hour of trial, and its
influence has extended to all the United
Nations. Canada has given the lead.
I am not going into details with respect
to your war effort. You know about that.
The fact that 800,000 men and women have
been enrolled in the forces, and the further
fact that 2,000,000 persons are taking part in
the industrial war effort of this country, are
sufficiently eloquent and convincing testimony
as to the whole-hearted way in which Canada
has thrown itself, without reserve, into what
it knew was a struggle for the existence of all
that is decent in the life of mankind.
Canada, like New Zealand, had no doubt in
September, 1939, as to where it would stand.
Canada, like New Zealand, like South Africa
and Australia knew that our Mother Country
had gone to the limit-yes, had gone beyond
the limit-and had risked dangers in her
endeavour to convince people who would net
be convinced that the path of righteousness
was the path of safety and security for
everybody.
Our countries. had not piled up arms. They
had not invested their capital in huge, hidden
forces to be let loose in a flood of destruction
upon mankind. Whatever may be said as to
the wisdom of policies immediately preceding
the war, this at least will be counted to the
credit of the United Kingdom and the British
Commonwealth of Nations, that our feet were
turned into the paths of peace, and our
thoughts were toward benefiting our people
rather than dominating and trampling other
peoples underfoot.
Yeu have fought in every field of action.
Your men fought bravely against overwhelming
odds at Hong Kong. They took part gallantly
and brilliantly in the commando raids, particularly at Dieppe. They took a share, too,
in the hazardous and dangerous landings in
Sicily and Italy, and the other day they again
covered themselves with glory, being among
the foremost fighters for freedom in the landings in Normandy.
I am not going to deal with your amazing
industrial contribution-and I underline the
word "amazing," for the development of your
munitions industry, your factories and your
shipbuilding is indeed a surprising and gratifying story and something beyond what even
your most sanguine citizens had a right to
expect. J might mention, too, your contribution on the seas. and your help in convoying
ships of the United Nations, including New
Zealand ships carrying New Zealand food.
Again, your acceptance and your carrying out
of the air training scheme, with all its
complexities and perplexities, all these services
to our cause have placed the rest of us under

JIJNE 30, 1944
a debt of gratitude ta your Dominion, a debt
wbich we gladiy recognize. Canada can say,
equally with the UJnited Kingdom and with
other countries of tbe British dominions, tbat
she bas given ta the lirait of ber resources.
Na mare can be done.
One word of gratitude for the bospitality
extended ta aur New Zealand boys, of wbom
sucli generous recognition was made oniy a
few moments ago. We are very proud of
tbeni. 1 knew we liad every right ta be proud
of themn wben, the other day, I saw tbem in
aur division in Italy, right from the base
camps up ta the firing line wbere aur Maori
battalion, composed of representatives cf anc
of the flnest races an eartb, was figbting and
leading the attack against the enemy at Atina

and Sors. I saw that division working. I saw
its efficiency, its smootbness, its good spirit.
Its spirit was dernocratic, tao, for every
officer in that division bad come up tbrough
the ranks. It bas been a most successful
experiment in democracy.
It is a splendid figliting division-as no doubt
your divisions are also; indeed we know their
qualities--but we realize that aur divisions
ta be first class must also be efficient business
concerns. Tbere is the feeding of tbe men,
the organization, the buge transport cf a
modemn force; all these require business
capacities as well as saldierly qualities. Tbey
require efficiency and acumen as well as
courage. I was praud ta see the New
Zealand lads assume their respansibility and
carry on so weli, I 'have seen these lads,
as no doubt you have seen your awn, in tbe
A.rmy, the Air Farce and the Navy, rise ta
great responsibilities and carry on steadfastly
and efficiently.
It is mainly because of the widespread capacity ta take advantage of demacratie apportunities, educational and otlierwise, that aur
bays bave dane so well. As was'stated by
Mr. Mackenzie King, the boys af aur Army,
aur Air Farce and aur Navy have been fighting
wlie-rever there is *figlting ta lie done. Our
boys were in the desert, in Greece and in
Crete. Tliey fauglit in tliat terrible fight,
whicli was one of the warst experiences tliat
cauld be undergone, the battîs of Sidi Rezegli.
Tliey were there wlien Rommel wams sweeping

whicli lie said lie was gaing up onto, the
escarpment the next mnorning, that lis division
was going up "to meet Rommel liead on."
Tliey did, and tliey lield on for two days. Tliey
heid Rommel and lis army back, and the

289

8th Army was able ta re-formn at Alamein,
part of it in trenches dug by the New Zealanders months before. We are proud of
what the New Zealand troops did at Alamein;
we are proud of the contribution they made ta
saving the Middle East. We are proud of
their subsequent sweep, along with the rest of
the British and Dominion forces, right througb
to Tunis.
We are glad that to-day New Zealand troops
are fighting side by side witli your boys in
Itaiy. I saw some of your lads there, and -1
saw others in the United Kingdorn before the
invasion. I saw your second-in-command in
Italy, General Burns, and 1 was much impressed by hais abiiity, his grasp of the miiitary
situation, just as -I was impressed by General
Alexander and ail those who have contributed
ta the successes there.
Mr. Mackenzie King will agree witb me
wben I say that a splendid opportunity was
afforded to us when we visited the, United
Kingdom recently and met at the Prime Ministers' Conference ta study the strategy of the
United Nations. H1e wili agree that we saw

SENATE

Just a word about the future. We -are
fighting for great principles, and we can
testify that those principles have not been
dimmed, nor has the spirit of the people
diminished.
We hear a lot about Great
Britain just now, about the flying bombs, the
pilotless planes. We cannot underestimate
these, or treat them too lightly. But the
people of Britain under this new affliction are
standing as they stood at Dunkirk, when their
shores were open te invasion, and when the
words of Mr. Churchill, ringing out not only
through Britain but through the world, raised
an echo in every heart that beat for freedom,
when he said they would fight on the shores,
on the streets, on the hills and in the valleys.
That spirit is still there. After four and a
half-it is getting on te five-years of war,
the British people are still unflinching. That
can be said of all of them--from Their
Maj-esties the King and Queen, who have
stood constantly in the forefront in a manner
which has shown that they are truly associated with their people-right down through
all walks of life. That spirit is still unbroken,
still undimmed; it is destined te endure.
The British people feel as they did when
their armies were miraculously delivered from
France. They will be able to face up equally
well to any new inflictions. Even if many
may be killed, even if many may be injured,
even if many homes may be destroyed, there
is no trembling, no going back. There is
nothing but courage unsurpassed, a courage
rising to heights that have never been
exceeded.
The sacrifices made by our men and women
on land, in the air and on the sea and in
their homes when these have been attacked,
as in Britain, must not-I speak most seriously
and earnestly-be in vain.
We are fighting first for the principles set
forth in the various declarations of the United
Nations, and secondly, for the principles set
forth in the Atlantic Charter. We went te
war, net for Poland alone, but Poland was
the occasion.
We had seen Manchuria
turned into the puppet kingdom of Manchukuo; we had seen Abyssinia trampled
undor foot; we had seen Austria go next; we
liad seen the Rhineland taken; and Czechoslovakia overwhelmed. We knew there had
te be a stopping place; otherwise, the world
would 15e given ovor to tyranny, bloodshed
and cruelty. The stand was taken.
The
principles thon ennunciated have been stated
in my hcaring and that of your Prime Minister time and time again during our conferences. They are these: the United Kingdom
and the British Dominions are net out for
aggrandizement or territory, net out to con-

quer or dominate anybody whatsoever. They
are out to free mankind, and that means the
nations that have fought beside us. I would
refer particularly to France.
There were
many Frenclimen who pinned their faith to
the cross of Lorraine and did not bow the
knee in the house of Mammon. We have
had our own New Zealanders escaping from
Italy, through Switzerland, and then through
France to Spain. Frencli men and women
in all walks of life risked their lives cheerfully and willingly to nid them, even against
the protests of those whom they were succoring and helping to escape. The people who
have shown that spirit will rise triumphant
and their country will once more become a
great leader among the nations and a great
repository of human freedom.
These nations, according to the declarations
of the leading United Nations, must be fully
restored, and tlieir territories must be given
back, wherever they may be; because unless
our word is carried out, the very foundations
of faith will shake and fall, and there will
be no resting place for honour in the world.
France will be restored, as will Poland, Belgium, Holland, Norway, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia and Greece, and their overseas
territories.
I pause for a moment to thank the Government and the people of Canada for the
help they sont to the starving people of
Greece and Crete, for the wheat they have
sent over there by the thousands of tons and
for the assistance in other respects that they
are continuing to give. I would tender my
own and my country's appreciation, of the
splendid offer of assistance that came from
here when millions of people in Bengal were
sickening to death through the famine. Our
friends in Australia also assisted, as we also
did, according to our capacity. These are
gestures, deeds, actions that will cement the
world and bring us into greater friendship and
comradeship to face the problems of the
future.
The principles of the Atlantic Charter are
not platitudes, nor meant to be platitudes.
They are principles that must be honoured
because thousands have died for them. Your
boys, boys of New Zealand, South Africa,
Australia, India, the United States and all the
United Nations have given their lives that
the four freedoms-freedom of speech, frocdom of religion, freedom from fear and frocdom from want--may be established and the
masses of the people given greater opportunities than ever befo.re. Unless we strive
to carry out those principles we shall be
undoing in peace what has been won on the
battlefield.

JUNE 30, 1944
any years ago that there
I heard it said r%
were two kinds of enemies of progress: those
who stood still and looked backward, and those
who looked forward and stood still. After the
last war promises were made in various countries-I am not singling out any country or
people or government; I am stating a factpromises were made, and made in good faith.
They were made because it was believed, even
by those who made them, that they would be
carried out. But the years came and the years
went, and instead of. the promises being fulfilled, we had an overwhelming sense of
impossibility, the overpowering feeling that
they could not be fulfilled. So, instead of
enthusiasm on the part of the masses, particularly on the part of the young people who
with their generous hearts, having fought the
war, wanted to reach out to a better future,
we have had cynicism, disappointment and
despair. We must give faith to our young
people. We must tell them that as they have
fought, and as they will win the war, so must
they take their place and help to garner the
fruits of victory for all the peoples of the
world. If that is not done people will say
cynically: "These promises were all right when
the war was on, but you cannot do anything
about it now." If these promises are not
fulfilled there can be no doubt that the forces
of despair will develop into reaction; once
more the ground will be ripe for the seeds of
Nazism and fascism, and democracy's final
chance will be gone.
Conferences are being held to help the world
towards a better day-conferences on commercial questions, on monetary and financial
questions; on production of food-conferences
that do credit to the good heart of the
democracies; conferences to rehabilitate the
nations that have been trampled under foot
by Germany, Italy and Japan. These are
excellent, and I have no doubt that the requirements, in particular the necessities, of all the
respective countries, will be considered and
allowance made for them. But unless the
mass of the people feel that in return for their
efforts on land, on sea and in the air, in the
workshops and on the farms, on the docks and
in the mines, the vision of a new world is a
reality, that the leaders of nations were in
earnest when they preached fundamental
democracy, not only political democracy but
educational, economic and social democracy,
then I say there is a black outlook for the
world.
But there is no reason why the outlook
sh.ould be black. The British nations are more
solidified to-day, as they are more determined
and more enthusiastie for democracy, than
ever before. Here is a paradox which the
world outside the British Commonwealth finds

291

it difficult to understand, the paradox that
the freer we become, the closer we are together;
the more our constitutional bonds are relaxed,
the more closely we are held in bonds of
friendship; the greater the extent to which
government sovereignty is extended to the
various parts of the British Commonwealth
and Empire, the more truly one we are in
sentiment, in heart and in spirit-one in peace
as well as in war.
That is something which the nations do not
understand. The British peoples-and when I
say the British peoples I mean all the races
under the British flag-have responded to the
principles of self-government and of trust and
friendship extended by the Mother Country,
and have raised with their sons, around the
Mother Country, a wall of fire, and have forged
bonds as light as air, though as strong as steel,
bonds that are stronger now that ever before.
A fortnight ago I was with a friend in the
north of Scotland. He pointed out te me a
certain fort, and said there were one or two of
the kind in Scotland. There is no cement, no
lime, no concrete in the construction of that
fort. It is built of vitrified stones, the residue
of a huge bonfire, whose heat was so great
that it melted the stones and united them
into a solid mass. Well, my thoughts turned
from that to our Commonwealth. In the fires
of war, in the trials, the tribulations and the
dangers of war, we have been welded together
so that we are stronger than ever. We want
to extend that sense of solidarity, that sense
of security to the other nations.
I am going to mention only one country. I
devoutly hope, from the bottom of my heart,
that India will sec through all the senses of
injury or wrong of the past, through all the
mist of prejudice of one kind or another, to
the fact that no greater freedom can be
attained than that of a sovereign state in the
British Commonwealth. We all should like to
welcome India in as one of ourselves, for she
also is rendering a great service to humanity.
In conclusion, I would say that at this
moment conditions are different from those
that prevailed when I visited here in 1941.
Then all çwas black except for the light of
faith in the eyes and hearts of the British
people, not only in the United Kingdom but
everywhere. They are different again from
when I came here in 1942, nearly two years ago.
For then the United States had come in and
we were just beginning to ascend the ladder
of victory. To-day we have the enemy on the
run. He will stand and fight bravely and unscrupulously, and he will make use of all the
diabolical weapons that the ingenuity of the
human mind can bring into existence. But it
will aIl be in vain. All the powers of hell cannot prevail against those who believe that they

are fighting the battle of righteousness, of
truth, of justice and of freedom, and are
determined that the new world shall be a new
world in truth and in deed, as well as in spirit,
and that we all shall go forward-you in
Canada, we in New Zealand, the people of
the Motherland, and the people of all the
British
Dominions-marching shoulder ta
shoulder in war time, prepared to march
shoulder to shoulder afterwards toward that
new world that will be a new Jerusalem.
Mr. MACKENZIE KING: I will ask Their
Honours the Speaker of the Senate and the
Speaker of the House of Commons to express
our thanks to the Prime Minister of New
Zealand for the deeply moving address to
yhich we have just been privileged to listen.
(Translation):
Hon. THOMAS VIEN (Speaker of the
Senate): Your Royal Highness, Mr. Prime
Minister of New Zealand, I am very happy
to offer ycu in my mother tongue, one of
the tvo official languages in this country, the
heart-felt and sincere thanks of the Senate,
of the House of Commons and of the people
of Canada, whom you have honoured today
by your presence and by the moving address
you have just delivered.
In the Old World, Celts and Gauls take
pride in their common ancestry, in their close
affinity of mind and temperament.
Was
there not once a celebrated woman who was
at the same time Queen of Scotland and
Queen of France?
In Canada, after the Battle of the Plains
of Abraham, the Fraser Highlanders Regiment
was demobilized and a number of Frasers
settled in this country. One of them gave
his name to Fraserville, a lovely little town
on the shores of the Lower St. Lawrence. In
British Columbia, the Fraser Valley, one of
our most fertile plains, is watered by a river
which bears your name.
All of which
illustrates, Mr. Prime Minister, that the name
which you have made famous in the South
Pacifie is known and honoured everywhere in
Canada.
In our geography text-books, we first learned
of the two islands which comprise your
country and of the tremendous distances
separating it froam our own. But current
history soon taught us that New Zealand,
often cal-led the "Britain of the South Seas,"
although established barely a century ago, is
already renowned throughout the world for
the volume of ber external trade, for the
liberal and progressive character of ber social
legislation, for the heroism ber men have

shown on every battlefield during two world
wars, and for her magnificent contribution to
the United Nations' effort.
We know also the part you have played
personally in all these achievements, and
we therefore feel a deep satisfaction in thanking you for having visited our land and
inspired us by your eloquent message.
Yeu may tell your people that we are determined to fight by their side to the end,
until tie triumph of right over might is
secured. With you we pray God to bless our
armed forces and to grant us promptly a
decisive victory and a durable peace.
Hon. JAMES ALLISON GLEN (Speaker of
the House of Commons): Mr. Prime MJinister,
to-day we welcome on the floor of the
Canadian House of Commons one of the
Prime Ministers of a great fraternity which ewa
call the British Commonwealth of Nations,
in the person of the Right Honourable Peter
Fraser, Prime Minister of New Zealand.
The bearer of such a name is always assured
of a welcome in Canada; for within our land
we treasure the Fraser river-discovered probably by one of bis ancestors, but certainly by
one of the Clan-whose rugged shores and
tumbling waters will remind our guest of the
rivers and streams of his own native
Ross-shire.
In the incidents of life the course of one's
career is directed by powers beyond one's
control; and you, Sir, might have becone a
citizen of Canada when you left your native
land in 1910. But we do net begrudge your
choice, for what we in Canada lost, New
Zealand gained; and I think you will agree
with me it is well that all countries should
have a leaven of Scots in their midst. This
little expression of insular pride will, I hope,
be forgiven me. Speaking to a brother Scot,
at our own fireside, I cannot refrain from a
personal touch, and I am sure it will not
destroy that self-effacing modesty so characteristic of our race.
Sir, it is one of the glories of the common
heritage of New Zealand and Canada that in
our House of Commons yeu can, in expressive
language, voice with receptive understanding
those ideas and principles whicb you set forth
so clearly in London, the seat of the Commonwealth and Empire, during the recent Conference of the British Prime Ministers. Your
position there, as here, and your qualities so
universally recognized in New Zealand, have
received the acclaim of the Empire, and
Canada takes this opportune moment ta congratulate yen, and through you New Zealand,
on the magnificent contribution which your
men and women have made in this war.

292

JUNE 30, 1944
We have flot had that intimate association
with your Army we would degire, but we do
know of their exploits in every theatre of war,
and it must neyer be forgotten that in that
moment of extreme peril to our nations, when
the daring and heroic adventure to save
Oreece was determined upon, New Zealand
troops fired the first shot in the conflict-a
glorious page in your country's history.
But if we know flot your Army intimately,
we do know your airmen. That they are
typical of your countrymen we have no doubt;
and I can say to you, Sir, with, I hope,
convincing sincerity, that their conduet while
in this country and their achievements overseas make us proud to cali themn kinsmen.
We are delighted to have you with us. We
thank you for your address, and I wish you
would convey to your country the assurance
that Canada's door will always be on the latch
to. you and ail your colleagues and citizens.
I urge you, do flot stay away too long. In
the happier days which we now envisage as
being so near, Jet us in Canada and you in
New Zealand demonstrate to the world that
'"though mounitains divide us, and the waste
of seas," we are bound by ties which nothing
can break.

VISIT OF GENERAL DE GAULLE
MOTION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
on occasions like the visit to our capital of
the Right Honourable Winston Churchill,
Prime Minister of Great Britain, of President
Roosevelt, and of other distinguished persons,
it lias been the practice to incorporate in the
Official Report of Senate Debates the addresses
then delivered. Last week an address was
delivered on Parliament Hill by General
Charles de Gaulle, and I would move that
his address, and the others delivered on the
same occasion, be included in an appendix to
the Official Report of the Debates of the
Senate, to form part of the permanent records
of this House.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?

The motion was agreed to.
CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. IL. KING moved the second .reading
of Bill 139, an Act to amend the Criminal
Code.
He said: Honourable senators, I would move
the second reading of this Bill, and in so
doing would state that my honourable friend
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) has
been good enough to indicate that he will
explain the purport of the amendments contained in the Bill.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, net mucl is needed in the way of explanation of this Bill. The first two sections
change the penalties provided in sections 364
and 365 of the Criminal Code. The offence
dealt with in section 364 is the theft of a post
letter bag or a post letter or any chattel,
money or valuable security from a post letter,
and the maximum penalty is life imprisonHon. Mr. KING.

ment. No change is made in that. But the
section as it now stands provides for a minimum penalty of three years imprisonment. The
Minister of Justice lias suggested that this
should be changed because it has been found
difficult to obtain convictions. I should rather
put it on the broader ground that in matters
of that kind the discretion as to a minimum
sentence should bc left with the trial judge,
who is familiar with all the circumstances, and
the fact that juries or even judges have hesitated to convict with that minimum penalty in
the section is merely an indication of the
reason why the trial judge should have the discretion as to the minimum sentence.
There is a similar reason for the amendment to section 365. The maximum penalty
provided there is seven years, with a minimum
of thrce years. The amendment would simply
eliminate that minimum penalty and leave it
to the discretion of the trial judge.
The third section of the Bill increases certain penalties provided for in section 436 of
the Code, which deals with a matter that
to-day is of very great import. The section as
amended would read:
Every person is guilty of au indictable offence
and liable to imîpri soimen t foi

sev-en yars, or

to a file not exceeding fifty thousand dollars,
or to both imiprisoinment and file ewho kinowingly

o13iheer or
servant of His Majesty, any defecttive naval.
military.

stores of

any

kiiid or

deseriptioii. . . .
Up to the present time the maximxuim penalty
for that very serious offence lias been only
two years imprisonment and a fine of $5,000.
Sometimes, in profiteering offences of the kind
dealt with in that section, the most effective
penalty is one that will hit the guilty person
in his pocket.
As to the object of the last section of the
Bill I shall have to refer to the remarks made
by the Minister of Justice, for I au not
faniliar with the facts. Heretofore appeals
from summary convictions in the province of
Quebec have been taken to the Court of King's
Benc, and the Minister of Justice said it has
been found that in certain parts of the province there have been long periods of time when
this court held no sittings. It is therefore
suggested that the jurisdiction for the hearing
of appeals be transferred to the Superior Court.
I understand this amendment meets the wishes
of the legal profession and of others interested. The Department of Justice lias suggested an amendment which would qualify this
last section, and I believe the honourable
leader (Hon. Mr. King) intends to move, after

JULY 18, 1944
second reading, that the Bill be referred to an
appropriate committee, where the amendment
can be considered.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, it
occurs to me that the new money penalty in
section 436 is not proportionate to the
imprisonment penalty. Up to this time the
maximum imprisonment penalty has been two
years, which the amendment raises to seven
years, but the maximum money penalty of
$5,000 is to be raised to $50,000. There does
not seem to be any proportion between the
two.
It also occurs to me that as a rule the
increasing of a penalty does net deter people
from crime. I think in nearly all cases those
who commit crimes know nothing about the
penalty they may incur.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I would point out to
my honourable friend that the minimum
penalty has net been increased.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: What I am coming to
is simply this, that if a penalty is made too
high it defeats its own object. From his
experience as a lawyer my honourable friend
knows very well that if a person appears
before a jury charged with a crime for which
the penalty is high, the jury will usually, if
at all possible, bring in a verdict of acquittal.
My experience is that it is much more difficult
to get a conviction for offences punishable by
high penalties than in cases where possible
penalties are less severe. I should have much
preferred to leave the section as it is now;
but if the Department of Justice thinks it is
necessary to increase the penalties to the
degree provided for by this Bill, I have no
objection.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the Bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, June
29, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. David:
That this House, acknowledging the teaching
of history as one of the fundamentals of
patriotism in every country, and anxious to
develop a better and more understanding Canadian patriotism, expresses the wish that at the

Hon. ARTHUR MARCOTTE: Honourable
senators, there is no doubt that when the

presented his resolution for our consideration,
he expected both praise and criticism, but
there is also no doubt that be did not expect
the sensational development and furore whichthe discussion bas created outside of this.
Chamber.
We are living in difficult days. Passions are
aroused. What should have been a strictly
academic and normal discussion of an important matter has become the basis of heated'
arguments. Politics, and politics of a very
base and degrading nature, have become
mixed with this question of history teaching,
so much so that to-day it is difficult to discuss.

bitter controversies.
campaign in the province of Quebec makes it
all the more necessary to take care not to add
fuel to the fires now burning.
Honourable senators, I shall try to give you
some arguments in favour of the resolution,
but as they will be based on statements made
in the past you will know that these arguments
are not born of the present discussion.
The resolution is based on two facts acceptable and accepted by all: the need of unity
in our country, and the teaching of history asone fundamental of patriotism in any country.
Then comes the expression of a wish for thepreparation of a text-book of Canadian history
acceptable in every school in the country.
Do we need unity in Canada? The answer
from every citizen is an emphatic "Yes."
There is no need to prove the fact. Is history
one of the fundamientals of patriotismanother word for unity-in any country? That
it is a fundamental is also a fact admitted by
every one, with one proviso, and one proviso
only: that history shall be truc and impartial.
There should, then, be no quarrel on the tw,
bases of the resolution.
What about the expressed wish that there
should be a Canadian history textbook
acceptable in every school in Canada? Is its
realization possible? If possible, is it advisable? If advisable, is it necessary and should
it be brought about? It seems to me that any
and all of these elements can be discussed'
and without creatingwithout prejudice
animosity.

SENATE
First of all, what is history? The definition
in the French dictionary by Larousse, a world
authority, is as follows:
Recital of actions, facts, events, worthy of
mensory chronologically co-ordinated.
According to the school of scientifie historians, history is "an impartial reconstruction
cf the past, based on documents, that is to
say, on the definite evidence of the thoughts
and deeds of those who preceded us."
Larousse proceeds further:
The essential wxeapon of the historical method
is analysis; each document must be analyzed
to fix its place in the synthesis where history
is leading to.
Because of the fact that history is a science,
the historian cannot succeed in his study
except on the condition that he be free from
any preconceived idea or parti-pris. Hence
the difficulty of contemporary history: firstly,
on the point of sources, as some of them escape
our knowledge; secondly, on account of our
criticism, which our political passion prevents
from being impartial.
History has to be impartial. On this point,
I wish to cite from an open letter written by
Mr. Emile Vaillancourt, of Montreal, a wellknown writer on Canadian history. Yeu may
not agree with everything published by him,
but you have to give him credit for his sincerity and honesty of purpose. As to the
necessity that history be impartial, Mr.
Vaillancourt writes:
On this point, two major principles were laid
down by the late Pope Leo XIII: the first law
of history is to tell no lie; the second, to say
the whole truth without any fear whatsoever.
Mr. Vaillancourt continues:
About the same time the eminent Pontiff
wrote to a well-known English Benedictine
monk. Cardinal Gasquet: "Publish of the
Vatican Archives anything of historical interest,
no meatter wxhether it casts credit or discredit
on the Churci authorities."
WVe need facts, not lies; we need the whole
truth. Who can reasonably object to this
statement ?
Since there is such controversy there must
be some other source of trouble. This trouble
arises fron our confusing history with the
philosophy of history. Before I discuss this
point I wish to cite a lesson from one of the
great phiilosophters of the past. I refer to that
wise man of China, Confucius, who lived
hundreds of years before Christian times. This
was the formula he preached te his disciples:
In foregone years the princes, in order to
bring out the natural virtues in the hearts of
all men, applied themselves to well govern their
principalities. To do that they first secured
good order in their families. To secure that
good order they strove to regulate the emotions
of their hearts. By so regulating their emotions
they perfected their will. By perfecting their
will they were developing their knowledge.
Hon. Mir

MARCOTTE.

Knowledge is developed by a scrutiny of the
value of things. Once this scrutiny is made,
knowledge reaches its highest degree. Then the
will is perfect, the emotions are well controlled,
and man becomes perfect.
After correcting
one's self one corrects his family. Se good
order reigning in the family, the principalities
are well governed and the country enjoys peace.
This formula is twenty-five centuries old,
and a better one has yet to be found. To
relate facts, events, lives of men, their deedsthat is history. To scrutinize things, events,
the lives of men, their deeds, to find the
causes and to fix the results-that is the
philosophy of history.
History can be made true, impartial; but
philosop.hy of history is not only of the
greatest difficulty but also of the highest
importance. Let me illustrate this by just
one fact. Canada became an English possession in 1763. No one will question that fact.
But then cormes the philosophy of that historie
fact. In his address to the Canadian Club,
in the city of Quebec in 1877, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, commenting on that fact, said:
Actually we French Canadians are a conquered race. It is a truth sad to state, but,
after all, it is the truîth.
I disagree and say that though our country
was conquered, we were not conquered as a
race, because we were guaranteed all the
characteristics of our race. For my further
reasons for that difference of opinion I would
refer honourable members to my address in
this Chamber on the 25th of March, 1942.
His Grace Monseigneur Plessis, Bishop of
Quebec, while lie was still Reverend Abbé
Plessis, wrote that the passing of Canada from
French rule to English domination had been
a blessing, a providential act. You have only
to read what Canon Lionel Groulx writes on
the same subject to find that these 'two priests
do net agree on the point. The writings of
Abbé Maheux and Canon Groulx disclose
similar differences in their philosophy of these
historie facts.
These differencës of interpretation are not
peculiar to Canadian historians. Take, for instance, the Norman conquest of England. You
have only to read the work of Thierry, a great
French historian, or of Palgrave, a noted
English historian, or of Freeman, another
eminent British historian, to find proof of my
statement. The three of them, writing on the
same facts, are far from being in agreement,
and yet they are recognized as honest
historians.
I could cite fact after fact in our history in
regard to which similar differences of opinion
would be found. But I am just confining myself to this one main fact in order te make
my point that the greatest difficulty lies in
commenting on a given historical fact.

JULY 18, 1944
The honourable mover of this resolution bas
in some quarters been severely criticized for
expressing his wish for a uniform text book of
Canadian history. Is this wish so very new?
In his letter, Mr. Vaillancourt writes that on
the 25th of May, 1938, while addressing the
Montreal Rotary Club menibers at the Windsor Hotel, he said:
Do you not think it is about time te educate
our ehildren properly, and maybe their parents,
in Canadian History, and that the Federal
Parliament, if it sincerely desires to create
Canadian unity, might name a committee of
competent historians of both languages, entrusted
with the duty of writing and publishing an
authentie history of Canada, acceptable to both
races?
He added:
Not long before bis death Lord Tweedsmuir
was having luncheon at my home in Outremont.

I asked him what book he had in preparation?
"A History of Canada acceptable to both 'races,"
was bis answer.
In November, 1940, when addressing the
members of Le Club Canadien, in Montreal, I
said:
My sojourn of many years among an English
population, and the struggles in which I have
.participated to help and preserve for our
French Canadians the use of our language, have
caused me to take a deep interest in the
intellectual, moral and, in the wide sense of
the word, political development of FrenchCanadian youth of the Province of Quebec. I
have told you before and I repeat it now: What
you are learning here, what you do, say, write,
even what you think, are of interest to us
French Canadians outside of Quebec, because
we thrive on it, -and sometimes-shall I say?we suffer from it."
Thé direction given to our young people must
be towards wider horizons. The comprohension
of a Canadian nationality must not be, for our
people, confined within the limits of the Province of Quebec. Will it always be necessary
for His Eminence the Cardinal to go to the
province of New Brunswick, for example, to
give assurance that the province of Quebec does
not wish separation -from the rest of Can-ad-a?
Sbould we not remember there is not a
country in the world enjoying a measure of
liberty greater than that which we enjoy in
this province of Quebec? It seems to me the
truth might well be inculcated that it is only
under British regime that conquered peoples
may not only aspire to liberty but also become
sister nations of their conquerors. We who are
descended from one heroic race could without
hesitation proclaim ourselves proud to be the
partners of another race-a race which in these
terrible days gives an example of heroism comparable to anything known in history.
I also remarked in this Chamber in
1942 and I repeat it now in reference to statements by certain persons that this is England's
war and is none of our business:
I always hear that statement with sorrow
and pity: with sorrow because it proves the
ignorance of those people; with pity, because

they are to be forgiven as not knowing any
better. And this ignorance is not their fault.
Their education is not of their making: it is
given to them and it is faulty.
You should not be surprised, honourable
senators, if a large part of our population
ignores what- happened in Canada under the
Immigration in the last
French Regime.
sixty years has brought into our country
hundreds of thousands of people who had
passed school age and had neither the time
nor the inclination to study the past of
Canada. Coming to a British country where
the majority were English, they could not
understand why French-Canadians were enjoying special rights.
But it is different with the young generation
of to-day and of to-morrow. Not only is it
the duty of our young people to attend
school and learn the history of Canada as
part of their education, but it is also their
right to be taught true and impartial history.
Who need fear the truth about the discovery,
the pioneering and the development of
Certainly not French-Canadians.
Canada?
We French-Canad.ians have the right to be
proud of the deeds of our forefathers, before

an English
Canada became
Pioneers they were; discoverers they were;
good soldiers they were; missionaries and
martyrs they were. After Canada came under
English rule they proved themselves, under
the guidance of their religious and civil
leaders, to be good citizens, faithful to their
oath of allegiance. They proved it with their
deeds; they signed it with their blood. They
helped to save Canada for England when it
was necessary to do so. Then why the fear
of true and impartial history? The trouble
is not about the facts, but about the interpretation of these facts, their causes and
their results.
Is it possible to have such a book as outlined in the resolution? Certainly, if you
stick to the truth, the whole truth, without
fear. The resolution does not encroach on
the constitutional rights of the provinces in
matters of education. In very plain terms
it says that the delegates representing the
nine provinces may be pleased to appoint a
committee. Then the provinces may agree
on that just the same as they have the right
to agree on any other matters under their
jurisdiction. If there is no agreement, nothing will be done. If there is an agreement to
appoint the proposed committee and the work
is done but the book is not agreeable to any
one of the provinces, nothing will come out
of it. Therefore I fail to see any objection
to such a study.
But, as I have stated before, no matter
if such a text-book be written and used,
there will always remain what is yet more

SENATE
important; the interpretation of the facts,
the events, the lives of men, their deeds, their
thoughts, their projecis. It becomes a matter
of impartiality not only in the relation of
facts, but in the philosophy of those facts. It
becomes a matter of good will, of good faith.
It is then a matter of education, of proper
guidance, to secure unity in our country,
to create a sound Canadian patriotism.
In a previous address in this Chamber, I
said that to me it appeared as a miracle that
France would be saved by the sacrifices, the
toil, the courage and the perseverance of ber
enemy of centuries-England. True, not of
England alone, as ail the Allied Nations are
joining in the common ,effort to-day.
But
-we must remember that in June, 1940, England
alone, with the Dominions and colonies, under
the inspiration of the indomitable Ohurchhill, stood to fight to the death a conquering
Germany.
And I hope that before many
months the same Churchill who wen't to
Bordeaux in 1940 to urge France to stand
up, but was rebuffed by certain politicians.
will be able to return to Paris with de Gaulle
at his side-the man we salted lhere a few
days ago-the French General who did
not quit. who said that France had lost the
battle but not the war. and in his own
inimitable words will tell France: "I have
kept my pledge. I bring you liberty. France
is again a free nation, free to take ber rightful
place beside the great nations of the world;
free to co-operate not only to win the war
but to win aiso a lasting peace for the world."
Honourable senators, when I read the history of Canada's two mother countries
England and France, fighting ail over
the world against each ether for centuries,
while discovering, pioneering, developing new
worlds to bring them civilization and Christianity, and then see them united in a joint
effort to save to the world that same civilization, that same Christianity, and this for the
second time in a quarter of a century, I wonder
why the sons and descendents of these two
great peoples in Canada cannot be more
united. Surely there have been in the past.
as there are in present times, enough heroic
deeds by these two nations to make their
sons proud of their ancestry.
When to-day history is written on that
same soil of France by our own Canadian
soldiers, English and French speaking; written
in their blood, when they fight and die
side by side for a common cause dear to
every one of us, the lesson should be learned
by ail here.
On the 24th of June last, on Sherbrooke
street, Montreal, a long parade of thousands
of French Canadians, with allegorical chariots,
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

took place in celebration of Saint Jean Baptiste day. On the same evening you could
hear on the radio, from a small village in
Normandy, the words of a French priest
speaking to French-Canadian soldiers. With
tears in his voice and gratitude in his heart,
he thanked them for coming to the rescue of
the old mother country. It was Saint Jean
Baptiste day there also. Again thousands of
French-Canadians
were present, and the
chariots were jeeps, tanks, self-propelled guns,
planes-all of Canadian make-brought there
to free France. I wonder, honourable senators,
which of the two celebrations went further
toward bringing harmony here. Is this not
enough to counteract certain elucubrations,
certain movements by irresponsible youths,
which, if they are not to be feared perhaps,
are certainly to be deeply deplored?
Last week, on the l4th of July, the Bastille
day-a memorable day in France-was celebrated at the village of Thaon in Normandy.
I cite in part a wireless dispatch from L. S. B.
Shapiro, the correspondent of the Montreal
Gazette. It is as follows:
Facing the curé, were Thaon's children, many
of them five and six years of age, wearing their
Sunday best and wide-eyed with curiosity.
Behind the children stood Canadian and French
soldiers.
The priest said in part: "Frenchmen, do you
understand your privileges?
Do you realize
you are free men once more? It is four years
sice you saw the flag, four long harrowinîg

years. You see it now, fluttering in the wind
beneath the open sky."
His voice softened as lie turned to the
ehildren.
"Look at your flag," he imiplored
them. "Look at it and know it. Many of you
children have never seen it flying free in the
wind.

Lool

You are free at last, dear p.arishioners and

Centuries ago, a legion of Norman soldiers
left the shores of France, invaded England,
conquered it, and remained there, to mix with
their enemies of earlier days and make together the great English people of the present.
To-day you sec English soldiers, together with
the descendants of French people, invading
Normandy, te free not only France but the
world from the shackles of moral and physical
slavery. Should that lesson go for naught?

APPENDIX
GENERAL CHARLES DE GAULLE
ADDIRESS TO MEMBERS 0F THE SENATE AND 0F THE HOUSE 0F COMMONS AND THE
GENERAL PUBLIC, ON PARLIAMENT HILL, OTTAWA, JULY 11, 1944.

The welcome ta General de Gaulle was
tendered, in English, by the Right Honourable
W. L. Mackenzie King, Prime Minister of
Canada, and, in French, by the Honaurable
Louis S. St. Laurent, Minister of Justice.
Right Hon. W. L. MACKENZIE KING
(Prime Minister of Canada): Your Excellency,
Yaur Royal Highness, ladies and gentlemen:
We are met this morning ta extend ta
Geneýral Charles de Gaulle a hearty welcome
ta Canada.

To yau, General de Gaulle, as a French
saldier, as a leader in the fight for world freedam, and as representing the uncanquerable
spirit of France, 1 arn preud ta offer this
welcome in the namne of tIse Government and
the people of Canada.
Here, in the presence of the representative
of the Crown, are assembled before you the
representatives in Parliament of the Canadian
people. Here also are assembled residents of
our capital city. Ail are proud ta hanour the
man who in the darkest days of this war rallied
the forces of Free France, and who ta-day is
the symbol of the determination of the French
nation ta restare its freedoa and greatness.
In welcoming Generai de Gaulle ta aur
country, I can speak far the whole af Canada.
In no country has the sympathy for France
in bier agony been deeper than in aur awn;
in nane have the prayers for her liberatian
been mare fervent; in none has the growth
of French resistance been watched with greater
pride and admiration.
For the vîsit ta Canada af General de Gaulle,
the hour couid nat have been mare happily
chosen. At this moment French and Canadian soldiers are fighting side by side in Italy.
On the battle-fieids of Narmandy, Canadian
fighting men farmn part of the great ailied
striking force. Amidst these scenes of canfliet

and triumph there has been a proud renewal
of the historic association between the people
of France and Canada.
General de Gaulle cames ta us fresh from his
visit ta Normandy. What emotion he must
have feit as hie set foot once more on the soul
of France! What a thrill of pride was feit
in many Canadian homes when we learned
that the first troops he met in Normandy were
men of Canada's army 1 It was from Normandy that the first Canadians came to make
a new home and faund a new natian in the
new wurld. We rejoice that Canada's fighting
men are helping to-day ta free the ancestral
home of sa many of our people.
France is not only the ancestral home of
many Canadians; in France are many shrines
sacred to ail Canadians. The Somme, Arras,
Cambrai, Vimy, and a host of scenes of battle
a generatian ago, are namnes that will live farever in aur history. In fighting for the liberatien of France, Canada is fighting for what is
truly a part of herself.
Within France a living spirit of resistance bas
revealed itself in countless acts af heroism and
sacrifice. Behjnd the enemy's uines the French
resistance has been undermining German
power. Since the landings in Normandy underground forces have been quick ta strike. On
all sides there is evidence that in the hearts
of the French people there stili burns an
unquenchable fire of "liberty, equality and
fraternity" which no dishanourable betrayal
within, ar fiendish tortures fram without, have
been able ta extinguish.
In the revival af French military power,
inside and outside France, General de Gaulle's
raie hias been of incomparable impartance.
In these years of war we in Canada have
sought ta do aur part ta keep alive the Rlame
of French civilization. We have cantinued ta

300

cherish our admiration for France and all she
has meant to freedom. We have never lost
our faith that the greatness of France would
be restored. The people of Canada are prend
to have their part in the memorable events in
which the liberation of France is being
accomplished.
In thanking yen for your visit and in wishing you all that is best in your valorous leadership, I ask you, General de Gaulle, to take
back with you an assurance from the Canadian
people to the people of France. Tell them that
all Canada is united in support of the determination of the Allied nations te drive the
enemy frem the soil of France. Tell them we
are net less united in the determination to
destroy the power of Germany to terrorize
Europe, and to end, once and for all, Germany's capacity to disturb the peace of the
world. Tell them that we are with them heart
and soul in these days of suffering and sacrifice; and tell them to fight on, for we are
confident the day is drawing near when we
shall be sharing with them their joys and
triumphs in the supreme hour of victory.
Hon. LOUIS S. ST-LAURENT (Minister
of Justice) (Translation):
Your Excellency,
Your Royal Highness, ladies and gentlemen:
We are met this morning to extend to Generai
Charles de Gaule a hearty welcome to Canada. I am proud to associate myself with the
right honourable Prime Minister to extend
to you, General de Gaulle, a hearty welcome
in the naine of the government and people of
Canada.
We welcome in you the great
Frenchman who defends his country, a leader
in the fight for world freedom, and a representative of the unconquerable spirit of France.
Here, in the prosence of the representative
of the crown, are assembled before you the
representatives in parliament of the Canadian
people. Here also are assembled residents of
our capital city. All are proud to honour the
man who in the darkest days of this war rallied
the forces of Free France, and who to-day is
the symbol of the determination of the French
nation to restore its freedom and greatness.
In welcoming General de Gaulle to our
country, I can speak for the whole of Canada.
In no country has the sympathy for France
in her agony been deeper than in our own;
in none have the prayers for her liberation
been more fervent; in none lias the growtih
of French resistance been watceld with greater
pride and admiration.
For the visit to Canada of General <le Gaulle,
the heur could net have been more happily
chosen. At this moment, French and Canadian soldiers are fighting side by side in Italy.
On the battle fields of Normandy, Canadian

fighting men form part of the great allied
striking force. Amidst these scenes of conflict
and triumph there lias been a proud renewal
of the historie association between the people
of France and Canada.
General de Gaulle comes to us fresh fron his

visit to Normandy. What emotions he must
have felt as ho set foot once more on the soil
of France! What a thrill of pride was felt
in many Canadian homes when we learned
that the first troops ho met in Normandy were
men of Canada's army! It was from Normandy that the first Canadians came to make
a new home and found a new nation in the
new world. We rejoice that Canadai's fighting
men are helping to-day to free the ancestral
home of so many of our people.
France is not only the ancestral home of
many Canadians; in France are many shrines
sacred to all Canadians. The Somme Arras,
Cambrai, Vimy, and a hest of scenes of battle
a generation ago, are names that will live forever in our history. In fighting for the liberation of France, Canada is fighting for what is
truly part of herself.
Within Frence a living spirit of resistance lias
revealed itself in countiess acts of heroism and
sacrifice. Behind the enemy's lines the French
resistance lias been undermining German
power. Since the landings in Normandy, underground forces have been quick to strike. On
all sides there is rvidence that in the hearts
of the French people there still burns un
unquenchable fire of "liberty, cquality and
fraternity" whiich no dishonourable betraval
within, or fiendish tortures from without, have
been able to extinguish.
In the revival of French military power,
inside and outside France, General de Gaulle's
role lias been of incomparable importance.
In these years of war, we in Canada have
sought to do our part to keep alive the flaie
of French civilization. We have continued to
cherish our admiration for France and all she
has meant to freedom. We have nover lost
our faith that the greatness of France would
be restored. The people of Canada are proud
to have their part in the memorable events in
which the liberation of France is being
accomplished.
In thanking you for your visit and in wishing you ail that is best in your valorius leadership, J ask yen, General de Gaulle, to take
back with you an assurance from the Canadian
people to the people of France. Tell them that
all Canada is united in support of the determsination of the allied nations to drive the
enemy from the soil of France. Tell thema we
are not less united in the determination to
destroy the power of Germany to terrorize
Europe, and to end, once and for all, Ger-

JULY 18, 1944
many's capacity to disturb the peace of the
worid. Tell them that we are wjth themi heart
and soul in these days of suffering and sacrifice; but. tell them to fight on, for we are
confidant the day is drawing near when wc
shall be sharing with them the joys and
triumplis in the supreme heur of victory.
(Translation):
General de GAULLE: The mnoving welcome
that you have accarded me seems to, corne
from a double inspiration. No doubt yen wish
first. of ail to testify to the comforting so ïdarity which unites in the world, across frontiers, oceans and continents, the men who fight
toget-her for liberty. No doubt you bave aiso
,judged it weii to show here that France bas
flot been, is not and neyer will be forgotten.
Well, gentlemen, I wish te, say for France, that
Canada is a dearer friend than ever.
Certainly the past accounts for a great part
of this unusual sympathy. On the one hand
your people, who have neyer been opposed to
ours in any historical event, whose men have
always opened their minds and their hearts
ta the ideas and sentiments which have oievated the French spirit, and in the veins of many
of whom flows blood which has corne from
France: on the other hand my country, which
rernembers having been the first to .carry
Christian and European civilization to this immnense iand; my country, which hias neyer
ceased to follow and admire the magnificent
efforts of your ancestars and of your kinsmen
in their struggle to bring about prosperity
tbrough the development of the natural resources of the country and to deveiop the minds
of the people inteilectually, spiritually and
morally in order to create a state of full consciousness of its own valour and in ioyalty to
the Commonwealth of which it is a parti
Your people and my country! May powerful
bonds link them throughout time.
Nothing seemed more natural ta oId France
than ta sce Canadian soldiers struggling on
her soil for the same. cause in the preceding
world war and ta bury reverently in her soul
those wbose heraic memory is sy.mbolized by
Vimy.
And let me say here that nothing has
seemed more moving ta the man wba has the
hanaur ta speak ta y-ou thanl ta have seen the
Canadian Corps engaged an the hanks of the
Liri River in Italy recently side by side witb
the French army, and ta find firÉt upon the

(Text) :
But, ladies and gentlemen, if the past holds
so many special reasons whiy France and Canada shouid understand one another, I may
say confidentiy that the present has added a
great many more! It, is in a time of crisis
that friendship proves itself. Weli, during these
difficuit years France bas passed through many
trying days. Submerged by the enemy, stuuined by the disaster, betrayed or deceived by
those who, having seized the State, did not,
use either their power or their reputation except te plunge it and maintain it in shame
of debasement, France might for a short time
have presented ta malevoient or superficiai
observers the appearance of one of those
falîs from which a nation does not rise when
she bas accepted it. But others, better informed because they werc more favourable,
quickiy realized that my country, in the depths
of its misery, rcfused te give up. These understood very soon that the determination, the
hope, the spirit of the French people remained fimiy at the side of those who refused to
iower the flag, and who at ail costs intended
te maintain their country in the camp of
liberty.
,
I shahl net try te describe what such an
enterprise has cost in effort, lasses, often bitter
disappointments, for the French who in every
domain, wbether it be in the interior of
France or outside the country, have carried an
this fierce struggle for independence and for
national unity.
But it is my duty te say what comfort and
support they bave found in Canada, in its
Gevernment and in its people. The French
aviators whom you have traîned here; the
French forces whom you have helped te armr;
the French prisoners whom you have fed and
ciathed; above ail, perhaps, the innumerabia
French who, in their suffering and their fight,
heard the echo of Canadian sympathy, are a
witness te this fact.
(Translation):
Te-dýay France is standing upright and
united. If the living friendship which she bas
feund everywhere in Canada bas contributed
ta sustain and lift my country during ber
trials and thus bas matenialiy and moraliy
strengthened the coalition of free peoples
against their bitter enemies, ta-day it becomes
a very important factor in the task of reorganizing the world which will came eut of tbis
terrible war. At present, victory flushes the
horizon. We feel in the hearts of the peoples
who have united te assure the triumph of
right and liberty, a tremendaus aspiration
towards a better future. For, if se many men
and women in a free worid bave voiuntarily

suffered, fought, worked, if so many good anI
brave soldiers have died without a imurmur,
if so many towns and villages bave offered
themselves up in sacrifice for our common
salvation; it would not be tolerable, it would
nut even be possible, that froin so much death,
sacrifice and ruin a greater and better humainity should not energe.
But, in a world where all intercourse lias
unceasingly tightened the interdependence of
nations and at the same tine tiat of individuals, how is it possible t coneixe hiuman progress if not within a systi of real international co-operation? For the same rcasons
that a single war, common to all, covers the
whole of our earth, which lias becone so
small, the peace we
iake mu-t bc a
single peace, common to all. For the same
reasons thai
what is thouglt, produced,
manufactured anywhere in the world has
inevitable consequences upon the destiiiy of
the niost obscure
combatant, to-niorrow
the condition of man in the world, wliatever
his race, country or activity, will depend in
some mtasure upon what will be achieved
anywhiere
in
political,
economic,
social
spiritual, intellectual and moral spieres. In
other words, it is impossible to imagine either
assured secuîrity or solid and lasting progress
for any nation or any individual vnless ail
nations among thiemselves, or within each
nation all citizens among theiselves, arc willing to consent te work together in normal
brotherhood.
France, emerging step by step from lier
temporary misfortunes, France, enilightened by
ber suffering, France, intending no longer te
divide, but to unite her passion for progress
and traditional wisdom, states herself ready to
play ber full part in this universal task. She
is certain to find at ber side and in agreement
with ber all the peoples who know ber welland first among them she will find Canada.

WAR SERVICE ELECTORS AND PRISONERS OF WAR VOTING BILL
CONCURRENCE IN COMMONS AMENDMENTS

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendment made by the House of Commons te Bill 135, an Act to provide regulations

enabling Canadian war service electors te exercise their franchise, and Canadian prisoners of
war to vote by proxy, at any general election
held during the present war, also to provide
amendments te the Dominion Elections Act,
1938, consequential to such regulations, or
made necessary by the ad'vent of the said war.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, it
will be recalled that when this Bill came
before us some threc weeks ago it was stated
liat many lionourable members had rccecived
protests fron certain important organizations
throughout Canada calling attention te section
5 of the Bill. This section, as originally drafted,
triade it possible for provincial legislatures to
amend their provincial Elections Acts in suchi
a way as to debar nationals of enemy countries from voting in the fortlicoming warime
election. We all realized the improbability of
suci action being taken by a provincial government, but the Senate-quite properly, it
seems te me-made an amendment tliat rendered any such action impossible. We also
made an amendiment by which section 5 was
brought under the provisions of section 11,
which confines the application of the sections
therein mentioned to general elections held in
Canada during the present war or within a
period of six months. The House of Commons has accepted those amendments.
Under section 5 as originally drawn the
intention was, as is clearly set out in the
ex.planatory note, to bar certain people of
Japanese nationality from voting in the wartime election.
After some
discussion the
Senate continued the disqualification.
Tue
House of Commons amendment in which we
are now asked to concur modifies this somtewhat, and provides that Japanese who, previeus

to the Pearl Harbor incident, were resident in
provinces other than British Columbia shall
continue to exercise their right of franchise.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Was that net so under
our amendmiient?
Hon. Mr. KING: Our amendernt covered
all Japanese in Canada.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Our amendnment disqualified Japanese people in provinces that
liad a law disqualifying them from voting in
provincial clections. The only province having
such a law was British Columbia. Therefore
under our amendment these people would
have the riglît to vote in other provinces.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think that is probably
the thougit of many, but it is net correct;
and the House of Commons bas modified our-

WEDNESDAY, JULY 19, 1944
amendment to enable these people who were
living outside of British Columbia prior to
the declaration of war with Japan to retain
the franchise rights they had previously
exercised. With that I am in hearty accord.
I do not think it was our desire to affect some
400 or 500 Japanese who were resident in
other provinces; and that, I believe, is all
who were or will be qualified to vote. The
House of Commons amendment will continue
to bar people of Japanese nationality who
were resident in British Columbia at the time
of Pearl Harbor,'and who, for security reasons
and as a war measure, were removed from what
are known as prohibited areas in that province
to other localities. Those prohibited areas
extend from the coast to the interior of the
province. The great works of the Consolid-ated Mining Company, for instance, and the
big dams of the Kootenay river, are within
the prohibited areas. Japanese residents who,
under government supervision, were allowed
to migrate in groups to other provinces, where
they are to-day residing, will be debarred
from voting in the coming wartime election.
I hope I have made myself clear as to the
amendment made in this Chamber and the
amendment that has come to us from the
House of Commons, with a request for
concurrence. As I stated when the Bill first
came under our consideration, this measire
primarily concerns the elective members of
Parliament. They have had an opportunity
of reconsidering their original draft of Section
5; they have seen fit to send the Bill back
to us with the amendment I have indicated;
and I have much pleasure in moving concurrence in that amendment.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: How does the
amendment read?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,Hon. Mr. KING: I will ask my honourable
friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) if he would kindly read and explain
the amendment as it stands now. But perhaps
my honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon.
Mr. Leger) would wish to speak first.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, I
have no objection to the amendment that
has come from the other House; but, with all
due deference, I must say that it simply adds
words to the section as amended by the
Senate and makes absolutely no change in the
effect of our amendment. Section 5 as
amended by the Senate disqualified persons of
the Japanese race from exercising the federal
franchise in British Columbia, because that
province had passed an Act prohibiting such
persons from voting in provincial elections.
No other province had disqualified Japanese

people from voting in provincial elections, and
therefore, under the existing law, all Japanese living in every province except British
Columbia have the right to vote in federal
elections. I repeat that the House of Commons amendment makes no change in the
effect of the section as amended here. So,
as I sec it, there is no objection to the
amendment.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I cannot agree entirely with my
honourable friend who bas just spoken. I
hope this is our last go at this matter, and
at the risk of repetition perhaps I may explain
the three steps that have been taken with
regard to the Bill. The honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. King) bas already done so, but
apparently he has not convinced my honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger).
The original Bill as brought down in the
Commons provided, in section 5, paragraph
(n), that no person belonging to a race which
was at war with Canada could vote in a
Dominion election if at the time of the election he was precluded by provincial law from
voting in any province.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is how the section
stood when the Bill first came to the Senate.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes. Serious objection
was taken to that section in the Senate, and
I think also in the House of Commons, when
honourable members of that House appreciated the scope of the new paragraph (n). My
honourable friend from L'Acadie made one of
the most effective arguments against the paragraph when he pointed out that if any one
province-for instance, Prince Edward Island
-saw fit to disqualify the persons of any race
from voting in a provincial election, all persons of that race living in Canada would be
disqualified from voting in federal elections.
It was never intended that the new paragraph
should have that effect, and so in this House
we amended it to provide that in the next
federal election every person whose racial
origin is that of a country at war with Canada
shall be disqualified from voting, if persons
of that race were disqualified from voting
in any provincial election.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: At the time of the passing of this Act.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That was a round,
about way of saying that no Japanese shall
vote in Canada at the next election, for they
were the only people whose disqualification
came within the terms of our amendment.
But I would pcint out to my honourable
friend that that amendment disqualified any
Japanese from voting in any part of Canada,

SENATE
although the disqualification in the British
Columbia Act related only to Japanese in
that province.
The purport of the House of Commons
amendment is not entirely clear at first, but
becomes so after study. It is this: Any
Japanese who were living in British Columbia
and disqualified by the existing law in that
province shall be disqualified from voting in
any part of Canada at the next election; but
any Japanese who lived in any other province
prier to the war shall not be disqualified. That
is the distinction. The House of Commons
amendment limits the disqualifications entirely
to those who heretofore were living in British
Columbia. The Senate amendment affected
not only those Japanese, but the Japanese in
every province, regardless of where they lived
before the war.
Now, honourable senators, having made
that distinction, may I say a word in support
of the House of Commons amendment? Since
I come from British Columbia, and particularly
in view of the remarks made by my honourable
friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) on
the last discussion of the Bill, one might weil
be surprised to hear me supporting this amendment. But the amendment declares a principle, at least by implication if net by express
language, which we in British Columbia are in
faveur of. It is a reaffirmation by Parliament
that each province shall have the right to determine the voting qualifications of the citizens
within that province, and that this right shall
not be interfered with by the laws of any other
province. That, to-day, in the declaration of
the House of Commons, means that Japs who
before the war lived in Alberta, for instance,
shall not be affected by any law now existing
in British Columbia. But that same principle,
applied to-morrow, may mean that British
Columbia shall have the right te say te the
Parliament of Canada: "No other province or
group of provinces shall dictate to us in the
matter of whether the Japanese are to be
given the vote in British Columbia." That is
a principle which we in British Columbia
regard as of great importance.
Hon. Mr. CALDER-: That is for provincial
purposes.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, not only for provincial purposes, but for federal purposes as
well. My honourable friend the acting leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) expressed that
principle clearly in the last debate, when
he said-I think I am expressing the idea he
then expressed, for though I have not read his
speech, I listened to it carefully-when he said
it was a sound principle that the citizens of
each province of Canada, best knowing the
conditions within the provincial boundaries,
.Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

should determine the qualifications in the
province for voting on matters of special local
import, either federally or provincially.
An Hon. SENATOR: No, no.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is wrong, anyway.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Of course it is right.
It is right, as stated by my honourable friend
opposite, and I think it is a sound principle.
The objection urged in this House on the
last discussion was that no ,province should
have the right to dictate with respect to the
franchise in any other province. With that
principle I absolutely agree. But when it
comes to the question of who shall vote in
any province, then unless the provincial legislature has departed from fundamental principles and has by its conduct indicated that
the judgment it is exercising is not in accordance with democratic principles such as the
rest of Canada can accept, it is sound doctrine
that the Dominion as a whole should recognize
the right of each province to declare the qualifications constituting the right of voting within
that province.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: We might have nine different qualifications in the nine provinces.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is what we have
to-day and always have had in the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That does not make it
right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Oh, yes, it does. Let
me call my honourable friend's attention to
the Dominion Elections Act.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Certainly.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: What about women
in the province of Quebec?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: For twenty-five
years they have voted in federal elections.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That may be; but I
say the Dominion bas recognized the principle of leaving certain voting qualifications
to the province. It may well be that the
Dominion will say: "So far as women are
concerned, we do not recognize it as being
a proper distinction that they shall be disqualified. It is not a matter local or peculiar
to any one province." But let me call my
honourable friend's attention to the Dominion
Statutes of 1938, chapter 46, section 14, subsection 2:
The following persons are disqualified from
voting at an election and incapable of being
registered as electors and shall not vote nor be
so registered, that is to say-

JULY 19, 1944
(i) every person who is disqualified by reason
of race from voting at an election of a member
of the Legisiative Assembly of the province ini
which lie or she residesThere is one qualification in that respect.
It is flot important for the purposes of mY
argument, but it is important for other
reasonýs. This is the qualification:
-and wlio did not serve in the military, naval,
or air forces of Canada in the war of 1914-1918.
Let me read .the paragraph again:
Every person who is disqnalified by reason
of race from voting at an election of a memaber
of the Legisiative Assembly of the province in
which hie or she residesis by this Act disqualified from voting in
federal cleetions.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In that province.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In that province. I
arn glad my lionourable friend emphasizes
that. 1 amn an advocate of the restriction .of
that principle to the province, honourable
senators, and that is the Teason why 1 amn
supporting this amendment.
Paragraph (j> reads:
In any province, every person exernpted or
entitled to dlaim exemption or who on production of any certificate might have become or
would now bie entitled to dlaima exemption f rom
military service by reason of the Order in
Council of December sixth, 1898, becanse the
doctrines of his religion make him averse to
bearing armas, and who is by the law of that
province disqualified f rom voting at an election
of a member of the legislative assembly of that
province.
As was said by my honourable friend froma
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), for many years
that bas been the recognized principle in
Dominion Statutes in regard to qualifications
for voting in federal elections; and, I repeat,
1 am in favour of this provision, because it is
a continued rccognition of that principle.
Hon. Mr. .BENCH: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? What hie lias just
been saying relates, 1 understand, only to the
inatter of disqualification. Do I understand
hlma to say also that lie would be in favour
of permitting thie eighteen-year-old age qualification in Alberta to apply in federal
elections?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not suggest for
one minute that this Parliament bas tied -its
own banda; but I do auggest Vliat witliin
certain limitations it is sound policy to recognize, so far as is practicable, the -right of a
province in matters, whicli have speciai application tio one province and which that province considers vitally affeets its citizenship,
and hence to leave these questions to, that
province. I quite concede that if for any
106-21

305

reason this Parliament said: "We will depart
from that principle," it migbt be justified
and ,would be entitled to do so.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: Hear, liear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: But I also say, lionourable members, that I should be very soirry
to sec this House at any time deny to the
provinces recognition of a principle whicli,
in a limited form it is truc, has for many
years bcen recognized as a sound one, andl
one that most mraterially has contributed to
the unity of this. country-so far as there is
unity.
There are some answers that may be made
to that suggestion. One is that the disqualification of the Japanese in Alberta who
were removed there from British Columbia,
is in itself a denial of thîs principle. But I
should like Vo point out that that argument
confuses two distinct things: one is the reason
for the legislation; the other is the language
whicli is used in the legislation to delimit
the disqualification. It is true that in the
language of the Senate amendment the
Japanese now in Alberta are disqualified
because-not because; I almost feli into the
error I was trying to correct-they are disqualified uàder an Act whicli ays thut tbey
did not heectofore have the riglit to vote
in British Columbia wliere they lived. That
is not the reason why they are disqualified
in Aiberta, but it is a oonvenient way of
defin.ing those wh*o are Vo lie disqualified
without making it too pointed as to wlio
is being picked. out in this way. That is ail
it means. The real reason for having the
enactmnent in, that form ia that it is part
of 'war legiÊlation, confined entirely to the
durdtion of the war.
These Japanese wbo will - be allowed to
vote as a result of the Flouse of Commons
amendment are few in number. In reality,
wbat is involved is a principle, noV numliers,
the principle being Vhis: we sh-al confine
the limitation to these Japanese wlio are
affected liy wliat we are doing in connection
witli this -war. Tliey are the Japanese wlio
were in what is known as the restricted
areas in Britishi Columbia. Practically ail
of Vliem have been moved freim their own
homes and deprived of the metliod of earning their livelihood wliicli tley liad enjoyed
before Japan came into the war. A large
nusnber of them are actually outside the
province to-day, noV because of any anltiJapanese sentiment in Britishi Columbia; they
are outside the province to-day or are in
unrestricted areas within the province in
virtue of a war measure precaution taken
by the Dominion Government. It would

be a serious situation if Japanese who had
never enjoyed the vote should, as the result
of that war measure and during war time,
have the vote conferred upon them.
It is to me rather surprising that we have
heard so much discussion about the injustice
meted out to the Japanese.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That is not it at all.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It is the principle.
Hon. Mr. FARRJS: The principle is applied
only in the discussion in connection with the
Japanese.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: They are the only
people affected.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I should like to call
the attention of my honourable friend to the
fact that in British Columbia the Chineseour allies-are not allowed to vote in federal
elections. Yet we have all this discussion.
But I have never heard any word about the
wrong principle in connection with our allies,
the Chinese.
Hon. Mr. BENCH:
tion.

That is not the ques-

Hon. Mr. FAR!RIS: I have not heard it in
this House. The North American Indians and
the Esquimaux are not allowed to vote in
federal elections, and as far as I know, never
have been.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I be permitted to
interrupt the honourable gentleman? There
have been protests made at the taking away
of the right of any citizen, no matter what his
race. If one is a citizen of this country, born
in this country, whether of Japanese race,
Chinese race or any other race, some of us at
least have protested that we have no right to
deprive him of his franchise.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have no doubt of
the correctness of what has been said, that in
general that has been the situation. But in
the concrete, in making the application, I
have only heard it in regard to the Japanese
Let me call attention again to Section 14 of
the Dominion Elections Act:
The following persons are disqualified from
voting at an election and incapable of being
registered as electors and shall not vote nor
be so registered, that is to say(e) every Esquimau person, whether born in
Canada or elsewhere;
(f) every Indian personThat is a Simon-pure native son of Canada.
-every Indian person ordinarily resident on
an Indian reservation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: They never had
the right to vote.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: They never had the
right to vote.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: They are wards of the
country.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That does not make
them any the less citizens of this country.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: They are not even
allowed to buy whiskey.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I have been very much
interested, honourable senators, in listening to
the explanations offered to justify this legislation in regard to the Esquimaux and the
Indians. They are not as strong as the
reasons that can be given why, in British
Columbia, restrictions are imposed upon the
Japanese.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Now, let me say as
dispassionately as I can that the question of
the right of the oriental, and, for the moment,
particularly of the Japanese, to vote in British
Columbia does not arise out of any war condition or any suggestion that because of
hatreds engendered by the war our judgment
is affected, and that by a sense of injustice
we are carried on to perform acts which in
themselves are unjust. That is not the situation at all. Those of us who come frein British
Columbia have lived with the orientals in
that province most of our lives; but we are
not different in mind from our brothers in the
East. A great number of us came froin eastern
Canada. It was my proud privilege to come
from the province of New Brunswick, and I
do not think that just because I live out in
British Columbia my sense of what is just or
my appreciation of democratic principles are
any less than they would have been had I
stayed in New Brunswick, gone out to Manitoba, or come to live in Ontario.
The facts are these. Theories are fine until
they come up against realities that are not
consistent with those theories.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is what we in
British Columbia appreciate. We in British
Columbia have protested all our lives against
bringing orientals into that province; and I
want honourable members to understand that
if it had not been for the protests we have
made-they did not accomplish their purpose
in full-but if it had not been for the partial
success of those protests there would have
been an infiltration of Japanese into that
province the consequence of which you can
appreciate just as well as I cn. If there has

JULY 19, 1944
been injustice in this matter it bas been an
injustice to the province of Britishi Columbia,
in that these people were not kept out entirely.
It is ail very well to talk about rights of
citizenship and breaking bargains. There was
no bargain broken witli the Japanese wlio became naturalized in British Columbia. Every
Japanese who came in there and becarne naturalized knew that lie was becorning naturalized
ini a country in wbich, the law was such that
naturalization did nlot give hirn the vote. So
there was -no contract broken. It is not as if
we took him in and naturalized him and then,
for the first time, denied hirn the vote. It ie
flot as if he was invited into the country. He
neyer was invited into Canada. It is true
that, by the rnajority wish in Canada, Japanese were ailowed to corne to British Columbia
in limited number.
Hon. Mr. EULER: How about the man
who was born there?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I arn coming to him in
a minute. I arn talking about the man who
carne in. 'He came into a province where
he knew he was nlot wanted. There is not a
single one of tlier who had reaclied years of
understanding who did niot know that wlien
he came into British Columbia lie was coming
into a province where lie was not wanted, and
wliere lie would be denied the vote-flot in
any spirit of injustice, but because tlie people
of that province believed in tlieir hearts that
the maintenance of constitutional government
and of dernocracy in its very highest form,
would be seriously irnpaired and perliaps destroyed if it was carried to the extent of giving
Japanese the vote as it is given to other
people.
It is ail very well to say, "You are getting
hysterical because the Japanese are committing atrocities. What is the difference between
the atrocities of the Japanese and of the
German people?" Let me point out to my
honourable friend who lias interrupted, me on
this question that ail Canada lias recognized
a fundarnental distinction. Nobody lias ever
suggested tliat the armed forces, or sorne commission appointed with the authority of the
police, sliould take the Germans of this
country, or the Italians of this country, as a
body and incarcerate tbern or move tliem from
their homes. But in the case of tlie Japanese,
that very thing lias been. done witli, as far
as I know, the unanimous approval of ail the
people of Canada.
My liozourable friend from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bencli) has said tliat is only for aafety
purposes. But why for safety purposes? Tbat
is tlie question. Wlien you answer that question I shall answer wliy the distinction in the
franchise.
106-21J

307

Wby tlie distinction? Ie it safe to allow
our German citizefis to rernain undisturbed?
Is it safe to allow the tliousands and thousands of congregated Italians in tliis country to
rernain undisturbed? Tlie answer is: "Yes".
But is it safe to do that witb tlie Japanese?
Tlie answer, according to wbat Canada has
done, is, ",No, it is nlot safe." Then there must
be some fundamentai distinction between, these
races to justify the action of the people of
Canada. I say if there is a fundarnental distinction of that kind, it goes ciglit to tlie heart
of the voting issue. It is a fine distinction that
says we shahl take this man frorn his home,
take bis wif e and cliildren frorn tlieic home,
confiscate bis fishing boat, and send bim to a
far land'--and then for tbe first tirne we will
give birn tlie vote. Tbat is the logic of the plan,
if it is carried througb, and for my part I
cannot accept it.
cNow, rny lionourable friend says, "Wbat
about the native-born?" I think 1 bave answered that in wliat I bave just said. Nativeborn Japanese living on the coast in Britishi
Columbia were taken frorn their bornes just tbe
same as tbe naturalized Japanese were. Wliy
was that? Was it net because the police
autliorities and the military autliorities of this
country fully apprecrated the fact tbat even
tliough a Japanese was born bere lie could not
be trusted like the native-boru of other races?
There could be no other explanation of it. And
if that is so, lionourable senators, surely wlien
it cornes to this question of tlie franchise it
is illogical and unsafe to give these people in
war-time what tliey were denied in peace.-time.
Did bonourable gentlemen ever stop to think
wbat tbe effect of granting tbe franchise to the
Japanese rernoved frorn Britisli Columbia
miglit be in Japan? Someone lias suggested
tliat it miglit stimulate them. to atrocities. 1
cannot believe that. 1 cannot believe that
anytbing can be added, to tbe stimulus of tlieir
cwn cliaracters, as evidenced in this war, to induce tlier to commit atrocities. 'I tbink the
ultirnate was reaehed long befoce the discussion of tliis question ever carne up.
But there is anotlier aspect to it. It is
this. One of the tliings to be taken into considecation in this war is tlie morale of tbose
who are fighting. I wonder wliat the effect on
the morale of thie Japanese would be if they
were told tliat aithougli ail tlirougb the years
wben tbere was peace the Japanese wlio lived
in Britisli Columbia were neyer allowed to
vote, and that aithougli to this d-ay the Cliinese
in that province are not ailowed to vote eitlier
fedecally or provincially, yet these very same
Japanese persons wbo bave been removed from.
British Columbia are now to be granted the
vote by the Pacliarnent of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, liear.

308

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My bonourable friend
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) referred the
other day to the book of Joseph Grew, -Ten
Years in Japan." I bad flot read the book
before, but I got it out of the Library and have
been browsing over it. 1 cannot say that it
bias had the effeet on me that my bonourable
friend might have wished. I find at page 153
of the b.ook, in the author's meinoirs of 1935,' a
reference to the discriminatory provisions of
the Exclusion Act of 19,24, whicb was in effect
in the United States. What lie says is this:
1 do not think that this is the time to approach
the question; of course the Act always rankies
and always will, but to repeal the discriminatory provisions now would be interpreted by
inany as an indication of weakness and as a
desire to placate the martial spirit of Japan,
and while lovely editorials would be written
about our graceful action in recognizing Japan
as an equal, it would flot in the slightest degree
alter Japanese policy or tone down the military
propaganda. On the contrary, I eau see some
Japanese writers arguing that having recognized
Japan as an equal on t he immigration issue, it
would now be ail the more appropriate and
logical for us to recognize ber as an equal on
the naval issue.
So, Mr. Grew, in the book my bonourable
friend bias called to my attention, wvas against
the repeal, and I would be against aniything
at this time that would'suggest a distinction
of treatment as between the wartime Japanese
and wartime Chinese, or any contra-distinction
as to the way those same Japanese were
treated in peare-time and in war-time, whieh
would suggcst to them that we were trying
to placate them, or in any way feared the
miglit and power of Japan.
Hon. Mr. BENCU: May I asic whether or
flot the Chinese in provinces other than
British Columbia are permittcd to vote at
Dominion elections?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: 0f course they are.
I do not know why my honourable friend
asica that question. I cannot see wbat relation
it bas to my advocacy of confining the
lisfranchisemcnt to the province in wbich it
bas always applied.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: By way of testing
the honourable gentleman's statement, may I
asic him a question? Would he say that the
four tbousand Japanese now resident in provinces east of British Columbia should be
allowed to stay in those provinces and enjoy
the franchise there after the war is over?
H-on. Mr. FARRIS: In discussing the question that we are now considering, I should
say "Yes". But I go further than that and
say that in my judgment they ought to be
made to stay in tbe East. I hope some of
thema go, out to Rociccliffe.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You can have ours back
from Manitoba. We will pay their way back.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

An Hon. SENATOR: To slavery in British
Columbia.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There is no slavery in
British Columbia. No province in Canada
bas bigber ideals of citizenship or better
citizens than British Columbia.
I say, bonourable senators, with aIl seriousness, that in its ultimate results this question
transcends anything that tbis Parliamenýt bas
considered. The grim realities of this question
are of far more importance. to the welfare of
Canada and to one of its finest provinces
than nny abstract question of the franchise in
relation to the Japanese people. I believe it
is a basic truth that when you allow people

wbo -cannot be assimilated to corne into a
section of the country against the protests
of citizens of that section, you are simply
stirring up grief and trouble. The granting of
a vote -to sucb people will not cure the
trouble; it will only aggravate it. Such an
extension of the franchise merely presents a
temptation to politicians, in times of close
elections, to secure in return for a concession
or two, a block vote, delivered by ne, two or
three mnen, that rnay turn the tide of the
election. And so concessions are made, step
hy step, until tbe prospect of a white British
Columbia is destroyed. My bonourable friend
from Lincoln (Iton. Mr. Bench) would understand that expression "white British Columbia," and feel just as strongly about it as 1
do, if he were living in British Columbia.
In bis remarks the other day my honourable
friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
spoke of the Negro, and suggested that
because Mrs. Roosevelt h.ad taken a certain
course the outlook in the United States was
better. I would now commendto my honourable fciend the readiug of an article, which
ha will find in the Reader's Digest, or, in its
original form, in the Atlantic Monthly. The
author is David L. ýCohn, wbo, according to
the footante in the Readec's Digest, is a
distinguished American.
Apparently he is
recognized as an authority worthy of having
bis views published in that magazine and in
the Atlantic Monthly. May I read oe or
two of bis observations?
If we would reach the heart of the problem,
we mnust makze three candid acknou ledgments.
The first is that the Negro question is insoluble,
as are aIl complex social questions.
Secondly, it is at bottoma a blooci or sexual
question. The wbites are determiiied that no
white in their legal jurisdiction shall marry a
Negro, and tbis is the law of ail tbe southera
states.
We know that there are more Anglo-Saxons
in tbe South than in any other part of the
United States, and that tha soutbern states

JULY 19, 1944
have always given Britain their strongest support and sympathy. Yet it is men of that
breed who have taken the stand referred to
by this author.
In another part of his article he says:
Upon such a society one must net lightly pass
judgment, nor must one seek to apply patent
remedies, for to do so is to play recklessly with
explosives.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The Negroes seem
to have been good enough to fight valiantly
for the United States.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: They may have. I do
not know what that has to do with the
question.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Ninety-nine per cent of
them in kitchens.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: A final passage from
this article:
Let us not delude ourselves. This is less than
democracy. But -there is no section of the
country in which at some time other minorities,
as well as the Negro, have not been discriminated against. There is no government-indeed.
no organized religion-which has not at some
time compromised with the logic of its own
institutions.
All my life I have been told that one of
the great sources of the strength of British
statesmanship is its capacity te compromise
when dealing with actualities, notwithstanding
the principles that may be involved.
I realize that I have wandered somewhat
from the matter under discussion, and I
appreciate the courtesy of the House in allowing me to do so. On the evening when this
Bill was formerly under consideration, a
couple of weeks ago, I did not speak, because
I did not want to keep the House sitting at
a very late hour. But I desired to speak,
membershonourable
not to persuade
for at the moment I am not concerned how
the Senate will vote on this-but in order
to explain the situation to some honourable
members who, I think, have not a full appreciation of the problem that exists in British
Columbia. It is not a war problem, but

marriages or said that the C.C.F. party was in
favour of such a mixture of strains in presentday society.
Addressing a C.C.F. panel discussion here,
Dr. Black said if any young couple, a white
Canadian and a Japanese, were to ask his advice
as to marriage, he would advise against it
because he felt that "the ignorance, prejudice
and intolerance of the mass of Canadian people"
would make life difficult for such a couple.
Well, honourable senators, I think this
gentleman takes a lot on himself. He brands
the people of Canada who disagree with him
on the Japanese question as ignorant, prejudiced and intolerant. I say he is entirely
wrong in his application of those terms. The
people who understand this question recognize
that there are fundamental deiffrences of race.
Oh, East is East, and West is West, and
never the twain shall meet.
What Dr. Black terms ignorance, prejudice
and intolerance is in reality only the commonsense recognition of the fact that these intermarriages are impossible, and that the fruit
of such marriages would not help to build up
the citizenship of thei country. The people
of the Japanese race are so fundamentally
different that they cannot be assimilated as
Canadians. Their presence here renders complete internal co-operation impossible and
does not make for the kind of nation that we
look forward to for our children and our
grandhildren in this country.
We have heard a great deal about the
franchise. But, honourable senators, let us
remember this:
To thine own self be true,
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any.man.
In dealing with this Japanese problem the
people of British Columbia have no desire
except to be true to themselves and to their
province, believing that in so doing they will
be truc in the highest sense to Canadian unity
and to Canadian institutions.

Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
I do not intend to delay the House, and what
I have to say will be spoken without heat.
I should just like to reaffirm the principle
that every Canadian citizen, especially if born
in Canada, should have all the privileges of
citizenship, including the right to vote.
I would also point out an anomaly that will
arise from the amendment made in the House
I understand that a few

hundred citizens of the Japanese race-I prefer
to speak of people who live here as Canadians,
rather than as Japanese or German or members of any other race-I understand that a
few hundred citizens of the Japanese race who
are living in provinces other than British
Columbia will be permitted to vote in the
next Dominion election.
Hon. Mr. KING: Those who were in such
provinces before the declaration of war.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I want to point out an
anomaly that will be created by this amendment. Since the war began a number of
citizens of the Japanese race have been transferred from British Columbia to, say, Alberta.
They will not be allowed to vote in the
Dominion election. But other citizens of the
Japanese race, who were resident in Alberta
prior to the war, and some of whom who may
now be living side by side with the recent
arrivals from British Columbia, will be able
to vote.
I would again affirm that clause 5 was not
worth the dissatisfaction-I was going to say
disaffection-aroused throughout the country.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Under the present law
citizens of Japanese origin in the province of
British Columbia cannot vote in federal
elections. Could anybody want anything more
than that?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Because they were a
dangerous element they were removed from
that province, and yet you would give them
the vote.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am saying it is an
anomaly to have Japanese living side by side,
some of whom can vote and some of whom
cannot.
But I rose more particularly to declare my
absolute disagreement with the lack of principle enunciated by my good friend from
British Columbia (Hon. Mr. Farris), that the
Dominion franchise should be placed under
the control of the province. Just because that
has always been done-and I know it appeals
to the mind of legal men as a precedent-is no
reason why it ought to continue.
Unfortunately-or fortunately-I am not a law ver,
and therefore cannot appreciate my honourable
friend's point of view. I do submit that it is
undemocratic that the legislature of a province
should be able in any way to modify the right
of the franchise for federal purposes. Let the
legislature of British Columbia disqualify any
body it pleases, as to the provincial franchise,
that is no particular affair of the people of
Hon. Mr. EULER.

Ontario or New Brunswick or any other province; but to empower that legislature to
modify the franchise for federal purposes is to
me most illogical. The exercise of such a
right will lead to chaos in the different
provinces so far as the Dominion franchise is
concerned, for certain racial groups may be
denied the franchise in one province and be
granted it in another. You will have no uniform qualification for the federal franchise.
It is an anomaly and utterly devoid of
principle. I submit that the franchise for the
federal Parliament should be the same in all
the provinces.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It can be that only if
the federal Parliament retains to itself the
right to decide who shall have the franchise.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I did not want to interrupt the honourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. Farris) during the course of his
argument. I rise now merely to say that I do
not think he was quite correct in his statement
that the Indians never enjoyed the right to
vote. My recollection is that the Indians did
vote prior to the election of 1896.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If I said that it was an
inadvertence. All I can say by the book is
that under the present law they do not have
the vote.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: But they did have the
vote at one time.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
at the present time no useful purpose would
be served by my opposing the adoption of the
motion now before us. On the contrary, it
might only delay enactment of the regulations
to permit war service electors to vote. However, I want to say that I remain opposed to
the principle of denying any Canadian the
right of the franchise by reason of his being of
this, that or any other racial origin.

regime and the English>regime. The fateful
year 1760 is the dividing point: about 150
years, a century and a half, on each side.
During the first part, dramatic events took
place. Let me recount a few: the birth of a
nation, its infancy, its youth, its coming of
age, its fights for living and for surviving, for
implanting on the shores of the mighty St.
Lawrence a Christian civilization. During one
hundred and fifty years these men, the
pioneers of New France, fought against wilderness, against barbarity, against paganism,
against ail kinds of mighty foes.
They fought, and fought, and finally they
conquered. After a century and a half, this
handful of daring men had created a potential
empire. From the shores of the St. Lawrence
they had unfolded their flag, the flag of their
country, north, south and west, over the whole
North American continent. Joliette and Marquette had discovered the mighty Mississippi.
Cavalier de la Salle. through dreadful vicissitudes, had pushed further south, reached the
shores of the Mexican Sea, and paved the
way to the foundation of a new French state,
named Louisiana in honour of Louis XIV.
Later on the noble La Verendrye and his sons
had discovered the great West, built forts
on the western prairies, and even reached the
foot of the mighty Rockies. I confess that at
this moment I must check the tumultuous flood
of history which is besetting my mind. What
a wonderful litany of great names comes to my
lips: Champlain, Maisonneuve, Laval, Frontenac, Iberville, Talon, Montcalm, Jogues
Bréboeuf, Marie de l'Incarnation, Marguerite
Bourgeois, Mademoiselle Mance, Madeleine de
Vercheres-great men, great soldiers, great
saints, great women! What a golden book!
and what a dramatie, what a wonderful
historyl
Then, in 1760, comes the end of these epics
and the beginning of a new era. It is the end
:f New France, but not the end of Canada.
The 60,000 Canadians have succeeded in
adapting themselves to their new allegiance.
No doubt it was a deep trial. But Canada
was their country, and they stuck to the
land of their fathers. For years they were
still the bulk of the Canadian population, and
the history of their national life was the history of Canada. Yes, it must be acknowledged
that until 1791 the vicissitudes, the struggles,
the exertions of what we now call the province of Quebec, were the main features of the
Canadian annals.
During ail that period,
there was no province of Upper Canada.
The settlement of that region truly began with
the Loyalist migration. It was only in 1788
that it seemed necessary to give it a judicial

organization, and it was accordingly divided
into the districts of Lunenburg, Mecklenburg,
Nassau and Hesse. On the seaside, Nova
Scotia alone enjoyed the privilege of a provincial constitution. In 1764 Prince Edward
Island, and in 1784 New Brunswick were
granted the same privilege. Then, in 1791
Lower and Upper Canada were each granted
a separate constitution, and in 1841 were united
under a joint constitution. At last, in 1867, the
British North America Act united aIl these
provinces under a federal constitution and the
Dominion of Canada was born.
My intention in going through that rather
unwonted historical survey, and my excuse for
doing so, is to show the peculiar situation
of the province of Quebec. She is the oldest
province of Canada. The first page of her
history was written by Jacques Cartier on the
shores of Gaspé four hundred years ago. Quebec, Three Rivers, Montreal, her main cities,
all have celebrated their third centenaries. In
ber old cemeteries ten generations of Canadians are lying under the shadow of the
Cross. Undoubtedly in the great family of
our Canadian Confederation she is the eldest.
If we agree to date her birth only from the
foundation of Quebec by Champlain, in 1608,
she is over three centuries old. Then comes

and sixty-three years; Ontario, one hundred
and fifty-three years; Manitoba, se'venty-four
years; British Columbia, eighty-six years;
Saskatchewan and Alberta thirty-nine years.
With aIl this data in our mind, we should
now ponder over the dreadful predicament of
the poor historians conscripted for the onerous
task of writing a common history-a textbook-for ail those Canadian provinces. That
common history should cover the whole field
of three centuries. And what would be the
framing of such a work? What would be the
fair proportion allotted to cach part?
It
must strike every man who is somewhat
familiar with those questions, that Quebec,
three centuries old, the New France of yonder
time, surviving as a distinct and active entity
till our own days, sbould take up half the
space in the contemplated text-book. Would
such a proportion be acceptable? Would it
suit the very natural feelings of the other
provinces?
Would, for example, the great,
weighty and thriving province of Ontario deem
that such a repartition would be a fair one?
I dare say no; in such a case acquiescence
would be miraculous. This great province
bas bad a glorious past. Faithfulness, loyalty,
costly devotion to a principle have enhanced

JULY 19, 1944
her birth,. The sacrifices, the struggles, the
hardships, the undaunted spirit, the trials and
victories of the United Empire Loyalhists shed
a glamour on the early history of that province. And ber splendid realizations in the
fiolds of trade, agriculture and industry should
be a matter of pride and admiiration. for every
Canadian citizen. Therofore Ontario is suroly

glorions deed.s. As a mattor of fact , eacb
province-the maritimes, tbe western provinces-bas a dlaim to a fair historical record
of ber deeds, and only a text-book framed in
that spirit-a text-book where the general
survoy on the origin, the growtb, the trials
and achievements of Canada as a whole would
be buttressed with speicial attention to facts
having a peculiar importance for tbe people
of tbe intended province-ecould be satisfactory. And such a book could not easily be
accepted as a standard book for alI the
provinces of Canada.

No, uniformity is flot to ho found in the
field of bistory, and, as a matter of fact, it is
not to ho found in tbe historical text-hooks.
I was reading lately the following lines in a
memorandum on tbis question:
The history of England is flot taugbt in the
sanie way in tbe London and in .tbe Edinburgh

the bistory of the Secession War from the
same viewpoint as the student in New York.

is not detrimental 'to national unity. Northern

and Southern Americans have the same love
Two religionýs and three
for their country.
nationalities in Switzerland have flot been a
seed -of conflict.
Then wbat should be our aim in such a
matter? Our aim should be to, have in eaeh
province one or many good text-books on -the
history of Canada, books which would join
accuracy in the narration of general facts, with
peculiar attention to facts more specially
connected with the history of the said province. In sucb 'books the paramount qualities
should be truth, impartiality and a happy
blending of provincial and Canadian patriotism. Such text-books would býe full of interest
for the young Canadians in each province,
whereas the uniform text-book would be
stereotyped, lifeless, colourless and, dulI.
In the course of ýthis debate we have heard
severe criticisms of text-books presently uised
in some Canadian provinces. Some of these
may bo woll-founded, some are not. Speaking
of the books uscd in my own province for the
teaching of our history, I feel inclined to
assert that there are good ones, and others
somewhat deficient. Improvomnent is always
timely, and at the presont moment in the
province of Quebec, a special committee appointed by the Council of Public Instruction,
is at work to make a study of text-bookis on
Canadian history.
0f course, one cannot expect that in historical books evorything will please everybody.
It would be foolish to hope that in speaking
of the years which. followed the faîl of New
France, and during which the settling of the
new government took place, the authors of
our text-.books should ho bound to state that
everything went smoothly, that every deed was
wonderfully -convonient, that every measure
adopted was wisdomr itself, that every ruling
and edict was the higbost peak of statosmanship. That would be undoubtedly false. No,
every'thing was not smootb, everything was
not pleasant, everything was not agreeable to
our forefathers. And it is only natural and
right to say so without bitterness. This is
history. It would ho ridiculous to veil one's
face because such and such a book happens to
state that Francis Maseres, once Attorney
General at Quebec was a fanatic, or that
Govornor Craig had none of the eminont qualities of Lord Elgin. Truth without acrimony,
statement of facts without hateful commentaries, sucb sbould be the law of ahl Canadian
historians, nay of ail historians.
History should be impartial, but flot impassi'ble. An English writer of history, speaking
of the Battie of Culloden, should not abstain
£rom relating that the Duke of Cumberland's

106-22
REVISED EDITION

314

SENATE'

victory had a bloody epilogue in the ruthless
butchery of the clansmen faithful to the
hopeless cause of Charles Edward. A French
writer, relating the brilliant military achievements of Marshal Turenne, should not keep
a guilty silence over his merciless d'evastation
of the Palatinate in 1672. A French-Canadian
historian would be faulty if he did net
denounce the treacherous act of Governor
Denonville when he condemned te deportatien the Mohawks chiefs whom he had summoned to a parley. Truth should be the law
of history.
During the present débate some quotations
from text-books authorized in my province
have been cited, to prove that racial prejudice
is fostered in our schools. Those quotations,
if they cannot be starmped as spurious, were
skilfully carved from their context. Dexterous
carving of quotations is sometimes a very
convenient art. In the present case use was
made of a text-Jbook entitled "History of
Canada, by the Brothers of Christian Science,
1910." Admitting the accuracy of the said
quotations, it can be seen by the text itself
that the author was really fair to the English
Governors of 1760-1774, Murray and Carleton.
Now I myself wish to enter the quotation
field. In a book entitled "History of Canada,
by the Brothers of Christian Science, Montreal, 1914." I read, on page 526 the following

iees:

Since the Cession (1760) the question of
independence bas always been the dream of
eminent statesmen. The great Papineau was
thinking of a Canadian republic on the shores
of the St. Lawrence.
Later on, Sir John
Macdonald seemed favourable te 'independence.
I do not agree.
It is truce that the swift development of our
country could lead us to autonomy. But supposing that we should reach independence,
might we not have the fear of being absorbed,
or at least crushed, by the United States?
Moreover, it is very advantageous for a young
country

to be under the aegis of a powerful

nation whici an maintain ber riglts and foster
her prosperity. If Canada was independent it
would lose the support of mighty England, and
would te deprived of tieaties favourable to
trade and 'industry.
Our connection with
England is more important for us than for her.
There is most evidently no sound of antiBritish feeling in such lines.
Continuing my intrusion in the quotation
field, I come to another carving operation
made in the present debate. It was practised on a speech delivered in 1937, by Mgr.
Mozzoni, secretary of the Apostolic delegation
in Canada, during the sittings of the 15th
session of the "Social Weeks of Canada,"
held in the town of Saint Hyacinthe. This
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS.

eminent prelate was speaking of the importance and of the benevolent influence of those
sittings, and he said:
If this week is an homage to the doctrine
of the Church, it is also a proof of your anxiety
towards the magnitude of the social problems.
Such a week shall certainly be blessed, -and
shall te highly promising for your people, for
the humble worker, for the lonely tiller of the
soil, for all the associations, because you shall
work for the ýactual realization of the Church's
teachings.
Then he went on with the words quoted
during this debate:
The politicians may talk of the greatness and
the prosperity of the country under such and
such a form of government; this concerns us
but indirectly. What we do want, and what
we shall work to obtain by all our means, is
a state completely Catholic, because such a
country only can represent the ideal of hum.an
progress, and because a Catholie people lias the
right and the duty to organize itself socially
and politically according to the tenets of its
faith.
Now, if you put together the two fragments
of that speech, you must come to the conclusion that the speaker was referring to
the social progress, the social improvement,
of our Canadian classes. The "Social Week"
was eonsecrated to the study of "social"
problems, and it was those problems that the
lecturer had in his mind. It was those problems of which he was speaking, -using a
tongue that was net his mother tongue.
"Such and such a form of government" had
nothing to do with the agenda of the sittings.
At that moment, it concerned them, "but
indirectly". Speaking te a Catholie congress,
this high Catholie ddgnitary was telling how
beneficent can be the Catholie principles
and doctrines for improving the social order.
That was the purpose of his speech. Most
evidently he could net and he did not mean
that his hearers should organize a crusade to
change the Canadian constitution in order
to make of Canada a Catholic republic. Co.mmon sense is not denied even to Catholic
dignitaries.
I do not intend to speak of the deadly menace which, it appears, is threatening our free
institutions through the lethal hand of a very
dangerous secret society whose birth place was
Ottawa, but whose deleterious activity is
mainly felt in the wretched province of
Quebec. I must humbly confess that I am
net a strong admirer of those underground
stories.
Summing up the main feature of the preseet
debate. I deern that fostering Canadian unity
tas been the prime object. It is surely a noble
aim. But I should like to call the attention of
my honourable colleagues to the fact that we
may perhaps be somewhat faulty in our

JULY 19, 1944
definition of that aim. If it is Canadian
"unity" which is our patriotic goal, I am sorry
to assert that it will never be reached. Unity,
in its true sense, means "the state of being
one." That cannot be our condition. We are
not one; we are many.
The Canadian
people is composed of English-Canadians,
of French-Canadians, of Irish-Canadians, of
Scotch-Canadians and so on. We speak two
main languages. We bow to different altars.
We have neither unity of race, nor unity of
creed, nor unity of language. Of course, we
are not the authors but the heirs of that
diversity. We cannot have unity which is the
sameness of the component parts. But we
may have union, which is the harmony of
those parts.
Then, by all means, let us have union,
because union is absolutely necessary for the
future growth, the progress and happiness of
our beloved Canada. Let us have union,
strongly founded on a basis of justice, toleration and liberty-on justice, which protects
all citizens, and deals equal treatment to minorities and majorities; en toleration, which
softens controversies and teaches the mutual
respect of national beliefs and traditions; on
liberty, which secures for everyone the free
exercise of all his civil, political and religious
rights.
Such blessed union would make our country
a happy, prosperous and glorious land, a land
whose history could inspire words similar to
those which an English writer used towards
the history of England. This writer, Mr.
Hutchinson, in "If Winter Comes"-a book
which had a tremendous success twenty years
ago--speaking of a text-,book which his hero
wculd have liked to publish, devotes the following lines to an imaginary introduction:
England, this England is yours. It belongs
to you . . . it is yours and has been kept

for you. This book is to tell you how it has
come to be yours and how it has been kept

for you-not by kings or by statesmen or by
great men 'alone, but by the English .people.
Down the long years they have handed it on
to you as a torch is sent from hand to hand,
and you in your turn will hand it on down the
long years before you. They made the flame
of England bright and ever brighter for you;
and you, stepping into all that they have made
for you, will make it bright -and brighter yet.
They passed and are gone; and you will
pass and go. But England will continue. Your
England. Yours.
These are indeed beautiful words. Changing
a few of them, let us tell our generations of
young Canadians: Canada, this Canada, is
yours.

It belongs to you . . . it is yours and

has been kept for you. This book is to tell
you how it has come to be yours and how it
bas been kept for you, not by governors or
106-22J

by statesmen or by great men alone, but by
the Canadian people. Down the long years

they have handed it on to you as a torch is
sent from hand to hand, and you in turn will
hand it down the long years before you. They
made the flame of Canada bright and ever
brighter for you; and you, stepping into all
that they have made for you, will make it
bright and brighter yet. They passed and are
gone; and you will pass and go. But Canada
will continue. Your Canada. Yours.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,

it is a difficult task for me to speak after our
venerable

colleague

from

Grandrville

(Sir

Thomas Chapais), who is acknowledged to be
one of our greatest historians. I remember
that in my youth, about thirty years ago, I
had the honour to attend his lectures and to
consult him on some of our histrical problems. I have always considered myself as one
of his pupils, and to his influence I owe much
of my conception of Canadian history and
patriotisin. I have listened with great emotion to his learnedi historical sketch of our
glorious past, and I am glad to applaud the
principle he has enunciated concerning what
should be the aim of every Canadian patriot,
namely, a true brotherly union such as'exists
in Switzerland-not unity in too rigid a sense,
but rather unity in diversity.
Thanks should be accorded to our colleague
from Sorel (Hon. Mr. Davidi) for the pa'triotic
inspiration which guided him to introduce the
motion we are now discussing. Many honourable senators have epressed the conviction
that it is not possible to prepare a uniforin
text-book for use in al our different provinces;
but nobody can doubt the sincerity and
nobility of purpose which animated our
colleague when he spoke so eloquently in
support of his resolution.
Personally, I am convinced that it is necessary that proper steps be taken to develop a
truly Canadian patriotism. The teaching of
history and education in citizenship are two
kindred subjects. But various speeches which
have been made here and elsewhere, particularly in my native province, as well as
articles in the newspapers, indicate only too
plainly that we are far from having reached
any kind of unanimity in this matter.
By giving further consideration to this very
important and very interesting question in
face of the reaction produced by the debate,
I have reached the conclusion that in order to
prepare a handbook of history with the view
of developing the better and more understanding Canadian patriotism set out in the motion,
it is necessary to agree upon at least a few

SENATE
definite basic principles. It bas been remarked that it is sufficient to state the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth;
in other words, to write history accurately and
impartially. We all agree on this theory. But
when the historian comes to interpret some
very controversial issues, such, for instance, as
those indicated by our honourable colleague
from Grandville, the historian has to give bis
own personal interpretation to the documents
which lie bas studied; he has to formulate bis
own conclusions. That is, he bas to appreciate
certain more or less distant events of the past
and, so to speak, to pass judgment on them.
Writers belonging to different schools of
thought will give surprisingly different interpretations to the same facts. There are racial
and religious issues in our national annals;
there are political, social and economic problems which cannot be treated in the same way
by everyone. The philosophical background
of the historian will have a well-marked influence on lis approach to our past. However, a text-Jbook for an elementary school bas
to be conceived on a much smaller scale than
a treatise destined for more advanced children.
Let us suppose that the proposed committee of historians would first of all set itself
to the task of writing sorme kind of a patriotic
eatechism to be used for the first lessons to be
given in history.
This historical synopsis
would have to be linited to the most important facts, and it would, I think, be as dry as
dust ùnless its pages revealed the living patriotism of -the authors.
What principles would animate those writers
in trying to instil in al! young Canadians love
of their country? Let us be quite frank.
Would the writers chosen to prepare such a
text-book give first place to Canada as a free
and sovereign nation. Would they write history
from a purely Canadian point of viewand that would be my wisli-or from a British
or French-Canadian or provincial point of
view? How would such authors conceive our
relations with the rest of the Commonwealth,
or with the United States? How would they
understand the relative positions of the
Dominion Parliament and of our provincial
legislatures?
What kind of a future would
they foresee for our growing generations?
Each historian would have bis personal
opinions on all the different subjects which I
have just enumerated. Each one would try
to write bis essay honestly and objectively;
there is no question about that. But, after
all, when the writer puts all bis heart into bis
patriotie task lie finds bis inspiration in bis
personal feelings. A subjective element necessarily comes into play. Without it you may
iHon. Mr. GOUIN.

have a dead record, but you cannot have a
literary work, the embodiment of the living
work of a gifted writer, a historian who is
also at the saine time an artist belonging to
bis own time and to his own country.
To be brief, I believe that we must first of
all try fto find a common denominator by
agreeing on sorne fundamental principles to
be followed in the teaching of Canadian citizenship. I am convinced that everywhere in
Canada our children should receive a sufficient
number of lessons in civics. Only a few
provinces have adopted civics hand-booksand, not to spare the truth, those hand-books
are in no way masterpieces. The provinces
which have not yet done so should follow
a similar course. Some day, through the concerted actron of provincial authorities, it may
be possible to come to some kind of uniformity in this matter. But at all events,
every young Canadian should, without further
delay, be taught to be proud of bis country
and bis province, and to respect bis fellowcitizens of every origin, creed or class,
throughout our vast Dominion. Our youth
should grow up with a sense of veneration for
our glorious .past and of confidence in our
future. They should realize that they live in
a free democracy under a constitution
modelled upon that of Great Britain, the home
of the Mother of Parliaments. They should
have a sufficient knowledge of our democratic
institutions in the federal as well as in the
provincial field. All young Canadians should
become convinced that they enjoy the priceless privilege of living in a land with infinite
possibilities, a land where flourish the four
freedoms: freedom of conscience, freedom of
speech, ,freedom from want, and freedom from
fear.
They should believe with religious
fervour in the fatherhood of God Almighty
and in the true and comiplete brotherhood of
all their Canadian brothers and sisters. Possessing the sarne rights, bound by the same
duties towards their Canadian homeland, all
the members of our new generation should
understand that they must devote their lives
to the glory of their native land, and that,
if necessary, they must be ready to die for
the survival of our beloved country-this rich
and glorious land, where two great cultures
are destined to grow side by side, where two
great races can live in peace and harmony,
giving to the whole world an almost unparalleled example of justice and mutual understanding, of liberty, true
equality and
brotherhood.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Question!
Hon. ATHANASE DAVID: Honourable
senators, I am certain you do not expect me
to occupy your attention-

JTJIY 19, 1944
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I should like to
remind honourable members'that the honaurable senator from Sorel is now exercising his
right to conclude the debate. If any honourable senators desire ta speak, now is tihe time
to do so.
Hlon. Mr. DAVID: I rose because I was
told nobody wanted ta continue the debate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Yes; but it was
my duty ta direct the attention of honourable
members ta the fact that the honouirable
gentleman is about ta conclude the debate.
Hlon. Mr. DAVID: Il, honourable members,
discussion of' uy motion tends ta promote
greater' interest in the history of Canada, I
shal be fully satîsfied. Moreover, we have
been gratified and honoured by speechýes which,
I believe, reflect credit on this House.
The Senate, among its duties, has twa of the
utmost interest-the protection of the constitution and the defence of minorities. Presuming that ta be so, by the discussion of this
motion we should have established before the
people of Canada that we accept also, as ane
of the elementary duties of the Senate, the
responsibility of trying ta create greater
harmony and better understanding between
the citizens of Canada. The speeches which
have been made reflect not only on the Senate,
but also on the speakers. lb is always difficult
for a man ta criticize the remarks of another,
especially when long association has proven
that even though the words were harsh, the
intention was goad. But let me say this. It is
always a great mistake ta judge a people by
a noisy minarity; and I think ail honourable
members of this House, men of long experi111
ence and understanding, w admit that the
smaller the minority the greater the noise.
Even suppasing there should be in Quebec-I
will go ta the limit-a group of anti-Britishers,
why should honourable senators be surprised?
In every part of the Empire, in every part of
the Dominion you will find someone somewhere who is anti-Britîsh. But because there
may be a certain number of these people, are
we going ta condemn the whole family -of
French-Canadians in Quebec and throughout
Canada? Are we ta judge the majority of the
people of this country 'by -certain speeches
made hy certain men of provinces oither than
Quebee? I feit really sorry when the honourable senator from St. Hyacinthe (Hon. Mr.
Bouchard), acting I know withîn his rights,
launched an attack which gave the impression
in other provinces of Canada that Quebec was
dislayal. The honourable senator knows, as
we ail know, that the sole and only capital

317

certain men have ta help them achieve their
personal goal or attain their political ends is
fanaticism, chauvinism and prejudice.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Hlear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Why should we not act
aur raies as we do ini a family? Because a
son is unworthy we do not have the right ta
insult the mother; and if something has ta be
said, we say it within the family. Often I
have drawn criticism upon myself in the
province of Quebec because I have stated
truths ta may campatriats which I have thought
they should hear; but autside of the family of
Quebec 1 always have defended and always
will defend that province.
Now, hanourable senators, desirous as I arn
ta avoid detaining you tao long or impasing
upon your benevolence, there are ane or two
points which I should like ta bring ta your
attention. On the question of ecanomny, as
ta which a few words were said nat o! critieismn
but of doubt, I think the answer was given
perfectly last evening by the honourable senatar fram Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte).
Before caming ta that point, hawever, may I
tell the honaurable senatar from Grandville
(Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais) that I have for
him personally the greatest respect and the
greatest esteem. He is a historian o! note,
and it was because of my 'belief in his impartiality, which I still retain, that I thought it
possible ta find in the other provinces historians of his calibre-impartial and goad
writers who could make a text-book which
wouId be acceptable ta aIl the provinces of
Canada.
Same Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID- Nothing that men o!
good will desire ta accamplish is impassible.
Evidence of this I shall try ta give. For centuries, off and on, flot cantinually, the Scandinavian countries--Finland, Sweden, Norway
and Denmark-had been at war. After the
conclusion of the Armistice of 1918-no one
could speak of the peace of 1918-the League
of Nations studied the possibility o! eliminating fromn all the text-books af the world
everything that would incite people ta, hate and
spite, and the first ta make a real effort in this
direction were the Scandinavian peoples. The
four cauntries referred ta nominated a coinmiittee of historians ta prepare a text-hook,
which they did, and this book to-day is used
in Finland, in Norway, in Sweden and in
Denmark. Now, honourable senators, if it is
possible for four countries with very great
differences in mentality, and great differences
in their good qualities and faults, ta corne ta
a conclusion and accept a uniform text-book,

318

SENATE

should it not be easier for us in a country like
this? At various times there have been between the two groups, the two nationalities
in Canada, diversities of opinion, and sometimes inbred bad feeling; but is there anything that should or could stop historians as
impartial as the honourable senator from
Grandville from meeting together and agreeing
on facts?
I have before me a book which I consider
of great value to Canada. The writer, although
of English descent, when lie comes to discuss
problems affecting the province of Quebec or
other provinces does so in a very dispassionate
manner, and I modestly and humbly suggest
that with that thesis, with the reading of this
book, the historians of to-morrow who would
form the Committee could arrive at-not a
history of Canada; and this is where I should
like to make a distinction-but a text-book
that would, be absolutely different. While I
am on this point, and leaving aside the book
for a moment, may I say there is nothing
implying that when the text-book is adopted in
Nova Scotia, say, or in Quebee, the educational
authorities of the province would be deprived
of the right to add to the text-book one, two,
three, four, even fifty chapters; but is it not
possible, in erecting the house which I call
Canadian patriotism, to have the same foundation in every province?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: When a man is a hero in
British Columbia, surely Le is a hero in
Quebec. If Le is a hero in Quebec, surely he
is a hero in Ontario. Therefore I believe that
as far as the foundation is concerned, the historians to be chosen would very easily agree
on a resumé, a synthesis that could be and
would be acceptable to all provinces.
I come to one part of this book which I
submitted to my very good and honourable
friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger), who
said there may be a little divergence of opinion
on one word. Here is the book "Building the
Canadian Nation", by George W. Brown, Professor of History at the University of Toronto.
As you well know, one of the great subjects
of discussion in the province of Quebec for
years past Las been the expulsion of the
Acadians. It is not easy to erase that incident
from our history; it is there to remain; and
to deny that it was a serious and great error
would be to deny historical truth. But it is
for you to judge whether the opinion of your
humble servant, who himself is descended from
a mother whose ancestors were Acadians, is
prejudiced. I shall leave Mr. Brown to speak
on the question, just to show my honourable
friend from Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

Chapais) that impartiality is possible in
Ontario, as in Quebec and in every other province of Canada.
From the military point of view the decision
miglit be justified because the Acadians had
stubbornly refused to take the oath of allegiance
and the colony needed to be strengthened for
the coming struggle against France. but it was
a harsh decision and bas no other justification.
The expulsion of the Acadians is the only sucL
incident to mar the history of Canada. .

.

.

None the less it is distressing. Perhaps, if it
has had any good results, it has strengthened
the deep-conviction which Canadians Lold to-day
that no quarrel between races or nations can be
permanently settled by the inhuman treatment
of helpless people.
I have seldom seen in any .French-Canadian
text-book a fairer comment on the expulsion
of the Acadians.
The honourable senator from Grandville
(Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais) spoke eloquently
of the past glories of Quebec. Honourable
senators, I am unable to recall having met
in the last thirty years a single Canadian of
English descent who, if acquainted with the
history of Canada, Las not spoken in admiration of the glories of Quebec. It would be
well if all Canadians, wherever they may be
living, were familiar with the glorious pages
in Quebec's history. Would it not also be
well for the people of Quebec to know about
the heroes of British Columbia. of the
Prairies, of Ontario and of the Maritimes?
Is it fair that certain text-books should carry
their story no farther tLan 1910, and that
to-day, during the second world war, young
boys who are using them should find nothing
in them about the first world war? I am
satisfied that many young boys using such
text-books do not even know the names of
the great Canadian Generals of the first world
war, and have never heard of such Canadian
heroes as Bishop and Brilland, both winners
of the V. C. That is why I said, when moving
my resolution, that the history of Canada is
badly taught; and I have no hesitation in
repeating that statement.
The honourable senator from Kingston
(Hon. Mr. Davies) Las referred to receiving
a letter in which it was suggested that if the
proposed committee is set up a number of
edtcators ought to be appointed to it.
I
entirely agree with that. I think that the
historians chosen to prepare the text-book
should be advised by educators as to the way
in which facts should be presented to students.
One person, evidently from my own province, wrote that if the proposed text-book
were prepared, the representatives of the
majority race would make sure that its errors
were not mentioned in it.
Well, that is

319

JULY 19, 1944
chi1dish. History, as was said by the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Sir
Thomas Chapais) is the narration of facts.
If an error has in fact been made, whether
in Quebec or Ontario, it should be mentioned
in a text-book, for to know of an error made
in the past may help us to avoid committing
a similar one in the future.
Honourable senators, for the closing words
of a text-book could any sentence be better
designed to encourage the proper teaching of
history in Canadaà than the statement which
is to be found at the conclusion of Thers'
magnificent History of the French Revolution?
I apologize for the translation I was obliged
to make:
We have written without ha-te, depfloring
errors, exalting virtue, admairing greatness, trying to grasp the profound designs of Providence
in the fate rtserved to us and respecting them
when thinking we underetood them.
Let this he henceforth the mot de passe of
aIl Canadians.
Hon. T. D. BOUCHARD: Honourable senators, 1 rise to a question of privilege. The
honourable senator who lias just spoken eaid
that if a son is blameworthy, that does not
give the other members of the family the
right to insult their mother; and that questions on which the family disagree should be
dîscussed only at home. I want to protest
against the implication of those words. Since
making my speech in the Senate I have been
vilified outside of the flouse. I shahl reply
outside of the flouse. At the moment I
simply want to say that wlien a FrenchiCanadian speaks in. the Senate he is speaking
in lis own home. The country of Frenchi
Canadians, as of ail other Canadians, extcnds
from the Atlantic to the Pacifie and from the

My national family is the Canadian family,
composed of Canadians of French origin and
of every other racial origîn. In saying what I
did here I do not thînk I insulted, my national
mother. In the Senate I am at home, and
when I speak here I am speaking to my
brothers.

CANADA-UNITED STATES 0F AMERICA
TAX CONVENTION BILL, 1944
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bull 159, an Act respecting a certain Tai
Convention between Canada and the United
States of America, signed at Ottawa, in the
Dominion of Canada, on the eighth day of
June, 1944.
fie aaid: Honourable senators, the object
of this Bill is to confirmn by legislative action
the convention entered into on the Sth of
June this year between Cana-da and the United
States. My honourable friend from Toronto
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) lias been kind enough to
undertake to explain this Bill to the Senate.
The measure is highly technical, and lie will,
I am sure, give honourable members a satisfactory explanation.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators,
this Bill gives approval and force of law to
a tax convention with regard to succession
duties, entered into between Canada and the

320

SENATE

United States on the 8th of June this
year. At the present time if a person domiciled in Canada held at his death assets in the
United States as well as in this country, his
estate might be liable to succession duty, first,
in the province in which he resided; second,
to Dominion succession duty; third, to succession duty in the state in which any assets
were located, and, fourth, to United States
federal inheritance tax. So in these circumstances there might be four taxing jurisdictions
biting into the estate of a Canadian.- In our
income tax Act we have had for some time a
provision for reciprocity as between the two
countries, covering Canadians in receipt of
income in United States and Americans in
receipt of income in this country. The tax
convention that we are now asked to approve
would extend that principle of reciprocity to
succession duties, in so far as the Dominion
Government is concerned in Canada and the
federal authority is concerned in the United
States.
The convention provides that, for the purposes of Dominion succession duty in Canada
and of federal estate tax in the United States,
real property shall be taxed only in the jurisdiction where it is located. So if a Canadian
citizen dies leaving real property in the United
States, it will be subject to succession duty
only in that country. Shares in companies
are to be treated as property in the jurisdiction
where the company was organized. Therefore,
if the assets of a Canadian estate include shares
in a company organized in the United States,
they will be regarded as being situated within
the United States; and of course the same
principle will apply conversely where the
assets of an American estate include shares in
a company organized in Canada.
The salient features to which I think I should
direct attention are the credit provisions and
the exemptions. I must admit that it took me
a little while, with the aid of a pencil and
some scratching, to work out exactly how the
credit provisions are applied. For the benefit
of honourable senators I shall attempt to give
an illustration, based on data furnished to me
by an official engaged in the administration of
federal succession duties.
In the case of a Canadian, domiciled in
Canada, dying and owning property in the
United States as well as in Canada, you calculate the credit his estate is entitled to in
this way. First, you take the total value of
the United States assets, other than real
property, which are taxed by Canada, and you
relate that value to the value of the total
assets held in the United States at the time
of the testator's death. The percentage you
arrive at may be 100 per cent if there is no
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

real property; it may be less if there is real
property. That is the percentage of the
United States tax paid by the estate which it
is entitled to deduct from the Canadian succession duties.
Let us take the case of a Canadian, who at
the time of his death was domiciled in Canada
and owned real property in the United States
to the value of $50,000, and stocks ta the value
of $100,000. He owned other property, not
situated in the United States, to a value of,
say, $600,000. Thus the total value of the
estate, wherever situated, is $750,000. The
Dominion succession duty-which even under
this tax convention would be calculated on all
property which the deceased person held anywhere, except real property located in the
United States-would amount to $90,000. The
United States tax would amount to $15,000.
To arrive at your credit on Canadian succession duty you take the total property situated
in the United States, consisting of real property
and stocks to the value of $150,000. The total
property value taxable by Canada is only
$100,000, because Canada does not tax the
real property situated in the United States.
Then you put the $100,000 over the $150,000,
and you get 10 over 15, or two-fifths.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Two-thirds.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am sorry, twothirds. You calculate two-thirds of this
$15,000, which is the federal estate tax on that
estate 'in the United States. Therefore the
credit to which that estate would be entitled
in Canada would be two-thirds of $15,000, or
$10,000.
To the extent that the convention provides
for a reduction in taxes in these circumstances,
I think it is a step in the right direction. It
may not go so far as we feel it should go, and
probably there should be further reciprocity
as between the provinces and each state in
the United States. But to the extent that it
does go in the direction of lightening the
burden of taxation where estates are subject
to so many death and succession duties, I
think we cannot but commend the principle
of the Bill.
Now then, as to exemptions. A person in
Canada, for instance, who had a portion of his
estate in the United States would be entitled
to exemptions based on the relationship of the
estate in the United States to the total estate.
And conversely, the same in Canada. I asked
the official to work out an illustration for me.
We took a person domiciled in the United
States who died leaving total property
wherever situate, of $100,000, and, assets in
Canada of $25,000. Now, a widow would be
entitled in Canada to an exemption of 20,000,

JULY 20, 1944
and a cbild under 18, to $5,000. 'In these
circumstances you calculate the percentage
which the $25,000 estate in Canada bears to
the total estate of $100,000, and that is the
percentage of the exemption to which the
estate of a Ujnited States citizen dying in the
United States would be entitled ini Canada.
And it works conversely. In these circumstances, where the estate was of that size,
twenty-five one-hundredths would mean an
exemption of 85,000 for a widow.
Now, I do not think these things are apparent from a casual reading; but that is the way
the convention works.
It recognizes the
principle that the country of domicile is
entitled to tax ail the property owned by the
deceased at the time of his death, except, in
the case of a Canadian, real property situated
in the United States, or conversely, in the case
of an American, real property situated in Canada. Also, in accordance with the termis of
this convention, the United States undertakes,
in the case of a deceased person other than a
citizen of the United States who at the time
of bis death was domiciled in Canada, to tax
only property situated in the United States.
And there is a recîprocal undertaking on the
part of Canada.
There is a provision in the convention for
excbange of information, and while I for one
have very strong views on the secrecypossibly "secrecy" is not the word-as to
how closely information with respect to a
man's personal affairs should be guarded, it
seems necessary for the working out of this
convention that there sbould be some met'hod
for the giving of information by the United
States if, in the course of investigation of
an American estate, it is found to include
some Canadian assets; and conversely by Canada, if a Canadian estate is found to contain
United States assets. So the convention provides for an exchange of information.
The convention hes not yet been ratifled
by the UJnited States Government. It is in
progress af being ratifled here. After ratification by both governments it will become 'law,
effective as of the date of the commencement
of our Dominion Succession Duties Act, which
takes us back to the l4th of June, 1941. So to
some extent it is retroactive.
Now, the Bill itself provides for certain
regulations which the Minister of National
Revenue, who will administer the Act, may
deem necessary from time to time for the purpose of properly carrying into effect ail the
provisions of the Bill and the tax convention.
Those are the two main features to which
I think it is important that I should caîl attention, and I hope the explanation given may
prove of some benefit to tbe Senate.

321

I would suggest that after second reading
the Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, because I
think possibly we should have some of the
officiaIs present to explain in some detail the
working of the measure.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, I sbould like to make two or tbree observations with respect ta this proposed Bill.
First of ail, I think this legishation is overdue.
We in this country have realized how important it bas been to have new capital come
into tbe country for in-vestment purposes.
We have been fortunate, I tbink, in having a
great deal of United States capital come to
Canada for investmýent, American investors
feeling that there is great security for investment in tbis country.
During recent years many investors of funde
in Canada have realized that before deatb they
must witbdraw those funds, otberwise tbey
are likely to be caýnflscated by duplicate taxation. This Bill gaes as far as this Parliament
is able to go, 'but it does nat go far enough.
The relief must came from tbe provinces. Tbe
provinces bave used every means, fair and unfair, I think, to extract money from foreign
investars in this country. May I illustrate
tbepoint? Many United States investors have
invested money in tbe gold mining incLustry
of Ontario. Under the former law, wbere a
carnpany bad a transfer office in the United
States, tbese investors could transfer tbeir
securities in the United States witbout becaming liable ta succession duties in Canada.
The provinces attempted ta collect succession
dýuties -in some of these cases. In one, which
,went as far as the Privy Council, decision was
given against the provinceý. It was held. that
so long as tbe transfer agency was out of tbe
country tbe situs of the sbares was in the
United States, the succession took place in the
United States, and the holder of the shares
was entitled te transfer them witbout becoming
liable to dluty in Canada. Two provinces, MY
own province in particular, passed regulations
whicb to my mind were comple.tely unfair and
had tbe eff ect in many cases of discouraging
people from investing in Canada. The regulations wbich Ontario put in force-and they
have not yet been tried out in any high court,
tbougb there is a recent decision invalidating
them---say in effect tbat unless tbe transfer
office is in the state in wbich the deceased
resides the duties shaîl be collected in Ontario.
I believe there is a similar regulation and law
in tbe province of Quebec.
Now, I bo.pe tbe provinces may take lead
from the legielation wbich. is proposed here,
and tbe convention which has been adopted

SENATE
between Canada and the United States.
What we require in this country is a free exchange of money. The free exchange of
money is as important to us as the free exchange of goods, and many of us in the legal
profession recently have seen cases in which
people, in order to preserve their assets, have
been forced to withdraw money from Canada
so as to put their estates in order in preparation for death. I had many conversations
with people throughout the United States before this legislation was proposed, in which
they pointed out that under the circumstances
which exist by reason of such a duplication of
taxation it was impossible for them to advise
investors to put their money in Canada.
In my opinion the governments of the two
countries are to be congratulated upon entering into a convention of this sort, which is so
essential in view of the close relationship of
the two countries. Such a convention is extremely important at this time. A similar
convention should also be entered into between
the provinces and the United States, because
we are going to face a post-war period in which
we are bound to enjoy an expansion of trade
and to invite capital to this country. As many
of us already know, the people of the United
States have great confidence in our financial
structure, in our banking system, and in our
governments.
Therefore, before closingthough it is not just on the point, possiblymay I be permitted, to say that the only
thing that stands in the way of prosperity and
development of this country beyond anything
we have ever contemplated is a radical and
unstable government. If that comes about,
it will disturb business and discourage
investment in this country; but it seems to
me that the convention which has now been
entered into is an indication cf the willingness
of Canada and of the United States to get
into closer co-operation in the economie life
of this continent.
Hon. W. R. DAVIES: Honourable senators,
I have listened with great interest to the two
honourable senators from Toronto who have
discussed this Bill. I agree with them both
that it is a step in the right direction. However, I have risen to my feet this afternoon to
suggest that it might be well if the government of this country were to take steps along
the same lines in another direction, namely,
towards the Mother Country, Great Britain.
It may surprise honourable senators te know
that while we have reciprocal income tax
arrangements with the United States, and are
now going to enter into a reciprocal succession
duty arrangement with that country, which
technically is a foreign country, we have no
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

arrangement whatsoever with Great Britain.
We did before the war, I believe, under some
convention of the League of Nations, have
some sort of reciprocal income tax arrangement with the Republic of France; but we
have never had one with Great Britain.
The honourable senator fron Toronto who
sits to my left (Hon. Mr. Campbell) has said
we want to try to encourage capital to come
into this country after the war. I quite agree
with him in that. But if we expect to encourage capital from overseas, should we not
try to make some arrangements which will be
as favourable as those we have made with the
country to the south of us?
At the present time many Americans have
summer homes in the province of Ontarioprobably in other provinces as well, but I
speak of the province in which I live-and
those Americans can come into Ontario and
spend the entire summer at their summer
homes and never be charged here with income
tax. Many Canadian citizens, including some
honourable senators, have winter homes in
Florida. Those citizens, I believe, can go
down to the United States and spend their
winters there without any restriction and
without being assessed for income tax. But
such a situation does net obtain in regard to
the Mother Country. I am quite well aware
that there is a far greater exchange of
population between Canada and the United
States than there is between Canada and
Great Britain. Nevertheless, when you inquire, you find that a large number of people
are affected by the condition which I mention.
A general who bad a very distinguished record
in the last war, an Englishman who had an
estate in Great Britain, made a trip to
Canada; he liked it here, and bought a very
large farm net fifty miles from the city of
Toronto. Prier to the war he was spending
six months of each ycar on his estate in Great
Britain and the other six months on his farm
near Toronto. I discussed the matter of
succession duties with him, and he was very
much puzzled. He said, "Frankly, I do net
know what would happen if I were to die in
Canada." He felt that his domicile was in
Great Britain. As we all know, domicile is a
difficult question, one that is sometimes hard
to decide. About fifty miles from my city
there lives a drover who before the war
carried on a cattle business with Great Britain.
He purchased a large farm, sema twenty-five
or thirty miles from Liverpool, te which he
shipped his cattle, and at certaie times he
resided in a house on the farm. In discussions
with me he has often said he wondered what
would happen te his estate if ie were to die
in England.

JULY 20, 1944
While we are making conventions and
treaties with the country to the south of us
we might see if something could not be done
along the same lile with the Mother Country-or perhaps I should say Great Britain, for
it is not the mother country of many of our
citizens. Its income tax regulations are much
stricter than many Canadians suspect. If a
Canadian visits Great Britain in four successive
years, he becomes liable to the British income tax. A distinction is drawn between,
as it is termed, a resident and an ordinary
resident, and one's classification is arbitrarily
decided at Somerset House.
Some Canadians, domiciled in this country,
have real estate or other property in Great
Britain, and if they should happen to die over
there the British authorities would no doubt
collect succession duties. I am a strong believer in succession duties, but I believe they
should be paid to the government of the country in which the deceased earned his money.
The amount of money a man earns depends
not only upon his own work and ability, but
upon conditions prevailing in the country
where he lives. People who have acquired
property in Canada, for instance, were helped
by conditions which they would not have
found on a desert island. I believe it is not
fair that an estate should be taxed for sucession duties by a country which has contributed
nothing to the building up of the estate.
At the present time estates in the province
of Ontario, and, I believe, in every other
province, are liable to at least two succession
duty taxes. The rules and regulations governing Dominion succession duties are different
from those governing provincial succession
duties. Upon the death of a Canadian domiciled in Ontario, his estate, if worth more
than a certain amount, would be liable to
succession duties, first, to the Dominion and,
secondly to the province; and the province
makes no allowance for any tax that an estate
has paid to the Dominion. Furthermore,
while the Dominion exempts gifts made more
than three years prior to the donor's death,
the Ontario Government taxes gifts made as
far back as 1897. Suppose that forty years
ago an Ontario man gave to his daughter,
on the occasion of her marriage, a little house
worth three or four thousand dollars, his
estate will be liable to the province for succession duties on that gift. That seems to
me to be quite ridiculous. This whole matter
might well be revised after the war.
I feel that in any event there should not
be double succession duties within the British
Commonwealth of Nations. Canada is an
equal partner with Great Britain and other
members of the Commonwealth. We have

323

played a highly important part in this war.
We have ma-de several gifts of a billion dollars
each to Great Britain, and we ought to be
able to arrange-at least we should try to
arrange-with that country a reciprocal tax
agreement such as this one with the United
States. It would be a grand thing if at the
peace conference a reciprocal tax agreement
were made between all nations or at least
between the Allied nations. But if that should
prove impossible, representatives of the British
Commonwealth certainly ought to be able te
sit around a table and devise reciprocal conventions, covering both income tax and succession duties, for the countries of the Commonwealth. We who are Allies in war should
continue to be Allies in peace, and be willing
to give and take in the matter of taxation.
I am inclined to believe that such a convention would be warmly welcomed by the
Canadian taxing authorities.
Honourable senators, I quite approve of this
convention with the United States, and rose
simply to urge that we try to make similar
conventions with members of the British
Commonwealth.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I had a question to ask of the honourable
gentleman who introduced this Bill (Hon.
Mr. Hayden), but I see he has left the
Chamber. I take it for granted that the
Government had no difficulty in arranging this
convention with the United States.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am not competent to
answer. I expect negotiations were carried
on in the ordinary way.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: From what I know of
business I should think that American investments in Canada are very much greater than
Canadian investments in thé United States,
and that therefore this agreement is all in
favour of the United States.
Hon. Mr. KING: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Well, to the degree that
American investments in this country exceed
Canadian investments in the United States.
There may be ten, twenty, thirty or forty
times as much American money invested in
Canada as Canadian money invested in the
United States. Whatever the ratio may be,
the convention is to that degree more profitable to the United States. I am not objecting
to the contract-I think it is along the right
lines-but we should not flatter ourselves that
we are getting something. We are on the
giving end of the contract. I am quite in
accord with what was said by my honourable
friend from Kingston (Han. Mr. Davies) as

SENATE
to the advisability of arranging a convention
with Great Britain, but if we succeeded in
that we should be on the giving end again.
What struck me in the speech of the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
was the compliment he paid to the Government for entering into this convention with
the United States. But the Government bas
donc nothing to remedy the succession duty
situation as between the Dominion and the
provinces, a situation which is far worse than
that as between Canada and the United
States. Let me illustrate. Suppose a man in
Manitoba were to die owning real estate in
that province and stock in companies with
head offices in Ontario and Quebec. His estate
would be taxed for succession duties by the
Dominion, and by the province of Manitoba,
Ontario and Quebec. There is an opportunity
for the Dominion Government to step in and
do some really valuable work in clearing up
this state of affairs. I have in mind one
instance where tax payments were made to
the Dominion and every one of the nine
provinces, as well as to four states across
the line.
As a practising lawyer I consider that the
imposition of succession duties by the
Dominion and the provinces make it impossible for a family concern to carry on after
the death of the principle owner. The
trustees simply have to sell out the business
in order to meet the charges for succession
duties and income taxes. No other feature of
our economic system is so disruptive as this
multiple succession duty tax. It induces men
to make gifts during their lifetime, within
limits controlled to some extent by the income
tax regulations. While I congratulate the
Government upon having made this convention with the United States, I say again that
the condition at home is far worse than the
one the convention seeks to remedy.
Now, on the side, may I just say a few
words along the political line to my honourable
friends opposite. If the present Government
is not returned to power in the next election,
its defeat will be attributable chiefly to the
taxing laws that it has made. Every time the
question comes up it raises trouble. People
will ask: "Why did the Dominion Government
come into the succession duty field, when the
provinces are already in that field? Why did
it not enter into some arrangement with the
provinces for the making of one assessment
to cover all succession duties on every estate?"
After a man or woman dies, the trustees of
the estate prepare information in answer to
questions asked by the Dominion succession
duties office. Then a wholly different set of
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

questions will have to be answered for the
province of Ontario, or any other province
in which the deceased had assets.
When there has to be a transfer of ownership in an Ontario company's stock certificates,
the trustees may run into considerable difficulty with the succession duties office in that
province. I understand that much less trouble
has been encountered in that connection in
the last year or so, but formerly it used to be
really serious. There never was anything like
as much trouble with the succession duties
office in Quebec. I say candidly that the
Quebec department deals with these matters on
a business basis. When dealing with them you
did not feel, as you did when dealing with
Ontario, that they were after you.
I earnestly urge the Government to take up
this question of succession duties. At present
the combined charge on an estate is tremendous. I agree with my honourable friend from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) that succession
duties should be paid to the country in which
the taxable assets were accumulated, for the
testator was protected by the laws of that
country and benefited from the general business conditions existing there. The difficulty
is that we are not able to get a uniform
succession duty that the ordinary estate can
bear. The insurance companies have tried to
meet the difficulty by selling policies payable
to provincial treasurers, but the Dominion
taxes the proceeds of those policies just as if
they were paid to private individuals; the
provinces do not.
I honestly think that the Dominion Govern,
ment never was entitled to succession duties.
Since every estate is accumulated in one or
more provinces, succession duties are a source
of revenue that should have been left entirely
to the provincial authorities. I take the
opposite view with regard to income tax,
which I say should be payable to the
Dominion and not to the provinces.
At present succession duties are so formidable that they strike at the root of our
business organizations and discourage enterprise. Every province in which an estate has
assets grabs a portion of them. The matter
is so complicated that it should be dealt with
by the federal Government. I shall vote for
the Bill and I ask my fellow-members to do
so; but I say that after the war the Dominion
should take the lead in bringing about the
long overdue revision of our succession duty
laws.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
I quite agree with the acting leader on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Haig) with regard to
succession duties. It seems to me quite unfair

325

JULY 20, 1944
that more than one province should be able
to collect such duties from any estate. That
was my honourable friend's main point?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: His objection applies
also to the provinces farther west. I recall
the case of a resident in Ontario whose estate
was subject to succession duty not only in
that province but in Alberta, and of course
to the Dominion levy as well.
My honourable friend stated that we must
not be too proud of this convention because
he imagined that after all the United States
is getting the better of the bargain, since
United States investments in Canada are
probably greatly in excess of Canadian investments in the United States. I believe he is
perfectly correct. But I do not think you
can keep an ordinary ledger balance in regard
to these things. I will give him an instance
where the shoe is on the other foot. A few
years ago we had a convention with the
United States under which each Government
taxed dividends at 5 per cent. United States
companies dediucted 5 per cent from the
dividends of their Canadian investors and paid
this into the United States treasury. Conversely, Canadian companies deducted 5 per
cent from the dividends of their United States
shareholders and remitted to the Canadian
treasury. I do not know who was to blame
for changing this arrangement, but unfortunately we raised the tax to 15 per cent.
The United States promptly retaliated by
raising its tax.to 171 per cent, and later on to
27J per cent. This heavy impost, it seems to
me, was both unwise and unfair from the point
of view of the Canadian and also of the
American investor. If the tax had gone into
our own treasury it would not have been so
bad, but because there was more American
money invested in Canada than Canadian
money invested in the United States, the
greater portion of the tax went to the United
States treasury. Under a later convention we
have a reciprocal arrangement whereby each
country collects a tax of 15 per cent. I am
sorry the old rate of 5 per cent was not
restored. I think that, on the basis of his own
argument, my honourable friend will admit
that in this particular case Canada is getting
the advantage.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Correct.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I add, by way of
mild reproach, that it seems to me his argument in support of uniformity of taxation
might also be urged in favour of uniformity
of franchise.

Hon. JAMES -MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I know very little about succession
duties, but I might give a concrete illustration
to show what the provinces are doing in this
regard. I happen to be the executor of a comparatively small estate of some five or six
years' standing. The estate included some
stock in Canada Car, originating in Quebec. I
paid to the Ontario Government $273 succession duty on that stock, and a similar amount
to the Quebec Government. In respect to a
small holding of stock in Nova Scotia, that
province and Ontario each took its share of
succession duties. A little later, in order to
provide cash for the estate, I had to sell that
small holding, and it realized less than the
succession duties paid to those two provinces.
If the Provincial Governments would take
steps to put an end to this double taxation,
they would undoubtedly be moving in the
right direction.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. King, the Bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
SALARIES BILL
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

Hon. J. H. KINIG moved the third reading
of Bill 160, an Act to amend the Salaries Act.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: I move in
amendment to the motion, that the Bill be
not now read the third time, but that it be
referred to the Committee of the Whole House
for consideration forthwith.
The amendment was agreed to, and the
Senate went into committee on the Bill, Hon.
Mr. Sinclair in the Chair.
On section 1-salaries of Ministers:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Ministers of National
Defence for Air and of National Defence for
Naval Services are not mentioned. How are
those Ministers paid?
Hon. 'Mr. COPP: They come under the
Department of National Defence Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is a salary of
$10,000 for the Minister of National Defence.
Hon. Mr. KING: Under the Department of
National Defence Act provision is made for
the salaries of the Minister for Air and the
Minister for Naval Services.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But they are not included
in this Bill.
The section was agreed to.

326

SENATE

On section 2 ,-Minister of Pensions and
National Health.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Why is it necessary to
continue the salary of the Minister of Pensions and Nation-al Health, while there is no
mention of the other Ministers? I do not
know, but I surmise that this is to ratify
payment of salary for which there was no
legislative authority. I have no objection to
the Bill, but I think we should ratify what has
been done. Therefore I would suggest that
the section be amended along these lines: the
payment of salaries heretofore made to the
Minister of Pensions and National Health is
hereby ratified and confirmed, and soi forth.
Hon. Mr. KING: I was Minister of the
Department of Pensions and National Health
when it was constituted in 1927 or 1928, and, I
have no doubt ýthat provision was then made
for the salary of the Minister. Previously
there had been a De.partment of Soldiers'
Civil Re-establishment and a Department of
National Health, which departments were
merged into the Deipartment of Pensions and
National Health. If that is the only question
my honourable friend has in mindî, I would
suggest that the Committec rise and report
progress and ask, leave to sit again. In the
meantirne we can clarify the point.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It is not important, and
I do not want to cause any delay, but unless
my surmise is correct I see no reason why
there should be provision to continue the
salary in that particular case and not in others.
If we are to pass legislation to confirm somethng, it seeems to me we shouid do it properly
and go back and ratify what bas been done in
the past, and also authorize what is to be
done in the future.
Hon. Mr. KING: I have no doubt there is
authorization for the payment of the Minister
of National Health and Welfare. It is
intended that the old department shall disappear and that two new departrnents shall
be set up, one under the Minister of National
Health and Welfare and the other under the
Minister of Veterans Affairs. It is intended
that for this session the present provision shall
continue.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: But that would automatically continue until the Act comes into
force. I cannot sec that this is anvthing
but a ratification; and if it is, I think it should
be donc right.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Am I right in assurning
that my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. King)
was at one time a very valuable Minister of
Pensions and National Health of this country?
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. KING: I had the honcur of being
the Minister.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: And that he received his
pay?
Hon. Mr. KING: If my honourable friend
opposite insists-Hon. Mr. LEGER: No, I am not insisting.
Section 2 was agreed to.
The preamble was agreed to.
On the title:
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will the Leader of the
Government undertake to give me an answer
to my question?
Hon. Mr. KING: I will. I shall do that.
The Bill was reported without amendment.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shall said Bill be read the third

Hon. Mr. KING: Now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time, and passed.
AERONAUTICS BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 133, an Act to amend the Aeronautics
Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I have just
a few remarks to make in regard to this Bill,
the purpose of which is to amend the Aeronautics Act. That Act was passed in 1927, and
under it civil aviation in Canada has been
carried on to this time. When we consider the tremendous development that has
taken place throughout the world, especialIly
within the last four years, not only in the
matter of civil aviation but in war aviation,
we must realize the importance at this time
of giving very careful consideration to all
matters pertaining to aviation not only in
Canada but elsewhere. This matter is one
which probably will require the most careful
consideration of all governments within the
next year or two.
The Bill before us deals with matters pertaining to our own dornestic field. The
Government have thought it wise to set up
a committee of experts to carefully study
aviation and its development in Canada, and
from time to time to advise the Minister, and
through him, the Government, of developments
and changes within our own country.

327

JULY 20, 1944
We are ail conversant with what took place
in the early days of railway transportation,
and later in the matter of bus transportation.
To-day we have before us a field which is
fairiy clear of the obstacles which confronted
us in other fields in earlier days. At least we
have the experience of the past ta guide us.
In 1943, the Goverument, through the Prime
Minister, not only indicated ta Parliament the
Government's view in regard ta international
and domestic aviation but also placed before
the people of Canada proposais that woud
give them an opportunity and the time-more
particuiarly the time-to consider the procedure ta be foliowed with regard ta aviation in
its broader sense. Then again this year, the
Minister of Munitions spoke at great length in
another place on this subject. Policies have
been laid down which, naturally, *will cause
some controversy and some discussion; but as
far as the Bill before us is concerned, it simply
proposes that a body be, set up to advise the
Minister, fr.om tîme ta time, and through hîm
the Goverament, of developments in air transport in Canada. A study wili be made of this
great country, which extends fromn the Atlantic
ta the Pacific-a country which must and
probabiy wiIi deveiop more rapidly than any
other country in the world after .the war. It is
for this reason that it is thought wise ta set.up
an Air Transport Board.
It is aiso proposed that this Board shahl
administer and make regulations regarding the
granting of licences, the type and character of
services, rates, safety precautions and other
matters related ta aviation. The Bill fairiy
weli explains itself, and should, I believe,
commend itself ta the favourable consideration
of the Senate.
As the subject matter of the Bill is of
great importance, when the Bill has received
second reading, I arn going ta move that it be
referred ta the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, where there
will be opportunity for further discussion of
the variaus sections and clauses of the Bill so
that they may receive the consideration they
menit.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable seRators,
as. we are gaing ta meet on Monday next, I
beg ta move the adjournment of the dehate.
I do not think it will delay the Bill
unnecessarily.
Hon. Mr. KING: Ail right.
The m<otion was agreed ta, and the debate
was adjourned.

TRANSPORT BILL

considering.
lion. Mr. HAIG: Carried.
Hon. Mr. KING: It simply takes out~ the
words "Air" and "Air Service" wherever they
appear in the Transport Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It just straightens out the
wording.

read the second time.

for one-twelfth of the individual items set
forth in the main estimates. However, as to
the legislative branch and the ýDepartment of
Mines and Resources, one-sixth is ,provided

CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT BILL

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

DEPARTMFDNT OF NATIONAL HEALTH
AND WELFARE BILL
SECOND READING

iHon. J. H. KING moved the. second reading
of Bill 149, an Act to establish a Department
of National Health and Welfare.
He said: Honourable senators, it wili be
recalled that the Speech from the Throne expressed the view that three departments
should be set up to deal with post-war planning: a Department of Veteran's Affairs, a
Department of Reconstruction and a Department of Social Welfare. Bills to establish the
first two of these departments have already
been passed, and the object of this measure is

JULY 24, 1944
establish the third department, whose titie
is to be, nlot Social Welfare, but National
f0

Health and Welfare. We ail know that according to our Constitution public health cornes

within the jurisdiction of the provincial governrnents, but certain matters, such as quarantine, immigration and the confrol over a number of drugs, fall within the purview of the
Dominion Government and have been administered by the federal Department of Health.
If is infended that that deparfmenf, which has
been in existence since 1920 and for some
years has been administerecl in association, wifh
the Department of Pensions, shall be broughf
within this new department.
I believe it will be generally admitted that
alfhough jurisdiction in matters of health rests
with the provinces, there is a national field
in which useful service can be rendered, and
thaf the federal department bas done good
wôrk towards improving health conditions

throughout Canada.

Personally 1 look for-

ward f0 the day when there will be a
research branch at Ottawa or sornewhere else,
under federal control, f0 carry on scientifie
investigation into ail questions affecfing the
health of our country. This is a very wide
field, and I think it would be unwise, even if
it were possible, for the provinces to undertake work :of that character.
-I desire f0 caîl attention f0 section 8 of the
Bill, which reads:
Nothing in this Acf or in any regulafions
mvade hereunder ehaîl authorize the Minister
or any officer of the Deparfmenf to exercise any
jurisdiction or control over any provincial or
miunicipal board of health or other health
aut-horify operating under the laws of any
province.
This is a clear statement that the Government bas no desire f0 interfere with the activities of the provincial Departments of Health.
1 have much pleasure in commending the
establishment of this ministry f0 the Senafe.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill waa
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, when shahl this Bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, if if
is agreeable f0 the House, I would move third
reading now.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the thirdi time, and passed.
The Senate ad-journed during pleasure.

CANADIAN

HISTORY-UNIFORM
TEXT-BOOK

QUESTION 0F PRIVILEGE
On the orders of the day:
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
I rise to a question of prîvilege. I wisb to
refer to an article puhlished in Le Devoir of
July 21, under the title, "Le débat sur la
motion David." Without questioning the gond
faith of the journalist who tried to surn up
my remarks, may 1 say that bis sumrnary is
ot eccurate. 0f course I spoke in favour of
developing a truly Canadian patriotisrn, but
I did flot say that "La proposition du Sénateur
David est un moyen d'y arriver." I bave not
used any words at ahl in favour of the motion
for a uiniforrn text-book of history; on the
contrary. following our colleague frorn Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais) I expiained
that in my opinion it wa impossible to prepare a uniform text-book, because tbere was
no agreement even on fundarnental prînciýples.
1 have' not advoeeted in any way the puiblication of a unîform abridgment of Canadien
history, or, to use the words of Le Devoir,
" . . de limiter la portée du manuel projeté."
I have simply recornmended teaching and
education in citizensbip, and tIse preparation
of bendhooks on civies by our varinus provincial authorîties, which is quite a different thing.
To sum up, if a vote lied been taken-and
I previously informed my isonourable colleague
from Grandville of my intention-I certainly
shîould bave voted with him, and against tise
motion.

AERONAUTICS
DEBATE

BILL

CONTINUED ON MOTION
SECOND READING

FOR

The Senate resumed frorn Thursday, July 20,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. King for the second reading of Bill 133,
an Act to amend the Aeronautics Act.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourabie senators,
I shall not teke very long to say what I have
to say about this Bill. We have had in Canada a great many struggies over the regulation
of travel or the means of travel by water, by
road and by railway, and now we have corne
to the foutt dimension, if I may use that
term-by air. Those of us who live in Western Canada will rprnember that there was not
as much contention over rates for traffic by
water and hy highwey as over rail rates. After
a long and flerce struggle we ssscceeded in
baving created in this country a board for
dealing with questions of transport by rail
nnd other railway matters in which the public
were interested. That led flnally to the
establishment of the Board of Railway
Commissioners. whîo were appointed for a
definite period of time, and a good deal of
law bas been built up around that organizetion.
1 have rcad this, Bill tbrough four times,
and I want to say candidiy that on every
successive reading my disappointment increased.
W/bat tise Bill proposes is certainly
a retrograde step. From start to, finish it places
ail the power in the hands of one man, the
Minister. ýNow, I do not know who that man
will ho, and I arn certain that no one in this
House knows who ho wilh be. It. assurcdly wiil
ho no member of the prcsent. Government; it
may be no member of the preserit Parliarnent.
Nobody can say who the Minister will be.
I strongly doprecate the placing of so much
power in the bonds of one man, whether it is
done under this measuire or any other. For the
last twcnty years or so there bas heen a tendency in this country to give by statute a great
deal of power to boards and individuals wbose

JT.LY 25, 1944
actions do not have to be subrnitted to Parliament for approval. 'I arn not complaining now
about the large number of Orders ini Counilmore than 40,000-that have been passed under
the War Measures Act, nor about the more
than 400,000 orders that have been issued by
boards appointed under those Orders in Council. It is disappointing to, see that kind of
thing done in a democracy, and it is just being
continued by this Bill. Such legislation only
leads to the exercise of arbitrary powers. If
our friends or enemies--whichever you care
ýto call them-the C.C.F.-ers should geV into
power, this is the very type of legislation they
would like, sin-ce it would not require thern to
corne to Parliament for authority to set. I
have seýveral times objected to bis of this
sort, and I object very strongly to this particular Bill.
I arn noV going to indulge in criticism of
members in another place, but I do say that
the opinion is widely held that years ago
truck and railroad transportation in this
country should have been co-ordinated. This
législation runs directly opposite to that opinion, its purpose being to, separate transportation by air from railway transportation. I
think that is a mistake. There should be
co-ordination rather than separation. If you
want to, travel east or west by aeroplane,
na;turally you go to Canadian National Railways ticket offices for information. If you
want air transportation Vo the far northern
parts of Canada, of course you make inquiries
at the ticket offices of the Canadian Pacific
Railway.
It was suggested by a member of the Goverament in another place that when our airmen came back from overseas they should
organize air transportation. companies.
I
presume many honourable members have sons
fighting for Canada. I know something about
our boys in the Air Force. I cannot imagine
any worse suggestion than that on demobilization tbey should engage in civil aviation. It
takes a good deal of capital Vo, establish an air
transpost system. Undoubtedly Trans-Canada
Air Lines and Canadian Pacifie Air Lines
would be glad to secure the services of many
of these young men,, and -I arn confident that
those xith ability would rise rapidly in either
organization, but I fear that, starting out for
themselves, few of those young men would
be successful.
Let me examine the principal sections of the
Bill.
Section 9 reads:
Subject to the directions of 'the Minister, the
Board sheil fromn time -to time make investigations and eurveys relating to the operation
and developmeot of commercial air services in

331

Canada and relating 'Vo such other inatters in
connection with civil aviation as the Minister
may direct.
Control is vested entirely in the Minister.
He may direct the Board to make inquiries
whether, say, it is feasible to have an air-line
service frorn Winnipeg to, Petrograd or to
Stalingrad, or to Tokio. I do flot object to
that; but I do object to the absolute control

of the Minister

over domestie

commercial

aviation.
Section 10 deals with recommendations:

The Board shall f rom time to time malté

recommenclations Vo the Minister with reference
to, any investigation or survey made by it and
shal 'advise 'the Minister i'n the exercise of 'hie
duties and powers under this Act in all matters
relating Vo,civil aviation.
Section il provides for regulations:
Subject Vo the approval of the Governor in
Council, the Board may make regulations-

Then follows a list of matters with regard Vo
wbichi regulations may be made.
Section 12 bas Vo 'do with the issue

of

licences. Subsection 1 reads:
Subjeot Vo, Vhe approval of the Minister, 'the
Board may issue Vo -any person applying therefor
a licence Vo operate a commercial air service.

Passing over the next two subsections, I would
direct the attention of honourable senstors to
subsection 4:
The Board shall no't issue any such licence
unless and untîl an operating certificate 'ha@
been issued by the Minister Vo the operator of
the proposed commercial air service-

It will be observed that the Board cannot
issue a licence unless the operator has first
secured the consent of the Minister. Therefore the Minister controls absolutely.

Hon. Mr. KING: But hie mnust report to
Parliament.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but that does nol>
belp the prospective operator. In the meantime the Minîster may have refused his
consent. Suppose Canadian Pacifie Air Lines

want to geV a permit, and the Minister
says no.
Hon. Mr. KING: Would you prefer that
the Board should act?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly. The whole
thing sbould be under the control of a board,
and appeal frorn its decision sbould be Vo the
Governor in Council.
Now subsection 8:
Whiere the Board refuses Vtoissue a licence,
issu-es a licence which differs from. the licence
applied for, or attaches conditions to wlîich the
applicant objects, an appeal niay be made-

332

SENATE

To whom?
-to the Minister.
What control has the Board got? Absolutely
none. You cannot obtain a licence unless the
Minister says se; and even after the licence
is granted the Minister may cancel it.
Subsection 10 provides:
Any air carrier whose licence bas been so
cancelled or suspended may appealTo whom?
-to the Minister.
If the Minister has net got you coming and
going, I do not know what language could
give him more absolute control. I say without
fear of contradiction that the establishment of
an Air Transport Board, which is the ostensible
purpose of this Bill, is pure, unadulterated
camouflage; for when you examine the Bill
you are driven back te but one conclusionthat the Minister. and the Minister alone, is
the man who will have control.
Hon. Mr. KING: As he should have.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I doubt it.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Why have a board,
then?
Hon. Mr. KING: The Board is, of course,
an advisory board.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yesterday the Minister
of Labour said over the air that he intends
to appoint a committee to investigate cartels
and patent arrangements. A similar course
could be followed under tbis Bill. Experts
could be instructed to investigate and report
whether, for instance, it would be feasible to
establish an air line from Winnipeg -to White
Horse. But no; that is not why a board is
mentioned here. The establishment of this
Board is, as I have said, pure, unadulterated
camouflage, because the Board will have no
power; the Minister will be supreme.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Except that the
Minister bas the facts presented to him by
the Board.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes; but he could get the
facts from any committee he might care to
set up. I would suggest to my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Foster) that it
would be better to have an independent
report on each case than te have a board
sitting all the time, knowing that it was
entirely subordinate to the Minister.
Some Hon. SENATORS: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You would be far better
off with an independent board, because life
being what it is the members of such a board
would take their duties seriously. I may be
reminded that the Bill gives the right of
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

appeal from the Board to the Supreme Court
of Canada. But what is the appeal to be
about?
Honourable members will note on
reference to section 18 that the right of appeal
is limited solely to questions of jurisdiction or
of law. That is all. There is no other appeal.
I have given the principal sections; the
other sections are merely subsidiary.
I submit that the Bill should net be passed
at this time, since in any event it is net
intended to be brought into operation until
after the termination of the war in Europe.
This is evident from section 14:
Every licence issued under Part III of The
Transport Act, 1938, or under Part VII of
The Air Regulations, 1938, prior to and in
force at the tine of the coming into force of
this Part shall be deemed to be a licence issued
under section twelve of this Acjt, but every such
licence, if

net cancelled or suspended by tle

Board under section thirteen of this Act, shall
cease to be valid on or after the termination,
as fixed by Order in Coucil, of the war in
Europe which comnenced on the tenth day of
September, one ithousanil nine hundred and
thirty-nine.
This clause indicates that, except for the
setting up of certain machinery, there is really
nothing to be donc until a year after the end
of the war, as fixed by Order in Council.
This being so, we do not now need this legislation. And I am persuaded that after the
coming general election the Senate would
never pass such a bill.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yeu are prophesying.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, I am, prophesying.
I will repeat my prophecy. I am sure that if
after the next general election the then
Government brought in a similar Bill we
would never pass it. because we should be
afraid of putting too much power in the hands
of one Minister. If democracy means anything it means control by Parliament, not by
a Minister. It would be bad enough to provide for an appeal to the Governor in Council.
But there you have from fifteen to eighteen
persons, including the Prime Minister, acting as
an appellate body. I am one man who believes
in our Prime Ministers. It does not matter
how mucb I may differ with any Prime
Minister's policy, I have very great respect
for the men who have been the Prime Ministers of this country, and I would trust a Prime
Minister more than anybody else. But in an
appeal to the Governor in Council you would
net have to trust the Prime Minister alone;
you would have the advantage of having your
appeal considered by all the members of the
Government. This Bill should go at least
that far, and the right of appeal from the
Board to be appointed should be to the
Governor in Council, not to the Minister
alone.

JULY 25, 1944
Honourable senators, I think we shal -be
making a retrograde step if we pass this Bill,
and I believe we shal] regret our action in the
years to corne. By passing such legislation
we are drifting away from our dernocratie
system into the system brought a.bout by war
conditions. Under the stress of war we have
given the Government arbitrary powers. You
have neyer heard me raise mny voice in this
House against anything the Government was
doing under those powers. Wby? I did flot
always agree with wbat was being done; sometimes I strongly disapproved; but I did flot
express my disapproval because I feit it was
vitally necessary that we should give our
whole energies to Canada's war effort. That
consideration was supreme. But, as I have
pointed out, this Bill is not intended to corne
into operation until after the war, and in the
meantime there wii be opportunity for fui]
investigation of the best means of developing
and controiling commercial aviation in this
country. I repeat, I believe this Bill is a
mistake, and therefore, I submit, it should flot
be passed.
Hon. G. P.' CAMPBELL: Honourable
senators, I know my honoura>ble friend from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) is quite sinceie
in bis argument, and I agree with hlm that
preservation of the right of appeal sbould be
very carefully considered whe-n the Bill goes
to comrnittee. But I suggest to my bonourable friend that already this session he bas, in
effect, voted in favour of withdrawing commercial air services from the jurisdiction of
the Board of Transport Commissioners. Last
Thursday this House gave Bill 101, an Act to
amend tbe Transport Act, 1938, second and
third readings, and tbere was no protest frorn
any honourabie member.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That legisiation only
cornes into. force on proclamation hy the
Governor in Coundil.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The Bill wbich was
passedHon. Mr. HAIG: Arn I right?
Hon. Mr, CAMPBELL: -into law repeals
Part IIIHon. Mr. HAIG:- Only when it is prochaimed
by the Government.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes. But I arn
merely saying that the members of this House
passed *without protest Bill 101 which, in effect,
ta<ee away ail the powers vested in tbe Board
of Transport Commiasioners to deal with
transportation by air. It may have been an
oversigbt on the part of my honourable friend
that he did flot object to that Bill, and at any

=

rate I, arn wiiiing to concede that what bappened does not in any way detract from the
force of bis argument.
I believe that the honourabie gentleman, ini
commenting upon the arbitrary powers wbich
this Bill vests in the Minister, is more fearful
than the circumstances warrant. The Air
Transport Board to be established under tbis
Bill is for the purpose of studying domestie
and international air problems. I feel al
members wiIl agree witb me tbat there is
need for very careful study of t.hose probiems.
I do not tbink the honourable senator from
Winnipeg, or any other honourabie member
wbo bas practised before the Board of Transport Commissioners, feels that it is equipped
to make the extensive studies necessary for tbe
purpose of advising the Government wîtb
respeçt to air transportation.
I believe -that in introducing this Bill tbe
Government is seeking to preserve. aviation
rigbts for the benefit of the people of Canada
generaily. One ebouid consider just what bas
taken place witb respect to the development
of air transportation in this country. The
Government took the lead in establishing air
schools in 1927, in constructing acrodromes
across the country, and :in 1937 introduced the
Bill which set up Trans-Canada Air Lines. And
may I say in pasýsing, that at that tirne Canadian Airways, the largest company engaged in
air transportation in tbis country, and tbe
C.P.R., another of the big transportation comnpanies, were asked to, j oin in the enterprise;
but before final decision was made as to the
set-up, Canadian Airwaya and tbe Canadian
Pacific Raiiway decided not to join, protesting that they did flot wish to bave on the
Board three directors appointed by tbe
Governrnent.
The honourable senator from Winnipeg bas
said that tbis House would not be likeiy, to
pass this legisiation if it were to, be introduced
after the next general election. No one can
propbesy what the result of that election wil
be. It may be, tbat my honourable friend is
more pessimistie than some of the rest of us.
Nevertheless, may I suggest tbat we should
rememaber tbat many of the developments in
air transportation have been made at the expense of the Canadian people. Wben the
transcontinental systern was set up an effort
was made to have private enterprise join
Government enterprise, and I feel tbat in
tbe future development of air transportation
in this country there must be a partpership
between private enterprise and Governrnent
enterprise.
.May I now, for a mornent or so, deal with
one or two of the arguments raised by the
honourable senator frorn Winnipeg? His chief

334

SENATE

argument was levelled against placing too
much power in the hands of one man. I have
in the past spoken as he has against such a
policy. But we have it in other statutes.
There is a precedent for it in the Income Tax
Act, where the appeal from the assessment, in
the first instance, is to the Minister. We all
realize that in many cases such appeals have
been successful. Therefore I do not think it
is proper in this case for the honourable gentleman to suggest that the Minister who would
hear the appeals would not consider them
honestly and fairly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask my honourable friend a question. Is this appeal exactly
the same as the Income Tax appeal?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: In the first instance.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.
Oh, yes; but in the
second instance?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: In the second instance, the appeal to the Supreme Court of
Canada is provided for in practically the same
language as is the appeal to the Supreme
Court from the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
But is there not an
appeal from the Minister to the Exchequer
Court?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: There is.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. But there is not
here.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: But in the case of
income tax, the first appeal is to the Minister
or his delegated representative,-who considers
the facts. I submit that in a case of this kind,
where there is an appeal from the decision of
the Board to the Minister, it is not proper for
any honourable member of this House to
suggest that it would not be honestly and
fairly considered. Whether there should be a
further appeal or not is a question, I think,
that should be fully considered when the Bill
goes to Committee.
The Air Transport Board which it is proposed to set up would collect the facts and
advise the Minister as to the course that
should be followed. The Board would hear
applications from various applicants for licences, and would recommend or report against
the granting of such licences. Assuming that
they recommend the granting of the licence,
the recommendation goes to the Minister. It
is true that under the provisions of the Act
the Minister bas power to say a licence shall
not be granted. I for one do not quarrel with
that authority. I believe it is quite proper
that in the development of air transportation
in this country, and in the use of air facilities
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

which have been provided at the expense of the
people, some representative of the Government should have power to say whether or not
licences should be granted. In effect we have
the same position with respect to applications
to the Board of Transport Commissioners: in
the final analysis it is not the Board of Transport Commissioners who decide whether a
licence shall be issued or otherwise, but the
Government. The Government still bas control, and I think necessarily so, in regard to
all forms of transportation. As far as transportation by air is concerned, I submit it is
essential that the Government of the day
should have control. It should say where the
routes are to be established, what the composition of the routes shall be; and it is in
that connection that the Board will make
recommendations to the Minister, who will
decide either to issue the licence or to refuse it.
Now, assuming that the Minister refuses to
approve the actions of the Board, undoubtedly
the question would be determined, or at least
discussed, in Parliament or before the Cabinet.
And again we have precedent, I think, for
power being vested in the Minister. Under
the provisions of the Excess Profits Tax Act
an advisory board has been set up whose
actions are subject to the approval of the
Minister; and I am sure that no one bas had
reason to complain.
My honourable friend bas referred to transportation by road. We have in all the provinces boards which are really nothing more
than advisory boards dealing with the granting
of licences to those entitled to engage in highway transport. Here you have the same sort
of board to advise the Minister with respect
to the issuing of licences, and the rules and
regulations relating to transportation by air.
In the case of transportation by highway
within the provinces it is the Government, or
the representative of the Government in the
person of the Minister of Highways, who lays
down the policy to be followed by the Board
with respect to the granting of licences, and
who bas power to either refuse or accept the
recommendations of the Board.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is that true in Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
Ontario.

I was speaking of

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is not true in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Well, I venture to
say that those who have had the experience
of obtaining licences in the province of
Manitoba have many times found it necessary
to go to the Government to get them.

JTTLY 25, 1944
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I challenge that
statement. There is an independent board
that bas power to grant or refuse, and it bas
neyer been over-ridden. It works very satisfactorily, too.
Hon. Mr. CA'MPBELL: Wel'l, that is net
the case in ail the provinces.
Now, speaking with respect to the appeal,
the appeai lies to the Supreme Court of
Canada on matters of jurisdiction. This, I
submit, is ini accordance with the provisions
of the ýRaiiway Act, which provides:
An appeal shall lie from the Board te the
Supreme Court of Canada upon a question of
"urisdiction, of the said therefor being oh aned
irom a judee upon leave Court upon appliction
made within one month after the making of
-the or-der, decisionand so forth.
An appeal @hall also lie £rom the Board to
such Court upon any question which in the
opinion of the BoaTd ie a question of law.
The honourable senator from, Winnipeg has
dealt with one or two sections of the Bill, and
I wouId refer to the Act as it now stands on
the statutes to show that it requires the
Minister to exercise certain powers. Section
3 of the Act provides that it shall be the
duty of the Minister to do a number of
things, including investigating, examining and
reporting on ail proposais for the institution
of commercial air services within or partly
within Canada or the limits of the territorial
waters of Canada. Now, if I understand this
legislation correctly, it is the framework for
the setting up cf a body, similar to the Board
cf Transport Commissioners, to deal with the
problem cf transportation by air; and I
support the Bill on the ground that a special
Board is justified in connection with the
development cf air tranisportation in this
country.
In the Ujnited States they have a similar
board under the namne of the Civil Aeronautics
Board. It is quite independent cf the Interstate Commerce Commission, which deals
with other forms cf transportation. Honeurable members will agree, I thirik that the
development cf air transportation ini the
United States has been soundly handled, and
administered. It bas heen kept closely under
the control cf the Government. It bas been
d'ivorced from railways and from highway
transportation, and from the Interstate Commerce Commission, which is an independent
board such as the honourable senator from
Winnipeg would have deal with aeronautics.
I distinguish between the three forms cf
transportation, and I say it is time this
Parliament toek action te preserve the righta
of the citizens cf this country in the matter

335

cf air transportation, to see that they are net
exploited by independent lines in the postwar period, and that the people cf Canada
have an adequate transportation system. I
support the second reading cf the Bill, and
the motion that it be referred to the Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
Hon. A. K. HtIGESSEN: Honourable senaters, I have only a few words to add to what
my honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) bas just said. I was much
interested in the remarks cf the honourable
the acting leader on the other side, and
normally speaking I think I should be
disposed. to agree with him in deprecating toc
much power being gîven to any Minister or
any Government department in cases where
the internai administration cf the country is
concerned. But I do think that transportation
by air, which my honourable friend referred te
as the fourth dimension-a very adequate
description-f aile into a different category
from erd'inary internal matters which require
to be dealt with by the Governinent of the
country, and I fully agree that with respect
to such matters it is net a good principle te
give tee much power te any Minister or any
departmnent.
I think it is essential that the Government
should have a very large measure cf contrel
ever transportatien by air, for what I might
perhaps deseribe as international reasous. It
is bccoming more evident day by day, as I
arn sure the House appreciates, what a vitally
important part of the werld Canada is going
to be in international air transport after the
war. Perhaps some hcnourabie members ssw
a map cf world air routes which was produced
a few months ago by the National Geographic
magazine. That map showed clearly, and mnade
me realize for the first time, the tremendeus
significance cf Canada's geographical position
in international air traffic cf the future. It
showed, for instance, that the direct route fer
air travel from the North American continent to the whoie cf Europe, the whole ef
Asia and the whole cf Africa-in fact, te any
part cf the world except South Americapasses through this country. Because cf Oanada's position, if for ne ether reason, I think
it is necessary thiat the Government cf the
day, ne matter what its pehitical complexion,
should keep a closely effective centrol over
the licensing and granting of air routes, both
within the country and between this country
and other parts ef the world.
I turn te section 17 for support of the view
which I have ventured te express. That section
says:
The pewers conferred by this Part on the
Minister-

SENATE
The word "Minister." which is objected te
by my bionourable friend frem Winnipeg,
appears here.
The powers conferred ýby t-his Part on the
Miiiister shall be exercised subject to any
interna tional agreemeont r convention relaiting
te civil aviation to wvhich Canada is a party.
The argument that the Government of the
day should for international reasons keep a
constant check upon the development of
civil aviation mighit be pursued by saying th-at
it is necessary for the Government te maintain constant control for military reasons also,
becau'ie. after ail, civil aviation is only one
side of the shýield, se te speak. Airports bujît
for civil -aviation are, ini time of war, available
for use by military airpianes.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I cannot sce how section
17 helps my honourable friend's argument at
ail, for that section makes the exorcise of the
Minister's power subjeet te international
agreements and conventions. I think the effeet
of that is .iust the opposite of what my honourable friend is arguing.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I do net quite
follow my honourable friend. What I was
attempting te show, by reference te section 17
was that in drafting this Bill the Government
had in mind the international implications of
control over the air.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Section 17 takes power
away frun, the Minister.
Hon. Mr. IIUGESSEN: 1 arn afraid I do net
quite follow the implications of that. What I
was saying was that Government control ever
aviation is necessary, to my mind frem the
point of view not only of international civil
aviation, but also of military defence of the
country.
Althouglb I quite agree with the
honourable the acting leader on the other side
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that normally Parliamont
should regard with a great deal of suspicion
any attempt te give too mueli power to any
minister or department, I do think that in
view of the cxtraordinary importance of
international air transport the powers conferred upon the Minister by this Bill are fully
justified.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Henourable members,
I simply risc te point eut te the House that
the honourable senater froma Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) and the honourable senator
frein' Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) did net
even attempt te defend the placing of sole
control of the airways of this country in the
hands of one man. I agree with the hast
speaker that it is necessary te give the
Goveroment suprome control ever the air and
air linos, but ne individual sheuld have that
control. I feel sure that neither of my bonHon. Mr. A. K. HUGESSEN.

ourable friends opposite wbo supperted the
Bill could point te any other transport legislation in Canada containing provisions similar
te those we find bore. This Bihl confers absoJute power upon the Minister, and even the
Governor in Counicil wilh have ne control over
bis decisions. To that I object. If that featurc were eliminated or changed I should support the Bill willingly, but I cannot agree with
the placing of the supreme power in the hands
of one l)ocson, wvbether ho is a momber of
this Goveroment or of nny-other Government
that may hold office in future. In my opinion
the h)rinciplc is wrong.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
the honourable the acting leader on this side
(Hon. Mr. Haig). raised but one point, the
question of the desirability of placing certain
extenîsive powers in the hands of a single Minister of the Crown. To that objection there
bas so far been ne rephy that will stand on its
foot.. I arn sure ex cry henourable member of
this House will agrcc that this is highly
dangerous legislation. I have taken part in
governments over a fairhy long period of years,
and I cannot think of any other instance
where such powver was evor given by law te
any one Minister.
The two honourable
gentlemen opposite wbo spoke in support of
the Bill mentioned a nuinher cf times hiow
nccessary it was for the Governiment te retain
control. te keep a check on international
agreements, and te do this nnd that. That
is ail right, but that is net the point. The
point is wbether or net this bouse shouhd
approve cf banding over te a single minister
full power in connection with aviation in Canada-I amn leaving eut the international
aspect.
We aIl know what is meant by civil aviation
in Canada. Ia addition te our main-lino airways, there are linos in eperation throughout
the great north country. AIl or provinces,
from Quebec clear through te British Columbia, are intensely interested in air power in
that north country, and we already bave had
evidence, througli the radio and the Press,
cf a fear that 'this legishation may net always
be administered as the goveroments and the
peophe of the provinces concerned may desire.
I think the legislatien is bad.
A further objection -te the measure is that
it fails -te provide appropriate means for
appeal from decisiens cf the Minister. That
lack certainhy sbould be made good. The
Government Inys down lines cf pehicy, and
bands the administration cf that policy ever
te the Minister. The recemmendatiens cf the
Air Transport Board, which is empowered te
make certain investigations and surveys, are
te bo sent te the Minister, net te the Governor

JULY 25, 1944
in Council; they will neyer reach the Governor
in Council at ail, but will be rejected, confirmed or modified hy the Minister alone. As
bas heen said, if the Minister were required
to submit his decision to the Governor ia
Council for approval, we shouid be on much
safer ground. But there is no requirement of
this kind in the Bill.
As I have said, we surely sbould provide for
a proper appeal fromn any decîsion made by
the Minister. Personaily, I arn opposed to
that part of the Bill which places tbe whoie
power in bis bands.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: May I ask the bonourable leader if it is bis intention to send this
Bill to a committee?
,Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. As announced the
other day. I shail move that it be referred to
tbe Committee on Railways, Telegrapbs and
Harbours.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Sinclair, tbe debate
was adjourned.

powers conferred on the Minister by the Aeronautics Act of 1927 were continued under the
Transport Act, 1938, and are still exercised by
him. Now, the purpose of this Bill is to
amend the Aeronautics Act by providing for
the appointment of an Air Transport Board to
advise the Minister on matters connected with
the development of civil aviation, and to perform the functions of a licensing and regulatory body in respect of commercial air services.
Before issuîing a licence the Board must report
te the Minister.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The Board must
get the Minister's approval before it can issue
a licence.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Quite se, the Minister must first issue an operating certificate to
the applicant.
It was sug'gested yesterday by some honourable senators that there should be a right of
appeal from the Minister's decision to the
Governor in Council. I would point out that
under section Il all regulations made by the
Board are subject to the approval of the
Governor in Council. The main objection is
directed against the clause providing that the
issue of licences shall be subject to the approval of the Minister. But I subîit it is essential that this approval should remain in the
hands of the Minister, for. in the last analysis.
he will be rcsponsible for the safety of aerial
navigation.
I have given careful consideration to the
amendments suggested by honourable members opposite, but further study of the Bill
clv tends te confirm my view that in its
present form it is best calculated to bring
about the most expeditious administration of
all matters related to civil aviation. I submit
tiat the adoption of their suggestions would,
in effect, lead to a weakening of responsible
government with respect to commercial air
services. I should net like te sec such a
weakening take place, and therefore I feel it
necessary net only that there should be a
board to advise the Minister. but also thtat
everything donc by that Board should be
subject te the Minister's approval.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the SPEAKER: I would point
out that if the honourable leader of the House
exercises his righît te reply he will close the
debate. Therefore if any honourable senators
desire to speak to the motion, now is the
time to <le so.
lon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators,
when I moved second reading of this Bill a
few days ago, I outlined its provisions. At
the time I felt there would be considerable
discussion on this important measure. That
discussion took place yesterday, and I intend
now te reply briefly te some of the criticisms
then advanced.
My honourable friend the acting leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) said he was afraid
of what migit happen under the one-man
control to be conferred on the Minister. I
hope that as T proceed I shall be able te
dispel his fear and that of others in this
regard.

JULY 26, 1944
My honourable friend expressed the view
that the Board of Railway Commissionersnow the Board of Transport Comnmissioners-would probably be able to administer a
mneasure of this kind. We know that the
Board of Railway Commissioners was set up
to co-ordinate railway transportation throughout Canada and that, as my honourable friend
bas said, a considerable body of law bas been
built up around its decisions. But 1 would
remind honourable members that that Board
wvas constituted at an entirely different pbase
of transportation. To-day we are in what I
may termi the age of air transportation.
He rather poob-poohed the idea that the
young men now engaged in our Air Force
overseas would be able to take advantage of
the provisions of this measure because tbeir
lack of capital would prevent tbemn fromn coinpeting in tbe fleld of civil aviation with men
of means. 1 tbink bis conception in that regard
is wrong. We know personally many young
men wbo to-day are in the flghting squadrons
of the Air Force overseas, and wbo on their
return will bave at their command, either
individually or jointly, sums of money large
enough to permit tbenf to organize themselves
into companies and make application to the
Minister for licences to operate air routes in
tbis country. I arn confident that they will
organize, and I arn sure it is gratifying to
tbe members of this House and to the people
of Canada generally tbat these young men
will bave such an opportunity.
The bonourable gentleman indicated that
the Board should be a body independent of tbe
Government. I do not think bie is really serious. We are to-day dealing with one of the
most important questions in our political
history: How can we best utilize the new
mode of transportation for the benefit of our
people? Surely we are not going to appoint
a Board of tbree members, make tbemn independent of Parliamient. and say to tbemn
"You operate this show." Thiat could flot be
friend
intention of my honourable
the
opposite.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is not the situation
of the Board of Railway Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. KING: I know it is not, but that
gentleman's statement yesterday. Hie spoke of an
independent board.
is in accordance witb tbe bonourable

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Board of Railway
Commissioners is an independent board.
Hon. Mr. KING: No. It receives its power
fromn tbe Government; it is regulated by the
Government, and there are appeals from the
Board.
106-231

339

Hon. Mr. HAIG: To wbomn is the appeal toý
be made?
Hon. Mr. KING: We have not reached that
stage yet. We have flot arrived at a time
wben we can deflnitely set out to an independent Board their duties ini regard to the de'velopment of air service in Canada or the international service that will corne to Canada.
My honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) made a very excellent speech,.
upon which I congratulate him. I believe it
was his flrst speech in this Chamber, and 1
knowv we were ail pleased at bis manner of
address and the subjeet matter of bis remarks.
He indicatcd that in 1927 the Governmenit
passed an Aeronautics Act on the suggestion
and advice of the Department of National
Defence. At that time the Department of
National Defence clajmed that in the event of
war the air arm would be of the utrnost
importance. We know, of course, that in 1926
and 1927 the people of Canada, along with the
people of môst other countriçs of the world,
werc of opinion that there would be no more
war; con--equently the suggestion whieh had
been mad'e was not received with a great dear
of enthusiasm by members of the House of
Commons or by the country generally. However, the Government proceeded to establisb.
an air school at Trenton. During the war this
school was greatly enlarged. and it bas served.
a very useful purpose. The objeet in view in,
estabhishing this scbool was to give men
military air training, if tbey wished, tb:ît Later
tbey might enter commercial aviation in
Canada and serve in that field. That seheme
was brought to an abrupt termination in 1932
or 1933, and we did not bear much more about
air transportation in thjs country until 1936
or 1937, wben the Governiment undertook toorganize wbat is now known as the TransCanada Air Lines. That system. was brougbt
into being with. great expedition and great
ingenuity, and the Minister responsible for it
is the father of the Bill hefore us to-dàsy. 1
think it will be generally admitted that that
development wns one of grgat importance to.
the country as a whole, not only as respects
civil aviation but military aviation as welI.
It also bas given us very valuable experience.
My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) rather indicatedi at the close of his
remarks that there was no need for hurry, that
the inatter sbould be allowed to, stand until
after the war, inasmuch as the Government
bad proclaimed in the Bill that no activities
would be undertaken and no licences would be
granted until one year after the end of the
war. Surely he cannot be serious in that
suggestion. He knows, as aIl of us do, that
there is a great problemn which ilust receive

studyý and consideration, hecause eventually
policies will be founded on that study and
-consideration. In 1943 the Prime Minister
M'ade a very excellent speech in the lieuse
"Of Commons, in wbich he indicated that the
Governinent were tborough]y interested and
sincerely anxious that air dex-elopment, flot
only in Canada, but internationally, should
receiv~e the closest .-tudy, extending over a
period of time. My honourable friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. ilogessen) yesterday devclopcd thiat phase of the question very fully.
Then, in add'ition to tire statement of the
Prime Minister this ycar, we had a statement
froin the Minister of Munitions and Supply
emphasizing the importance of air transportatien net only within Canada but internationally.
Wc know that the Govcrnment of C'anada

of transportation by air. Within the last few

JULY 26, 1944
Government, through their ministers, are
responsible to Parliament, and Parliament is
responsible to the people. It is provided in
this Bill, therefore, that ail regulations enacted
under the Act shail be published in the Canada
Gazette, and that if Parliament is sitting they
shall be laid hefore bothbhouses wjthin ten
days after publication. If Parliament is flot
sitting, they are to ha laid before both houses
within ten days after the next ensuing sittings
thereof. As I have alraady said, in the practical working out of this measure the Minister
is merely the intarmediary between the Government and the Board that is to ha set up.
We have as a guide the example of the
great repuhhic to the south of us, a country
comparable witb ours, wbich bas found- it
advisabla to dissociata air services from other
forms of transportation.
The Govarnmnt
feel that is a gond example to follow. Experience may bring a change of view, but I
believe that in all countries to-day there is a
tendency towards close governmental control
of air lines operating within the boundaries
of the respective countries concernad and on
international routes. Tbe granting of a licence
to an air lina is a different matter from the
granting of a charter to a railroad company
whicb intends to put down steel and operate
cars between given points; and it is different
from granting a licence to a motor transport
company to operate trucks and buses over
highways. The mattars that have to be considerad in regard to the control of air traffla
are in a class by tbernsalvas. and vary caraful
supervision and control 'will have to ha axercised by the Government.
As to the Board itseîf, it will ha the desire
of everynne that the Goverrent should
sacura the most compatant men obtainýable
for this important work. Many problems of
wbich we ara unaware to-day will corne up
for the Board's consideration.
Some objection was raised to the giving of
powaer to the Minister to refuse licences, but
1 do not think anyone would bold to that
objection after considaring the Minister's
responsibility.
Ha will ha rasponsible for
seeing that every plane that goes out from
Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto, or anywbere else
in the Dominion is in charge of competent
men, and that the apfiliances and methods
usad will provide the greatest possible safety
for aIl who traval upon the air lines. So I
say: If you want security, do flot be afraîd
of giving the Minister responsihility. .Place
the responsibility where it should ha: first
on the Ministeïr; then on the Governor in
Council, wbo will report to Parliament; and
Parliament will act in- the hast 'interests of
the people.

I should like to sea this Bill referred to the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegrapbs
and Harbours. In committee conversation and
discussion can he carried on more freely, and
if it is thought wise that some controls should
ha added to the Bill we shall ha prepared
to bear about them and consider tbem. In the
meantime, I feal we ara ail quite wall agread
that the Govarnment ara not acting too soon
in taking steps for the study and consideration
of this great problam of aeronautics, and that
the very hast men obtainable should be
appointad to the Air Transport&Board.

mental or administrative experience, and in
some instances represent what I would call a
"tidying-up" of a number of unrelated sections
having to do with penalties. If I might go
through the sections and explain them briefly.
I think the purport of the amendments will
be easily understood.
We do not need to deal with Section 1. It
is what I call the "tidying-up" section. It
repeals a number of sections of the Special
War Revenue Act as it now stands, and
gathers them together in Section 6 of the
Bill, which becomes Section 113 of the
statute.
Section 2 applies to the fur content of
garments and articles of fur imported. Last
year we imposed a tax of 25 per cent upon furs
.dressed and/or dyed in Canada. Then this
kind of situation arose: when «a Canadian
manufacturer of a cloth coat, let us say, used
fur for the collar, that fur had already borne
its portion of the tax which was levied at the
time the fur was dressed and/or dyed; but
when a dealer imported a cloth coat with a
fur collar, the Department found it had no
authority to levy a tax upon the fur. The
amendment provided by section 2 authorizes
the Department to impose the tax upon the
fur content of garments imported.
Section 3 deals with the liability for retail
purchase and entertainment taxes. Under the
provisions of the Act luxury taxes have been
levied upon the purchase of certain articles.
and also on entertainment. For instance, if
you have a meal in the Chateau Laurier grill
at a time when there is music and dancing,
your check is subject to a luxury tax. The
numbe of people in Canada charged with the
duty a collecting this tax is of course very

large, and the businesses carried on by some
of them is seasonal, the net result being. as
experience has showed, that in many instances
the tax is not collected. The only penalty
the Department was able to have assessed
against anyone for failure to collect this tax
was apparently a fine of $25; but on the occasion with respect to which a person paid that
fine he may have deprived the Government
of revenue amounting to hupdreds of dollars.
This section makes the proprietor responsible
for the tax, if he fails to collect it.
Section 4 simply brings into section 111 of
the Act the penalties for failing to affix or
cancel stamps; and section 5 repeals two subsections. whose provisions are included in
section 6.
Section 6 is a compilation of a large number of provisions contained in different parts
of the Special War Revenue Act. Most of
these provisions are covered by the sections
repealed by this Bill. The chief purpose of
:section 6 is to require persons reon.ehle for

343

the collection of the retail purchase tax and
the entertainment tax to keep records. A
certain discretion is given to the Department.
For instance, if the Department is satisfied
that a proper system of book-keeping is maintained by persons liable for collection of the
entertainment tax, it may perinit such persons
to make a daily recapitulation and remit the
tax on that basis; and, similarly, it may permit
vendors of taxable merchandise to make
returns on a weekly basis. That provision has
been made necessary by a variety of circumstances. Some dealers were fearful of loss by
theft if they kept a large supply of stamps
on hand in advance of actual requirements.
Lawyers in the Senate will no doubt be
interested in section 7, which permits the
Minister to include a number of offences in
one information or complaint. Strictly speaking, as the statute now stands, a separate information would have to be laid in respect of
each customer from whom a -vendor or proprietor failed to collect the proper tax. What
the effect of this amendinent will be, having
regard to the fact that no corresponding
amendment is made to the Criminal Code, is
a matter that I suppose lawyers will work out
some day; and the Department of Justice will
then probably bring in an amendment to the
Code.
Section 8 repeals a number of sections of the
Act incorporated in section 6, to which I have
already made reference. I dealt with the
provisions of sections 9 and 10 when, in
explaining section 6. I pointed out that discretion was given to the Department to permit
persons liable for collection of the entertainment tax to make daily or weekly returns.
Section 11 relates to the excise duty on what
is commonly known as soft drinks. The Act
as it stands at present would make some
bottled beverages, such as pure orange juice,
subject to excise tax. The amendment exempts
ail bottled fruit juices, if at least 95 per cent of
the product is pure fruit juice.
Section 12 deals with cigars. Apparently,
prior to the imposition of the present levy
upon cigars there used to be on the market a
class of cigars selling at two for five cents. I
understand from departmental officers that sales
of cigars in that class accounted for 20 per cent
of the entire cigar business in Canada, and
that the manufacturers have contended that
they cannot bear the present impost and
continue sales at that price. Recognition is
given to that argument about the two-for-fivecents cigar-whether that means it is to be an
election cigar this year, I do not knowHon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: -and the excise is
lowered.

SENATE

Section 13 adds to the list of articles
exempted from sales tax. Honourable members who were at the meeting of the Finance
Committee this morning when we were dealing
with amendments to the customs tariff, will
recognize that baling twine is now exempted
from sales tax.
Binder twine is already
exempted, and apparently baling twine is a
similar commodity, only heavier, used for the
baling of hay right out in the field. This
section adds a considerable number of items
to the already long list of things exempted
from sales tax.
Section 14 provides that when the amendments set out in this Bill are given the force
of law they shall have effect from the 27th of
June, 1944.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, the remarks that I wish to make about
this Bill would probably be better made in
committee, if there is to be a reference to
committee after second reading. At this stage
I desire to direct the attention of honourable
members to section 6; which repeals section 113
of the Act and substitutes a new section of the
same number. Subsection (1) of the proposed
new section reads as follows:
Every

person

required.

by

or ptirsuant

to

this Act, to pay or collect taxes or other slnis
or to affix or cancel stamips shall keep records
and books of account in English or French at

his place of business in Canada in suich fori
and

containing

sech

information

as,

in

the

opinion of the Minister. will enable an audit
to be made to establish the amnont of taxes or

other sums that should have been paid or
collected or the anount of stamps that should
have been affixed or cancelled.
The words that offendi me are, "in the
opinion of the Ministor." It seems to me
that those words could be dropped without
in any wav weakening the requirement that
persons responsible for the collection of the
tax shall keep a proper set of books from
which an audit can be made. Let us suppose
that a person keeps records which in his
opinion are sufficient, and which, in the opinion
of a court of law before which he is ordered to
appear, would be sufficient to enable him to
make a proper accounting to the court of the
money that he has collected or that he is
required to pay. That would not save him
from a conviction if his books were not satisfactory to the Minister. There wouldi be the
possibility of a man satisfying the court, but
not being able to satisfy the Minister. In some
cases the Crown has been known to come forward' and say that the protisions of the statute
had net been complied with, because the Minister was not satisfied, and. therefore a penalty
was payable. As I say. I do not think the
object of this section would be in any way
weakened if the words to which I object were
eliminated; and if it is proper for me to do
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

so, I would move that section 6 be amended
by striking out from subsection (1) of new
section 113 the words "in the opinion of the
Minister."
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I would point out
to the honourable gentleman that his amendment is not receivable on the motion for
second reading. His remarks may be taken as
a notice of amendment to be moved in
committee.
Hon. Mr. KING: I may say about this
Bill, as my honourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) said about another, that we got a
little out of step in committee this morning.
When we found that the Bill had already been
passed in the other House and sent over to the
Senate. we proceeded, to consider it, without
having given notice to the committee. As His
Honour the Speaker has just ruled, my honourable friend from
Toronto
(Hon. Mr.
Campbell) will have an opportunity of moving
his amendment when the committee meets
again.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Is it desired to give
third reading to the Bill to-day?
Hon. Mr. KING: No. I intend, to move
that it be referred to committee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: In view of that fact. I
shall not say very much about the Bill. All
who were present at the committee were fully
satisfied, I feel sure, with the explanation of
every section as given by Mr. Sim.

The explanation given to us in committee
by the departmental officials concerned was
very helpful in clarifying the various amending sections. The main purpose of the Bill is
to provide machinery which will make it casier
to collect the new forms of taxation imposed
during the war years. For instance-if I may
mention the grill room of the Chateau Laurier
-I do not think it was ever necescary to have
detectives in attendance to see that proper
stamps were affixed or cancelled in the conduct of business. The hotel management and
the Department worked out an arrangement
satisfactory to all concerned. How-ever one
can visualize certain plat-cs where it would be
necessary to insist on the proper stamps being
affixed or cancelled inmediately. Personally,
I am in favour of the Bill, but I do not object
to its being referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee. I would suggest to bonourable senators,,especially, to lawyer members,
that whether they are on the committee or not
they attend its meetings, because this legislation is mainly legal in character. There is, I
think, no dispute as to the principles under-

JULY 27, 1944
Iying the Bill. The only question is whether
it will operate fairiy as between the Government and the individuai.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Subsection 5 of
section 6 provides that the Minister may
prescrîbe the formi of, and the information Vo
be contained in records or books of account
to be kept under subsection 1. Would it flot
be advisahle to, have a standard formn? This
wouid remove the objection of the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell).
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The honourabie senator from Toronto has raised a point on
subsection 1 of the new section 113, wbich may
make it necesu'ry Vo refer the Bill Vo the
Cominittee on Finance.
May 1 refer to subsection (5):
if a personkrequired by subsection one of
this section to keep records or books of account
hlas neot, in the opinion of the Minister, kept
adequ ate records -or books of acceunt, the
Minister rnay prescribe the form of, and the
information to bc contained in, records or books
of ýaccaunt to .be kept by such persan under
subsection one of this section.

It is not unusual Vo empower a department
Vo require such information for the purposes
of audit.
The penalties set forth in subsection (6) are

imposed on failure Vo keep records or books in
the form d.irected by the Minister. Subsection
(8) gives the Minister powcr Vo make an assessment where the records are noV properly kept.
There does noV appear Vo me' Vo be anything
unusuail or extraordinary in, the powers which
this section confers on the Minister. However, in view of the objections raised, I would

suggest that after the Bill has been given
second reading it be referred Vo the Finance
Committee.
The motion was agreed Vo, and the Bill was
rend the second time.

Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Under the present iaw,
a judge on reVirement is antitled Vo a pension.
However, ne provision is made for bis wife,
and on the death of bier husband she gets parhaps one month's sahary; that is aIl. In more
than one case great bardship bas resutedbardship that reflectad net oniy on the comnfart and anjoyment cf the widow, but aise, in
the opinion of most hawyers and judges, on the
State itself.
This Bill des net meet the situation at ai!
in regard Vo those wbo are now widows of
judgas; they are net within the Bill. Howevar, it dees deai in a makeshift manner,-I
Vbink I may fairly say-with the wives cf
present judges. For instance, a judge cf the
Suparior Court receives a saiary cf $9,000.
Under the Judges Act bie is entitled on retirement te a pension cf $6,000. Under this Bill
hae may make an election, an irrevocable alectien, befere the first day cf November as te
whether hae wiii divide bis pension with bis
wife.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

This year.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Ha must elect Vhis
year. In the case cf a new judge, hae may
eleet within ninety days cf bis appointment.
Ha may decide Vo allow the law Vo operate as
it always bas operated, and on reVirement hae
wiii enioy a pension cf $6,000 a year, ceasing
at bis death. On the other hand, bie may eleat
te taka advantage of Vhis amending Bill and
divide his pensien with bis wife. Thereupon
hae will receive a pensien cf 84,000 a year on
retirement, and bis wife wili recaive $2.000 a
year. On bis death she wili continue Vo receive
the $2,000 a year during bier lifetime. If the
judrge. dies while, stihi sarving on the Bench,
bis widew wiii receive $2,000 a year, or twonint.his cf bis annuai salary. In the one case
the State is relieved cf ahi obligation on the
death of the judge; in the other case there wiil
ha a contribution until the death cf both.
As was expiained in the other flouse, the
change, based on the expectatien of life, wiih
make practicaliy no difference Vo the reasury.
If anything, it wiil make suai a very slight
increase that in the opinion of the treasurY
officiais the amount wiih ha negiigibie.

There is.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Supposing bis wife dies
and he re-marries. As I figure it out, the
second wife might not be entitled to the
superannuation; it would die with the first
wife. If that is so. I think further consideration will have to be given to the matter at
another session.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What about the wives of
judges now on superannuation?
Hon. Mr. KING: Those judges can make
election.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is that clear?

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It should be.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: County Court or
Circuit Court judges who have served less
than five years at the date of their retirement
receive only one-third of their salary instead
of two-thirds. Their widows will each receive
an annuity equal to one-ninth of the salary
of their iushands at the date of death.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable

section 26A.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The section reads:

elected to that effect. I do net think there
is any doubt about it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: All right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators,
w hile I am confident we are aill in favour of

I think we will agree that he is aware of
hardships that have arisen in the case of
judges' widows, and is in sympathy with them
and with the judges, wio huiave suffered by

But lie has stated, and I thiiiik we shall have

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No.
While, as I say, I think we shall have to
accept this situation, speaking for myself I
am net prepared to accept the reasons that
are being advanced in support of it by some
newspapers and by variots organizations and
others throtighout the country who, from time
to time. have discussed this question.

They

seem to base their argument on the ground that
many judges are getting enougi. That nay
or may net be so. But that is net the issue that
The issue whieh
ought to be considered.
ought to be considered in connection with the
whole problem of the administration of justice
is oe of public welfare. We liear a great
deal at times about British justice and its
administration as inherited by us in Canada.
It is now Canadian justice; and net only the
latwyers but the publie generally are proud of
it and boast of it. Yet I have the feeling at
this time that tlucre is not a full enough i

ali-

zation of just what Britisli jîustice lias neant
in Great Britain and other parts of the Empire
during the centuries, and I am not sure that
there is an entire appreciation at this time
of the danger that something may be lost in
this country in conuection with the administration of justicc. I say that when we are considering this question we shiould ask ourselves:
Is the policy of the Government, is the poliy
of Parliament. in the interest of public
welfare?
In the first place, in looking at this question
L think honourable members of this House
should study it from the standpoint of existing tribunals apart from the courts. There are
what we term administrative tribunals, having
semi-judicial authority. Somnetimes there are
appeals fron these tribinals to the courts.
both on questions of law and of fact, and
sometimes there is a denial of the rigbt to
appeal. There is a great difference between

JULY 27, 1944
these tribunals and the courts of justice. I
often think laymen overlook the fundamental
performing
tribunals
between
difference
administrative duties and the courts, which
are performing strictly judicial duties.
Let me give an illustration. In a private
organization a man is hired -at, say, $200 a
month, and there is provision for a month's
notice in the event of his dismissal. Now, the
head of that organization may have heard
rumours about this man, or someone whose
opinion was respected may have come in and
said: "This man is living beyond his income.
I cannot prove that he is dishonest, but the
circumstances are suspicious." The head of
the organization may then decide that it is not
in the company's interest to keep this man,
and write a letter of dismissal, and pay $200 in
lieu of a month's notice. That is strictly an
administrative act. The man who makes the decision that the employce should be dismissed
under these circumstances is entitled from a
business point of view to consider only the interests of the business. If he thinks it is in the
interest of the business to do so, he may say, "I
do not want you any longer." On the other hand
suppose the employer says: "We will dismiss
that man on the ground that he is dishonest.
and we will not pay him the $200 in lieu of
notice." Once that situation arises you enter
the field of contractual relations between
employer and employee, and the employee is
entitled to go to the courts to have his case
decided on strictly judicial principles, because
individual rights are now involved. There is
a contract and a charge of dishonesty. Justice
demands a trial.
That illustrates the fundamental distinction
between administrative bodies and judicial
bodies; and one of the dangers that I see-it
existed long before the war, but has been very
much aggravated since-is the tendency to
mix up administrative bodies, which consider
only matters of administration, and judicial
bodies, which must give paramount consideration to justice and to the rights of the individual, and render decisions in accordance
with principles of justice which this country
and the Mother Country have developed over
the years of growth of our social and political
institutions. Now, I say that if these principles of justice in our courts are to be maintained, we must first have the ideal before us.
and secondly, we must give it practical effect.
That means that the ideal must be supplemented by efficiency. The basis of efficiency
is competent judges, and you cannot have
competent judges to administer justice unless
vou have competent lawyera to fill positions
on the Bench.
106-241

I have heard in many quarters the statement: "Well the judges do prettywell. They
get good salaries." We still have the capitalist
system in this country; it is hobbling alongHon. Mr. KING: It is doing quite well.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It is not the free
system it once was-I am not sure it should
be-but it is still the capitalist system and it
still carries with it the element of competition,
the basis of which is that the man who is
most efficient in business will best succeed.
The same principle is applicable to the professions: the men who are the most highly
trained, the most efficient and the most competent, will get the greatest awards. As long
as that principle exists, the efficient, capable
lawyer is bound to receive the highest rewards of his profession, and be is just as much
entitled to do so as is the business man, the
engineer or the doctor. As a matter of fact,
I think he is more entitled to those rewards
than the doctor, because the average income
of the doctor is higher than the average income
of the lawyer. As a rule the lawyer only
becomes successful in the large centres where
the competition is keen, whereas the medical
profession demands the same services and
offers the same opportunities in the smaller
places as in the large. Consequently, as I say,
the average income of the doctor is very much
higher than that of the lawyer. As a matter
of fact, I have seen figures-I do not remember them exactly-which show that in the city
of New York the average income of a lawyer
is about $600. That shows what extremes
there are in the profession.
I am not defending the lawyers. I am discussing this question from the point of view
of recognizing that under the capitalist system,
the competitive system, the good lawyers are
bound to receive substantial incomes. Therefore, if the State expects to secure as judges
men whose incomes are commensurate with
those of the best doctors and engineers and
the most competent business men, it must pay
salaries which bear some relation to what
these men would earn in private life.
More than once the question has been asked,
"Why should there be pensions for judges
when such inadequate provision is made for
old age pensions?" That, of course, shows an
entire mis-appreciation of the situation. In
the one case the pension is a part of the
remuneration of a man who,. when he is
engaged, has to put aside all his private transactions and activities to go on the Bench, and
who in making provision for his family after
his death will be dependent on his salary alone.
The pension is part of his remuneration. That
is a very different proposition from the old

348

SENATE

age pension, which is furnished by the State,
flot by way of contract, but by way of a
contribution to people who have arrived at a
certain age and are no longer capable of
looking aftor theinscives. Thiat is flot remunoratien; it is contribution.
Honourable senators, I have raised this discussion not, with any idea of an immediate
change, but in order that honourable members
,of this Chamber, who are experienccd and
thoughitful men, may consider these things on
a proper basis and kecp in mind the necessity
of making sure that contractual rights, the
,rights of personal frcodom and ail other individual rights, wilI net be lost or lcssened in
these days of administrativ e tribunals, but will
be prcserved by free aecess to the courts and
by the maintenance of the bigh standard of

In the ardinary case, people who are d.rafting

a situation where there may he such a genera]
power of appointment without any alternative
right of exercise, and where the persan who
enjoys the general power of appointmont bas
failed ta exercise it. In such circumstances a
teýchnîcal legal question arase as ta whether
praperty that passod ta a persan becauso' of
failure ta exercise a general power of appointment was or was not a succession within the
meaining af the Act. The amendment is intended to make clear that in such circumstances there is a succession.
I do not intend ta move that this Bill be
referred to cuinmittee, un]ess the House indicates a desire ta have this donc.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Hanourable sonators, this aftcrnaan scems ta be a real fieldday for the lawyers. So far ail the Bis that
have came before us at this sitting have been
explained and discussed by members of the
legal prafessian.
I desire to make a few remarks with regard
ta paragraph (b) af section 1. There has heen
a lot of difficulty aver the definition of "child,"
particularly because the definitian in the
provincial Succession Duty Acts is different
from that in the Daminion Succession Duty
Act. Most iawyers practising in the Probate
Caurts have had ta handie wills under which
praperty was left ta a child, of the decoasod.
In same wills a child may ho referred ta as
having been legally ad.opted, and in others
simpiy as the child of the testatar. Whon yau
went ta prohate the will yau faund that, even
if you were unable to prove legal adoption of
a child, the provincial Succession Dýuty Department would, fot assess the child as a
stranger; but when you filed yaur papers with
the Dominion Succession Duty Office. unleas
you were able ta prove that the child was
legally adopted at a proper age, succession
duty would have ta be paid an the child's
interest in the estate just as though that
child had been a stranger.
The amendment provided by paragraph (b)
of section 1 of this Bill makes the de-finition
similar ta that in the Succession Duty Act
of Saskatchewan and of most ather provinces.
I am pleased to see this amendment. My
anly criticism. is that the change is nat made
retroactive. The Dominion Succession Duty
Act came into farce aniy in 1941, s0 there
would- nat ha a heavy lass of revenue ta the
Department if the amendment were made
retroactive ta that year. I may mention a
couple of cases that I had, in my office this
last year. In one, a testatrix, having adopted a

child at the age of ane or two months,
destroyed the adoption papers because she
did not wish the child ta learn that ho ha&
heen adopted. The will, however, described
the child as having heen legally adopted, andwe had ta pay the Dominion Succession Duty
Office three ar four hundred dollars mare
duty t:han if wc had. heen able ta prove the
legal adoption. The estate was only a smaîl
one and the child needs that money. I had a
similar case a few days ega. As I understand
this amendment, neither of those cases will
ho reconsidered. I would point out that the
two estates have not yet been wound up,.
and therefore, in the event of this section
being amendcd ta caver aIl estates subjeet tasuccession duties since the inceptian of the
Act in 1941, there is nothîng ta hinder a.
refund.
Hon. Mr. KING: 1 helieve my honourahlé
friend is satisfied with the amendment. It
is certainly an improvement on the original
section. Ho suggests that the section should
ho made retroactive. That is a principle nat
readily conceded hy the Department.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I would not have
suggested that the section ho made retroactive if this were an aid, statute.
Han. Mr. KING: The original Act is,
chapter 14 of the Statutes of 1940-41-, and no,
douht many estates have heen waund up since,
it came inta operation. In view of what the
departmental officiais told us yesterday in
Cammittee, that they would, hesitate ta advise
this amendment being made retroactive, I
think, we should accept the section in its present
form. It liberalizes the definition of "child,"'
and probahly goes as far as we could cxpeefr

AUGUST 1, 1944
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable senators,
words fail to express my personal feelings in
regard to our late colleague.
I knew Senator Robinson since 1893. In
that year I became articled to a law firm of
which he, having just finished his course, was
the junior partner. We were practically boys
at that time, and we spent two years together
in that office. Even back in those days his
many fine qualities were recognized, and he
was marked by the citizens of his native city,
Moncton, as one who would naturally play a
successful part in public affairs. In 1895, at
the age of 29, he was elected as an alderman of
Moncton, and after continuing in that office
for two years he was chosen mayor by
acclamation.
I had become greatly impressed by our late
colleague's high qualifications for public life,
and at a convention called to nominate a
Liberal candidate for the county of Westmorland, in the Dominion election of 1896-which
was the first time that I ever took part in
any political matters-I had the honour and
pleasure of nominating him. Despite the fact
that his apponent was a man of great ability
and experience, and that for the preceding,
twenty years the constituency had returned a
Conservative, Mr. Robinson came within
fifteen votes of being elected. The next year
in a by-election for the provincial legislature
he was elected by acclamation as member for
Moncton, a constituency which he represented
continuously from 1897 until 1924, except for
the years 1912 to 1917. For two terms, or part
of two terms, he was Speaker of the Legislature, an office which, as all who know him will
understand, he filled with dignity, grace and
impartiality. In 1907, after retiring from the
Speakership, he was invited to become a member of the Executive Council without portfolio, and shortly afterwards was made
Provincial Secretary.
That same year he became Premier of the
province. In 1908 an appeal was made to
the people-the Liberal party had been in
office for some twenty years without a break;
he was the fifth successive Premier during that
period-and the Government was defeated.
Mr. Robinson himself was re-elected, however,
and continued to be a member of the provincial House until 1912, when he retired. In
the provincial general election of 1917 he was
again a successful candidate, and when the
Foster cabinet was formed he was made a
Minister without portfolio. Two years later
he became Minister of Lands and Mines, which
post he held until he was summoned to this
As a member of the federal
Chamber.
Government at the time I had the honour and

351

the pleasure of recommending to the Prime
Minister Mr. Robinson's appointment to the
Senate.
During all these years Senator Robinson
occupied a prominent place in not only the
political but the business life of New Brunswick. Soon after entering on his publie career
he ceased to practice at the Bar, but his
counsel was eagerly sought, and usually followed, by corporations and business firms.
From 1910 to 1917 he embarked on large
lumber operations, and ultimately devoted
himself largely to his business interests.
No man could have had a better friend than
For fifty-one
I had in Senator Robinson.
years we enjoyed the closest personal and
political friendship, and during that long period
never a harsh word passed between us. I firmly
believe be never harboured an unkind thought
of me-or for that matter of anyone-and
yesterday afternoon as I saw his remains
lowered to their last resting place I could not
but realize that I bad lost the staunchest of
friends. His memory will always remain green
with me, as I am sure it will with all who
have had the good fortune to be associated
with him in this chamber. I do not know
whether he selected the hymn sung at his
funeral service, but as I listened I thought it
would be just like Cliff to express himself as in
this couplet:
Let there be no moaning at the bar
When I put out to sea.
My dear friend was an honourable, straightforward gentleman, always courteous and kind
to both friend and foe. When the Liberal party
in the county of Westmorland was at its lowest
ebb, a weak minority party, he did net hesitate
to associate himself with its fortunes. He became an uncompromising party man, but
never a bitter partisan. Some of his strongest
political opponents were also his strongest
personal friends.
It is a tribute to our late colleague's abilities
that he occupied such a prominent position in
the political life of Canada, and I am confident
that had he been as aggressive as he was able
he would have reached a still more prominent
place. I know of three occasions when he
declined preferment. I recall in particular one
case in 1915 when, though my senior, he effaced
himself and proposed my nomination as candidate for a seat in the House of Commons,
and helped to assure my election. We worked
together in the fullest harmony. In all our
election campaigns he was my right-hand supporter, and I reciprocated and helped him to
the best of my ability.

352

SENATE

On his appointment to this Chamber he
participated in our debates only when he had
something worth while to say, and he always
said it well. He also took an active part in
our standing committees, where his opinions,
based on long experience in public and business
life, were always well received.
I realize that I have lost a true, loyal and
faithful friend. His splendid career bas meant
much to the public life of this country, and I
hope it may inspire us all to still greater
endeavours as members of the Senate of
Canada. His dignity of manner entitled him
to walk with kings, and at the same time enabled him to keep in touch with the common
people, from whom he sprang, among whom ho
dwelt, and for whom he laboured during his
public career.
On behalf of honourable members on this
side of the House, I wish to extend our deepest
sympathy to the widow and the step-daughter
of our .late colleague.

(Hon. Mr.

Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honou.rable senators,
it is with feelings of deep emotion that I rise
to say something about my late friend Clifford
Robinson.
I endorse all that has been said by my
honourable colleague opposite (Hon. Mr
Copp).
Like him, I have known Senator
Robinson all my life. As very young boys
he and I went to Mount Allison Academy,
the preparatory school for the university. At
that time I was 12, and Clifford, was 14
or 15. From there we went to the university,
he two years ahead of me. We have always
been friends, and notwithstanding that we
were members of opposing political parties,
we continued to be friends until his departure
from this world.
I received a letter yesterday from a business associate of mine in Moncton, in which
he used these words:
Senator Robinson was tie sort of man one
liked to meet amd liked to talk with.
I do not know that any finer tribute can
be paid to any man by a fellow citizen than is
contained in those sincere words-and, I think
they would be echoed by every person who
knew Senator Robinson well.
Senator Robinson was a descendant of the
so-called Yorkshire Settlers who came to the
head of the Bay of Fundy in the 1770's. They
were a very fine body of people. Possessed of
considerable worldly wealth in those times,
they brought with them their furniture, and in
most cases their stock, and, made homes for
Hon. Mr. COPP.

themselves and their descendants.
In 1774
two or three members of the group brought
out brick from Yorkshire, and erected buildings on Point de Bute Ridge, one of which remained until only a few years ago, when it
was taken down because the bricks were so
weathered that they would no longer hold
together. Such was the stock frocm which
Senator Robinson came. As was only natural,
members of these families who came to the
head of the Bay of Fundy so long ago intermarried, with the result that many people in
that section of the country to-day can claim
some relationship. Clifford and I were second
cousins on both sides of the family. Though
I did net support him in elections, nor he
me, we had no disagreements.
We ran
elections in the same county without interrupting our friendship. We were good friends at
all times.
As the previous speaker said, Clifford
Robinson was a lawyer by profession, and a
good one, but during recent years his mind
ran more in the direction of business. He and
I have been closely associated in many enterprises in the Maritime Provinces. We have
also for years been members of the Board of
,Governors of the University from which we
received our degrees. Our associations have
been of the most pleasant nature. When he
visited Sackville I invited him to my house;
when I was in Moncton, I frequently went to
bis;, and this pleasant family relationship
continued throughout our lives.
I was greatly shocked to hear of his illness, and still more shocked to hear of his
death. I deeply regret that the visit of friends
from a very distant part of the Dominion
made it impossible for me to attend his funeral
and pay my last respects.
The province of New Brunswick has lest a
fine citizen; the city of Moncton bas lost a
man who at all times had its interests at
heart. He will be missed there, as elsewhere,
for many years to come. The younger generations, of course, did not know Clifford Robinson as we knew him, but they must know
the record he has left behind him.
It would be futile to give a chronological
catalogue of the late Senator's activities; that
has already been well done; but one thing
that I can say is that the memory of Clifford
Robinson will remain fresh in our minds as
long as we continue to be memibers of this
Chamber. I salute the memory of the Honourable C. W. Robinson.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I am quite sure,
honourable senators, that you would wish me
to forward a copy of the record containing
these remarks to Mrs. Robinson.

CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 171, an Act to amend the Civil Service
Superannuation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I think those
of us who have been in Parliamentary life in
Ottawa for a number of years have come to
realize that our Civil Service is a most important public body. The younger democraciem
have learned that it takes time to build up
an efficient civil service. In Canada, especially
during the last twenty or thirty years, many
young men and women who have planned to
make their careers in the public service have
followed the English practice of undergoing
special studies in an endeavour to qualify
themselves for certain positions. I believe
there are in our universities to-day a considerable number of young people looking forward
to the time when they may become members
of the Dominion Civil Service. That, it seems
to me, is a development of much importance
and one that will prove highly advantageous
to our country.
This Bill is an effort on the part of the
Government to meet representations made by
Civil Service committees to the Treasury
Board or the responsible Minister, as well as
recommendations received from time to time
from Parliamentary committees. Nowadays
appointees to positions in the Service are
largely chosen by the Civil Service Commission. 'It is true there has been some complaint
on the part of elected members of Parliament,
and perhaps at times proper complaint,
because their influence in securing appoint,ments had been greatly curtailed; but I believe
that in general the public are pleased with
the present arrangement. When we look back
over the history of our Civil Service and
realize that a change of government no longer
affects the tenure of office of publie servants,
we see that considerable advance has been
made. Our civil servants have learned to
adapt themselves to changes of government,
and know it is their business and duty to carry
out the policies of the elected representatives
of the people. I have had some experience
with the Civil Service, both in the provincial
and federal fields, and have found that if a

SENATE
minister has confidence in his departmental
officers and staff and invites their co-operation,
he will readily secure it.
This Bill is long and complicated.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: The amendments are
numerous and will have to be carefully considered. It is difficult ta give a full explanation of the changes, but I shall try to indicate
briefly what is proposed. The Bill consolidates
regulations passed by the Governor in Council
in 1939 and amendments made to the Act in
1940. Certain employees who previously had
the right to elect, within a certain period, to
come under the Superannuation Act, but who
failed to do so, are to be given a further right
to exorcise this option at any time during one
year from the 15th of August next. Some
3,500 persons who to-day are in the temporary
service, or contributors ta the rectirement fund,
will have an opportunity to enjoy the benefits
of the superannuation fund.
There is also a provision which will allow
what are known as prevailing-rate employees
to become contributors to the superannuation
fund. I remember very well that there was a
large number of these employees in the Department of Public Works. That group includes
mon such as plumbers, who in the Government
service are paid wages at the scale prevailing
in private employment.
A number of sections in the Bill provide for
certain incrcases in benefits. One amendment
applies ta persons who aire dicharged or who

resign before completing ten years' service. Formerly they forfeited whatever contributions
they had made ta the superannuation fund,
but under the amendment they will be entitled
ta the return of their total contributions,
without interest.
It is also provided that where a pension is
payable te dependants of a formèr public
servant whose total required contribution has
not been fully paid, the pension will continue
until it has equalled the contributions made.
. Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the honourable leader a question? He has said that
employees who complete less than ton years'
service, and wtho in the past would have
forfeited all their contributions, will now
receive back the sum of their payments. Will
that apply also to employees discharged for
miseonduct of any kind? When I was a member of the Government I constantly advocated
that ýamendment, but never succeeded in
getting it.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, there is such an
amendment; it is the last one on the list in
front of me.
Hon. Mr. KING.

The Bill also provides that if a public
servant dies without dependants, his estate
will be paid an amount not less than his contributions to the fund.
I come now to the point raised by my
honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler). The Bill repeals the clause providing
for the forfeiture of contributions made by
an employee discharged from the Service, it
being felt that other action should be taken
in such cases.

As I have said, this Bill is long and complicated, and I expect there will be considerable discussion of some sections. If it is the
wish of honourable members that there be a
reference to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, I shall so move, after the second
reading.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators.
as the honourable leader has said, this is a
complicated Bill and will require careful
investigation. Personally, I would prefer to
have it considered in committee before I make
any remarks about it. I should like to say,
though, that we took a long step forward for
the betterment of public service when we
established the Civil Service Commission, and
it seems ta me that these amendments are
along the right line. All over the country
annuities payable at sixty-five or seventy are
becoming increasingly popular, and I believe
there will I- general agreement with the prieciple of this Bill. However, as I have already
intimated, it would be well to go ta a committee, whcre we could interrogate departmental officers upon various points, so at
present I shal say nothing about the mnerits
of the Bill.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill was
read the second time

AERONAUTICS BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. A. B. COPP, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and
Harbours, presented and moved concurrence
in the Commýittee's report on Bill 133, an Act
ta amend the Aeronautics Act.

AUGUST 2,1944
He said: Honourable senators, the Committee bas made one amendment to this Bill.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I beg to .move, seconded by the honourablie senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder),
the following amendment:
That the report of the comrnittee be not now
concurred in, but that the Bill be referred back
to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours, with instructions to strike
out the word "Minister" where it appears n
the tenth line, page 5, section 12, subsection 8,
and substitute therefor the following:
Governor in Council, which appeal must be
held and decided upon within three months of
the date of the filing of the 'said appeal.
The subsection will then read:
Where the Board refuses to issue a licence,
issues a licence which differs from the licence
applied for, or attaches conditions to which the
applicant objects, an appeal may be made to
the Governor in Council, wihich appeal must
be held and decided upon within three months
cf the date of the filing of the said appeal.
I move this amendment because I object te
the underlying principle of this Bill, which
places the regulation of civil aeronautics under
the control of one man, the Minister of Transport for the time being.
I might object te other clauses-for instance,
te the first paragraph of clause 12, which
reads:
Subject to the approval of the Minister, the
Board may issue to any person applying therefor a licence to operate a commercial air service.
However, I am limiting myself te this basic
Under the Bill as at present
amendment.
drafted, if I, with the approval, mind you, of
the Minister, were to apply for a licence te
operate an air service from Winnipeg te
Churchill, and the honourable senator from
Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) made a similar
application, the Minister could say to the
Board, "We will deal with the Calder application." Then I would be out. I do not like
te give the Minister such arbitrary power,
but I am not objecting te that. Furthermore,
the Minister can instruct the Board, te make
all sorts of findings, and I have no objection
to him having that authority.
I do not intend to-d.ay te go over again the
fundamental objections which I urged against
this Bill on the motion for second reading,
except te say that in my. view it is fundamental that the proposed board should have the
final say in all matters of civil aviation. That
is the principle embodied in the Railway Act
which established the Board of Railway Commissioners te deal with railway transportation. True, the first Aeronautics Act was
passed in 1918, but at that time aviation was
of little account, and.not until 1938 did its
regulation become much of a problem in this

35Î

country. Since then, however, largely owing
te the war, a development has taken place, a
development which otherwise would have required ten or twenty years. At the present
time there- is no body of legislation governing
aviation. Under this Bill a Board is set up
which, at the request of the Minister, will hear
representatives and make investigations in
regard te matters of policy. It will then
report te the Minister. That is covered very
thoroughly by Sections 9 and 10.
Practically the only objection raised to my
amendment by the Minister was that an
appeal te the Goverffor in Council would take
too long. Well, I am limiting the time within
which the appeal must be heard and decided
te three months. There is no question that
it can be done in that time. There will not
be many appeals te be heard. Aviation is not
like railway transportation. Little companies
will not want te establish air lines; the cost is
far too great. It is all right to say that other
conditions exist in the United States. I am
not dealing with the question of whether the
railways should have rights or not. My
primary objection to. the measure before us in
its present form is that it places all the power
in the hands of one man; and no matter who
that man may be, aviation is much too important to be under one man's control.
My honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr.
King) said this morning that this man would
be a member of the Government, and that he
would be controlled by the other members
of the Government. Well, that may ba se, or
it may not. Certainly that is not in accordance with the history of governmental affairs.
The Minister largely controls the department
over which he presides.
It was also urged this morning that the
Governor in Council must appoint the Board.
I am not saying that is not truc, but I am
not much impressed by that argument. The
Board cannot grant a licence unless the Minister permits it te do se, and if it refuses,
there can be an appeal to the Minister.
I ask the House te send this Bill back te
Committee with instructions te make provision
for an appeal. I think that is the least I
coul.d ask for. The only questions on which
there may be appeals from the Board of Railway Commissioners are questions of jurisdiction
or law. It is quite true. that the Governor in
Council can pass legislation overriding the
decisions of the Board, but that is not an
appeal. The Government can pass on Orderin-Council and repeal what the Board has donc.
I would have no objection te such a provision in this Bill. But I am asking a great
deal less than that because I am impressed by

356

SENATE

the argument of the honourable senator. from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) that this is a
new field which requires the building up of
policies and a code of law, and therefore the
Minister and the Board must have power
accordingly. But I want the final appeal to
be to the Governor in Couneil, with a limit
of three months upon the time during which
the matter may be delayed. I therefore ask
the House to vote for the amendment.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
this matter was discussed on the motion for
second reading, a few days ago, and again in
committee this morning. I regard my honourable friend's contention as being more
technical than practical. From a technical
point of view bis amendment would seem to
be all right, but when it comes to the practical development of air transportation in
Canada, at the stage that we have now
reached, I believe the course taken by the
Government is the right one. The Government takes the responsibility of nominating
and appointing the Air Transport Board.
What is the purpose of that Board? It is
to investigate and make a study of rates and
various other phases of aerial transportation
in this country. The Board's powers are also
qualified by the provision that whatever
regulations it may make are subject to
approval by the Governor in Council.
My honourable friend objects to the Minister having the power to say "Yes" and "No."
That is a power used every day by every
Minister in the operation and administration
of his department. The responsible Minister
under this Act will be dealing with great
public problems. My honourable friend said
that he himself might apply for a licence to
operate an air line between Winnipeg and
Hudson Bay, that his confrere sitting next
to him might apply for a similar licence,
and the Minister could rule that only one
application should be received. Under this
Act it is net intended that anything of the
kind should be done. The Board will be
required to receive and study all applications,
and then to make recommendations to the
Minister. These will not be ordinary departmental matters. If my honourable friend
does apply for a licence, it will be a matter
cf great importance to the people, not only
of Winnipeg but of Canada generally, for
everyone recognizes the vital place of the
Northwest country in international air routes.
Speaking from my own experience-and I
have had some-I should say that the best
safeguard rests in the requirement that all
applications for licences must be referred to
the Minister, who is vested with the right to
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

make the decision.
What is the situation?
Members of the Government will know if
there is any controversy going on between
thpe Minister and the Board.
There is a
further provision that the Board's regulations
must be laid before both Houses of Parliament within ten days after they are published
in the Canada Gazette, or, if Parliament is net
sitting at the time, within ten days after
Parliament resuimes its sittings. My honourable friend refers to the Board of Transport
Commissioners. That Board was establislhed
in 1903, as the Board of Railway Commissioners.
It was not given full powers; it
never has had full powers. It never has had
the right to grant a charter to anyone for
the building of a line. Regulations made by
the Board from time to time, together with
various legal decisions, constitute a form of
irisprudence wbich is accepted as a guide
for the Board's actions. It will of course be
seme years before the Air Transport Board
reaches a comparable stage.
I disagree with my honourable friend's
suggestion that the Air Transport Board
should be made an entirely independent
body for deciding upon applications for
licences. I am satisfied that the people of
Canada would not be prepared to place the
responsibility for such decisions in the Pands
of any three men. I should like to meet
my honourable friend's suggestion, but I am
sorry that I cannot do so. As I remarked at
the outset, I regard bis proposal as being more
technical than practical. The Minister appeared before the Committee this morning
and expressed his feelings. He has had much
to do with the development of air transportation in this country, and I am convinced of
the soundness of his judgment in this and
many other matters. I believe that in so far
as this legislation is concerned the best safeguard lies in the requirements that decisions
as to licences must be made by the Minister
and that an annual report on work of the
Board shall be presented to Parliament. In the
interval while air transportation is being
developed within this country and internationally, we shall no doubt be building up a body
of jurisprudence that some day will make it
feasible for us to have this relatively new
means of travel regulated by a body similar
to the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Honourable senators, may
I just say a word with regard to one feature
of my honourable friend's amendment? He
is asking us te pass a law that would require
the Governor in Council te take certain action

AUGUST 2, 1944

-

within a specified time. That, it seems te
me, would be going farther than any legislation
should go.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I was trying to meet an
objection raised by the Minister.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
I have only a few words to say in connection
with this Bill. In a sense the whole business
of aviation is in the making, and 1 presume
that t.here are reasons why we cannot proceed
rapidly in determining matters of policy.
Assurance was given to us by the Minister
this morning that in the near future the Air
Transport Board will hold an inquiry to secure
data on the basis of which the Government
and Parliament nmy prepare a line of policy
for the future. Our real difficulty is that at
present there is ne legisiation embodying a
policy for the development of aviation in this
country. In the railway field the situation is
different. We have a large Railway Act that,
consolidlates decisions by the Government and
Parliament on a thousand matters of policy,
and in deciding any questions within its jurisdiction the Board cf Transport Commissioners
is guided by, t.he law. It, is true that Parliament has neyer gîven the Transport Board
the right te issue a railway charter; that
right has always remained with Parliament.
As to aerial transport we are at present in
a period of transition, and the question before
us is whether the Minister should have the
power to decide certain matters about which
there is a difference of opinion. You canno-t
compare the powers of the Minister in charge
of aerenautics with those of any other minister, fer ministerial powers and duties with
respect te ail other matters are pret.ty well
defined hy law. It is in this new field alone
that the Minister is given the sole power of
deciding questions of policy.
The honourable leader opposite has referred
to the provision that the Air Transport
Board's regulations shall be laid befo-re
Parliament, but in my opinion that does net
touch the objection te the Bill. Any question
of policy decided upon by the Minister in
June, for instance, might net be reported te
Parliament until January, February or March
of the next year. I say that to give a single
Minister the right te decide questions of
policy, without providing for any appeal from
bis decision, is undemnocratic and unsound; and
until the policy is set forth in the law, there
should be some procedure for appeal. That is
why this amendment is prepesed.
I was very glad te hear the Minister state
definitely this morning that the Air Transport
Board weuld arrange for the holding of public
hearings throughout the whole country, se that

35'

ail persans interested would have an opportunity to make representation as te what
should be provided for in our law on aeronautics. I trust that such hearings will be
held, that ail interested persons will appear
and mnake their wishes known, and that in due
course we shahl have the necessary statute.
The Hon. the SPE*AKER: Honourable senators, I shouhd hike te point out that before
discussion begins on any motion the question
shouhd be first put frem the Chair. In this
instance discussion began before the question
was put, but I refrained from interrupting. I
will now put the question. The Honeurable
Senator Copp presented the report of the
Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs
and Harbours on Bill 133, an Act te amend
the Aeronautics Act, and meved, seconded by
the Hlonourable Senator Hugessen, that the
Thereupon the
report be concurred in.
Honourable Senator Haig moved in amendment, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Calder, that the report of the cemmittee he
net now concurred in but that the Bill he
referred back to the cemmittee with instructiens te strike eut the ýword "Minister" in
section 12, subsection 8, as appearing on page 5,
at line 10, and te substitute therefor the
fohhowing words: "Governor in Coundil, which
appeal must be held and decided upon within
three months of the date of the filing of said
appeal." If se amended, subsection 8 of
Section 12 weuld read as follows:
Where the Board refuses te issue a licence,
issues a licence which differs from the licence
applied -for, or attaches conditions -te which the
applicant 'objects, an appeal may be -made te
the Gevernor in Council, which appeaýl must
be held andl decided upen within three meonths
of the date cf the filing of said appeal.
The question is on the amendment. la it
vour pleasure te adopt the ameedment?
Those in faveur will say "Content."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Content.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those opposed
wihl say "Non-content."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Non-content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In my opinion,
the non-contents have it.

AGRICULTUýRAL PRICES SUPPORT BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING movmd the second reading
of Bill 168, an Act for the support of the
prices of agricultural products during the
transition from war to peace.
Be said: Honourable senators, I may say
in explanation of this Bill that it is the desire
of the Govmrnmcnt to set u-p machinery to
provide mneans whermby the prices of agricultural products may be stabilized during the
transition from war to peace. Wm know that
early in the war the Government set up control boards with respect to agricultural produets,
and it will be admitted that if control bad flot
been mxercised the farmers in many cases would
have rmceived moré for their produets than
they did. It must be admitted that the
control measures taken up te the presenit have
been of great advantage; -,nd honourable
members will agrem thait the ability to, control
prices and prevent inflation aftmr the war will
be of still greater advantage.
It bas been thought wise that machinery
should bo provided for this purpose, and
under this legislation a board of three members will be appointed to survey the agricultural field from time to time with a view to
advising the Government upon the desirability
of establishing floor prices for certain products.
No particular product is mentioned in the
bill; whmat is excluded; but it is within the
option of the government, and of the Board,

acting under regulations made by the Governor
in Council, to recommend from time to time
the establishment of floor prices. Prices once
having been established, if the market indicates that articles such as butter or eggs are
due for a slump owing to seasonal conditions,
it will be within'the. province of the Board to
step in and support the prices of those commodities. If the market does not absorb the
produet at the floor price, the Government will
buy that commodity and control the price.

à

The Bill also provides for buying and
selling, flot only Iocally and domestically but
internationally. On the advice of the Board
the Governiment may make arrangements to,
have other countries take various products
at certain prices. To accomplish this a revo.iving sum of M000,000 will be placed at the
dàsposal of the Board. It is flot expected that
there wiil be any profits, or that participation
certificates will be issuedý.
1 arn sure that if we can successfully maintain reasonable prices for agricultural products
during this period of uncertainty we shahl be
doing a great service for not only the agriculturists but the people of Canada generally.
The bill is easily understood, and with this
short explanation 1 move the second reading.
Hon. R, B. BORNER: Honourable senators,
I wish to make a few remarks on this Bill. 1
fail to understand just ho.w any definite service
will ýbe rendered. 1 arn suspicious. The Bill
mentions the period of transition from war to
peace. If I arn right, the difficulty which wilI
confront the farmer will occur not during that
period but afterwards. 1 had hoped thiis Bill
would contain some assurance regarding the
peacetime period. It is true that the prices of
farm products have heem prevented from rising
for fear of inflation, and I had hoped the Bill
would contain some definite plcdge that aftcr
peace had been restored there would be some
regulation of prices.
There is another point that troubles me with
regard to the marketing of live cattie. The
Bill doms not say who will be protectmd, the
par-ker or the farmer who raises the live
animal.
These are the features of the Bill whieh cause
me.some disturbance.
Hon. Mr. KING: The powcrs of the Board
are wide, but they are subject to the control
of the Governor in Council.
Hon. JOHIN T. HAIG: I appreciate the position of the honourable member from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Borner), for what
bas worried me about this legislatio-n ever
since it came into the Bo-use is the fact that
it evidently does not contemplate dealing with
grain at ail, because the sumn mmntionmd in the
Bill is only $200,0O,000. This year the grain
crop of western Canada probably will be five
hundsred million bushels of wheat, four hundred
million bushels nf oats, two hundrmd million
bushels of barley and a f airly large crop of
flax.

Bon. Mr. KING: We have staibilization
now under the Grain Board.

360

SENATE

H-on. Mr. HAIG: Yes, but flot under this
Bill.
What 1 had hoped for was that in
this legisiation Parliament would recognize
that portion of our population xWhieh is engaged
in primary production..Atw in Bill, dealing
with fisheries, which is cuming to us fromn the
other House eliminates part of my objection;
bu~t during the last forty years I have neyer
feit that the farmers got a fair share of the
national income. I admit that this measure
is an attempt to give them a larger share. To
that I say "Amen," but I really thought we
would have had a much more comprehensive
measure.
1 want to say to hionourable gentlemen
opposite-and I arn going to ju.t touch on
politics for a momentHon. Mr. COPP: Careful!
I-on. Mr. HAIG: -that in the next eloction
tbey are goiog to ho met with a challenge
fromn the Leader of our party on the question
of fairnes to the farmers during recent years.
and iii the future. I agree ivitb the honourable
senator frorn Saskatchewan North when ho
says that this Bill deals only witli the period
of transition froim war to peace. Now, what
are the facts? The Gox-eroment bas closed
the Winnipeg Grain Exchange, and lias fixed
the pricýe of xx
bc:t at $1.25.
If the Exchange
bad been left dloue the pric-e of xvat would
haxe becn mu cli more t han i bat. The on]y
Pei-sonls tffe cred xx u ttîe' faril ns. I admit thai
ilîrongh tbe year tlîe farmners of tlîe West
havxe deiiandcd tbat the Grain Exchange be
cloSed; buit it was onlv closed by the Government wlîen it xvas working for the farmer and
thie price of grain was going up. It is fortunate for us, that we will have one of the
best (Tops we exer bad. and that it has corne
.ît a time when the world sorely needs wlîeat;
but like my honourable friend, I want to knoxv
wbat is going to bappen after the war. Those
of ins xvbo lix d in wxestern Canada from 1930
to 1936. '<cars dtîring whicb the people of the
East suffered from a depression, know that in
tbe W'est we had not onl 'v a depression but an
abs.olute lack of erops. One of the troubles
of the M'estî b, been that for the last forty
years the mentality of Parliament hias been
rueh tbat it bas neyer, in miv .indgment, fully
reeognized the importance of the farmers in
the economie life of this country. This Bill
is a delayed and partial recognition of the
importance of the farming industry, and the
Bill vet to come gîves sinijlar recognition to
the importance of the fisbing industry.
I arn all for tbis Bill. but it doe; flot go far
enougb. 1 tlîink it sbonld bo the settled piolicy
of tbii.s country that. so far as the farmers are
concernied, the basic figýure sbould equal the
cost of production. It is ail right to say that
Ihii.

Mr.

KING

ynu can grow wheat in western Canada for
40 cents a bushet. You can if you have a
mechanized farmn and a large acreage; but on
the average farm you cannot grow it for leas
than 60 cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: And you have to get
a erop every year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, and we bad crop
failures for three or four years. The reaction
of the people to the situation which bias existed
in tlie pa..t is one of the basic reasons why
our fciends of the C.C.F. are making such
5
progress . They bave promised that such a
T
situation will not occur again. W e must see
to it that a greater share of our income goes
to the primary producers of this country. I
tbink tbat is basic. I may be wrong, but I
bolievo thuat John Bracken is going to challenge thi., country on that issue. It is going
to be an issue in this election or the next ono,
and it will offer a far greater challenge than
the C.C.F. will offer. I do ot believe Canada
will ever adopt socialism. It might, though,
if tlie people bocome temporarily nervous.
That is one of tbe explanations of the result
of tbe Saskatchîewan elections; but in my
opinion tbe true explanation bias ot yet been
given.
No one xxo lias ot lîcen brought up on, a
farîn knows the farnier's psychology. The
Canadian farmer lias nover had a square deal,
tither in thc We.ts or any ot-her part of the
cnnntr v. Fariners in Prince Edward Island
inay bave bee(n reasonably weil fixed at times,
but cuir farmiers in tbe Western Provinces
have alwavy felt tbiey did flot get a fair share
of tbe wealth cf this country. Now we are
entering a neiv period of international econoiei arrangements. Agreements will he made
witb varinuis couintrios. and in order to control the basic price of a commodity-bacon,
butter, ceeoFe, or wx-atever it happons to hotbe Goverumiient at, timos may have to pur(biase the eutrent production. The Government woii]d lie in a better position than any
indîvidital to niegotiato witb other countries
for the disposaI of the entire production of a
cornimoditv. I intcnd to vote for the Bill.
1 hiave takLen tbis, opportunity, ot te, criticize
tbe Governument, for I think ià bas made a
gond start, but suînply to point ont that in
troy opinion the Bill doos ot go far enough,
tbat à (IoeN ot deal with the underlying
problem.
Incidentallxv, I notice that the Board to be
set up under thuis measure must report to the
Governor iii Cotincil, ot to the Minister of
Agriciiltcirc.
Probably some of the remauks

ment, witb the resoît that this Bill bas been
made ta comply with the principle for which
we are contending.
I say again that althougli the Bill is a
move in the rigbt direction, it does not go far
enoughi. The farmer's problern was well stated
by the bonourable senatar from Saskatchewan
North (Hon. Mr. Horner). Witb the demand
from Europe and Asie. for food, agriculturai
prices may increase, and if the farmers can
get bold of enough money ta finance their
crops, conditions may remain fair for the next
four or five years. But wbat is going ta happen after thet?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: How many years
does my bonourable friend tbink the Bill
sbouid caver?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think good times wil
hast five years, because the demand for our
products wiii continue that long.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: How fer do you say
the Bill sbould extend beyond that?
I would make it
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
permanent.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There is no time limit
in the Bill, is there?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Bill is entitled, "An
Act for the support of the prices of agricultural products during the transition from war
ta peace." I want it ta extend beyond the
transition period; I want it ta, continue
indefinitely.
Hon.
longer?

Mr. LAMBERT:

For how

mucb

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Permenently. We cenflot go beck to the economic conditions that
existed before the Ivar. I do not believe
thet a cless of people et one end of the ecanamjc scale sb*ould get seventy-five per cent of
the weeltb produced in aur country,, wbiie a
cless et the opposite end gets only fifteen
per cent.
Hon. Mr. KING: Wbere did t.he honourabie
gentlemen obtain bis percentages?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I tbink you will find they
are correct.
Hon. Mr. KING: We sbould be careful wîtb
figures.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I believe tbey are approximately correct, according ta returns. The
farmers do not get a large enaugb proportion
of the total wealth praduced in this country.
That is the fundamental basis of the problem.
in Saskatchewan, and in Alberta, and in every
agricultural district throughout the country.
The farmers are hoping that John Bracken can

answer their prayer. If he cannot, they will
go radical. Agricultural radicalism. is different
from industrial radicalismn, because industry by
and large is dependent upon co-operation
between management and labour.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Is my honourable friend
trying to cIeprive Mr. Bracken of bis chance?
Hon,. Mr. HALG: No, but I arn willinýg to
give you the chance ta beat him to it. I arn
so much more concerned about the welfere of
the farmers than. I arn about polities that I
arn willing ta do that.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Well, hie won't be there.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend was
a member in another place, and I notice hie
was very glad ta accept an appointmnent to, the
Senate. I do not bleme bim a bit, because
bis former seat is now occupied by a person of
the opposite stripe of politics. My honourable
friend says John Bracken wiil not be there.
I can tell my honourable friend that I know
,. good many other men who will not be there,
especially if th--y run in Western Canada.
John Bracken w.ill run in Western Canada, in
the -province wbere hie bas lived for the
greater part of bis life, and bie wiIl be eiected
to the House of Commons as the representative -of one o.f the constituenci-es in that province. My bonourabie friend bas not known
bim, as I bave, for twenty-odd years.
However, tbe question before us is not
whetber John Bracken wiii be elected. The
question is wbetber the farmers of this country

Bill do-es lot go far enougb; but I intend to
support it, even tbough it is onîy a balf-way
measure.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
t sbould like to say a word or two about this
Bill. I am in favour of it. Wbetber or not it
extends far enougb is a question that can be
taken care of in due course; if .t ý,bould btecme
necessary ta, extend, the life of the legisiation,
there sbould be no difficulty in attending ta
that later on. The uncertainty as ta prices
conceros the post-war period; there is littie
doubt that tbey will flot fali beiow their
present level until after the war ends. No one
knows just wbat will bappen then. Look at
the situation in Europe. During the war most
Furopean countries bave been looted by Germany, and when peace cormes their supplies of
nearly every commodity wiii be very low.
Furtbermore, their productive capacity wili
have been seriously interfered with, and for a
wbiie wili remain at virtually the minimum.

fonds of ail kinds, manufactured goods and
everything that ive produce in our factories
.and on our farms. Millions of people have
been transferred fromn their native lands;
figures given to me indicate that as many as
six millions have been subjected to this treatment by the encmny. It is said that one and a
quarter million Frenchi citizens have been
moved to Germany, wlhere tbey are ohliged to
work on the ]and or in factories. But in the
course of time France, Norway, Denmark,
Holland andi other countries will become, as
we say, rehabilitated.: they will have secured
new implements and machinery, and their
people iiho were removed to enemy tcrritory
during tlic war will have returned home. The
crucial period for us will comne aftcr these
people are repatriated and production in their
respectiven coiîntries approaehes the normal
level. That will flot bc until some years hence.
If is tben that the Goveroment will have to
decide upon the real question underlying tbis
Bill, and miake up its mind whether, regardless

AUGUST 2, 1944
provides for the appointment of commodity
boards to undertake the purchase and disposition of agricultural products. Paragraph (j)
of the samne subsection provides for the
appointment of committecs to assist the Board
in an advisory capacity. This follows pretty
much the procedure under which. the Food
Board and the Bacon Board were constituted.
I think this is a good feature of the Bill, as
it will give represenfafion t0 the producer
af a minimum of expense for administration.
In regard t0 collecting information, 1 should
like. to emphasize one thing which enfers info
the wliole econoii structure of this measure.
In the discussions in another place comparative prices were given for agricultural produets
during the great war, during the depression,
a.Speaking generally,
and duigti
there is not much diffcrence between current
prices and those which were prevalent during
the last war; but there is a very greut differSince 1939
in working conditions.
ecc
appeals hav e from time to time been made
f0 our farmers f0 strive for maximum proOur
duction of beef, pork, and cereals.
farmers have answered those appeals i0 a
way whicbi 1 think is higbly commendable,
particularly as their cost of production bas
been very much inereased. I may say that
I am more familiar with agriculture in the
East than in the West. I know that farmers
in Eastern Canada are to-day paying almosf
double tho pre-war prices for new machinery.
They cannot buy as much -as fhey necd, for
the supplr is îationed, so they are ohhligcd f0
make the best of their nId machinery. This
means that in the period of transition from
.war to peace there will ho a groat demand
for farmi machiincry, and if presenit prices are
maintainod our farmers will bc involvcd in
a(lditional heavy expense.
Anofht r factor fo bceconsidered in farm
operation is wages. To-day wages of farm
workers in Eastern Canada are comparable
to those roceived by industrial workers, particularhy those engagcd in war industries, for
unless oui farmners pay simihar wages the men
drift loto munition factories and otber industrial plants. In many cases our farmers not
oniy bave to -puy their behp on this higher
scahe, but havego provide fhcm wif h board.
Our farmers also have f0 face heavier costs
when they repair their buildings. For instance,
roofing maferial, which, like many other
t-hings, is rafioned, cost $4.50 a thousand before
the war, as against $6.75 to-day, an increase

of 50 per cent.

These higher costa of farm,

operation will bo sharply accentuated during
the interim between war and peace, and
shouhd be very carefully considered by the
Board which is f0 function under this Bill.

There is another matfer fo which, I would
direct the attention of honourable senators.

As I have stated, during the past two years
farmers in Eastern Canada have been urged

to increase production f0 the maximum. In
order f0 accompfish. this they have had to
use much larger quantities of commercial
fertilizers,

particularly

in growing

pofafoes.

To a large extent fertihizer prices have been
controlled, but even so we are now paying

25 per cent more for ferfilizers than we were
before the war. During the period of adjustment fromn war f0 peace farmers in Eastern
Canada will have to continue to increase
rather than diminish their use of fertihizers.
The greafer the crop and the higher ifs stan-

dard the lowcr will be the unit cost of
produttion.

This

is possible

only by

the

generous use of modemn commercial ferfîhîzers.
On the other hand, farmers who follow the ohd
mefhod of fertilizing get a smalher crop at a
higber cost of production.

While, on the subject of ferfihizers, I would
remind honourable senators of a further disadvanfago which the farmers of Prince
Edward Island have f0 confend wifh. There
the soul is deficient in lime, and wif h the use
of commercial ferfilizers it is necessary f0
neutralize acidity by treating the land liberally

have bcd to pay hi ' h freight rates on
lime brought. from the other Maritime Provinces, and this matorial was not available fo
the small farmer unt il fthe provincial Government recontly granted a subsidy f0 offset the
cost of transportation. This grant is just beginning f0 stimuhaf e the traffie, and during the
crop season in the years ahead our railway
facihities will ho taxed to the limit f0 supphy
the lime required by the farmers of Prince
Edward Island.
With ail the extra expenses whicli bave
been added wifhin the hast five years
unless during the transition period from war
fo peace we bave some such measure of control
as it is provided for int bis Bill, the farmer wil

find bis commodify prices much below bis cost

secure a f air relationship between the returns

occupations.

House the Minister of Agriculture said:

conditions whi-h now exist to the prices which
now exist and that aill facts with regard to
matters of that kind be made available for use
immediately the war is over.
I think the honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder) is correct in saying
that while our present control system continues it may not bu necessary to go very far
with this Bill because prices for agricultural
products have been kept pretty well up to
the maximum of prices for other goods. However, this measure is in accordance with the
statement in the Speech from the Throne that:
To ensure economic stability for agriculture,
you will be asked to make provision for a price
floor for staple farm products.
I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Because of the brevity
of my remarks on this Bill, I wonder whether
I may be allowed one further word. I did
not wish to interrupt the honourable senator
from Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) when in his
opening remarks he said it was some fifteen
years after the last war that prices dropped.
I am confident that the honourable senator
from High River (Hon. Mr. Riley), who sits
behind him, very well remembers that in 1921
a number of farmers in Western Canada were
ruined because the prices of live cattle dropped
from 10 cents to 4 cents a pound. I hope this
correction may serve as a warning to farmers
throughout the country not to expect present
prices of farm products to continue for fifteen
years after this war is over.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I remember that
quite well. The reference I made was to a
table filed in another place.
Hon. DUNCAN MARSHALL: Honourable
members, I think our various political parties
are all agreed on the principle of this Bill.
After all. the important feature is the working
ont of the details. because this measure is
more or less in skeleton form. The honourable gentleman opposite who has just sat down
(Hon. Mr. Horner) said something that I was
going to say to my honourable friend from
Queen's (Hon. Mr. Sinclair) about the prices
of cattle and sheep following the last war. It
nay bu news to the honourable gentleman
from Prince Edward Island that a carload of
sheep which a farmer shipped from Peace
River to Winnipeg sold at a price which was
insufficient to pay the freight charges. and
that when a telegram reached him asking for
more money to make up the deficiency, be
replied that be had no cash, but was sending
on more sheep.
I am afraid that anybody who owned a few
hundred head of cattle at that time-and too
many of us did-found the price tumbling
very rapidly. However, I think there is nothHon.

NIr. SINCLAIR.

ing to fear in relation to the length of time
for which this Bill will run. The British
House of Commons have already passed a Bill
like this, in which they have fixed a period
of four years. Under it prices are to be
revised at the end of every year. Before they
passed the Bill they raised soie prices, for
instance, on mutton and beuf. Much to the
disgust of the fellows raising sheep in Scotland, they did not raise the price of wool.
They are having many difficulties in Britain,
and while I do not know that I have any
business to go into the details at this time,
one of them is in regard to the classification
of their beef. They are classifying it by the
killing-out percentage. Anything that bas a
killing-out percentage of 59 is classed as
super quality. We would not consider that a
very high percentage in show cattle at our
Winter Fair or the International Fair, as
animals there frequently run as high as 67
per cent or 68 per cent. The result of that
classification bas been that the Englishman,
who is just as fond of making money as anybody else, even a Scotchman, has fed these
beasts until. as one man in the west of Enga
land put it, th cattle were like elephants
and the sheep as big as donkeys. Wien these
brutes are killed they are largely tallow. and
when thev are cut up by the biitcher there
is a heavy loss. because grease is not as
scarce as it was.
I hope this Board will bu very careful
about, their classification when they fix the
prices. In Britain a start bas been made by
taking prescnt prices-some have been increased-and these will be revised once a year.
We must expect prices to be revised to some
extent after we get a bit away from the war.
The great difficulty in calculating farm prices
lies in the faut that one man can raise a
bushel of wheat for 50 cents, as my honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) saidalthough I have not seen many men who could
do it-whereas it costs another man 75 cents.
especially if his farm is small. Therefore it is
very difficult to bu fair to the small farmer
as well as to the large farmer who operates
perhaps several thousand acres.
So far as the period cev erd by the Bill is
concerned, this House will xeet before another year, and if any amendment or change
is needed to carry on further, it can bu made.
I think perhaps three or four or five years
will be about the period that will have to
be provided for following the war. so this Bill
will cover it.
I do think the title of this Bill could have
been better. Without mentioning any names,
I may say that I know someone who could

AUGUST 2,1944
The Department lias intimated that one
amnendmient shouid be made to the Bill. I
wouid therefore suggest that after the Bill has
heen readiasecond time it shouid be referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
where departmental officers of long experience
wouid be present to explain the measure fully.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable

senators, I

have read this Bill and a.m in favour of its
principie, but I think the time limit for receipt
of applications should be longer than three
years.
Hon. Mr. KING: No doubt before that time
limit has expired Parliament will be asked to
extend it.

Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Personally, I think five

years would ýbe hetter.
Hon. Mr. KING: Experience indicates that
Parliament will be asked for extensions fromn
time to time. The idea prohably is that the

short time limit tends to induce veterans to
make their applications earlier than if they
knew they couid come under the, Act at any
time within, say, five or ten years.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I intend to make some
remarks on the Bill, but I shall wait until it
has been considered in committee. I am
strongiy in favour of the principhe.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEL~

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, I
would move that the Bill he referred to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Will1 the Bill be before

Hon. Mr. KING: That is the intention. I
understand that notices of the Committee's

A message was received from. the Ho>use of
Commons with Bill 131, an Act to amend the
Quehec Savings Banks Act.
The Bili was read the first time.

SECOND

READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, when shall this Bill be read the second
time?
Hon. J. H. KING: With 1eave of the Senate,
I would ask that this Bill be read the second
time now.
The Quebec savings banks, like our chartered hanks, have to corne before Parliament
every fen years for a renewal of their charters.
I arn going to suggest that this Bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce. It is my hope that the Committee may meet to-morrow morning, and
that the menibers of the Committee, with the
assistance of the officiais of the Department,
may go carefully into the proposed amendments and thoroughly familiarize themselves
with the ternis of the Bill.
I would move the second reading of the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I ask the honourable leader. just by way of information, if the
amendments to the general Bank Act, whien,
adopted, will apply?

Hon. Mr. KING:

No.

Hon. Miý. LEGER: The Quebec
Banks have special charters?

EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
FIRST READING
A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 178, an Act to incorporate
the Export Credits Insurance Corporation and
to promote the revival of trade by the provision of Dominion Government guarantees
to encourage exporte from Canada.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senstors, when shall this Bill be read the second
time?
Hon. J. H. KING: With the leave of the
Senate, I would move second reading now.
The purpose of this Bill is to provide credits
through the Export Credits Insurance Corporation, an organization to be set up by the

368

AUGUST 3, 1944

Government, with a view to enabling the
Government, on the advice of the Corporation,
to promote export trade. It is believed that
if our industries are to develop as they should,
it will be necessary, in order to secure the
advantages of such development for our own
people, that we look abroad for markets. In
view of conditions which it is anticipated will
prevail in devastated countries after the war, it
is believed that individuals or companies venturing into the markets of those countries will
require some assistance or some assurance from
the Government of Canada.
Under thiis Bill a corporation will be set up
to inquire as to credits and the feasibility of
entering into contracts, and to assist the
exporter to take advantage of markets if they
are considered safe. This inquiry will not be
confined to companies and individuals only, but
will be made with respect to governments as
well.
The Bill should conirend itself to honourable members of this Chamber. It is in line
with other measures now being proposed to
assist in the development of Canada's trade
after the war, and is for the purpose of supporting those of our people who undertake to
engage in export trade.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Do- the Bill provide
guarantees of credit to exporters, whether individuals or corporations?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That is to say, after the
examination has been made the exporter will
be insured against loss?
Hon. Mr. KING: If it is decided that the
risk is not too great.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I have read this Bill very carefully and can
see the benefits that will flow from it. I can
also sec soin dangers. I hope they will not
be too numerous.
The corporation to be set up will comprise
the Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce,
the Deputy Minister of Finance and the
Governor of the Bank of Canada, and these
gentlemen are to be assisted by four directors
to be appointed by the Govern r General in
Council.
I think the honourable the Minister has
given a fair explanation of the Bill as far as he
bas gone; but I think he should have given
us more information. For instance, we have
wheat to sell to Greece. It may be that no
dealer could afford to take a chance on selling
wheat to a business firm in that country.

Pay-

ment migbt never be made, or the exchange
on the foreign currency might be too high.
Hon. Mr. RING.

I see nany difficulties in connection with
this legislation. It may be necessary to finance
some purchasers. The Government will probably have to set up a large bureau to investigate the reliability of purchasers and to ascertain what commodities should be exported.
These wxill be highly important business transactions.

difficulties in connection with it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: After the last war we

$8,000,000 or S10,000,000 to Greece.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I should like to sec the

I intend to move that.

Hon. Mr. IAIG: I hope the Minister of
Trade and Commerce, in whon I have a good

The niotion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Hon. Mr. KING moved that the Bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think thsat Dr. Clark,
the Deputv Minister of Finance, and Mr.
Towers, the Governor of the Bank of Canada, should be present at the committee. This
is one of the most important Bills that we
have had to deal with, and it imposes a

FAMILY ALLOWANCES
SECOND

BILL

READING

.Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 161., an Act ta provide for Family
Allowances.
He said: Honourable senators, it might
appear to uninformed or inexperienced persons
that aithougli Parliament lias heen in session
for some six months, important legîslation is
now being rushed through without full opportunity being given for its consideration.
It must, however, be recalled that during the
nearly five years since Canada entered the war
Parliament lias had ta devote almost its entire
attention to the enactmnent of measures
designed to give maximum effect to our war
effort. In short, this is a war Parliament.
But almoat immediately after Canada decIared
war the Government undertook investigations
with the view of introducing legislation to take
care of what miglit be considered the period
of transition from war to peace. We are now
ap.proaching this stage, and hence it is necessary that before the life of this Parliament
ends next April the Government should
initiate legislation ta carry into effect during
the reconstruction period policies based on
those investigations.
*
To this end during this session and preceding
sessions Parliament bas passed a considerable
body of legisiation dealing with veterans
affairs. I do not need ta enumerate the
various measures, but I may remind honourable members of the Veterans Land Act, which
widens the scope of the original Act passed
after the hast war. We have also made provision for vo-cational and university courses
for the ben-fit of any of aur returned eoldiers

SENATE
who may desire to take advantage of them.
We have just given second reading to a bill
for the purpose of establishing an expert
credit insurance corporation to promote a
revival of trade by providing Government
guarantees to encourage PNport from this
country. 1 merely mention these measures
to show that the Government is endeavouring
to take care of the reconstruction period which
will followv the end of the war.
The various provincial Governments have
co-operated with the federal Government in
order to bring about a closer relationship
between those two great forces cngaged in
industry-capital and labour. This has become
so important that within the last, few years
each of the aine provinces bas set up a
Labour Department to ensure this dloser
relationship.
In the Atlantic Charter. which President
Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill
formulated at their historie conference, certain
principles were enunciated which the Allied
nations are seeking to establish in their war
against Nazism and Fascism. At that time
the Allied nations were on the defensive, but
to-day we have every reason to believe that
the two remaining Axis partners will soon be

naturally falîs into three broad fields-demobilization, rehabilitation and re-establishment in
civil life. The plans were set ouf, in the Speech
from the Throne.
In order to assure continued empînyment in
the post-war period a rapid and efficient conversion of industry from war to peace-time
activities must be hrought about, and 1 am
satisfied that if the present co-operation
hetween capital and labour is carried over into
the transition period much can be accomplished to tho advantage of our people
generalhy. It is hoped that. through Governsmalh and medium-scahe
ment assistance,
industriah enterprises may be established and
a greatly expandcd lome market provided to
absorb their increased: production. My experience of the adaptability shown by Canadian
industrialists and Canadian workmen, coupled
with the enterprise of Canadian business men,
leads me to behieve that we can secure larger
fore-ign markets for the products of our
factories.
We know from scientific investigation and
from discoveries made during the last two or
lion. Mr. KING.

threc years, that greater use can be made of
our natural resources; and undoubtedly new
development.s will take place which wil
enlarge the field of emphoyment. Furthermore,
if the measure which we liad before us a few
moments ago assists in making availahhc to us
the markets of the wvorld, we can be assured
of greater employment.
The Bill before us is closely correlated with
the whole rehabilitatiôn. programme. Under
this Bill it is proposed to pay the parents of
children s0 much per child, the amounts varying with the ages and the numbers of such
children. It is conceived that this enactment
will briag about improved conditions in the
homes of those who, thraugh no lack of energy
or desire on their part, have failed ta reach
a place in the higher income brackets. We
realize that in the set-up of our industrial
life there bas been no provision for supplementing the income of the married man as
against that of the single'man. For their day
of toil, working side by side, they both receive
the same wage. It is felt by those who have
given great consideration to this prohlem that
the men who accept the respoasihility of
eatering into the married state, and who raise
the future citizens of the country, should have
a larger share in the benefits derived from our
natural resources. Upon that principle the Bill
is founded.
I had the privilege the other day of reading
a speech made hy the honourable the Prime
Minister in Toronto, in March, 1919, just
shorthy after the hast war. It was the speech
of one who had givea a great deal of study
ta social and industrial relations, and I believe
it should he read by every young man and
woman in Canada, with a view to their having
a hetter understanding of the rehationship that
should exist between industry as a whole and
those employed in it.
Hon. Mr. IIORNER: Did the Prime Minister in that speech suggest a tax on bachelors?
Hon. Mr. KING: No, hie did not. That is a
matter which comes within the purview of the
provincial governments. I have no doubit that
seime day they wihh take advaatage of the
oppartunity.
Han. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Do you not think the very
measure before us cames withia the purview
of the provincial goveraments?
Hon. Mr. KING: Louder.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Do you want me ta yehl?
Hon. Mr. KING:

Yes. 1 shoiîld like ta hear

AUGUST 3, 1944
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Do you flot think this measure
also is within the purview of the provincial
governinents?
Hon. Mr. KING.- Like my honourable
friend, I arn a member of the medical profession, and 1 would flot venture an opinion
upon that point. We have many legal men in
Parliament, nlot only ini the othier House but
in this Chamber, and no douht that aspect of
the Bill will be dealt with to the satisfaction
of honourable members.
The Bill itself defines the terrnis, "child,"
"Mînister," and "parent," and sets out matVers of regulation, allowances, residence, and
so forth; in fact, as 1 have said before,' it ie a
formula for carrying out the principles underiying farnuly allowances.
Farnily alýlowances are not new in the world.
They have been in -. eration -in rnany
p
couintries.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.- Would rny honourable
fricnd narne some of the <'ountries? I cati find
oniy three.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think there are three or
four-Germany, Norway and Swcden, and, I
believe, Denrnark.
Hon. Mr. HAÂIG: No, Norway and Sweden
have no family aIlowances.
Hon. Mr. KING: I arn not sure.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I can give authority for
that statexuent.
Hon. Mr. KING: That may be correct.
However, 1 arn not intercsted in the European
situation, but I arn interested in the question
of whcther farnily allownnces are feasible and
possible in this country, with its great natural
resources and the great opportunities which
industry enjoys to-day. In rny opinion family
allowances provide one way by whîch. the
wealth that cornes from those resources cati be
mnore fairly distributed arnong the people who
labour to produce it. That is rny position
and the position of the Govertiment in support
of this legislation.
There has 'been much discussion of this
measure in the press. In that discussion the argument has been Iargely one-sided. Perhaps we
cati understand why. Those who have been able
to, avail themselves of the press of this country
to make their vicwpoint understood were ail of
a certain class. Consequently we have had
nurnerous letters and editorials in opposition
to this rneasure. But we have the satisfaction
of knowing that when this Bill came beforc
Parliarnent, the elccted representatives of the
people in another place voted unanirnously for
the principle of the Bill; and that is something
106--251

to which we in this Chamber should give very
careful consideration. Further, as the measure
involves a very considerable expenditure, we
should consider it coolly and calrnly, and I arn
hoping that when this is donc the Bill will
receive the commendation of the Senate.
Hon. A. J. LEGER: Honourable senatois,
I want to say just a few words in support of
this Bill.
The Fiathers of Confederation, seeing the
great possibilities of this country, its natural
attractions, its vast resources and its opportunities for capital investment to bring about
a fuller devclopment of our latent assets, predited a great future for Canada. Yet, threequarters of a century of confederation has not
brought about the anticipated result. -Many
factors could perhaps be învokcd to explaiti
our comparatively slow risc to prospcrity. To
rny mind there is one which enters into the
subi ect now under con.-ideration, namely, a
lack of appreciation of the value of the human
element in the building up of thc nation.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. IEGER: Wc have not given to
large families the attention which thcy
deserve, and we have donc nothing to encourage an increase in the number of such families.
Wc have known ail along that children arc
not only the greatest blessing the marriage
state can bestow, but the best asset a nation
can posscss. Wc have known that a. high
hirth-rate is the most convincing sign of the
prosperity of a country. Wc have known
that if large families weýrc to cease, or decrease
in numbers, we would not onJy be classed
amongst the nations which were dyini or
disappearing off the face of the earth, but
that the capitalist, the employers, the manufacturers and the, merchants would lose the
benefits which large farnilies render to the
community by furnishing both producers and
consumers. Yct, knowing ail this, we have
heretofore let the parents alone shoulder the
reeponsibilities and obligations entailed in
rendcring this service to the nation.
'But that is not ail. By lcgislativchy imposing the eight-hour day, thus preventing the
fathcr of a large farnily frorn proionging his
working day and thereby incrcasing his output,
wc have deprived him of the opportunity to
earn extra rnoney. We have also deprived
him of the hclp of his chiidren by telling hirn
that modemn conditions dcmand that children
shall spcnd from eight to twelvc ycars at
school, and 'by barring the doors of factories
against thern until they reach the age of 14 or
16. Thc jearning power of the large farily has
been curtailcd by the exigencies of modern
civilization. And what has becu offered in

372

SENATE

return? Nothing at ahl. On the contrary, we
have further burdened the alread'y harassed
father of the large family hy imposing taxes
on commodities, thereby making him pay an
extra and very heavy share of the national
levy. Add to ahl thi5 the difficulty of finding
housing accommodation, and you will have a
pale picture of the situation.
It seems that we have reached the stage
where the State can no longer neglect the
large-family problem. How can it be solved?
Some say by higher wages. *But this would
benefit onhy those, who draw wages. In any
event, we could neyer hope for wage increases
responsibilities,
to family
proportionate
because under our industrial sy stem wages are
adjusted in accordance with the laws of
supply and demand. Strict justice, it lias
been said, demands equivalence between what
is received, and what is given. Consequently,
if an employer obtains the samne amount of
work from different work,rs, hie satisfies the
demands of justice by paying thema equal
wages. To demand that hie give more to the
worker with a large family than hie pays
to another worker would be equivalent
to saying that hie is bound to give more than
he receives. In the meantime the father of
the large family must hy his own hand,
without other help, feed, clothe, house and
educate his family; and this hie cannot do
unless his efforts are supplemented by those
of bis wife, by charity, or by some other
method which is not conducive to producin-g
contented workers.
What is the remedy? If, as is generally
admitted, large families are a necessary factor
in the prosperity of the nation, it follows that
they should at least he placed in a position
of security hy means of family allowances.
From what I have said it will hie realized
that the family allowance is not payment for
work done; neither is it ahms or charity
offered to the head of the family because hie
is in need or in trouble. It is remuneration
for eminent services rendered to the State,
services which no one had thought of
remuneratîng hitherto, but which the special
conditions of present day oconomics compel
society to recognize and reward.
If such services are recompensed, will the
State be thereby impoverished? Might such
remuneration have a tendency to lower wages?
Industry is well aware that by diminishing
wages it lessens the buying capacity of the
worker, thus delaying the extension of markets
and restricting it.s own prosperity. Family
allowances are in the interest of both employer
and employee. When adopted they will hasten
the development and prosperity of Canada,
by providing a more raliid increase in popuhaHon. Mr. LEGER.

tion; they will enhance the value of the land,
by creating a greater demand; they will stop
the exodus of families and induce Canadians
n.ow resident in the United States to return
home, t.hereby extending the home market;
they will increase productioni, diminish the cost
of living and render higher wages possible.
For these reasons and. many others that could
be evoked, 1 arn hearti]y in favour of the
Bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I think it will be generally agreed that
this is perhaps one of t.he most important
measures of social reforma that the Parliament
of Canada lias ever been called upon to consider. I feel that before dealing with the Bill
itself it would be of some interest to inquire
in-to its background. My honourable leader
was quite right in saying that it had its
genesis in that meeting of those two great
leaders of democracy, President Roosevelt and
Mr. Churchill, in. the autumn of 1941, when
they formulated the Atlantic Charter, which
sets forth the aims and objecte of the dernocratic countries and the four great freedoms
for which these countries stand, includinig freedom from want and frcedom frorn fear.
As a result of that meeting and the general
principles there enunciated, a n-umber of
bodies ivure set up in this country, Great
1
Britain and Unitcd States, to study how best
our social economy could be improved in order
to. provide for ail our people freedom from
want, and freedom from fear. In the United
States there was th~e Natural Resources Mobilization Board. ln Great Britain there was the
Cominittee on Social Security, under the Chairmnanship of Sir William Beveridge. In this
country there was the ýCommittee on Reconstruction, set up hy the Government, under
the chairmanship of Principal James.
The next step in this' line of progress came
in December, 1942, with the publication of the
Beveridge Committee's report, which had a
great effect upon the thinking of the Englishspeaking world, in particular, on matters of
social security. Then in this country there
was the Speech froni the Throne at the beginning of the session of 1943Hon. Mr. HAIG: Would my honourable
friend allow me? Has the Beveridge report
heen accepted hy the British Government?
Hon. Mr. HIUGESSEN: It hias neither been
accepted nor rejected. I do not know what
the exact position is, but I underst-and the
British Governmnent bas accepted that part of

AUGUST 3, 1944
the report relating to, the paymient of children's allowances, and that a measure. authorizing chiklren's allowances will shortly be
introduced at Westminster.
I was referring to the' Speech frein the
Throne at the begînning of the session of
1943, in wbich it was stated:
It is in 'the general interest Vthat freedom f rom
fear and fromn want should he the assured
possession of ail.
Then in March of last year there was the
publication of Dr. Leonard Marsh's report ta
the Reconstruction Committee on a systemn of
social security for Canada. Later, as honourable menmbers will recaîl, this Huse and the
other Chamber appointed commnittees on reconstruction and on social security. Those
committees heard a good deal of, evidenceth.e witnesses included Sir William Beveridge
and Dr. Leonard Marsh-and did much valuable work.
In September, 1943, the National War
Labour Board, under the chairmanship of Mr.
Justice McTague, as hie then was, made a
report which suggested a system, of family
allowances for cases whe-re it was impossible ta
raise wages above the minimnum standard
at which they wcre frozen by wartime
regulations.
Finally we corne ta the Speech from the
Throne at the beginning of the present session.
The introduction of a measure of family allowances was fore-shadowed in this short paragraph:
The family and the -home are the foundation
of national life. To aid in ensuring a minimum
of wellhbeing ta the ohi'ldren of the nation and
ta help gain for them a closer approach ta
equality of opportunity in the hattle of life,
Yen will -be asked ta approve a measure making
provision for f amily allowances.
And now we have this Bill, "an Act ta
provide for family allowances."'
In summing up this part of my remarks, I
say that the Bill is one step towards that goal
of social security which is inherent in the
adhesion of Canada, as one of the Ailiesi
nations, to the terms of the Atlantic Charter.
But I venture ta suggest ta hanaurable members that the basic concept of the Bill
antedates that great document. I thinlc it
,stems from the great depression. of the thirties
andi from the unbending resolution of our
people that the conditions which then existed
should neyer be allowed to recur.
Ronourable senators know just as well as I
do what those conditions were. In aur industrial areas and great towns hundreds of
thausands of family men, with wives and
children, dependent upon them, were thrawn
out of employment. Having no money at al

coming into their homes, they were forcesi to
go on relief. They were stamped with the
stigma of indigence and had ta depend upon
municipal autharities for their bare maintenance, constantly beset by the fear that that
maintcnance would be discantinued if they
maved fromn their residences or happened ta
earn a few dollars on odd jobs.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honauiable
senatar a question? Does hie suggest that ýthis
Bill would cure such conditions as existed in
the thirties?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No. I suggest that
it would go a long way tawards remedying
such conditions; and that if allowances as provided for in this Bill had been in effect in the
thirties, most families throughout the country
would be in far better condition than they are
at present.
Hon. Mr. KING:
better off, tao.

Industry would have been

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:- During the depressien period the people in many rural sections
also were ini a bad position. That was particularly true in the Western Provinces, which
were afflicted with draught and crop failures,
conditions ta which my honourable friensi the
acting leader on thc other side (Han. Mr.
Haig) referred sa eloquently yesterday afternoon. There the same rcsults followed from
different causes. Crop failures dried up the
sources of incarne, and in consequence numerous families were forced onto. relief and had
ta accept charitýy, with ahl its degrading implications.
In those situations the worst features were
not unemploy-mcnt and crop failure, but conditions braught about by the lack of famihy
income. Parents had no money ta spend upon
their children and were subj ected ta contraI
by municipal and charitable organizations as
ta the manner in which relief alhowances, in
cash or in kind. should be applied. I repeat
that if our people arc dctermined on anc point,
it is that those conditions of the thirties shahl
nat recur. This measure will insure ta,parentsat
least a specified monthly incame whîch they
can spend as they wish for the benefit of their
children.
There bas been some criticism of the possible
cost of this measure. As I shahl show in a
few minutes, the estimated cost is about $200,000,000 a year. 1 suggest ta honaurable senators that it is far better ta> spend $200,000,000
a year in an equitable nation-wide distribution
of incarne through the families of this country
tha n ta spend, as we did during the depression
period, $900,000,000 in innumerable widely

SENATE
divergent, uncoiirdinated relief projeets. Those
projects were intended tn give work to unemployed mon and to provide indirectly what týhis
Bill provides directly-an income for families.
I say that this legisiation is much more consistent with human dignity than the measures
that were adopted during the great depression.
Now, may 1 put this thought before honourable senators. Those days we hear of many
strange economic doctrines-doctrines which,
it is quite useless to deny, appeal to a great
number of our people. Why is that? I arn
convinced that it result-s from two factors.
One is the grim, terrible remembrance burnt
into the minds of hundreds of thousands of
our people by the conditions of the 1930's,
of what they then had to endure. The other
is the proof, cloar te, a-il during the la.st fouîr
vears, that this country can produce gonds in
such volume as, distributed equitably amnng
the pcople, would enable e\. orybody t0 live
comfortably. What these doctrinaires tell us
is ve.ry seductive. They say: "You had no
reason to go through the miseries you underwent in the 1930's. The two old parties in
power one after the other during that period
subjected you unneeessarily to those miseries.
as is proven by what has happened during the
last three or four years. Throw thoýse parties
out and put us in power, and we will sec that
you do not suifer again." That, honourable
sonafors, is a powerful argument. And if has
got to be met. It is a challenge to those of us
who believe in the preýsent order of snciety.
I suhmnit it can nnly ho met hy legisiation
such as this, which will ensure at least a minimum standard of family life for ahl nur people
and a more equitable distribution of the
wealfh of the country. I repeat, measures of
social security such as this are the only effective answer to the arguments of extremists
fluat we hear every day. They are the only
effective reply to those who wish to tear up
our econmy by the moots and plant in its
place the doctrines originally prnclaimed by
KarI Marx, and nnw paraded by the parlourpink professors of the C.C.F.
This Bill is, 1 submit, a logical sequel to
rocent trendhs of thinking and social development in this country. Family allowances are
nt now. Thev were, 1 amn infnrmed, adopted
hy many European countries before this war.
In answer f0 my honourable friend who asked
the question a few minutes ago, they were in

and also, I understand. in Germany and in
Russia.

confine myself to the countries of the Empire.
Family allowances were intmoduced in New
Zcaland in 1926, and the amnunt was incmeased
bast year.
They were introduced in New
South Wales in 1929, and in 1941 were
extended f0 the whnle of Australia at a rate of
5 shillings per week for each child other than
the first. They were, I amn advised, introduced
in the Irish Free State last February.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Right.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: A few minutes ago
I was told, thnugh I have no officiai information, that the British Government has adopted
the principle of family allowances, and will
shnrtly give legisiative offect to its policy. So,
honurahle senatnrs, I think we can agree that
Canada is in gnod cnmpany in intrnducing
legislation of this kind.
But more than that, as a result of investigations made during the last few years we now
have the advantage of the expert, trained
opinion of those who have given extendod
study te, this question.
I mentioned the
Beveridge report a few minutes ago.
Sir
William Beveridge is, I suppose,, the mnst
outstanding snciologist in the British Empire.
With the permission of honourable members,
I shaîl quote this short sentence from. page
154 of bis famous report;
Social insurance should ho part of a policy
of a national minimum. But a national minimum for familles of evemy size eannof in practice be secured by a wage system, which inust
ho based nn the produet of a man's labour and
not on the size of his family. The social sarveys
of Britain ýbetwcen the two wars show that in
the first tihirty years of this century real wages
rose hy about one-third without reducing want
to insignificance, and that the want whiolh remained wý- almost wholly duo to two causesinterruption or loss of earoing power and large
families.
Which is exactly the point madeo by, my honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger). Then I want f0 quote a mon who
to-day is perhaps the mnst eminent econornist in the British Empire, if not in the
world-Lord Keynes. As honouroble senators
will recoîl, hie headed the British delegation to
the Monetory Conference held ot Bretton
Woods last month, and was rogarded as the outstanding economist at that gatheming. ln 1940
hoe wrnte a book entitled "How to Pay for the
War'. This is a short quotation frm if:
At first siglit it is paradoxical f0 propose in

1 recomtnend, therefore, that a family allowance af 5s. per week should be paid in cash
for each child up to the age of fifteen.
Honourable senators will recaîl that in May
and June of this year the International Labour
Conference met in Philadeiphia. *The representatives of forty-one nations were in attendance, ail experts in. matters of labour and
social reform. Canada wae among the countries represented.
I hold in my hand the
report of the proceedings prepared hy the
Canadian Government delegates. The conference set up a Cammittee on Social Security.
This committee made a number of recommendations, from which I propose to quote the
following:
Society should normally co-operate with
parents through general measuroe of assistance
designed to secure the well-being of dependent
chi]dren.
(1) Public aubsidies in kind or in cash or in
both should be established in order to assure
the healthy nurture of chjîdren, heip to maintain 'large f asilies, and complete the provision
made for children through social ineurance.
(2) Where the purpose in view is to assure
the healthy nurture of children, subsidiee ehould
take thse form of such advantages as free or
below-cost infants' food and sehool meals and
below-cost dwe]lings for families withi several
children.
(3) Where the purpose in view is to help
to maintain large f amulies or to cosplete the
children by su-bsidies in
E rovition maade for ïsocial insurance, subsidies
ind and through
should take the ýforým of children's allowances.
(4) Sucb allowances should be payable, irreapective of the parents' incarne, accarding to a
prescnibed &cale, whieh should represent a subetantial contribution ta thse ooslt of maintaining
a child, should allow for the higher cost of
maintaining older children, and should, as a
minimum, be granted to a-Il children for whoin
no provision is made through social insurance.
That recommendation, which waa unamimously adopted by the conference representing, as I have said, forty-one sovereign. nations,
is more or less international in character. I
wish now to corne to the situation as it exists;
in Canada itself, and the information we have
as to the desirability of establishing family
allowances here. I have already referred to
Dr. Leonard Marsh's report dated March 16,
1943, made to the Advisory Comm-ittee on
Reconstruction on a scheme of social security
for Canada. I quote from page 32:
The practical answer to thse lituation is that
chi'ldren's needs should be met as a special dlaim
on the nation, flot xnerely in periods of unemployment or on occasion of distreis,- but at
ail times. This is the basic case for chîldren's
allowances.
Then page 87:
Children's allowances are &. clear part of thse
policy of a national mini.mum-of the direct
attack on poverty where it is bound up with
the strain imposled by a large family on a

375

«maîl incarne. Quite irrespective of whether the
rig'ht parents have thse most children, children
shouýld have an lunequivocal place in social
Gecurity policy. I f Nwe
are concerned about the
quality of parents and their children, the proper
approach is nat to condemn thse children to
Isardship or inadequate conditions because their
parents happen to be poor. The child bas no
choice. His opportunity in the modern coinmunity does flot depend only on such advantages as hie receives by inheritance from his
parents, but on their incarne level, and on thse
children with whom hie mu-st grow up. The
needs, of course, are greatest amnong the lowest
incomne groups, but there aretnarrow margins
for thse farnilies of m.any parents whose earnings
by 'labour market standards would be regarded
as reasonable or moderate.
Some persons rnay say, "That is the opinion
of a theorist. Socîologists like Sir William
Beveridge, and econarnists like Lord Keynes,
take no account of the practical difficulties to
be overcome."' I venture to ask those persans
this question: "Whom should we look te in
this country for practical advice an this quêstion?" I suggest there are two classes of
people well qualified to advise us. First, our
trained social warkers, persans whose life-work
it is ta go amang the poorer classes of thse coimmunity, and who by that very. faet are brought
in-to daily and hourly contact with the problems involved in large families with small incames. We have in this country, an organization known as the Canadian Association of
Social Workers, and, with the permission of
thse House, I am going ta read an extract from
a letter, dated JuIy 8 af this year, written by
Miss Elizabeth Wallace, executive secretary
of -the association:
The Canadian Association of Social Workers,
a professional organization representing same
800 social workers across Canada, in a recent
su-bmission to the Dominion Advisory 0cmnmittee on Social Security warmly commended
the proposed introduction of family allowanme.
I suggest there is anather class af people
ta wham we sliauld go for practical advice on
this question, and that is the wamen of -the
country, who after all are charged with thse
duty of bringing up aur ehildren. Honourable
senators may recaîl that thse Committee on
Reconstruction appointed a subcommittee of
women ta deal witlh questions more particularly
relating ta women in the reconstruction period.
That committee consisted of a number of
prominent wamen and trained practical workers from aîl parts of thse cauiitry. I might say
that they were hesded by, tIse wife of thse
Lieutenant-Governor of Manitoba.
This is
the unanixnous conclusion reached by the
Wornen's subcommittee:
The eubcommittee stroiîgly supports introduction of a systemn of children's allowances, and
hopes that thse establishment of this systema
will follow health insurance as soan as passible

376

SENATE

It 'was then anticipated that health. insurance would precede children's allowances.
It is the only system yet devised which will
remove the poverty ar.ising fr&m the fact -that
a man's wage must be based on the produet
of a man's labour and flot ýon the .size of 'his
family. The subcommittee believes that these
allowances should apply te ail families with
children.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: 'May 1 ask the

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. KING: There is no means test.

run the risk of people getting more when
they are unemployed than when employed,
and therefore losing the incentive to work.

lion. Mr. HUGESSEN: I will cerne te

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

I was going te refer te the Jnly l5th issue
of Canadian Welfare, the monthly journal
of the Canadian Welfare Co-uncil, of which
Dr. George F. Davidson is executive secretary. I am snre a number of hononrable
senators are acqnainted with Dr. Davidson
and the great work he has done in the field
of social reform. I just wish te indýicate te
them an article in which he supports the
introduction of this Bill for family allowances.
The principle of this Bill, that of cash
allowances for children, payable to the parents
and increasing with the number of childiren in
tbe family, is net new in our legislation. This
measure merely generalizes and makes umiversal a principle already te ho fonnd in a
number of our statutory provisions dealing
with special cases.
First of al], there are the alewances whichi
have been paid te dependants of members
of the armed forces since the ontbreak of
this war. Honourable members know that
when a man enlists in the Army, the Navy
or the Air Force, his wife receives a
separatien allowance and assigned pay. She
is aise entitled te receive a further nllowonce for each child under ý16 years of
age supported by hier, up te a, total of six.
'The allowance for the first child is $12; for
t.he second, $12; for the third, $10, and for
the fourtà, fifth and sixth, $8. These alwonces have been paid on that basis since the
commencement of this war. They are ndministereci by a body known as the Depondents'
Allowance Board.
An Hon. SENÂATOR: That is per month.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: These allowances
are paid by way of monthly cheques, the
manner in which it is proposed that the
allowances under this bill shonld ho paid.
What I am trying te peint ont is this. The
Dependents' Allowance Board has set up and
perfected machinery by which already under
the rogulations; more than qix hundred thonsand monthly choques are paid te the dependants of soldiers, sailors and airmen. It will
net need very much of an extension of that
machinery te permit the issuing of cheques te
the 1,400,000 families which it is anticipated
will derive benefits under this mensure. Sa,
from the point of view of administration,
there should net ho much difflcnlty.
Seeondly, ns honourable niembers kn.ow,
under provincial legislation mothers' allowances are paid te mothers whe are widows or
whese hnsbands are invalida. Seven out of
the nine provinces provide, nllowances.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: If I interrupted, I
apologize. I thought my young friend was
quite capable of taking care of himself.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: That may be so,
but it is desirable that the honourable senator
should be allowed to continue without interruption.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I thank you. I
welcome any questions. My only fear is that
if I am asked too many, and attempt to
answer them, I shall exhaust my welcome.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: We won't limit you to
forty minutes.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: As I say, the legislation recognýizes that the cost of maintaining
a large family does not increase proportionately
with each additional child, because in families
of more than four children the allowance is
reduced by $1 for the fifth child, by $2 for the
sixth and seventh children, and by $3 for the
eighth child.
These
allowances
commence
on
the
1st of July, 1945, at which time the
Bureau of Statistics, on the basis of the Census
of 1941, estimate that there will bc approximately 3,500,000 children under the age of 16,
divided among about 1,400,000 families. They
also estimate that the total gross cost for July,
1945, will be $21,100,000, which is equivalent
to an annual gross cost of $253.200,000. That
gross cost will, as was pointed out by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Haig), be reduced
by reason of Section 8 of the bill, which
provides:
Nothing in this Act shall preclude such adjustment of the deduction on account of a dependent
child from tax payable under the Income War
Tax Act as may be necessary to avoid duplication of benefits under the Income War Tax
Act and this Act.
Those who under the Income War Tax Act
already receive deductions from tax for dependent children will benefit, if they benefit at all,
only to the extent that allowances under this
Bill exceed those deductions. Let me give
an example. A parent who has an income
large enough to obtain the income tax deduction of $108 for the year in respect of a child
under six would not be able to claim the
$60 which he would otherwise receive in that
year under the provisions of this Bill.
It is estimatcd that the number of income
tax payers with dependent children is about
800,000. About 180.000 are entitled to the
full income tax deductions. and so will not
benefit at ail under this Bill. The remaining
620,000 will benefit to some extent, according
to the number of their children and the
amount of income tax deductions in respect
of them. To sum up this branch of the disThe Hon. the SPEAKER.

cussion: it is estimated that the total cost
of family allowances will be $250,000,000,
which will be reduced by income tax deductions of from $50,000,000 to $60,000,000, so
the actual net cost of the scheme will be
approximately $200,000,000 a year.
There is one aspect that I feel I should
say a few words about, and I come to it with
some degree of distaste. I want to refer to
the position of my own province, Quebec.
There have been claims that this measure will
benefit Quebec far more than other provinces,
by reason of the fact that gencrally speaking
there are larger families in Quebec, and such
claims have been unjustifiably used as excuses
for stirring up racial prejudice. I do not
like to deal with questions of this kind, but
I feel it is my duty to do so. I would point
out to honourable senators that though this
legislation will benefit Quebec more than
other provinces, the extra benefit will not be
nearly as great as we are sometimes led to
suppose.
True, Quebec has large families,
but the allowance payable for every child
aftcr the fourth in a family is on a reduced
scale.
Out of the estimated total allowances of
$21,000,000 in the month of July, 1945, it is
expected that parents in Quebec will receive
$6,700,000, and parents in Ontario $6,100,000.
Honourable members will note that the difference there is not substantial. According to
census figures compiled by the Bureau of
Statistics for the year 1941, the percentage
of each province's inhabitants who are under
sixteen years of' age-that is, the percentage
for whom allowances would be paid-is as
follows: Quebec, 35; Saskatchewan, 32; Prince
Edward Island, 32; Alberta, 31; Nova Scotia,
30; New Brunswick, 30; Ontario, 28; Manitoba, 28; British Columbia, 23.
It will be observed that the differences
between the various provinces, other than
British Columbia, is not great. As between
Quebec and Ontario, for instance, the difference is only 7 per cent. The proportion of
young people in British Columbia is of course
relatively small, because many of the residents
of that province are people who have retired
front active life to spend the remainder of
their days in the delightful climate of the
Pacifie coast. Naturally, umost of them would
not have dependent children under the age of
sixteen.
I deprecate attempts to use this great mensure of social reform as a means of stirring up
racial prejudice.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

AUGUST 3, 1944
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: To do that is unjustlfied and un-Canadian. In this connection
I feel it is my duty to refer to a speech made
hy the Premier of Ontario at a political rally
in Richmond Hill on Wednesday evening.
According to a report in the Montreal Gazette
of this morning, Premier Drew said:
We now have it fromn Mr. Godbout's (Premier
Godbout of Quebec) own lips that this baby
bonus is the resuit of his collaboration with
Mr. King, and in the sa-me evening Mr. King
'went eut of bis way in the House of Cosumons
te .point out the very special advantage this Bill
offered te the people of Quebec.
On Mr. Godbout's own stateinent, supported
by the evidence of Mr. King himself, this Bill
is an outrageous bribe offered to the people of
Quebec immediately before an election, upon
whieh Mr. King's last chance of political
survival depend-s.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Shame!
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? Having quoted the
Premier of Ontario, will he now quote what
the Premier of Quebee said on the same
subjeet the other night?
Hlon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I shall be obliged
if my honourable friend will do that for me.
1 have not a report of his speech at hand.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Neither have I.' It
seems to me to he hardly fair to quote one
Premier and flot the oth-er.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: If I were obliged
to quote ail the provincial Premiers, my
speech would be of an inordinate length.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: And there is an election on in Quebec.
Hlon. Mr. BLACK: May 1 be permitted to
say a word? I amu in favour of the Bill, and
I amn sorry that the matter of racial prejudice
bas been brought uip in this Chamber. The
honourable senator fromn Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) has made an excellent speech up
to this point. 1 beg him flot Vo introduce a
discordant note now.
Hou. Mr. HUGESSEIN: Amn I Vo be accused of introducing a discordant note? I am
trying Vo show that Vhe interjection of racial
issues into questions of this kind is highly
objectionable.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: You are making it
worse.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps the only
charitable explanation of those words by the
Premier of Ontario is that the weather was9 bot
and be got a little bot too. I do resent such
statements, particularly because of their racial
implications against my province, and I content myseif wltb the tho'ught that they will

not add Vo the good name or the political
reputation of men who make them. Surely,
bonourable senators, after seventy-seven years
of Confederation we should be able, iu this
Chamber and throughout the country, to dis
cuss great questions of social reform witbout
the interjection of racial prejudice.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: That is what I say.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The remarks I have
quoted were madle by a man wbo I amn told
was a gallant soldier in the last war. But bis
gallantry becomes sadly tarnished when he
uses a dirty weapon such as this.
As was stated by my bonourable leader
(Hon. Mr. King), Vhsq Bill is one of the evideuces of a new era, in our economic and social
thinking, an era, in wbicb more attention is
going to be paid Vo buman values and less to
property values. After aI, cbildren are the
human capital upon. which our country's future
will depend. In a speech macle in another
place a few days ago the Prime Minister,
referring to the old concept of ricb and poor
in a static societyHon. Mr. LEGER: I suggest that it is
contrary to a rule of the Senate Vo identify
an bonourable member of VIe other House
when quoting remarks made by hlm there.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: In a speech by a
very prominent member of another placeHon. Mr. LEGER: That is better.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: -a quotaticu was
macle from a sarcastie poemn on Vhis subject of
ricl and poor in a static society. The poem,
which appeared lu "The Chimes" by Charles
Dickens contains these lines:
O let us love our occupations,
Ble9s tbe squire and bis relations
Live upon our daily rations,
And always know our proper stations.
I remnember that one verse of a bymn which
used to le sumg in my childhood expressed a
similar sentiment. The bhymn, whieh I arn
sure many honourable senators will recaîl
having sung in, their youtb, began witb the
words, "Ahl things bright and beautiful." The
verse ln question went like this:
The ricb man in his castie
The poor mnan at bis gate:
God made thesu high or -lowly
And ordered tbeir estate.
That indicates the fixed condition of ricI and
poor as envisaged by the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. It is perhaps unnecessary for
me to add that the vers was removed frgm
the bymn book a number of years ago. We
have travelled a long way since those words
were written, and we shaîl go much farther.

SENATE

This Bill is one step forward. As my honourable leader pointed out, it is one of the many
steps which this Government has taken and
to which Parliament and the peopie, as adherents to the terrms and principies of the Atlantic
Charter, are committed, for it is a step along
the road of our endeavour to give the people
of Canada freedom. fromn want and freedoma
fromn fear. I commend the measure to this
honourable Chamber.
Hon. R.-B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
the honourable gentleman fromn Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugesseni) quoted a verse. 1 would
quote, two limes:
Oh, what a tangled web we weave,
When first we practise to deceive!
I do not want to introduce a discordant note
into th.is discussion, but I feel it my duty as
a senator to oppose the Bill. I believe one
of the purposes for which the Canadian Senate
was created was that mensures such as this.
when brought down at a time like this, should
be defeated. I arn going to argue that there
is no necessity whatever for the Bill. Last
session the Senate and the other bouse each
had a committee on reconstruction, and among
those who gave evidence were Dr. Leonard
Marsh and Sir William Beveridge. We have
been to]d that Germany, Russia and Italy
have or had legislation of this kind in effect.
Well, I doubt if they will have it when they
get a democratie form ojf government. I
would say that in countries whieh have passed
laws like this the children do not belong to
the homes, but are creatures of the State. If
we pass this Bill, who is going to dlaimi with
pride that hie raised a large famiiy? A man
wiIl no longer boast of how many child.ren
hie has brought up. Instead, hie will have to
admit that the Government helped him. He
wilI say, "The Government and I raised a
family."
This great country, honourable senators,
sparsely settled as it is, is stili a pioneering
country. We need men of initiative, diligent
in their business, and .thrifty, men who feel
they ouglit to earn every dollar they properly
can and manfully pass on their savings to their
children. It is children of people like that
who will inherit the earth. That is seripture.
What incentive is there for thrift and iodustry
when such a heavy burden of taxation is piled
on us to provide for unemployment insurance.
mothers' allowances and old age pensions?
'Now theýre is agitation to lower the age limit
for these pensions, and it well may happen
that both chuldren and their parents will look
to the Government for a living. Some time ago
I read an article on suecesaful men of the United
States, men prominent in industry and business.
It stated that 99 per cent of those men
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

came from. large families and had to get ont
and earn their own living when they were only
twelve years of age. If there were family
allowances during the boyhood of the Great
Emancipator I doubt very much whether hie
would have deveioped as lie did. At an early
age. he had to go out and work to provide for
his education. This proposed legialation just
manifests the fear that lias seized members of
the Government and other persons--fear of
certain socialistie trends. The Government is
trying to go one better than the socialists, and
I believe tliat in doing so it will faîl by the
way as the government in my province did.
I arn also fearful of the attitude of labour.
The hononrable senator from, Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. -Hugessen) qnoted figures that I hesitate
to arcept as authentic. H1e said. that 600,000
people were receiving wages not taxable under
the incomne tax law.
Hon. Mr. EUGESSEN: I think rny hionourable friend misnnderstood me. The figure
of 600,000 represented the niumber of monthly
cheques issueci by the Dependents Ailowance
Board to dependants of soldiers overseas.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I thouglit youl meant
labourers.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: It seeme to me that
legisiation of this sort. is a tacit admission that
we are going to drif t to the stage where we
shall have large-scale unemployment. I arn
mot one of those who think that children shouid
suifer because their parents, through unfortumate circumstances, have become destitute.
Let no child suifer. But if the Government is
going to continue to pile np debt and taxes, I
fear the time may corne when I shahl be inclined to say: "Let us have absolute inflation
and start ail over again."' With ail this intricate maze of taxes and the steadily increasing staff necessary for their collection and the
writing out of cheques for social services, every
man gainfully employed wili soon have to pay
two Goverroment officiais to wait on him, and
the whole structure wili break dowm. This socalled far-advanced legisiation may suit a
totalitarian state or an old country of small
extent, but I do flot think it is mecessary in a
great new country like Canada. If I may
make a personal reference: at tweive years of
age I was workimg in the woods handiing great
logs; I knew rny boys at that time who,
like our present-day agitators, enjoyed a higli
standard of living with not very mucli to do.
I arn very sorry to say that ail of themn have
passed to the Great Beyond; I arn stili going
strong.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

AUGUST 3, 1944
Hon. Mr. HORNER: By assisting cbildren
too much you take from them the pride of
accomplishment.
1 believe it is the particular and peculiar
duty of the Senate to rejeet this measure.
This Chamber was created to prevent the
enactmnent of such legislation. When everybody is earning plenty of money, it is nothing
short of a crime to pile this additional burden
on the taxpayers of Canada.
I do flot think I need mention the circumstances surrounding this measure; bonourable senators will understand me. I am
opposed te it on principle and aise because
I believe it will do this country more barmn
than good. Let me repeat, I am concerned
about what will happen if this legislation is
enacted. How wilI it affect family life? How
will our boys appreciate the value of money
when they do flot have to, get out. and earn it?
How can we expect the-i te develop into great
men if the Government takes them in band
from the day they are bora?
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: I did net want te
interrupt the bonourable member during bis
speech. Now I sbeuld lîke te ask him a question. Il this measure is as vicious as the lionourable senator bas indicated, why witb but
one exception did ail tbe members in anotber
place vote for it?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do flot tbink you
want me te tell you wby. Do you? If yeu
do I will. Do you?
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators, 1 think on a measure as important as
this we should give the reasone wby we support or oppose it. I fer one am in faveur
of tbe principle of the Bill. I tbînk I sbould
explain why I support a measure wbicb, we
are told, will involve an annual expenditure of

$250,000,000 and will impose a substantial
burden upon tbe people of the country generally in order te apply the, proceeds in one
particular direction. In my view tbe measure
is entitled te support on tbe grounds of social
j ustice-natural law.
I was very much interested in the remarks of the honourable senator frein Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), and I wish te congratulate bim upon bis exhaustive treatment
of the subi ect. I tbink this legislation migbt
more properly be termed a cbild income bill,
rather than a bill te provide for family allowances, since I prefer tû deal with it from tbe
standpoint of providîng financial assistance
for children who bappen te be bora te parents in
receipt of a very smaîl ineome. Having regard

381

to the method under whicb we carry on business in Canada, there is a direct relationship
between wages and the value of what is produced. If we give the man earning low wages
some benefit by way of wage increase, so that
hie can attain to a higher standard of comfort,
we accomplish nothing, because we have increased bis cost of living and he will
need another increase of wages to take
care of the situation. You cannot establish as
a principle that services sbould be paid for or
material supplied at a price which has regard
to the family situation of the individual performing those services or supplying those
goods. The wages paid have to be hased on
the value of services or goods in relation te
the end for which they are to be used. No
matter wbat doctrine you may subscribe to,
whether it be capitalism or state socialism, you
must recognize the prîncîple of relationship
between wages and production. Otherwise
our economie system cannet function, for we
have to trade with the rest of the world if we
are to carry out the ambitious programme embodied in the legisiation whicb has heen before
us during the last ten days.
So I say the problem cannot be solved by
attempting to increase the income of the man
in the low-wage bracket. TherefRre we have
to find some other way of deallig with the
situation, and -the only reasonable way so far
as I can see is to recognize that the State owes
some obligation to the child. To-day when
a child grows into manhood or womanhood
its services are appropriated for the security
and protection of the State, even to the extent;
of sacrificing the life of the cbild. Thus it is
a direct responsibility of the State to see to
it that the child is assured some decent
measure of care, security, health, and education from infancy to adolescence. Once you
recognize that responsibility you have to find
the best way of assuring to the cbild, no
matter what the circumstances of its parents,
some source of income which will give it a
decent amount of care, secu'rity., health, and
education. And this is an investment by the
State. If you provide means whereby the
health and education of the child are improved, you cannot cenvince me that that
does not enure for the benefit of society; that
is, the State.
It bas been suggested that the burden of this
social security will be too great for our
taxpayers to bear. The suggestion does flot
impress me very mueh, even tbough I am one
of those who feel strongly that taxes should
not be unduly high, and that our present
taxation can. be justified only i war-time.
No economic system that I know of can or
should be expeeted to carry the present bur-

SENATE
den of ,taxation in peace-time, because it really
takes away the incentive necessary for the
proper development of business and industry.
But I say that when, for the protection and
security of the State in war-time, we are p.repared, as we have been on a number of
occasions, to vote a billion dollars by way of
gift to the United Kingdom, and another
billion dollars by way of mutual aid to the
United Nations-all for the purpose of assuring
a greater measure of security and protection
for our own people-I am not terrified by the
prospeet of imposing an additional burden of
$250,000,000 a year upon the taxpayers of
Canada, having regard to the purpose for
which the money is to be used. The money
is not being thrown away, it is not being given
away; it is being invested in the best asset
we have in Canada-the growing children of
this country, who in the future will govern
and defend it and make it prosperous.
So I ask: What is twenty-five per cent of
each of the several donations of a billion
dollars to the United Kingdom? What is
twenty-five per cent of the several votes of a
billion dollars to mutual aid? What is it
compared to the m.oney we are ready to
spend for the rehabilitation of other countries
of the world? I say it is a sort of investment on the home front, and that we should
be prepared to support it in a whole-hearted
manner because it is the best investment
we can make from the point of view of
Canada.
I am not much concerned about the motive
-if there is one-for introducing legislation
of this kind at one time or at another. When
the principle is as sound and, as solid as
the principle behind this legislation I do not
care what the suggested motive may be. If
we are in a position where, by a contribution
of $5 or $6 a month to the maintenance,
education, health and well-being of a child,
we can change a home with a worried mother
and distressed family life into a home that
is happy and comfortable, we should be prepared to make that contribution. Even if rthe
motive may be to procure votes, this is not
the first time that legislation has had such
a motive behind it. So let us be practical
and not be shocked.
The principle behind the bill-the welfare
of the child-is so worth while that I think
we should direct our attention to that. The
children have nothing tto do with the situation
in which they find themselves when they are
born into a family of low income. In some
sections of the country there are many people
who have low incomes; in other sections you
may find people with large families. But no
matter what the condition may be nor in what
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

part of the country it is found. if we look at
the matter from the point of view of the
child and not from that of geography or
race, I think we shall be giving impartial consideration to the principle of the bill. And, if
we do that we must say that this is the only
way we know of by which we can assist in
giving the children a better start in life without
upsetting the whole economy of business and
our whole wage structure. This is not a sop;
it is not a gift; it is not charity to the parents.
It is a recognition of the fact that the State
owes a duty to the child-, because it demands
of that child the assumption of certain
responsibilities as it grows to maturity. I
say that if the State demands something at
one period in the life of the child it must
be prepared to contribute when the child
is in the formative period.
May I repeat? I can see nothing unsound
in this legislation. I am not much concerned
about the mechanics of it, except that I
believe existing machinery should be used
in order that as much as possible of the
money which is taken out of the pockets of
the people of Canada may be spent in
bestowing a benefit on the children rather
than in the administration of the plan. We
should adopt a simple method for the distribution of this money, And that is what
the Bill contemplates.
If those who are subject to income tax
register and apply for the benefit provided by
this Bill, they will have to pay back through
the medium of a lower deduction from income
tax. The allowance on income tax is now
$108 per child. If a parent applies and
registers for this benefit in respect of a child
he will receive $6 a month, or $72 a year.
If he happens to have enough income to make
an income tax return, instead of taking the
allowance of $108 in respect of that child, he
will reduce that amount by $72, thus returning
the $6 a month paid to him on the ground
that he was in a low income bracket. That
is logical and sound, and provides assurance
that the money will go only to children who
by reason of circumstances of birth are
deprived of the measure of health, welfare
and maintenance that should be the heritage
of all the children of Canada. Therefore I
am heartily in support of this Bill.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
as has already been so eloquently said by
our colleagues from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger) and Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) when
discussing the matter of family allowances,
we must never forget that children are the
most precious asset any nation can have.
They constitute a priceless spiritual value.
They are the reserve of human capital. This

AUGUST 3, 1944
is particularly true of -our Canadian democracy.
We cannot give too much attention to the
welfare of our rising generation because, our
country stili being insufficiently inhabited, a
normal growth and sound development of our
population is absolutely essential to our future
prosperity and even our survival.
Canada is the land of plenty. We have an
immense territory with almost unlimited
natural resources generously entrusted to us
by the Creator mot. only for the benefit'of our
people of to-day but also those of to-morrow.
But in a young country as rich as ours, is it
not really appalling to, see millions of young
Canadians underfed and insufficiently clothed,
and to know that many of themn do not
receive an adequate education andL that
hundreds of th-ousands stilI live in squalid
slums or hovels?
Is this not a crime
against humanity and against our nation?
The main cause for this deplorable state of
affairs is to be found in the insufficient means
of the parents, insufficient wages to wageearners and insufficient returns to, farmers and
othiers. To achieve a general and more equltable readjustment of our present system, of
production and distribution would take a
very long time indeed. What steps could he
taken to provide that the father of a large
family should receive more money thax4 his
fellow-worker with fewer children or none at
aIl? It is exceedingly difficuit to find a satisfactoiy solution to such a problem by means
of a readjustment of wages or returns.
Under our present system, as has already
been remarked, the amount of the wagez to
be paid is not and cannot be calculated upon
the basis of the needs of the recipient. Wages
being the price paid for one'à services, the
value of such services to the employer do not
bear any relation to the family charges of
the employee. Some people have advocated
the imposition of a levy upon employers and
employees at large for the purpose of paying
a family bonus in addition to normal wages.
Such a scheme, whatever may be its merits,
is not in principle within the jurisdietion of
the Parliament of Canada. Therefore I do
not consider it practical to diseuss here any
contributory system of family allowances. I
shaîl limit my remarks to the provisions of the
Bull as submitted to us, without examining the
many other courses which might have been
followed but which, in fact, have been left
aside.
The Bill in its prcsent formi is certainly
constitutional. The question which we have to
answer "Yes" or "No" right a-way, is: Are
Canadian children entitled ta obtain within
the shortest possible time relief from the
inhuman fate which le now the lot of so many?

ffl

The present Bill gives an immediate answer
in favour of the childhood of this country.
The bill is not perfect, but I am confident
that wîth the passage of time it will be
improved. Nevertheless, in its present form,
it is at least a great and immediate step
in the right direction; moreover only
by means of Federal legislation can a practical solution be found at once to meet
this real emergency. We have waited a long
time, too long, indeed, and there is no reason
or justification for waiting any longer.
Like many others, I would much prefer a
provincial system of family allowances,
because such a system would adapt itself more
satisfactorily to the local needa and institutions of each of our provinces. This is also
true of any other branch of social legislation.
1 arn not speaking now in favour of transferring to Ottawa ail our provincial rights in
such an important matter; over-centralization
is undesirable; but let us look at the facts
as they are, not as; we would wish thesa to be.
It is: not possible financially for provincial
governments to provide an adeqate system
of family allowances. I remark here, however,
with great satisfaction, that the Prime Minister of my own province has declared his intention of introducing legislation for the purpose
of adding something to the sumo to be given
under the present Bill to families of more than
four children.
I regret that in this Bill it has been deemed
necessary to decrease the rate of allowance te
parents in respect of their fifth and subsequent
children. It seems to me that that provision
is unfair, for it deprives such children of
opportunities enjoyed by the childýren in
smaller famîhies. But let us be, practical. Haîf
a loaf is much better than no bread at ail, and
it should not be refused. For years and years
the school of social thought to which I belong
has been advocating family allowances, but no
positive and concrete success had been recorded. At last the principle is recognizedi and
applied, though *not in the formn that we
originally had ini view. Theoretically, we may
prefer another plan, but at present we 'have
to consider the plan before us. That plan will
be highly beneficial to the children of Canada.
Though I have had to criticize certain
features, I feel it would be a great error te
oppose the Bill. On the whole, the measure
deserves my support, and it is clearly my duty
to vote accordingly. This legislation will help
in a substantial way to secure for all Canadians
freedom from want and freedom from f ear.
Thus, as was so well stated. by my henourable
colleague from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
it will to a large extent implement the Atlantic
Charter.

SENATE
By introducing this measure, which ivill provide our childrcn with bctter food, better housing and better rlothing, and with better
education as dispensed irnder the proper provincial authorities, the present leader of the
Canadian people bas proved once more that
hie is flot only a world-famous statesman, but
also a pioncer and an apostie in the field of
social reform, and a great humanitarian. His
Christian ideal bas inspired the Prime Minister
to give to our country this generous and
highly beneficial measure, whieh wiIl forever

to come.

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of the Bill.

Hie said: Honourable senators, this Bill was
discusscd before our Committee on Finance.
My honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) bas kindly consented to explain
it on the motion for second reading.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, the Bill provides for eighty-eight
amuendrnen*ts to Sebiedule A of the Customs
Tariff, and three amendmenýts to Scheduie B.

When these amendments were in the resolution stage they were before the Committee on
Finance, and various items were explained.
I may say that there are no increases in the
tariff, and that five of the eighty-eight items
in Schedule A are new.
One of these new items provides for dutyfree entry from aIl countries of bottles and
other necessary apparatus for the collection,
preparation. storage, transportation or administration of blood serum or plasma. Under
another new item trophies of war from any

F.AMILY ALLOWANCES BILL
DEBATE

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion for the
second rcading of Bill 161, an Act te previde
for Family Ailowanccs.

AUGUST 4, 1944
Hlon. JOHN T.. HAIG: Honourable senators, 1 shall endeavour not to delay you too
long.
I was greatly interested in the address of
the honourable senatoe, from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen). He presented a very fine
case to prove that family allowances are very
desirable, and he cited many authorities in
support of his argument. I noticed that al
the persons he quoted as authorities were in
favour of family allowances, but he entirely
failed to mention the pour taxpayer, who, I
may tell him, was mentioned frequently in
the election in the province of Saskatchewan.
I also failed to hear him mention the various
bureaux that will have to be set up under
the Bill. The bureaucrats wcre frequcntly
referred to in Saskatchewan.
So that there may be no misunderstanding,
mnay 1 say that I do flot believe there is a
member of this House who is opposed to the
general principle of family allowances. The
honourable senator from Saskatchewan North
(Hon. Mr. Horner) said that he was opposed
to them, but I think that he is against certain
things that are being done rather than against
the principhe.
In any event, I am in favour Mf the principhe of the Bill, and I shouhd think this
would be true of honourable members of this
House who have gone through the experience
of bringing up and providing for children of
their own. Speaking candidly, when I have
said that, 1 think 1 have said ail that can
be said in favour of the Bill. Any further
remarks I make are not a criticism of t.he
principhe of famihy allowances, but rather of
the way in which things have been done.
I am persuaded that tiiere are grave doubts
about .the constitutionality of this measure;
but I do flot think that will we-igh one way
or the other, because if the Bill is unconstitutional the great body of public opinion
in Canada would be that it could be amended
in sucb a way as to make it constitutional,
and,' if necessary, that power could be secured
for that purpose.
I think this matter has been approached in
the wrong way. I believe that family ahlowances should he administered by the provinces.
I arn fearful of the growing power of the
Dominion as against the provinces in ail fielde
of endeavour. I would not say that if Canada
were the size of, say, the province of Quebec
or the province of Ontario. But thie Dominion
stretches for thousands of mniles from east to
west and from north to south. Nearhy every
province is a compact unit. It cou¶d be said
that the Maritime, Provinces are a territory
by theniselves, and the same is true of Québec,
Ontario, the Prairie Provinces andL British

387

Columbia. In reality there are five countries
in Canada su far as geography is concerned,
and the administration of such matters as
family allowances, old age pensions, mothers'
allowances and kindred subi ects could therefore be best administered by the provinces.
.During the years of depression the question
arose whether the 'Dominion Government, the
provincial governments or the inunicipalities
should take care, of unemployment. At that
time the Dominion Government held that it
was a matter for the provinces, and they in
turn hel d that it could be turned over with
advantage to the municipalities.
Now I digress. The honourable senator
fromn Inkerman said that the granting of allowances to children would have lessened the
effect of the depression when it occurred, or
at least that was the impression he left on my
mmnd. I do not believe this is the wa-y to meet
the challenge of the C.C.F. in this country.
They are arguing that the older parties were
in control in this country at the time of the
depression, and therefore were responsible for
it. Nothing could be further froni the truth.
The depression was caused by conditions quite
beyond the orbit of Canadian life, conditions
beyond the reach of anything we could have
done. Yet this contention is being made.
This is a vital matter. My own children have
spoken to me about this subi ect. They have
said: "Weren't you and the old party politicians in charge of things? Why didn't you
sec this depression coming and stop it?" But
what couhd we have done. We know that following the first great war the United States
lent millions of dollars to Germany, part of
which. was used to pay indenities to France,
and the rest for Germany's own purposes. That brought about a condition
of activity in the worhd. If you will look
at the records you will find that in about 1928
or 19.29 Germany started to put a tariff
against our wbeat. So did Italy. Why?
Because they remembered that in the hast war
they were almost starved to death when the
British and American navies kept food from
going into Central Europe, and as they were
getting ready for another war they were hound
and determined to raise their own wheat.
Hitler had not yet corne into power; he was in
opposition and not very influential at that
time. That was the beginning of world-wide
over-production, which before long brought
about the depression.
Take industry in Canada. It is no use
to say that because;- of something the
Government did you eould not seli binders
made in Brantford or trucks made in Windsor.
If the farmers ýcannot selI their products they

they need, and when the demand for these

388

SENATËi

things ceases you have unemployment. There
is an economic circle.
In 1928 and 1929
the world was rushing around in a spirit of
nationalism or isolationism, whatever you mnay
eall if. That was what caused our depression,
for no country in the world is more dependent on ivorld conditions than Canada is.
It i.s for týhis reason that I have been so
strongly in favour of various items of Government legisiation with regard to exehange
in forcign countries. Wc have to watch that.
In my judgment the way to answcr the
C.C.F. is to state these facts, flot to pass
legisiation like this. Evcry timc-mark my
words-cevcry time we try to out-C.C.F. the
C.C.F. we sim.ply add to their armament.
The thing to do is to try f0 edocate our
people as f0 what caused the depression.
Western Canada, whose normal huying power
is very large, had a crop failure, straight
through for five years. Yoo may blame the
hard times thaf, we had out there on erop
failure, or rust, or grasshoppers, or what you
will. The fact is thaf if there had not been
a world depression we sf ili would have suffcrcd
greaf distress in, fhat part of fhe country,
because our buying .power was greafly éecreased. Look at the picture for this year.
The three western provinces will probably
have a crop of between 450 and 500 million
bushels, valuedi af from 500 f0 550 million
dollars. That will give th-ose provinces a
tremendous buying power.
Truc, under
present regulations, the people cannof buy
everything fhey want, but fhey will save a
good deal of thaf money and use it when
goods become plenfiful again.
Everything
will be ail righit so long as there, is a demand
for our 450 million bushels, but what will
happen when we only have f0 provide for
or home con6umption of about 60 million
bushels?
Hon. Mr. KI'NG: If is mucli more now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not much more. If is
geuerally conidered thaf the conuouption uf
wheaf for food averages about five bushels
per ýperson. Pcrhaps 50 or 60 million bushels
are required for fecd and, secd. Say our total
consumpt ion is 125 million bushels: there will
remain a surplus of 350 f0 400 million bushels
f0 dispose of on w orldi markets.
The fondamental facf f0 bear in, mind is
thaf our depression was caused hy a world
condition thaf wc had vcry liffle f0 do wifh.
The sooner wc make thaf known f0 our
young mca and womcn who are advocating
C.C.F. policies, the hetter for fhem and for us.
I arn nof afraid thaf flhc yuung people who
have been cducated in flhe sehools, colleges and
universifies of this country in the last fifteen
Hon. Mr. HAIG

years will go wrong if the facts are put to
fhem in a way thaf they can understand.
They are being told thaf hy manipulation of
this and thaf you can make a country prosperous. What we must make clear is fhat
our prosperity depends upon world conditions.
I arn glad f0 sec thaf the Government bas
been scnding represenfatives f0 meet wifh
delegates from Great Britain, the United
States and other powxers. and discuss world
markets. If will be of vital importance f0
us affer the war that. wc get our proper share
of these markets.
What I have been saying is more or lcss on
the side, except by way of answer to the
statement that legisiation such as this migbt
prevent a depression. I do flot fhink if could.
As fo the cost of measures like this, some
people say fhaf if we can raise moncy f0 carry
on a war we can raise money to ýcarry on the
peace. But wartime financial conditions and
peacetime financial conditions arc altogether
different.
Jn September 1939 we made a
unanimous pledge-be if to our credit-that
wc would go into this sfrugglc and sec it
through to the end. Thank Cod we are
gctting close f0 the end now. The people
arc willing to pay high taxes wbi]c the war
lasts, but after peace cornes thcy will protest
againsf the present rates. I am nof thinking of the rich and well-to-do, with incomes
of 85,000 or more, but of the classes who never
paid taxes unfil the exemptions were reduccd
to $660 for single persons and $1,200 for
married men.
I am pcrsuadcd that the lowering of these
exemptions had as much as anything cIsc f0
do with whaf happencd in the Saskatchewan
election. Those who followed that election
and are familiar with conitions in the West
wiJl tell you there arc two things that people
in the small towns onut there are wrangling
about. One is the income tax. Formerly, when
the exemption was $1,000 for a single person
and $2,000 for the head of a family, plus $400
for cach child, vcry fcw people in those smaller
places paid any income tax at ail.
The second thing that agitates fhem greatly
is the large number of regulations. I have
not exact figures before me, but I understand that up to the firsf of July some 44,000
Orders in Council had becn issued undcr the
War Measures Acf, and that the number of
regulations made on the authority of these
orders was about 400,000. Tbcy affect the
whole population, and the C.C.F. is making
capital ouf of the annoyance they cause. One
thing the war has shown is that under a
syetem of Government control wc are sure f0

AUGUST 4, 1944
have a great extension of bureaucracy. Thousands of men and women are now engaged in
seving to it that the 400,000 regulations are
carried out.
People ail over the couintry are rebelling
against the pettineas of some of these regulations. Let me refer to one order made by
the Wartirne Prices and Trade Board. Honourable senators will understand that I amn
not criticizing the Board, for we know it has
donc good work. Price controis have beneflted us ail, and no one would suggest that
we ought not to have had them. The Board
issued an order that you could purchase oniy
one pair of pants with a suit. I would descrîbe
that as a joke of an order, because it prevented you frorn getting more than about
half the possible use out of the coat and vest.
At the Liberal party conference in Ottawa last
September there was a row, and this order
was repealed. Some other orders are equally
nonsensical, and many of the Board's officers
and employees are -impractical. I could cite
dozens of annoyixng examples, which make me
angry every time I think about them. I
know I arn digressing, and I hope honourable memabers will pardon me. The point I
arn trying to emphasize is that 'by and large
the only way to go after the C.C.F. is by informing our young people of the need for
proper coutrols in war-time, and flot by passing measures such as this.
I think ti legisiation shouid be administered by the provinces. Before I go farther
along that line I want Wo say something
political. I amn persuaded that if we were flot
going Wohave a federal election within the
next six months a coniference would have been,
held with the provinces and an attem.pt macle
.to work out a poiicy whereby they would
administer the payment of these family allowances. My province of Manitoba wua a
pioneer in -mothers' allowances; if 1 ar n ot
mistaken it was the first province to have
them. The scheme has worked well, but it is
costing neariy twice as much as was éstimatesi
when it was first proposed in the legislature.
Do not be misled about the cost of these
children's aliowances. Instead of $250,000,00)0,
it will be nearer to $500,000,000. But if we are
right in passing a law of this kind, its cost
should flot be a serious objection..
I arn ail for provincial administration of
schemes like this. The provinces would turu
the actual carrying out of the scheme over to
the municipalities, which do a better job in
matters of this kind than any other bodies can.
I know that in Manitoba unemployment relief
was administered far better in the municipalities than in unorganized districts. The prov-

ë

inces and the municipalities are dloser than the
Dominion 'is to the recipients of benefits under
measures of this kind. We see that Ontario
and Quebec are objecting to the reduction iu
allowaxices when there are more than four
chi1dren in a family. If a personai reference is
permissibie, I must say my experience was that
with every additional child the cost of maintenance seemed to go up.
Another objection to the Bill is that it does
flot provide for allowances in respect of children older than sixteen. Those of us who have
raised families know that the rnost expensive
period in a child's life is between the ages of
sixteen and twenty, when the child is attending high school or university. True, this
legisiation may be intended prinicipally to,
benefit what are known as poor people. I
dislike that term, but I do not know what
other one to use. In, any event, children of
so-calied poor people have the sarne right as
other children to a good education. I do flot
-ay that high school or university education
wiil make boys andi girls better citizens than
they would otherwise be, but I arn persuaded
that by andi large those who graduate from
our high schools and unîversities are better
quaiied for the struggie of life than thoset
who do flot go beyond grade six. I can point
to a mimber of men lu our own city who,
though having had littie formai education, are
well-to-do and influential citizens. People of
that kind would make a success if they had no
education at ail. But what about the average
person? I arn con-vinced that bis chances in
life are more or less proportionate tp the
degree of his education.
The provinces and the municipalities are
dloser to the people than the Dominion is, and
therefore I am oppoeed to, federal adiministration of these aliowances. The Dominion wili
have to, set up a. large nation-wide organization, witb branches in every province, in order
to see that the terms of the Act are lived up
to. But however large the organization may
be at the start, it will tend to grow steadily
andi develop into a bureaucracy. I arn afraid
of the Dominion Government's encroachments
on the social services of the provinces. I arn
quite willing that the great bulk of this rnoney
shouid corne from the Dominion, but 1 think
the provinces shouid be entrusted with the
administration.
The policy of family allowances has been
adopted in France, Belgium, Italy and«Germ*any, but not in the Scandinavian countries.
I would ask honourable senators to note carefully what I arn about to read:
Sweden, Norway and other Euro-pean countries investigated and rejected the policy on the

ground of cost. They decided that the wiser
course was te give aid te nieedy families in
services and in kind.
Hon. Mr. RING: What paper are you
reading frorn?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: From, an article by Grant
Dexter, which appeared in the Winnipeg
Free Press on the first cf this month. The
article continues:
The United States National Resources Planning Board in 1942 reported again8t the policy.
The board believed that wages and prices should
be high enough to meet basic 1ieed..
The Quebec Commission cf 1930 tur ned down

a ineans cf keeping wages down. No consideratien appears te have been given te the effect
cf allowances on the rural popuflation.
I have read these extracts te show that al
is net clear sailing, thaýt everybody is net in
favour of this legisiation.
The estirnated 'cost of the proposed family
allowances is said to he S250,000,000. My own
figure was $240,000,000, which is pretty close.
There are two ways in which this money could
be divided-eithcr among the provinces on a
per capita basis, or, as the Bill provides, hy
payrnent directly te the children's parents.
The cost cf farnily allowances is estimated te
be $1.79 for each child.

Dominion Government will administer family
allowanccs in thiat province. The provincial
authorities would rather do the work themselves. You enly have te go into the province
te flnd that I amn correct in my staternent.
Further, the people cf Quehec think the Bill
discrirninates against large families. This is
obvious frorn the fact that Premier Godbout
in a recent speech promised a provincial
contribution
te
remove
this
so-called
discrimination.
I arn in faveur ef children's allowances. I
remember when I was net. I questioned the
policy whien it was flrst put forward in

AUGUST 4, 1944
Manitoba. I arn glad to say that it has
worked out most successfully there. Some
honourable member yesterday said that that
policy has been copied in the, other provinces
with the exception of Prince Ediward Island.
I do not know why it was flot copied there.
I repeat, 1 wish thé Bill provid-ed for distribution of the allowances by the provinces rather
than by the Dominion. My honourable friend
may say that the plan will be so worked
out, but this cannot be done unless at the
outset there is an agreement with the provinces. I arn quite willing to accept the
figures furnished by the Department as to the
number of chuldren who will be entitled to
these allowances, but I think the money
should be turned over to the provinces so that
they may co-ordinate this service with their
other social services.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: Honourable senators,
as this subi ect, wa;s discussed at great length
yesterday and has been very ably presented
to us this afternoon by the honourable acting
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig), who bas
just sat down, I arn sure you ail féel that not
much remains to be said. But of course a
woman would not be running true to form if
she did flot want to have the last word.
Hon Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
,Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Wben this measure was
intruduced into the House of Communs its
objective as then ann;ounced was to bring
about a greater measure of well-being, in, the
fields of nutirition, health and education, for
the children of Canada, especially those whose
parents were in the lower income groups. As
the hon-ourable acting leader has very well
said, no one in this Chamber objeets to the
principle of the Bill. We are aLl in accord
as to the desirability of attaining the objective
sought, though sorne of us rnay bave different
ideas as to the best methode to be ad.opted.
In February last, speaking in this Chamber
in the debate on the Address in Reply to the
Speech frorn the Thron-e, I thînk I made
clear in a general way my, own personal stand
on matters of this kind. With the consent of
the House, I will read a few lines of what I
said on that occasion:
We ail appreciate the f act that there are
certain cases and certain conditions calling for
the payrnent of cash grants te individuals. But
personally I should like to see the emphasis
placed upon services first, and cash grants made
supp]ementary to those services.
That is still rny opinion. I have followed
the debates in the House of Commons and
here, and have read what bas appeared in the
press with the greatest care. While I amn not

opposing the Bill in its present form, I still
would prefer to see the greatest emphasis
placed on the extension of essential services,
for then we would know that the children were
getting the direct benefit. The cash grants
should be- supplementary.
Yesterd&y rny honourable friend frorn Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) referred to the
support which the Women's Committee were
givîng to this Bill. I have had many representations and communications frorn groups
ofwomen who have been studying this subject, women with farnilies where the income
is not in excess of $2,000. They tell me that
while they are not opposed to the Bill and,
like myself, are in full accord with the objective aimed at, they are uineasy on two scores:
first, thèy fear these cash payments may take
the place of higher wages for their husbands;
and, secondly, they have been looking forward to a great expansion of social services
throughout the country, and fear that the
payment of children's allowances may to a
certain extent curtail the expansion of those
services, especially the yearly medical checkup, the twice-yearly dental check on al
children under sixteen years of age, with free
medical attention as needed, the extension of
health chinics to rural centres, the electrificatien of rural homes and the extension of educational faiities in rural areas, which of
course includes better salaries for the teachers.
It has been said that this 'Bill will provide
greater educational advantages for chîldren in
the low-income groups. That to a certain
extent is truc, but I would point out to
honourable senators that it does not necessarily follow in rural areýas, particularly when
educational facilities do not exist in those
ameas. If a community is not financially able
to pay good salaries in order to secure the
best teachers, I cannot see how the cash allowance will meet the situation. Further, I think
honourable senators will agree that in every
community there are great numbers of parents
who are careless about the education of their
childrcn, and not at aIl convinced that they
need any great amount of education. I arn
not at aIl certain in my mmnd that the placing
of a few extra dollars each month in the hands
of such parents is going to change them overnight and cause them to desire an education
for their children, and make thcmn willing to
spend the money to that end.
The feature which bas been stressed Most,
perhaps, and which, I may say candidly, is
responsible for rny support of the Bill, is the
hope that these bonuses may he the means of
building heaîthier bodies for our Canadian
children in the future. I think that in the

392

SENATE

great majority of homes these extra allowances will help to counteract the malnutrition
which has been all too prevalent among the
youth of our land. But while that may be
true of a majority of homes, once again it will
not be true of all. I am sure the honourable
the Leader of the House, who is a medical
man. will agree with me when I say that malnutrition among the children and the youth of
our country is not always due to a lack of
money. but in many cases results from money
being spent on the wrong kind of food and the
improper cooking and careless preparation of
meals.
I note that in another place some of the
speakers in dealing with this phase of the
matter have suggested that educational pamphlets on nutrition should be sent into the
homes where they are thought to be needed.
Personally, I do not think this would be very
effective. I think these pamphlets would meet
the fate of most pamphlets that come into
the home-they would be consigned to the
waste-paper basket or would be used to light
the kitchen fire.
On the other hand, I think a great deal
could be accomplished by making use of
existing services. I have spoken before of the
wonderful work done by the Victorian Order
of Nurses-I cannot speak too highly of that
organization-and it is my opinion that by
giving more financial support to the work they
are doing in sending trained housekeepers into
homes where medical check-ups have shown
the existence of malnutrition, much could be
done to remedy a really serious situation.
These housekeepers could show by practical
demonstration what foods should be bought,
how they should be bought and how they
should be prepared.
I have given these few examples just to
illustrate my point when I say that in supporting the principle of the Bill I sincerely
hope the payment of cash allowances will not
in any way curtail the extension of services
which will be of much practical benefit to the
children of Canada as a whole.
Now. there is one other matter to which
I should like to refer. It relates' not to the
Bill, but rather to the method of presentation. I support the honourable the Acting
Leader on this side of the House (Hon. Mr.
Haig) in opposing the manner in which this
legislation has been prepared and introduced.
The honourable the Acting Leader has
said that the provinces should be charged
with the administration. I agree with that,
and I would go even further and say that
the provinces should have been consulted
before the Bill was brought to Parliament.
Let me repeat. I do not oppose the principle
of the Bill, but I do object to the undue
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS.

haste with which it is being adopted. This
is a Bill of extreme importance. In order
to carry out its provisions, it will be necessary to impose very heavy taxes upon everybody. Yet the Bill is submitted to Parliament without the provinces being consulted.
It bas been brought down at the fag end
of the session, when there is not even time
to send it to the social security committee
of either House.
Hon. Mr. RING: Notice of it was given on
the first day of the session.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: My point is that
it was not introduced in time to send
it to the social security committees, as was
the health measure brought before Parliament a couple of sessions ago. Members
on the Government side in both Houses have
spoken of this Bill as being just one part of
a great programme of social security; yet
the health bill, which also forms part of
that programme, was before the House of
Commons committee on social security for
a long time and is now being sent to the
Dominion-Provincial Conference for further
consideration before it becomes law. I submit that the same course should have been
pursued with regard to this Bill.
Honourable members may not agree with me,
bu.t I submit that it is high-handed dictatorship

to say, in effect, to

the province

of

Ontario: "Yau must pay out $100,000,000 or
more a year, much of which will be spent
outside of your province. You must cooperate with us in the administration of this
bonus, but you cannot have any say in -the
d.rafting of the Bill." We have aIl realized
that during war-time it is necessary for a
government to take unto itself certain dictatorial ,powers in relation to war measures;
but to carry that attitude into peace legislation is something that will be very bitterly
resented by thousands in the province in which
I live-I cannot speak for any other province-who maintain, as I do, that the provinces had every right to be consulted. If it
was necessary for the health measure to go to
the Dominion-Provincial Conference, then, I
submit, it was just as necessary for this Bill
to go there before coming to Parliament. But when this line of reasaning
is submitted, we are met with the argument
that there is no time to do these things;
that, even though the Bill will not come
into force until July, 1945, it must be rushed
through now, because the intervening time
is required, for setting up the necessary
machinery.
Well, frankly, I must admit that I have not
been very much impressed with this argument.

AUGUST 4, 1944
The present Government has been. in power
for nine years, some of themn years of very
bad depression when the children were realhy
suffering and badly needed assistance. But
nothing was clone. Naw we are in a period
of bigh wages; work for everybody is the
arder of the day. This being so, I cannot
see why, after waîting nine years, it should
suddenfly become imperative ta rush this Bill
through withaut submîssion ta the DominionProvincial Canference. If an, cmergency really
exists, then I submit that the Government
should have intraduced' the Bill early in. the
session sa, that it could have been considered
by the proper committees.
It seems ta me that the Senate has a duty
ta perfarm. As honourable members of this
flouse have repeatedhy stated, the Senate
is an independent body, it is in no way
a rubber stamp for the flouse of Commons,
and one of its chief diuties is ta prevent
Iegislation being rushed through without full
consideratian by the proper autharities. I
submit that. we now have an apportunity ta
show the people of Canada whether or not
we have meant, what we said, and stihl mean
it. We owe a duty ta, the people of this
country, who will be heavily taxed ta meet
the financial requirements of this legisation,
and that duty is ta satisfy ourselves that the
Bill before us will give the maximum benefit
ta the children. of Canada, a benefit propartionate t,& the amaunt of money wbich wilh
be spent.
In order ta satisfy aurselves, only ana
method is passible-consultation between
the Dominion and the provincial authorities.
This is my own personal opinion upon it. I
submit that the Senate should net give this
Bill second reading, but should ask that it
be referred ta the caming Dominion-Provincial
Conference for consideration along with the
national health bill. If that were done there
would he no dehay; the Bill couhd still be
brought befare Parliament at the beginning
of next session, and couhd- become effective
by the lat of Juhy, 1945. 1 believe that if we
took such action, ail Canadians-certainly
the maj ority in many provinces-would feel
satisfied that an honest endeavour was being
madle ta *spend the maney of the taxpayers
ta the very, hast passible advantage. Thank
you.
Some lion. SENATORS: ie an, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS: Honourable
senatars, as I intend ta use my mother tangue
in speaking of this bill, I pledge myself ta

3

hold the floor for the shortest possible time,
taking into account the fact that the
thermometer has risen to an unusual height
to-day. The bill now before us is certainly
one of the most important that we have had
to consider since the beginning of this session.
I shall even say that it is one of the most
important that have been introduced in the
Canadian Parliament in many years. It is
a most significant bill and I may add a very
intricate one. I do not know whether the
atmosphere that purrounds us in the times
through which we are now passing imparts to
my honourable colleagues feelings and impressions similar to those which. I now experience. As far as I arn eoncerned, I arn under
the impression that humanity has neyer lived
in conditions so complex and difficuit as thdse
that obtain to-day. The matters that corne
up are not simplet; 'they cannot easily be
grasped at first sight. Nearly ail of them are
extremely and frightfully intricate. Where is
the truth in ail those pieces of legislation that
are submitted ta the different parliaments of
Canada? Where is the truth in legisiative
measures destined ta bring happiness and
sometimes misfortune to the people? A man
whom history holde in disrepute once said
these words which have corne down to us:
Quid est venitas? What is truth? We might
be tempted to say to-day: Ubi est veritas?
Where is truth in aIl those conflicting doctrines, in the plans that are submitted ta us'by
people who have more or less authority ta do
so? Our forbears were happier than we are;
they were living in a less complîcated environment, and their laws were almost al
simple. It was merely a question of saying
yes or no. Let us rememnber the men who
preceded us, the men who drafted the laws by
which we are stili governed: secularization of
church reserves, abolition of seigniorial tenure,
representation based on population, and many
others. As I said, our forbears were happier
than we are; they could say yes or no. Today, I wonder whether I must say yes or no.
I should be inclined to say yes as regards
the principle of the bill that is now before us.
I coulýd say that the Bill is good. If I
had ta, vote on it, I would feel inclined ta
support its second reading, because ,that is
the time when we pass judgment on the principle of a -measure. However, in s0 far as the
details are concerned, I find-and I arn not
the only ane ta hold such a view-that the bill
bas a very great number of weak points. I
said that I would speak as briefly as passible,
and I shahl try ta keep my word.
If I go over this bill, even in a quite cursary
way, it is because I wish ta show that it bas, ta
my mind, four main defects.

394

SENATE

In the first place, I consider as excessive the
assumption of an exclusive control on the part
of the government in the establishment of family allowances. How will this bill work? What
is the body that will operate that fairly complicated machine? It will be purely and simply
the governments of Canada, whatever they
may be.
Here is section 11 of the bill, which provides
for regulations governing the administration
of the act:
The Governor in Council may make regulations to give effect to and carry out the objects
of this Act, and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, may by regulationsprovide generally or in respect of any
province or any class of cases that payment
shall be made to the parent prescribed in the
regulations;
provide that where, by reason of age, infirmity, ill health, insanity, improvidence or
other reasonable cause of disqualification of the
person to whon the allowance is payable or in
other special circumstances, payment may be
made to another suitable person or agency;
provide the procedure of the tribunal established pursuant to section six of this Act;
provide that in the case of Indians and
Eskimaux payment of the allowance shall be
made to a person authorized by the Governor in
Council to receive and apply the saine;
prescribe the manner and form of registration
and the information and evidence which may be
required in connection therewith;
impose penalties for violation of any such
regulation by way of fine not exceeding two
hundred dollars or imprisonment for a term
not exceeding three months enforceable upon
summary conviction.
That is a vast power indeed.
Absolute
power is conferred on the government as
regards the administration of the act.
Section 6 provides as follows:
If any person is dissatisfied with a decision
as to his right to be paid an allowance or as to
the amount of an allowance payable to him or
as to any other matter arising under this Act,
'he may appeal against such decision to a
tribunal to be establislhed and conducted in
accordance with regulations, and the decision
of the tribunal shall not be subject to appeal
or review by any court of law.
Here is a court set up by the government,
a court without appeal. Therefore, you have
state control, a government-created tribunhl
from whose decision no one may appeal.
I an firmly convinced that it would be impossible to create a more absolute power.
I therefore state briefly that this bill evidences an excessive control over the administration of a measure which bas a great social
and economic importance.
Besides, I claim that this bill infringes on
what I may call fanily autonomy.
One
often hears this word nowadays: there is
federal autonomy and provincial autonomy.
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS.

Here, it is a matter of autonomy in the
family, of family autonomy. I now come
to section 3 of the bill:
From and after the first day of July, one
thousand nine hundred and forty-five, subject as
provided in this Act and in regulation . . .
Here again we have this matter of regulations which the Governor in Council may
enact, etc. I wonder whether my colleagues
have the same feelings as I have in reading
or re-reading section 5:
The allowance shall be applied by the person
receiving the same exclusively towards the
maintenance, care, training, education and
advancement of the child, and, if the Minister
or such officer as is authorized by regulations in
that behalf is satisfied that the allowance is not
being so applied, payment thereof shall ba discontinued or made to some other person or
agency.
At first sight, one might be inclined to say:
"After all, the government passes an Act
granting family allowances, and it is only
fair that they endeavour to know how the
money is spent." Granted. However, there
is, in all this, a certain amount of haziness
which paves the way for regrettable intrusions.
After all, the family is the family; the
father is the king of the family; the father
is the head; he is the one to decide what
education should be given his children. There
is such a thing as family autonomy. This
very point that I am trying to make, I
notice, bas been thoroughly covered by a
very interesting and reliable Montreal periodical, in connection with section 5 of the
bill:
The extremely abusive government interference in the management of the family would go
so far as to control the expenditure of the
allowances; are not these payments designed to
help the family as a constituted and autonomous
ýunit of society? Is the father to become a
mere middle-man through whom the father-state
shows its liberality towards the children? Ia
the education of the family to become
the business of funetionaries?
State control is indeed one of the pitfalls
of the Bill. All this may lead ta serious
mistakes and even to misuse of authority and
absolute intolerable interference.
I wish to be brief and, therefore, I come
to a further criticism in connection with this
bill. I refer to the distribution of allowances,
to the section concerning the decreasing payments. This is surely one of the sections of
this whole bill against which the greatest
aversion and opposition is apparent in certain
quarters.
You know the meaning of section 3. After
enumerating the rates for a child under six
years of age, five dollars, and so forth, there
is the following restriction:

Provided that the allowance payable shall, in
respect of a fifth child naintained by the
parent, be reducied by one dollar and in respect

AUGUST 4, 1944
of a sixth chjld and a seventh child respectively
so maintained, by two dollars and in respect of
an eighth child and each additional child respective]y so inaintained, by three dollars.
,This is called decreaeing allowances, a
systemi which je condemned by competent
sociologists. Here is another extract of the
periodical frorn which I quoted a while ago:
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: What publication are
you referring to?
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPMIS: Relations.
A periodical entitled Relations, published in
Montreal. It is, I believe, the officiai mouthpiece of l'Ecole Sociale Populaire.
This measure might 'have secmed reasonable
in connection with an elderly population, in anoverpopulated country, with exhausted resources,
but in Canada, a land of infinite opportunities,
which some would have overrun by immigrants,
w-here a young population is on the increase, it
becomes an anomaly. It constitutes a departure
from tihe wise traditions of ail countries where
family allowancee are coinprehiensive; they sometimea have increaaing rates, or unif'orm rates,
but nowhere are decreasing rates to be found.
The measure is in direct opposition to its
objecta whicli la to assiat large families unable
to provide for their own needs; the recommendation of the Congreas of the International
Labour Organization, held in Philadelphia
recently, summarizea the universal practice and
tendencies wben it recommends payment from
the tbird child on.
Well, those views are open to discussion,
but to my mind they are far-reaching and
signifleant ini Eo far as the consideration of
this bill ie concerned.
Then there is a fourth objection to the bill,
which I shaîl caîl invasion of provincial rights,
and in this connection I must add that I
have heard with great pleasure the very forceful etatemente of the honourable senator who je
acting as leader of this aide of the House (Hon.
Mr. Haig) in regard to the very subject to
which 1 arn referring at the present time. I arn
convinced that a project such as the farnily
allowance bill ehould be carried out by the
provinces, I regret having to make so many
quotations, but I noticed that ini another place,
quite recently, the attention of another group
of men was called to that point in these words:
Even this measure, to which I have not
objected thus f ar, centralizea a great deal of
power in Ottawa. I ahould have muoh more
readily .favoured granting the snoney ýto the
provinces, as direct grants, to whioh they would
be given a conatitutional guarantee, as of right,
with the suggestion that the cnoney should be
used by the provinces for the payment of family
allowancea. As I eaid -the other day, the people
in the provinces know 'how, to govera tboae
provinces. There are no men in the Dominion
of ýCanada who know more about governing
Prince Edward Island than do the people in
Prince Edward Island.
He nientioned Prince Edward Island, but it
could be applied to the other provinces.

;9

They know their local conditions; they know
their needs, because they have lived in that
province. They live in the province; they have
built the province, and their c.hildren are going
to live in it. Why should the power at Ottawa
undertake to tell the people of Prince Edward
Island how to manage the affaira of that
province? The sanie applies to every province.
Because of the enorenous distances involved in
the dominion, and the widc variety of geography
and climatic conditions, it je aIl the more
important that we guarantee to the local governmente in the country a greater and greater
measure of unchallengeable antonomy.
I endorce this statement and 1 share those
views. Indeed, has not a precedent been in
existence several years? There are precedents which do not work but there are corne
which do. Well, if we glance through the
Statutes which have been enacted in the past
in Canada, we find the title of an Act which,
under the present conditions, would bring
about the smme recuits; it ie the Old Age
Pensions Act. You are well ýaware of the setup. In connection with the old age pencions,
the governinent pays -a certain eurn to the
provinces and the latter distribute this money.
These pensions were of trernendous help to a
large number of our citizens.
I wich to quote an excerpt from a brief
prepared by the Cornmittee of Social Walfare
of Montreal, an important organization which
rny hion. friend (Hon. Mr. Gouin) must know:
It would *be aufficient, in order to protect the
higher interests already ýmentioned to redraft
bill 161 on a similar basie to that of the Old
Age Pensions Act (che.pter 156, R.S.C., 1927,
as amended).
:Those are, honourable gentlemen, my views
in regard to this bill. To surn up, the objecli of
the bill seeme to be a worthy one. Sociologists
and econorniets -have endorsed it. Several countries have already a cimilar seheme in operation
and it je certaihily a measure that will assiet
Canadian families whoee mneans are insufficient
to enable them to ensure substantial advantage
to their members; it le a measure which will
be of greaýt benefit to the whole country.
The purpose of the bill is excellent, but 1
muet admit, in all truthfulness, that it meete
with seriouc objections whjch 1 have juet
briefly mentioned. Under these conditions, 1
would certainIy be willing to support the
second reading of the bll, but I could not go
beyond that.
Now, I would like to add a word. Why
muet we in Csnada fýace this problern, thie sort
of ill-feeling between such and such a province, thie nationality and that, over the bill
now before the Sanate? The province of
Quebec to which I belong appears to, be the
butt of attacks varying widely in fairnes.
People seem irritated beforehand. by the ecope
of the bill. If it je paesed, as it will be, if it
je put into effect, again as it wîll be, people

SENATE
imagine that one Canadian province might
derive more benefit from it than others and
that the unfortunate province of Quebec would
get the lion's sharel Why? Because in that
miserable province of Quebec, there are too
many children. Too many children in the
province of Quebec ! But is it a crime, honourable gentlemen, to have a high birthrate? Is it
shocking to develop it in one province? Does
it constitute high treason against the state?
Tell me, shall we castigate the province of Quebec because in its cottages
there grows a strong young people, sometimes
not quite as sturdy as it might be because of
a scarcity of means? Is that not rather to the
credit of the province of Quebec? If Ontario's
birthrate exceeded Quebec's, I would say: "All
the better, heaven be praised!" If it overtook that of Quebec by one, two or three
hundred thousand, I should cheer Ontario on.
Children are a country's greatness and happiness! And to think that some people would
ban one province because it has too many
children. To-morrow, some other bill may
be introduced in another field, and when it is
put into effect, it may benefit one province
in some respect, let us say New Brunswick or
Ontario, more than the others. That is always
happening. This legislation or that is certainly
not enacted with such a precise purpose in
mind, but it constantly occurs that in practice
some particular act is more profitable to one
province than to another. What does that
matter? It is all to the greater good of the
country! We are al] brethren in Canada and
we live in sister provinces. It would be ratiher
strange for one sister to resent the good
fortune of another one of ber sisters.
(Text):
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT: Honourable senators, I have studied social problems
in this country and in Europe, and, with your
permission, I propose to make a few observations on this Bill. I was very much impressed
by what the honourable acting leader on the
other side (Hon. Mr. Haig) said in regard to
Sweden and Norway. I am familiar with the
situation in those countries, but I fear I shall
not have sufficient time to discuss it to-day.
Certain persons appear to be afraid of the
large families whicb are the pride of Quebec,
and they say the principal purpose of this
Bill is to favour that province. Even if this
were true, would it be wrong in any way? Are
we not all citizens of the same country? Are
we not all Canadians? Does not the British
North America Act declare that the province
of Quebec shall never have more than sixtyfive members of the House of Commons nor
more than twenty-four members of the Senate?
Hon. Sir THOMAS CHAPAIS.

As French-Canadians, did we say that the
other provinces wanted to keep us enslaved?
We had faith in those who worked te establish
Confederation, and we are parties to the
contract. Why do some persons continue to
make insinuations which can only undermine
that contract?
To-day, unfortunately, in
different parts of the country certain people
are holding aloft the torch of intolerance-a
torch which to-morrow may so inflame passions across the land as to destroy national
unity and dissolve Confederation. This would
mean the end of our Canada. Let such persons
take 'heed! No one plays with fire without
peril!
As I have said, some persons are afraid of
the large families we have in Quebec; but we
are proud of them. I am the fifteenth child
in my family. I have eleven nephews in the
Army, Navy and Air Force. They are fighting
in Normandy to protect the liberty of Canada
and the liberty of England, and to give back
ber freedom to our former mother country.
In sad contrast, I regret to say there are
persons in this country working in the opposite
direction:

instfad

of

striving

to

maintain

full liberty for everyone, they seek to deny it.
I maintain that, contrary to what some would
like the public to believe, it is not true to say
that this Bill is intended to favour my province at the expense of the other provinces. And
it is not true that Quebec wants to isolate
itself. As a matter of fact Quebec buys at
least one-half of the goods she consumes or
uses from the other provinces. This of itself
is a substantial contribution to their prosperity.
I would appeal to all men of good will, to
real Canadians, to muster all their energies
so that we in Canada may have the
fullest measure of peace and harmony. All
my life I have preached co-operation. But
co-operation is possible only when two parties
are willing to co-operate. Co-operation means
union, mutual assistance, charity. Let us all
co-operate, so that Canada, our Canada, shall
grow happy and prosperous.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. J. DUFFUS: Honourable senators,
I have been twenty-five years in public life,
and it has always been my practice to champion the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
During that period I have whole-heartedly
supported all types of social legislation, for I
am firmly convinced that such legislation is
wholly in the national interest.
For many years I have assisted persons who
were justly entitled to pensions of various
kind.s-returned soldiers, burnt-out veterans,
soldiers' widows, the blind, and others. In

AUGUST 4, 1944
fact, in my first speech in another place I
pleaded with the Government to establish
pensions for the blind, and urged that they
be as generous as finances would permit. I
am proud to say that in this effort, I, with
others, was successful. Recognizing the
economic handicap of parents with large families, I have often pondered over what could
be done to remove that embarrassing disadvantage, and when I listened to the Speech
from the Throne at the opening of this session,
I was delighted beyond measure to hear that
at last this long-neglected problem was to
receive consideration.
As to the Bill before us I have th-is to say:
I feel that if during the years I have spent
in Parliament I have done nothing but support
this measure and cast my vote for it, by that
alone I have justified my presence here.
I am repaid for any sacrifice I have made.
It has been said, and quite correctly, that
the youth of this country is our most precious
asset. Indeed, if there were some means by
which we could adequately assess such values,
I am sure it would indicate that nothing else
was nearly, as precious and valuable. If, as a
result of the passage of this measure, our
children are healthier, happier, better educated, better clothed and better housed, any
reasonable expenditure we make to meet our
obligation in this respect will be justified.
It cannot be denied, I think, that the first
charge on the finances of a nation is the
health and education of its people. Many
other nations have loyally met the challenge
in this regard. Is there any justifiable reason
why we should be guilty of depriving our
children of their birthright, especially when
we pride ourselves on being one of the richest
nations in the world? I have no intention
of enumerating the many assets which this
country possesses. Hldnourable members are
quite as familiar with then as I am. I am
simply maintaining that the provisions embodied in this Bill will assist greatly in putting
us on a par with other nations. Honourable
members will agree that two of the things
whioh Canada has negelected most are education and health. That the passing of this
Bill will assist education immeasurably no
one can deny.
Ill health causes suffering, pain, deprivation
and unhappiness. This Bill will do much te
overcome these evils by providing the mothers
with proper medical attention, delicacies and
the other supplies so essential to their welfare
both before and after childbirth. Indeed, I
think I am wholly correct when I say that
these granta will reduce the deaths from
childbirth to a minimum, and will hasten the
recovery of the mothers. Subsequently the

397

children, by reason of having healthy bodies
and keener minds, will make greater progress
in acquiring education.
Hence, the two
problems of education and health, will have
been solved in a general way to the satisfaction of all concerned, and this will be of
inestimable advantage not only to the families directly concerned, but to the country
in general.
Now, I have a question to put to honourable
members. Let us suppose that I am a
mechanic with a large family and the man
next to me in the factory has no family. We
are both receiving the same rate of pay.
What chance in life have I as compared with
the man who has no family? Will anyone
suggest that it would be possible for me to
convince my employer that because I have
done my duty as a citizen I am entitled to
more pay? Honourable senators know that
it would be absolutely impossible for my
employer to increase my pay without creating
disruption and dissension within his industry.
God's command, as contained in scripture,
is to be fruitful and multiply, and one of the
duties of all couples joined in matrimony is
the propagation of the human race. Unquestionably God was sincere. If proof of this
were necessary it is to be found in the fact
that he elevated matrimony to a place among
the seven sacraments of the Church, and
thereby set it amongst the holiest of holy
things.
Speaking of population, is it not better that
it should be increased as far as possible in the
natural way, rather than by the expenditure
of large sums of money to bring in. from
other countries people of objectionable character, who by causing dissatisfaction make it
necessary for us to deport them?
Honourable senators, I can think of nothing
more heartbreaking than to see a delicate
mother trying to take care of a sickly child
of tender years when her meagre means render
ber helpless in the matter of providing necessary medical care and nutritions food. When
I think of what will be accomplished by this
Bill, in ensuring to every Canadian mother
and child medical care, sufficient and proper
food, clothing, proper housing conditions and
education, I find it impossible to estimate the
wealth of happiness that will accrue. Permit
me to cite the experience of a young couple
who lived on a farm in the country. They
had a family of 21, children, 18 of whom are
living. They lest the farm because it was
economically impossible for them to survive.
I challenge any honourable member to say
that they should. not have received assistance.
Honourable members may laugh; but this
young couple did their duty in accordance

Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honeurable
senaters, ià is net my intention at this late
heur of the day te tire you with a long
speech. I understand that this Bill will be
sent te Committee for further consideration,
and with that understanding-I hope it is
correct-I shahl say just a few words.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Committee?

Is

the Bill going

te

Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I bave follewed witb
close attention the speeches made this afterneen. Ail of tbem were well conceived, and
well delivered. It eccurs te me that it migbt
he interesting te give a short recapitulation.
The Acting Leadcr on the other side of the
Hlouse based his case mainly on the ground
that legislation such as this is more or less a
challenge te provincial rigbts and preregatives.
The henourable the lady member from
Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis) hased ber
case mainly on tbe contention that there was
ne reasen for baste in passing sucb legislation
at this particular time.
My honourable friend from Grandville
(Hon. Sir Thomas Cliapais) built up bis case
on four points. Since be spoke in Frencb I
shall run over tbema briefly for the benefit of
honourable members wbo are net familiar witb
that language. I am willing te accommodate
the House in that, respect.
is first point was
tbat this legislation gives tee mucb power to
the federal authorities.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: First, hie approved the
principle of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Vos. He expressed bis
appreval of the measure as social legislation
that in general is desirable, adding that family
allowances liad been advecated by foremost
sociolegists tbreughout the world.
H1e based bis objections te tbe measure on
four grounids. First, be said that it gives too
much pewer te the federal Government.
is
second contention was that it invades wbat be
aptly called "family autenomy."
In other
words, the Bill more or less challenges the
autherity of tbe father as the head of the family, an autbority wbicb bias been recognized
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS.

for centuries, and whicli sbould net be interfered witb, for the family is the very cernerstone of society.
The honeurable gentleman's third objection
applicd particularly te the proviso at the end
of section 3, that 'lie allowances shail h0
reduced in respect of the fiftb and every subsequent child in a family. Se far I bave net
committed myscîf -as te bow I stand with
regard te the peints raised hy my honourable
friend, but I say witbout besitation that I
join with him in objecting te tbis proviso.
That is one of tbe main reasons wby I
suggested tbat the Bill be referred te a cernmiittee for furtber examination.
I do net;
know te what cemmittee it sbould go.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: No one is objecting te
the principle of the Bill, but surely, if we bave
any powers of revision at ail, we are free te
modify certain clauses.
The fourth and hast objection voiced by my
bonourable friend fromn Grandville was miucb
te, the same effect as that expressed by tbe
bonourable acting leader on bis side of the
House (Hon. Mr. Haig) : that tbe Bill is a
dangerous invasion of provincial prerogatives.
For the accommodation of my Englisbspeaking friends in this House I have made
tbis brief summnary of the excellent speech
delivered by the honourable gentleman frein
Grandville.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thank yeu.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I wisb I could translate aIse bis magnificent peroratien, wberein
ho argîîed that no Canadýian family sbould ho
despiscd or discriminated against fer the terrible crime ef being large in number. I need
hardly say that I sbare bis views in this
respect tee. If I migbt ho allowed a personal
remark. 1 would suggest that, if every head, of
a family in Ontario fellowed my example, this
province wouhd soon challenge Quebee's birth
rate.
The remarks of the bonourable gentleman
from Levis (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) and of
the honeurable gentleman from Peterborough
West ('Hen. Mr. Duffus) go te show that there,
is general agreement as te the desirahility and
eppertuneness of sucb legishation.
But the
differences of opinion as te some sections in
the Bill are sircb as te justify thorougb study
of tbem in eommittee.
We must neot lose sigbt of the fact that
this measure is the first move in a new directien. The hegislation is in the experimental
stage, and will of course ho improved as time
gees on. Experience will show the need for

AUGUST 4, 1944
modifying various clauses to meet changing
conditions. I think we should start rigbt away
to examine the Bill in the light ef the objections raised this afternoon, to study it conscientiously and dispassionately, to weigh the
pros and cons, to try to differentiate the good
features from Vhe bad, and make it as
acceptable as possible before reporting it back
to the House.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

CANADIAN BROADCASTING BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 179, an Act to amend the Canadian
Broadcasting Act, 1936.
He said: Honourable senators, the explanatien of this Bill is very brief. Heretofore the
Chairman of the Board of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation has been paid an
honorariumn of $1,500 per annum. A committee of the other House recommended the
appointment of a permanent chairman, to be
selected by the Governor in Council, and that

399

be be paid an annual salary and be required to
devote bis who]e time to the performance of
bis duties under the Act. I believe tbat those
who have studied the organization of C.B.C.
are in substantial agreement that the chairman should devote himself exclusively to bis
officiai duties.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I arn in entire accord witb the purpose
of this Bill. I believe it is advisable that the
chairman should devote his whoie time to the
duties of hîs office.
I have always questioned the wisdom of
placing private broadcasting stations under the
control of the C.B.C. I think they should be
an independent organization.
Hon. Mr. KING: You mean an organization
separate from the C.B.C.?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, a separate organhzatien. The Good Book tells us that you
cannot serve two masters, and I think that
maxim applies here. Neither an individual
nor an organization can deal with opposing
interests without favouring one to the prejudice of the other. I hold no brief for the
newspapers or other advertising mediums, but
I believe the advertising policy of the C.B.C.
bas gone far beyond wbat was contemplated
at its inception. To-day C.B.C.'s income from
advertising is three times as much as it was
when the decision was made to requiré owners
of radio sets to pay an annual licence fee.
With its greatly increased revenue from
advertising, I should not think the corporation would need the income it derives from
licence fees.
Hon. Mr. KING: The system is growing
ail the time, and this growth entails larger
expenditures.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know; but when the
C.B.C. was organized the income from advertising was estimated at $500,000. Now it is
close to $1,500,000.
Hon. Mr. KING: I think it is more.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Probably it is. I arn
raising this question now because ultimately it
will have to be settled. If the Corporation is
to remain in control of private broadcasting
stations, it will do its utmost to ensure
the success of its own stations, and ini the
process tbe private stations will be driven. out
of business. While of course this question is
not perinent to the Bill, it -is one of policy
wbich the fuli-time chairman will have ample
opportunity to deal with; and undoubtedly
he will have to iron it out.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
Bill ho read the third time?
Hon. Mr. KING: Now, if there is no
obection.
Hon. Mr. PATTERSON: Honourable senators, I should like to see this Bill referred to

those in charge of the C.B.C., and to bring up
somne of the points raised here hy the honourable scnator opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Hon. Mr. KING: I have no objection to
the Bill going to Committee, and would move
that it he referred to the Standing Commlttee
on Banking and Commerce.
Thc motion was agreed to.
MONTREAL TRAMWAYS STRIKE
QUESTION 0F URGENT PUBLIC IMPORTANCE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I take the opportunity of rising on
the Orders of the Day to speak briefly on a
matter of great national importance and
urgency. I refer to the tramways strike in the
eity of Montreal, now in its fifth day, whereby
ail the tram-cars and buses have heen brought
to a standstill.
The issue, as honourable senators know, is
on the question of union memhership. I
understand that the name of the union
involved is the Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Emphoyees and Othcr Transport Workers,
otherwise known as the C.B.R.E. The members of this union insist that the company shahl
employ oniy persons who behong to their
union, and that new employees, unhess they
join the union within thirty days, shahl be
discharged by the company.
It seems almost incredible that Montreal
should now ho suffering its third tramway
strike within seventeen months. When the
strike was brought on hast winter Montreal
was exporiencing about the most severe
weather it had ever known, and the people
suffered intensehy from the cold while en-

deavouring to get to their work. Now weather
conditions are reversed, and we have heen
enduring extreme he:at. Last week it was pitifui to sec men and women walking along the
streets, carrying their coats, in a temperaturo
of 90 or 91 degrees, comhined with excessive
humidity.
The honourable the Minister of Labour
made a proposai to refer hoth the Quebec

labour iaw and the federal labour code to the
Supreme

Court, and the tramways company

Hon. Mr. HAIG.

agreed to accept the findings of that court.
The union ohjected, however, and the stri.ke
is continuing.

Many employees of the tramways company
are members of the Catholie Syndicate or of
the A.F. of L. But the Canadian Brotherhood

of Raiiway Employees and Other Transport
Workers say to these employees: "If you
want to hohd your job here you must behong

to our union and none other."
Labour disputes are always difficult to
handle and to solve, and I realize Vhe difficultics that confront the. Minister and the Government. But I wa-nt to imýpress upon the
Minister-and I hope ho will carry my words

to his colleagues-that the spirit in Montreal
is rising against thuis union, because the people
'have no transportation of any kind.
The most serjous consequence of the strike is
that the ahsenteeisma whýidh necessarily results
from lack of transportation is causing dangerous delay in the output of our war industries.
While on various fields of battle our brave
relatives are fighting and shedding their blood
for justice and freedoma for ail, these four
thousand tramways men sit comfortably in
their homes and prcticahly say: "This is no
concern of o>urs."-at heast, that inference can

ho drawn froým their conduet.

In the mecan-

time the -,var plants are left to do the hest
they caa to get their employees to and from.
tvork with trucks and other conveyances; but
by far most of the people are forced to walk.
I respectfulhy suhmit two suggestions to my
good friend the honourable the leader of this
House. I think the time has arrived when the
Go-vernment should ýcaîl the strike off, order
these wvorkers back to tlheir jobs, and refer
the inatter at issue to the Supreme Court of
Canada for decision. As I said in my opening
remarks, the offer of a reference to the
Supreme Court has heem refused by the union.
If they refuse to ohey a Government order to
go hack to work and get the tramwvays and
buses in operation again, it seems to me the
only course for the Government to foilow is to
put the Army in charge. I know it would be
difficuit, to operate the tramears in that way.
hut operation of the buses would ho a simple
matter. I reahze that my second suggestion is
a very drastic one, but I notice that in
Phihadeîphia, where there was a strike, the
military were put in charge and the strike has
been calhled ýoff. I arn under the impression
that if the Govern.ment orders the employees
hack to work, pending a decision hy the
Supreme Court, they will ýobey. If they do
flot, haw and order must ho preserved. There
are civil rights that -have to he, protected. and,
what is more important, no aggregation of mon
or no union can ho allowed to defy the authority of is Mai esty's Goverament in Canada.

AUGUST 7, 1944
As I intimated a moment ago, the citizens of
Montreal are in a very bad temper just now.
Before resuming my seat I would urge the
Minister to adopt one or other of the suggestions that I have just put forward in all good
faith, for unless one of these courses -is foll.owed I cannot see any possibility of the strike
being settled. The Government, I am sure,
is just as anxious as the citizens of Montreal
are that the tramway service be resumed at the
earliest possible date.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
think everyone understands the seriousness of
the situation caused by the strike of tramway
workers in the great eity of Montreal. As my
gcod friend opposite has indicated, this is the
third strike on Montreal tramways within the
last seventeen months. In ordinary times
matters of this character come within provincial jurisdiction, but in time of war the federal
Government assumes larger responsibilities
with regard to labour. A labour code was
drawn up under wartime regulations and has
been, I believe, generally accepted by the
provinces as well -as by labour and management throughout Canada.
As my honourable friend stated, the
Canadian Brotherhood of Railway Employees
is the bargaining agent for the Montreal Tramway employees. If I remember correctly, it has
been so declared by the Labour Board. As he
also stated, among the employees are members
of other labour unions. The bargaining union
has taken the position that every person employed by the company must be a member of
that union, or become one within thirty days
after starting to work for the company. That
would make a closed shop, with one union
controlling all employees on the Montreal
tramways. There were other difficulties, but
I understand these have been fairly well
ironed out, and the only issue remaining is the
one under discussion.
The company has been advised through its
solicitor that the strike is illegal, and that
acceptance of the proposal for a closed shop
would be an illegal act.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

the Supreme Court whether we are right."
That is the position to-day. There were conferences here yesterday between the management and employees in regard to that point.
Quebec also has a new labour law, but I
understand that in the present instance it
would be overridden by the war labour code.
The Quebec labour law would make illegal a
strike on a public utility such as the Montreal
tramways. The Dominion regulations have not
gone so far.

Honourable members know how serious the
strike in Montreal is at this time; the city is
a centre of very large war industries highly
important to the fighting services in Europe,
and disputes between management and labour
should be adjusted by conference or by reference. There certainly should be no stoppage
of work. That view, I am sure, would appeal
to the majority of our Canadian people as
sound and reasonable. It is hoped that the
employees of the Montreal tramways will see
the force of that view and appreciate their
responsibilities, not only to their union, but to
the people of Canada and the men who are
fighting overseas for our welfare and safety.
I cannot go farther. I am glad that my
honourable friend has drawn attention to the
seriousness of the situation in Montreal. I
will see that his remarks are conveyed to the
Minister and to the Government.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Would the
honourable leader not admit that the Government has the authority to order all the
employees back? The Government could do
that under the War Measures Act, if in no
other way.
Hon. Mr. KING: Wide powers are given by
the War Measures Act, and though I would
not speak definitely, I am satisfied that if the
Covernment wished to take such action under
that Act, it could do so.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
3 p.m.
THE SENATE

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. KING: The matter has been discussed with the Minister of Labour and officials
of the Department. The Department has
offered to make a reference to the Supreme
Court of Canada as to the legality of the
strike; it indicated that a decision could be
secured within sixty days, and suggested that
in the meantime the men should go back to
work. The company is willing to accept that
offer, but the men have said; "Accept our
contention now, and later let it be decided by

before this flouse shall be given the consideration which their importance dernands.
If
tîtat is done, the Senate cannot possibly, aýdjourn on Sat.urday. The foliowing Bis have
flot yet reached this Chamber: the National
Housing Bili, providing for an expenditure of
$275,000,000; the soldiers' rehabilitation measiîre, the Bank Biii, which extends the banks'
charters; the Industriai Deveiopment Bank
Bill and the Bill providing for intermedýiate
*termas
and short terra eredit to farmers.
Ail these Bis are of the greatest importance. I understand that neither the Bank
Bill nor the Industrial Deveioprnent Bank Biii
hias yet been, reported from the Banking and
Commerce Coinmittce of the Commons. This
House wiil need t.o devote a great deai of
time and study to ail the Bis I have mentioned, and, in particular to the Industriai
Development Bank Bill.
Ever since Confederation the Senate of
Canada bias been noted for its thorougb and
careful consideration of Bis. I wish to serve
notice on my good friend the honourahie
leader of this flouse (Hon. Mr. King) that I
and those wbo are associated with me intend
to stay here and take the necessary -time to
consider fully the Bills I have narned and any
other measures that may corne before us. 1
therefore see no possibility whatever of ýthis
flouse adjourning on Saturday.

Hon. Mr. KING: Honourabie senators, we
quite appreciate what my honourable friend
lias stated. What is happening now is not new.
The Senate to-day is prohabiy as weii informed
on the legisiative programme as it lias ever
106-27J

been. Our- practice, adop-ted in recent. years,
of discussing Burdget resolutions and other
mnatters pertaining P. war finance in the Stand-

ing Commit tee on Finance, prior to the receipt
of the Bis from the House of Commons, hias
been of materiai advantage to this Chamber,
Thiese Budget resolutions have been before
our Finance Committee for corne time. When
the Bills based on the resolutions reach this
bouse bonourabie members wili have ample
opportunity to. discuss tbern. The work of our
committee hias kept honourable senators fuiiy
inforined of the character of tbe legisiatioýn,
and this in turn will tend to expedite progress
.when the measures corne before us for review.
The flrst Order of the Day in the other
House i.s "Receiving reports of the Committee
of Siipply"-in other words, Estimates. As
hionourable members are aware, the Estimates aiways reach us in the iast days of the
session and as a rule we do not question them.
The second and tbird Orders also relate to
sncb financial matters as are ucual at this
stage of the session.
The fourth Order covers the committee
stage of the Bill respeeting Banks and Bankiog,
conimonly known as the Bank Bili. This Biil,
of course, deals with the decennial revision of
the Bank Act under which bank charters are
renewed for another ten yearc. In corne
quarters it is cnrnplained that the revision
should be more frequent. That, of course, is
a matter of opinion. Prohabiy Canada is the
only country that requires its commercial
banks to corne before Parliament every ten
years for the renewal of tbeir charters. A
committee of the other flouse devoted about
fortvy-nine sittings to consideration of the Bill,
and amended it in certain particuicrs. We
-hall bave an opportunity of discussing it
here and also in our Banking and Commerce
Committee. The measure contains nothingvery new or very startiing, and I cannot conceive that this Chamber wiil rejeet it,
The next Order is tbe Industrial Development Bank Biii. When this Bill reacbes us I
intend to ask tbat it bie referred to our Banking and Commerce Committee, wbere honourable senators wili have full opportunity for
discussion and where the publie may appear
and make representations for or againct the
measure.
Then the other flouse bias under consideration a rneasure which I am sure wili meet with
the approvai of this Chamber. It is described
as an Act to encourage the provision of intermediate terni and short terni oredit to.

says: "Wel. you have gleancd a lot of information here and there; there wiil be a certain
amount of debate in this Bouse; but why,
after having absorbed ail the information
already at yuur disposai and hearing what is
yet to be said, shouid much time be spent

on this legisiation?"
Hon. Mr. KING: 1 did not say that.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: "Why not let it
go through?"
I object to honourable members of this
Bouse, Who are men of great experience and
capacity, being asked to pass such measures
without first having an opportunity to consider them, properly. In another place they
have been discussed for weeks. Before I
resume my seat, I desire to say that I cannot
see how by Saturday it will be possible for
our Committee to give these measures--particularly the Industrial Development Bank
Bill-the consideration they deserve. We want
to consider these matters in committee and
express our opinions in this Bouse. We do
flot want to base our action upon what bas
been done in another place, what we have read
in the press, or what may have been mentioned
in the Speech from. the Throne. We have in

to consider these measures in Committee and
to express our views upon them in this Bouse

people, and the little village grows into a
thriving city. I venture to offer the daring
suggestion that even though depositors may
have lest their money in some of those banks,
in the end those very depositors derived indirectly frorn business developrnent more benefit tîran they would have derived directly if the
hanks had kept their money secure. We are
sornetirnes told that ocr banking systerun is
suhîcrier te that in tIre lUited States. WVill
sonr one tell mie. then, wliv we have to pay
$110 or 3111 to gct $100 cf Arnerican ronouy

The banks introduced a systern of lending
moncy to prefessienal men and others who
were able to give notes signed by endorsers,
and even wvent se, far as to advertise in the
newspapers for borrowers. But no compensation at ail was paid to an endorser, evea
though in some instances the bank made 9
per cent on the transaction. If the horrower
could net pay when the tirne came to settle,
the endorser was told that hoe should net have
endorsed the note.
At one period in Western Canada a large
number of men suffered because of lack of
judgment on the part of bankers. When cattle
were sclliag at 8 cents a poîînd the banks
w~rote letters te everyene who had any security te offer. suggesting that they borrow rneney
and buy cattie.
With the knowledge that
thiese large financial institutions are supposced
te posseas, they should have knowa the price
wveuld soon drop. It dropped te 4 cents, and
as a rosuit many men lest everything they
had; but the haaks had their boans well
secuired. and they were eut scarcelv a dollar.
When the depression came, successful farmers
with an experience of twenty-five years and
-a geed reputatien for honesty-mca who
owned buildings wvorth twelve te flfteen thonsand dollars, and land that is now producing
theu-and.s of dellars profit- could( net berrew

told this te the bank president he said, "Is it
a fact?" I said, "Yes." The head of thc Land
Deparîrnent of tOc Canadian National Railways told me that a section of land which had
been a burden on them for years had in the
past five years produced crops te, the value
of $11.000 and had th.en been sold fer $16.000

Hou. NORMAN MeL. PATERSON: May
I ask the heneurable senater if credit lu
Western Canada xvas net ruined hy the farmers
asking for a moratorium and taking advaatage
of the Farmers' Crediters Arrangement Act?
Heu. Mr. HORNER: If rny memery serves
me right, tOc banks absolutely quit before
the Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Art came
luto for-ce. I grant yen that tOc Act did a

AUGUST 10, 1944
great deal to destroy confidence, but that
situation, at ail events in the province of
Saskatchewan, was brought about by reason
of the Act being administered in a way in
which it should flot have been administered.
The banks did flot suifer a great deal, but
their attitude to borrowers was a crime. If
the banks had advanced money when the
farmers needed it, those farmers would neyer
have had to take advantage of the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act. I know maniy
cases where the batiks settled a man~s account
of two or three thousand dollars for a thousand
dollars, and where that saine man to-day has
$6,000 on deposit. There was no occasion for
the batiks to take the attitude they did. They
were partly responsible .for the Farmers'
Creditors Arrangement Act.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON - I ýmight reply to
the honourable senator by saying that I arn
flot a shareholder nor amn I connected with
our chartered batiks in any way, but over a
period of thirty-four years in business my
experience of our banking systemn has been
most satisfactory.- About a year ago when
one of my ships went ashore off Cuba it was
very gratifying to me Vo be able, to borrow
from one of our prominent banks the money
necessary to, get lier afloat and on ber voyage
aga.in. I think our chartered banks deserve
a great deal of credit for their initiative in
establisghing branches and introducing our
financial systemi in foreign countries, because
tbis has been a great stimulus to our'foreign
trade. I qhould like to endorse everything
that bas been said in commendation of our
chartered banks.
Hon. P. R. DuTREMBLAY: Honourable
senators, much can be said in favour of our
banking system. During the depression we
were proud that none of our batiks closed
their doors, while in the United States the
number of bank, failures was appalling. There
is no doubt that our chartered banks are well
conducted and neyer fail to pass the strict
investigation made by the inspectors of the
Department of Finance. Altbough we have
not so many individual batiks as they have in
the United States, our chartered batiks have
branches ail over the country to. serve local
needs. In this way tbey have rendered a very
valuable national service, and in the years to
corne we sbould be very careful to do nothing
to undermine confidence in or banking system.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourabie senators, I did not intend to say anything on this
Bill ontil it had been referred to the Banking
and Commerce Committee, but 1 ýthink it weil
to refer to the remarks of my honoorable
frietid from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr.
Horner). I live pretty close to his province
106-28

atid ktiow a good deal about it. There is only
one charge that cati be made against our chartered banks--tbey have always lent too. much
money rather than too little.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Always. In Saskatchewan
alone between 1920 and 1936 the batiks Iost
$8,000,000.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: They did not need
to lose that; they got frightened.
Hoti. Mr. HAIG: Tbey lost that $8,000,000
in Saskatchewan. We in Manitoba started
local credit societies, of which my honourable
frietid approves. We also started a savings
batik. We lent the depositors' money on farm
lands, and also in live stock, machitiery, and
things of that kind. We lost two atid a haîf
million dollars on live stock and atiother
million dollars in trying to collect the loans.
We got our capital back on the farm loatis,
but we lest the interest.
Suppose I want to boy a liaîf section of
latid and go to a batik atid say I should like
to have a boan for that purpose. The, manager
would discuss it atid then ay: "Well, Mr.
Haig, that is a very fine scbeme, but, honestly,
that is a proposition not for a batik, but for a
boan compatiy, on a long-term basis." Matiy
of our farmei's have resented the fact ýthat
the batiks would not make them long-term
boans to buy land, adjoining their farms. It
was no use for a farmer Vo tell the bank
manager, "I will pay it back this faîl." True,
ýthis year some farmers will be able to pay the
cost of their farms out of oe crop, but that
is not generally the case.
When President Roosevelt came into office
banking conditions in the United States were
appalling. I amn surprised to hear my honourable friand praise the local banks in the
Uniited States. A local batik may ba a good
institution in a district where thare is cotisiderable crop diversification, so that if one crop
fails there is anothar to take its place; but in
the prairie country the backbone of or prosperity by and large is one crop-wheat. True,
we raise cattle and hogs, and grow barley, oats,
fiax and corn; but the great basic crop is
whaat, and when it fails there is absolutely
nothing to take its place. That is why in
connection with the incomne tax I have urgedand I amn going to urge again-that a five-year
average sbould be the basis on which a
farmîer's incoma is taxed.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is provided for
in the ametidment.

AUGUST
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, yes, you could tel]
me that they went in and bought eut seme
other banker. But that is only a detail.
The fact is that the banking business of
Canada bas been conducted on a, souind basis,
,and I arn in favour of the systema that
exists. One bank is now making personal boans
up to $150-and it does not charge an excessive rate of interest.
Furthermore, the
banks of this country have done a tremendous amo-int of work for the Gorerumnent, for
which they have received no recompense at ail.
It bas been suggested that the Govornment
could get ail the money it required for nothing, simply by issuing paper. 0f course it could,
but that wouid mean inflation. We are borrowing close to three billions frorn the people
this year by way of bonds. I have seldom
heard a more able speech than was delivered
by the Finance Minister three days ago when
hie said that we were fortunate in having
the banks carrying on the business of the
country.
I arn strongly in favour of the Bill.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
scuators, I shaîl bo very brief. I arn nut as
fortunate as the honourable senator who bas
just sat down (Hon. Mr. Haig), who said hoe
did net owo the banks a cent. Spea.king as
une w-ho owes them a lot of money, I want
to say that I heartily approvo of the Bill and
endorse everything that bas heen said about it
by the leaders on both sides of the House.
My real purpose in rising is te say that
in my opinion the peuple of Canada owe a
debt of gratitude to the Committee members
in another place who, for about flfty days, sat,
and patiently listened to people propounding
schers about what 1 cal], "funny meney"sehemes which few of us understand. I
attended several meetings of the Huse of
Commons Committee, and I confess that I was
confused. But when a measure is put before
another House of this Parliarnent and is passed
by a vote of 84 te 6, nu eue can tell me that
the 84 are wrong and the 6 are right.
1 hieartily agree with t.he honourable Leader
opposite that the banks of this country have
been welI run. and that the peuple and the
small business mon of the country have confidence iu the banks. While thîs may net be
the time to discuss the Industrial Bank Bill,
like the henourable senator opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dallantyne) 1 arn puzzled to knuw why we
need an industrial hank at this time. The
small business man is properly and decently
and honestly treated by the banks of this
country.

Yesterday nfternoon, w-hon the Bill w-as

Diii held over uintil suîîb lime as the Dominion

would likely take place in the early faîl, so
there w-ould be ample time te have tbe Biii
considoed hy the conference before the date
on w-iich the Covernment has stated the Biii
w-ill comte into offeet. I furibor stressed thc
importance of delay, -:tating that w-bile I was
flot in t1e confidence cf tho (}ovcrniment, and
lion. Mr. RING.

of course did( flot know wlîcther or flot another
session of Parliament wvould ho held hofore
the general elect ion, there was a possibility of
siich a session, and, therefore, if the Bill. was
withhioid until the proposed conference between
the Dominion and Provincial Prime Ministers,
it couid be considered and possibly passed at
that next session. 1 al-.o pointed out in plain
t ernîs that the moncy rrquired to pay the
total cc-t of this Bih -amiounting to somne 200
million dollars or mort-would bc raiscd by
ineans of t axes from ail the provines, and thiat
t licrefore i t w ïs onlv jîî- ami right that the
provinces sbouid ho brouglit into consultation.
If this were flot donc. it woulid be a repotition
of nn hii.storie, event of the 1 îasttaxation
w ithout consultat ion.
If this Bill is put into effect, Ontario's share
of the taxation will arnount to 100 million
dollars. Last night Premier Drew made a
very sig-nificant statement whien hie said in a
wide broadcast Iliat his Goveroment intends to
rde "everything within its powcr" to sec that
the recently passed Family Ailowanccs Biii

Mr. Brooke Ciaxton, Pailiamentary AFsistant ho tue Prime Minister, wben explaining
the Bill 10 tue Danking and Commerce Comnmittcc of the Senate yesterday, stressed. over

AUGUST 10, 1944
and over agýain the necessity of friendly
co-operation with the provinces, pointing out
that they had so many agencies already dealing
with mothers allowances and other welfare
schemes that co-operation would mean not
only greater efficiency but, greateT econurny.
Hon. ARTHIUR MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, 1 wish to make a few remarks
on this Bill before' it becomes law. I have
listencd to what bas been eloquently said in
faveur of the principle of the measure. I
agree that the time bas corne for the giving
of assistance to large familles ani needy
oidren. But rny approval stops there.
The only allusion to the lcgality of this
measure wvas rnade by the honourable senator
from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin) in just
one sentence. He said:
T1hie Bill in its present forrn is eertainly
constitutional.

But he continues:
Like many others, 1 would muchel prefer a
provincial systern of family allowances, because
sacb a systern would adapt itself more satisfaetorily to the local needs and institutions of
each of our provinces. This is also truc of any
other branch of social legislation. 1 arn not
speaking now in favour of transferring to
Ottawa ahi our provincial rights in such an
important matter.
In cornmittee, I heard the statement made
and repeated, that because the federal Governiment is supplying aIl the moneys to be
disbursed the Bill is intra vires. I cannot
agree with that point of view. That the
federal Governrnent has the legal authority
to raise rnoney through taxation, and to make
a gift of it to the provinces or to individuals,
there is no doubt; but, as 1 shall try to prove,
it has no power to distribute that money by
invading provincial. jurisdiction.
The honourable leader of the Gove'rnment
(Hon. Mr. King) tabled legal opinions on this
measure. These opinions were reproduced in
the House of Commons Hansard of July 21,
and with your permission I shall refer to tbern
in rnaking my argument.
The letters, opinions and citations are dated
quite a few years ago and refer to the Old
Age Pensions Act. It was on account of the
analogy between that Act and the present
measure that these opinions were tabled first
by the Minister of Justice in another place
and by the honourable leader of the Government in this Chamber.
Honourable senators are familiar 'with sections 91 and 92 of the British North Arnerica
Act, which detail the powers specially given
the federal and provincial authorities. Section 92 enumerates the powers of the provinces.
Included under subsection 7, are powers

413

regarding the establishment and maintenance
of-arnong other institutions--asylums and
charitable institutions in and for the province;
and under subsection 13, property and( civil
rights in the province. Under subsection 14
cachi province is given control of the administration of justice in the province, including
the constitution, maintenance and organization
of provincial courts, both uf civil and of crirninal jurisdiction, and pi'ocedure in civil matters in those courts. There is nothing doubtfnil about that. Famihy relations, and the
maintenance, training and edurcation of childreil
are certainly civil rights. Sebiool laws and
regulations under them are ýýtrictly prov incial
matters. There is no doubt about that, cither.
Let us procced. The first opinion given is
taken fromn a letter by Mr. Edwards, then
Deputy Mii..rpr o-f JTustice. This hetter is
datcd May 23, 1925, and reads as follows:
Dear Sir:
Referring to your letter o<fthe l2th instant,
asking to be advised with regard to the
authority of Parliament te, lcgishate on the
subject of nid age pensions, I may say týhat
this suhject does not fail specificalhy within
aity of the enurnerated subjects given to the
Dominion under section 91 of the British -North
Arnerica Act, but does in my judgmeut faull
witbin the subject "prnperty and civ il riglits
in the province," cornmitted to the provinces
under section 92. I arn of opinion thereforethat the subject matter of pensions lias 1)000
entrusted to the provincial hegislatures rather
than to, Parliament. I do nt mean to suggest
that Parliament has flot the power ta hegislate
upon the subjeet so as tu assist the provinces
or to establish an independent vohnntary sehemne,
provided that io either case the hegishation does
net trench upon the subjeet matter of property
and civil rights in the provinces, as for exaînphe
by obligating any province or person ýto contribute ta thbe scbeme.
I shahl corne to this point later on,
The enactmrent o'f such hegislation would, hîow-ever, involve fthc assumrption by the Dominion
of obligations involving beavy expenditures wvith
regard to a matter which does not fahi specificahly within the Domninion filhd of legishation.
From that it follows that the federal Parliament cannot trench upon the matter of
civil rights.
But it bas heen stated that because the
federal Parliament is supplying the whole
fund, without asking for any contribution
frorn the province, this Bill is within federal
jurisdiction. If the money is to be used to
assist the provinces, 1 should say "Yes;" if it
is to be given to individuals, I should say
"Yes;" but if the provisions of this Bill and
the regulations under it trench upon civil
rights, 1 say "N'o."
Among the opinions quoted was this statement by Lord Atkin of the Privy Counc il:

AUGUST 10, 1944
in favour of the principie of this Bill. But
he knows as weli as I do that the best way
to kili the Bill and ta deprive the chiidren,
of Canada of their rights under it is ta do
the very thing he now suggests.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Why?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: H1e wants this
measure ta be referred to the DominionProvincial Conference. I couid well understand my honourabie friend's suggesting that
yesterday; but for him to suggest it to-day,
after Premier Drew bas said that he opposes
the whole principie of the Biii and bitterly
contests it, is something thatHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do not want
to interrupt rny honourable friend, but sureiy
he wiil he fair. Before the comrnittee yesterday I strcssed over and over again, and so
did Mr. Brooke Ciaxton, the necessity of
having the co-operation of the provinces in
regard ta the frinctioning of the Bill, and the
using of ail the various provincial agencies.
I said that, inasmuch as the Government bas
not asked any provincial Prime Minister or
officiai what he thinks of the Bill, it would be
unfortunate if it met hostile provincial
Governm'ents. Therefore I urged delay until
the premiers met, after which the Bill couid
be managed flot oniy more eeonornîcally but
much more efliciently. I have said to-day
exactly what i said yesterday.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is just what
I objeet to, because my honourabie friend did
flot know vesterday what he knows to-daythat if this matter is referred to the DominionProvincial Conference Premier Drew will kili
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How can he kiil the Bill?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My honourabie
friend referred to the appearance of the Pariiamentary Assistant before our comrnittee
yesterday afternoon. As he weil knows, the
Parliarnentary Assistant made it clear that if
the Bili is ta corne into efféct as eariy as
July 1, 1945, as one of its terrns expressly
states, it wiii have ta be passed now. The
reason is that a great deal of cornpiicated
machinery may have ta be set up in arder to
bring the iaw inta operatian, and that may
require at ieast six months' preparation. That
is another reason why I abject most strongiy
ta the suggestion that the Bill shouid be heid
over pending a Daminion-Provineiai Conference, the date af whîch we do nat know.
Not aniy do we nat knaw when iît wili be
beid, but we do not, know when, after it is
heid, Parliarnent wiil meet again and the Bill
be passed. What my honaurable friend is

410

suggesting, in effeet, is that the Bill do not
corne into force on the lst of July, 1945, and
to thât I arn absolutely opposed.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Absolutely not.
My honourable friend shauid be fair. I will
flot stand for any such accusation as t.hat. It
is absolutely inaccurate. I shouid like to use
a stronger word, but I will not.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I ar n ot suggesting
that my honourabie friend is deiiberateiy
ta.king that attitude. But I d'o subrn'it that
the resuit, of his attitude would be exactly
what 1 said, that the Bill would not corne into
force on the first of Juiy next.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I do not think it will
anyway. It was neyer intended to.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: We heaid something this afternoon fron rny honourable
friend about the Premier of Ontario. It
appears that yesterday evening the Premier
gave a radio address, in the course of which
he stated that his Governrnent would do
everything within its power to sce that the
Family Allowances Bill does not go into
effeet. H1e addcd:
It is flot thi-9 Bill alone, but the w"hoie
prineipie inv'olved, which we intend to resist.
I take it that my honourable friend dîsagrees
with that statement and agrees with the
principie of this Bill. The Premier is said to
be an ambitinus man.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: If my honourable friend wishes to deive into other people's
minds, he is perfectly welcorne to do so.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Perhaps my honourable friend will ailow me to guess what is in
the mind of the Premier of Ontario. I will go
further. I can tell what is in bis mind frorn
what he has said in public. I do not know
very rnuch about hlm, except that, as I say, he
bas the reputatian of being an ambitious
manHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: And an able
man.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: -and rumour had
it a week or two ago that he was anxious to
supplant Mr. Bracken as the federal leader
of the Progressive Conservative party.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: H1e bas denied that.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That was denied?
Hon. Mr. HAIG- Certainly, by hlm.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: In reading the
speech of Premier Drew I was interested to
sce the very wide scope he took. In addition
to saying a good deal against the province of
Quebec, he went out of his way to compliment,

SENATE
in turn, everv other province of the Dominion.
11e even went so far as to say that the people
of Ontario were delighted that they had been
able ta contribute to the cost of car ferries ta
Prince Edward Island. Sa I take it that even
if he does nlot wish ta suppiant Mr.-Bracken
as leader of the Progressive Conservative party,
at least he considers himself a national figure,
with the right te, appeai ta every one of the
provinces in turil.

after the election? Is that the difficulty?
Hon. Mr. MýOLLOY:

No, no.

Hon. Mr. QUINN:. It smacks of something
like that.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: There is nothing to
be feared from that side.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: You cannot tell me that.
I ask: Are honourable senators opposite afraid
of being defeated? 1 think there is considerable fear of that.
I had flot intended to speak on this Bill
at ail, but the argument in this Chamber has
been such that I have now made up my
mind to oppose the Bill.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, 1 have heen waiting for two or tliree
years to place something on the records of
the House, and I think that this is a splendid
opportunity to do it. I have before me a
copy of the Ottawa Morning Journal, containing an article the headlines of which read:
Drew to try block family allowances.
Quebec shouldn't get preferred treatment
while refusing to bear full burden.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That is stili to be
proved.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The article says:
Drew termed the family allowances bill an
"obvions bribe" and said "there was every
reason why this measure sliould ineet with
approval" in Quebec where there was "a very
important eleetion approaching." Millions of
dollars from the pockets of the peo.ple of
Ontario %vould go to the province of uebec
un&er the measure, the premier added.
He said the people of Ontario would be
asked to pay nearly bahf of the $200,000,000
whic'h would be needed as the initia] amount
ta put the family allowance act into effeet.«

Now, from w.here and how did this
$100.000,000 come into the pockets or the
hands of those who will be asked to pay it
by way of taxation into this particular procet? It camne from. past protectionist poli(qes that maintained brown-stone fronts and
big gardens, while poor working men were
placed on pcnsion wben they werc no longer
able to work.
Hon. Mr. HOPuNER: Order!
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
number of millionairesSome Hon. SENATORS:

A considerable
Order!

Hon. Mr. MURDýOCK: We have on the
corner of York and King streets in the city of
Toronto an enormous building. How was it
-built? From the mining revenues that came
to certain individuals.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Newspaper publishers.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: And Mr. Drew
objects to any of the taxes of those- muimilhionaires going towards putting shoes on
the feet or bread and milk into the stomaclis
of dependent children in Quebcc and other
provinces.

Now, here is what I have been wanting to
get on the record for a number of years. Who
is this man Drew, and what is bis judgment?
Let us, see. On February 11, 1938, Colonel
George A. Drew addressed a meeting in
Dominion United Church, Ottawa. The tit-le
of lis address was, "Communism comes to
Canada." The next day botb the Ottawa
Journal and the -Citizen carried somne reference
to the Colonel's remarks of the previous evening, and in the light of the education that lias
come to the world during recent months as
ýo the unity, loyalty and democratic fighting
spirit of the Russian people, one cannot lielp
wondering whether in February, 1938, tlie
gentleman who is now the distinguisbed leader
of the Government in Ontario was flot somewhat mistaken, and perhaps unduly biased in
some of the views lie held. Unquestionably in
1938 Colonel Drew did not expect that soon
lie would he reading the reports of the wonderful achievements of the Russian people that
have come to us during the past several
montlis.
The lieading I have read gives yau an indication of what Colonel Drew was talking about.
Incidentally I was at the Dominion United
Churcli on the occasion in question.

to-day there wvas at 0ne tirne a eornrunistic
govertiment or communistjc daiiLer. As stronglýy
opposed to Fascjsm as I was to Commoinisrn,"
the speaker declared, "I saw nowhere in
Gerrnany such bad conditions as exist in
Iliussia." In his visit to the Soviet Union hie
saw much poverty and oppression, with higli
living prices and wasteful expenditîîre as well
as a wide range of wages.
That is the gentleman wbo gets front page
notoriety in the Ottawa Journal to-day for
saying that lie will try to block this Family
Allowanees Bill. Whom is lie working for?
lie is working for the dyed-in-the-wool Tories
who have been trying to exploit the people of
Canada for many years. Those Tories bave
been mnaking their millions, but lie objeets to
a law that would dig into their poekets and
give out any of their millions to supply
cblîdren ivith bread. milk, and shoes. That
is the man we hav e before us to-day.

It bas been argued by somne honourable
gentlemen opposite that this measure sbould
be postponed util the Interprox incial Conference. That is only an indication of their
sincere hope that something will be hield up
and a general election come along before the
quarrel is settled an(1 anvýthiing- arranged.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Why did it take you

Tlîe Hon. the SPEAKER: Order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: 1 arn not afraid to
bave this Bill given third reading in the
Senate and passed into law. as promised in tbe
Speech from the Throne on the 27tb of
January last. That is wbat sbould be donc.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Would the honlourable
senator permit me to ask just one question?
Did hie oppose holding the National Healtb
Bill for the Dominion-Provincial Conference?
That measure bas been considered in the

419

other place for two years and bas been lield
up until approved by the Conference. Did
bie oppose that, or would hie oppose it?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No, I did not. Tbat
is surely an entircly different matter from
this. This is a direct guarantee of $200,000,000
or $250,000,000 for the relief of needy cbildren.
Hon. P. R. DuTREMBLAY: Honouraýble
sena;tors, 1 have onîy a few remarks to make
on this very important Bill. I, am in favour
of it, but I think it sbould be improved in
seine parts, especially in this proviso at the
end of section 3:
Provided that the allowance payable shall,
in respect of a fifth ohild maintaincd by the
parent, be reduced by one dollar and in respect
of a sixth ehild and a seventh child respectively
so maintained, hy two dollars and in respect
of an eighth child and eacb additional child
respcctively so rnaintained, by tliree dollars.
I agree that wben there are seven or eight
children in a family the cost of raising the
younger ones may drop a little, but I feel that
the reductions of two dollars and three dollars
ai, provided for bere are too great: a deduetion
of one dollar would have been enough.
This is a Bill of great importance, and it
wiil benefit a large number of farnilies. I
understand there are in Canada about 350,000
families with children under sixteen years of
age. Perhaps one-thîrd of those families are
pour enough to need the assistance that the
Bill is intended to give, and therefore it seems
tc, me it sbould be passed as soon as possible.
It is because of the benefits poor families
would receive that I arn in favour of the
principle of the measure. As time goes on the
legislation could be improved in rnany ways,
eFpecially in respect of the proviso to wvhicb 1
have already referred.
It was suggested this aftcrnoon that passage
of the measure be postponed until the provincial prime ministers meet. We do noýt know
yet wben the Conference will be held. It has
been spoken of frequtint-ly, but no definite date
bas been set, and et present we canoot say
whetber the meeting wvi1l be this faîl, next
spring or next summer. But we do know that
a large igumber of families tbroughout the
country are waiting for these allowances. It is
for Parliament, flot the prime ministers of the
provinces, to decide whether the grarit is to be
made. If I understand correctiy, the provinces
will be consulted in the distribution of the
allowances, but of course tbey have nothing
to say on the question of whether Parliament
sbould or sbouid not enact this legislation. If
the prime ministers did meet. some of them
would agrce to, a certain form. of administration, wbile others might be opposed to the
whole thing. Uncertainty as to the attitude of

420

the proxvincial prime n:niters is ne reason
xxhy tbis measuro sbould ho postponed. The
responsibility rests upon Parliament. It is for
lis te decitle w'botber we sheuld make a grant
of $200,000,000 te the cbilciren of tbis country.
I am sure tlie bonourable leader on the other
sitle (Hon. Mr. Ballantyno) does net desiro
ie bis lîeart te bave this Bill dofeated. In
fact, ho sai liho was in faveur cf it, and I
knew lio woiiltl like te sec the moncy made
available te nttdy famnilies. Dees ho cet fear
that if the measure were postponed indefinitoly

next xxeck, anti befoxe we incet again there
may ho an election. I do net knew Who will
ho tîcetti. The prescent Ccx crnment btlieves
it xxill ho returned, antioccv friends opposite
hope tht ir pariy will ho returntd. At this
moment 1 amn thinking of the 350,000 families
%vbo weutltt btnefit by this Bill. They are concerued, not as te Whe ixa form the goveronitent aftî r the next t lect ion, but as te whether
tinîy are geing te gel financial aid in raising,
tht jr thilircn. Thene people do net want
ainv-ting te prexent the passage of this
incasurc. 1 aux suie it is oui, drîty te pass it
to-d'ay.
A qtuest ion was raiseti regardîng the legality
cf the mecastire. Th-at bias been thoroughly
discusseti in anotlier place. 1 baveo read the
Jebate tîtoit, and cspecially what, was said by
the Minisler of Justice, who is a groat lawyer.
Ho quoted legal opinions that bcad been given
by a former Deptity Minister cf Justice, and
other authorities. and I think, the concltusion is
that tlîis measure iiodouibtedly coin" witbin
the jiiictien of Parliamnent. Se fat as I
<'an sec, the Bill dots net infringe at aIl on the
rights givon te the provinces by orîr Constituition; therefore 1 subetit we should net
hiesitate te pass it.
I wish te say that tbe sponsor of this Bill in
anotber House--I should like te ho allowed te
namne him-ýwill hy reason of bis enligbtened
policy ho recorded in bistory as tbe groatest
henefactor of the people of tbis country.

in mind that ho bas extensive business interests

Some Hlon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: Our friends opposite
are now becoming aware that this Bil' is very
popular throughout the country, and they are
trying to find somne way of hlocking it. Their
opposition to it may be covered in five words,
each beginning with D: Drew, Delay, Deferment. Deht, Decomposition. That is whiat

1 must now ugain asic for an answer to that

Soine Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. R. B. HORNER: The lime hias passcd

for that answer.
Perbaps the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) will allow me a
few words. Before we heard that any provincial premier was opposed ta this Bill I
voiced my opposition to it. I amn stili opposed
to the measure, and I shaîl vote against it.
At a lime when the country is burdened with
taxe s, I think it is unwise ta add another
$200,000,600 t0 the iîeavy load our people are

The honourable senator from Parkdale
<Hon. Mr. Murdock) quoted a speech made
hy the Prime Miniuster of Ontario in 1938. I
venture ta say I could cite speeches along
sornewhîat sim-ilar lines made b 'y prime
ministers of Canada and other counitries. I
regret very much that hie saw fit tb' give a

Hon. M. MODLOY: -the refiection that 1

voted for this Bill wilI be more gratifying to

me than the memory of my vote on any other
measure, either in this Chamber or in the
House of Commons. XVhat happened to the
Old Age Pensions Bill mentioned by my
honourable friend? It was defeated by the
gentlemen opposite, who delayed it for a year.
What about unemployment insurance? When
a Bill was introduced to provide for such
insurance honourable members opposite said
it was a ha.d thing, that it was unconstitutional, and they spent weeks trying to destroy
it,. That Bill has proved a great benefit not
only to the working men but to the taxpayers
of this country, in that those relieved by unemployment insurance wou id ot-herwise bave
become a direct charge on the comunity.
The strongest argument ;n favour of tbis
Bill is that it may help-we hope it will,
though it should not be necessary-to bring
about a natural increase of our population.
Recently the Winnipeg Fret Press published
a series of articles-and these no doubt were
read hy my honourable colleague from that
city, one of which stated that 40 per cent
of the families of this country raised and supported but one child. Why? We know why.

Christians in tbis country say, "We wvill have

but one child." It puts me in mind of the
Arnerican system.
lion. Mr. H OR NE R: The honourable
senator bas flot answered my question as to
where hie bas found the happiest farnily.
lion. Mr. MOLLOY: liappiness is something tbat depends on the father and mother,
and on heredity and ail tbat goes witb it.
The lion. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, la it your pleasure to adopt the
motion?
lion. Mr. HORNER: On division.
lion. GUSTAVE LACASSE: lionourable
senators, may I he pernîitted to say just a
few words. I wish to cnîl attention to a few
facts whicb bave occurred to my mind. To
sum up the whoic discussion, rnay I sny tbe
mensure hefore us is eitiier good or bnd. I
take it for granted tbat it is regarded as a
gond mensure hy my honourable friends
opposite, because al] but one of thern agree to
the principle of it. I give the honourable
senator frorn Saskatchewnn North (Hlon. Mr.
liorner) credit for heing the only one on the
other side of the bouse who bas been consistent froin start to finisb, and in agreement
with

the

premier

of my

province.

I

arn

inclined to wonder what would have happened
in another place if the Premier of Ontario bad
deiivered bis speech of last night a week or
two sooner? Apparently there was a lack of
týming somewhere-an utter lack of tirning
which, though everything else was well staged,
is obvious to one and ail.
One point tbat I want to draxv attention to
particularly is what took place in tbe days
of the nId age pensions legisîntion which hias
been referred to in the course of this debate.
Nobody seems to rernember that in tbose
days there was, as there appears to be te-day,
or.e dissenting province. At that time it was
the province of Quebec. I du ont recall,

however, that the then premier of that province delivered a radio address challenging the
ideals of any other province in Canada. lie
just kept quiet, educated his people along the

liues of tbe new Act, and iu due course of
tirne, without noise or bluster, lined up with

the rest of the country, with the result that
aIl the provinces are n0w enjoying the benefits of nid age pensions without any civil war
,or threat of civil war. Perhaps some honour-

able memabers believe
orninous a tern to be
so, I will withdraw it
suggestion cornes from
hirnseif.

lie

that "civii war" la ton
used in this buse. If
irnmedintely. But thie
the Premier of Ontario

said, referring

to this fnmily

allowance proposai: "You know that we face

423

an issue here in Canada. hard]y less irnportiint"ý-that also is an orninous expression-" 10
its bearing upon our future than the outeorne
of the war itself." Those are just as orninous
words as the ones 1 uttered, and they are the
inspiration of what 1 sai.
1 amrn ot going to argue on the constitutional
aspect of this matter, because 1 tbink my
henourable friend from Pýonteix (Hon. Mr.
Marcotte) has sufficiently enlightened us in
I do not depend on my own
that direction.
personal knowledge, or even my intuition-a
word frequently used since the beginning of
the war-but I have read the opinion of the
I)epartment of Justice. That there is room for
discussion about that I will not deny, for 1 arn
no judge of such matters. I do not say that
this measure. is peifect. As far as 1 am concrned there are a few clauses in it that I
woiîid pre-fer to have presented in some other
form. 1 arn particularly opposed to the proviso fol!lowing clause 4, and 1 think sooner or
111
have to he arnended. This
later the Bill w
is true of most mensuires. If it were not, we
would not be sitting as a Parliarnent. I do
believe, however, tbe measure will meet the
challenge no matter frorn what quarter it rnay

corne.
Again I want to ernphasize the utter and

obvions discrepancy between the position taken
by "Opponent 'No. 1," who bias repuidiated the
very prînciple of the menasure, and that of bonourahie rnerhers opposite, who ail rose with a
smile of enthuisinsm to nccept the weli-.founded
intention and principle of the measure. Surely
this will be; confusing to the minds of rnnny
electors in Canada when the next election
cornes around. 0f course 1 would expect a
leader of the opposition to oppose simply for
the sake of opposing.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Not biere.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: But it surprises me to
fiud this attitude on the part of one wbo bias
passed fromn tbe position of the leader of the
oppo,5ition to that of prime minister of one
of the provinces He sbould understand that
it is not the duty of a prime minister to
oppose just for the sake of opposing. As leader
of the opposition in the legisiature of Ontario,
it was ail right; but now bie shouid co-operate
and lead, instead of opposing wvhatever cornes
from Ottawa.
The lion. tbe SPEAKER: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to adopt tbe motion?
lHon. Mr. HORNER: On division.
The motion was agreed to, on division, and
tbe Bill was rend tbe third tirne, and passed.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The exemption for single
persons slîould be at least $800, and for macried persons at least $1,600. Yen may say te
me if ihe exemptions were raised te these
figures there would be a big drop in revenue.
The Minist.er ef Finance said in anether place
it would mean a drop ef about $135,000,000,
and 1 will take bis figures as being correct.
Han. R. B. HORNER.

This qucstion of exemptiens is a highly important one. A number of honourable menmhors have spoken te us about bow badly
needed the family alloxvances are. In my
opinion financial aid is needed principally by
people wlto ncx er h-ad to pay taxes until bbe
exemptions xwere lowered te t.heir present
levol. I feel very keenly about this. I arn
pleased by man 'N othier amendments to the
Act. but amn diaappointed that the Government. did not r.-ise the exemptions te bbe
figures I htave -,uggested. Inceme tax exemptions are reduced hy the ameunit of allowances paid under the Family Allowances Bill,
and in th-rt way we are hit.ting at tIre very
c lass whichi rendors the greatest. service to
the cetîntry-îlre class of people w-ho would
net have teo pax' any bax at ail if the exemptions were raised te $1.600 for married persons. There i-t usually a fine familv life among
that class of people, andi in general il may be
said that the ' do more for the community
than thecir feilow-citizons with highcr er even
with Iewom' incomes. I tirgo that bbc exempt ions bc raised at the next session. I may ho
wvrong. but 1 think it is likely we shahl have
another session before the genci-al cîccrion.
A frrhor ameedmient that I tltink should

At prescrnt it is difficult te gct. people te werk,

In a mnanufacturing plant

forrn was as simple as il could ho made. Hie
bas liad people xvorking in an endeax'oir te
prepare a simpler form, but they have net
succoedcd.
I still think that the form, for
people xvith income net in cxcess of $3.000 is

AUGUST 10; 1944
too complicated. It is the Government, not
the officiais, who get blamed, for this. A good
deal of the opposition to the Liberal party
in Saskatchewan, rose out of dissatisfaction
with orders in council and regulations made
by the Dominion Government. I do flot know
anything about the situation in, Quebec, but
1 presumne there is a similar spirit of pro-test
in that province. I want to tell my honourable friends opposite. that in the next
Dominion election the opposition to the
Governmerit on the part of the people of
Manitoba will be based principally on the
numýerous federal regulations and orders in
council, which affect every individual a littie
differently. Included among these are the
income tax regulations. A friend of mine, who
bas been travelling around Manitoba in connection with the one line of business for
twenty-five years, made a survey of the province about a month ago. He told me that the
thing that gave him the most concern was the
numrber of Liberals who said they voted for
the Government in the last election but, on
account of annoyîing regulations, intend to
vote differently next time. He asked them
how they would vote, and they replied that
they were not sure yet. I believe that kind
of reaction is typical. Income taxes are
collected from people in every community.
The deputy minister told us that therp. are
two million taxpayers in the Dominion no*w.
Only a few years ago the number was nearer
to 200,000.
I say again that I a-n pcrsuaded the Bill
should have contained an amendment raising
the exemptions to a minimum of $800 for
single persons and $1,600 for married persons.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May 1 ask the
honourable gentleman a question? I thi-nk
evervone would agree with what he says, but
what is the alternative source of revenue? We
ail know that thjs money must be raised. I
think the honourable gentleman sa-id that the
increased exemptions would mean a drop of
8135.000,000 in revenue.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: According to my memory,
that was the figure given by the Minister, but
I speak subject to correction.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: What alternative
source of revenue does my honourable friend
suggest?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not suggest anything.
I would rather take a chance on horrowing
the money. 1 may be wrong, but that is my
view.
Persons in the relatively higher incorne
braekets may protest at the present rates of
taxation, but strictly speaking they have no
good ground for doîýng so when the revenue

42lî

is directed to winn-ing the war. My whole
point is that because of the present low
exemptions the people with small incomes are
taxed too highly. Take a man with a salary
of $2,400 a year. That may be considered
a substantial income, but it is certainly not
large, especially if a man happens to have a
wife and a couple of children to support. Yet
the amount he has to pay in taxes is surprising.
It wilI be a little less under this Bill because
there will be no compulsory savings. 1- admit
there is no substitute for compulsory savings,
but 1 feel very keenly that you are taxing a
class of people, that under our economie
system'are entitled to better treatment.
The Bill contains other provisions which
I think are a real step forward. As I have said,
I think the intpoduction of compulsory savings
was a mistake. I do not want to be misunderstood. 1 do not think the Government
will get back those savings in another form,
but the trouble was they were taken out of
the pockets of people who could ilI-afford them,
while people who could more easily afford
compulsory savings enjoyed exemptions by
reason of insurance or mortgage payments and
therefore were flot affected.
Hon. Mr. KING: 1 hope my honourable
friend does flot imply that the Government
will not pay back those compulsory savîngs,
because that seema to be the popular idea.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Do you inean a return of
what the Government has already taken in
the form of compulsory savings?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have neyer had any fear
of that. The public will get back those
compulsory savings alI right. I am talking of
the savings now released by this Bill. Supposing you are a married man getting 82,400 a
year. You paid a certain tax, amounting, say,
to $100, in which the compulsory savings were
included. Under this Bill you will not have
to put up that $100; but 1 do not think it will
be invested in a war bond. That is wliat I
meant.
Hon. Mr. KING: You do not think the taxpayer will contribute that $100 in the form of
a war bond?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. The compulsory
savmngs feature will be released by this Bill.
I arn in favour of this change, because those
who needed the relief most did not gel it, while
those who did flot need the relief did get it.
As a lawyer I have made out dozens of income
tax returns, and 1 have found that the larger
income fellows always had exemptions for
insurance and mortgage payments, and, therefore did not have to pay anything on account

Hon. NLc. MURDOCK: Have yen any
figures te indicate how many additional taxpay-ers wili be reached by redueing the exemp'ion for married couples from $1,200 te M90?

AUGUST 10, 1944
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I arn afraid I have
flot those figures, but I will try ta get them
for rny honourable friend. What particular
deduction does he refer ta?
Han. Mr. MURDOCK: The exemption now
will be $900 for married persons.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, $1,200.
Hon. Mr. MvURDOCK: I must have read
the wrong section.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The deduction is
M66 for an unmarried persan, $1,200 for a
married persan.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: For a single person or
a couple?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Where the wifa is
in receipt of less than $660 a yaar the husband
is allowed an excmption of $1.200. Whare
bath of thern have incarnas of $660 or more,
each pays income tax.
There is a furtber provision in relation ta
ivhat are called unusual medical expensas. It
-will be remembared that last yaar a provision
was introduced in, the incarne tax lag-isiation
by whicha a taxpayer was allowed for tax purposes ta deduct from his incarne certain
unusual medical expensas in axcess of 5 per

cent of bis grass incarne. It was providad that
those expenses rnust have bean incurrad in
Canada, and there was a furtber limitation
as ta the total amount which could be claimed.

$400 for a single persan, $600 for a married
persan, and $100 for each dependant of a
married persan.
This has been considarably expanded ta the

-advantage of the taxpayer in four differant
ways.

First of ail, medýical expanses incurrad

outside of Canada are now included. Secondly,
the proportion of the total ýincarne of the tax-

payer on which he can begin ta make daduetiens~ for mnedical expenses lias bean ebanged
from 5 par cent ta 4 per cent. Thirdly, the
maximum amount which be can dlaim for
thosa deductions have bean increasad by 50
par cent. That is. an unmarried persan ca-n
now dlaim up ta $600 instaad oFf $400; a
anarried persan, $900 inLstead of $600; and for
,each dependant cbild the allowance bas been
rai,-ed from. $100 ta $150. Faurthly, certain
additional medical expenses are allowed, sncb
as the cost of artificial limbs or braces and
hearing aids.
Thera are alsa certain provisions for the
benafit of ernployees. Undar aur present incarne tax law an amployaa wba upan his
retiremant receives a gratuity hy way of a
lump sum bas ta treat it as incarne for the
year in whicha it is receivad, which means of
course that for that yaar ha pays a vary much
higber incarne tax. Under this legisiation the

amployae will be allawed ta spread his gratuity
over five years,'so thaýt be wîll pay incarne tax
ou only one-fifth of tbe gratuity for eacb of

the five years.
At tbe presant time employees are allowed

ta deduct $300 per annurn for contributions
whicb they may make ta superannuation or
pension fonds cstablished by their emplioyars.
This Bill contains an amendment extanding
thiat deduction ta annual contributions made
hy cmployees ta trade union superannuation
funds.
The Bill provides ana furtber sligbt relief ta
the individual taxpayer, ta wbicb I tbink
bonourable senators would like me ta refer.
It relates ta, a wiclow or widower having a
dependent child or cbildren and employing a
fuil-time bousakeeper or servant in bis or ber
establisbrnent. In such cases there is provision

for an additianal deductian of $108.
Those, bonourable senatars, are the principal
provisions affecting the individual taxpayer.
Parbaps at tbis stage I migbit be allowed to
refer for a moment ta the very intéresting
reraarks wbich the bonourable senatar frorn
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) macle bafora we
adjourned at 6 o'clock. His first suggestion
wvas tbat we should increasa the amount of the
minimum exemption for single and married
persans. That is a matter of Governmant
policy, as ta which I bave no right ta speak,
but I tbink we shaîl aIl agree witb him that if
that could be done it would ha most desirable.
'l'le only comment I would make is tbat aur

minimum exemptions of $660 for a single person and $1,200 for a rnarriad persan are already
bîgber tban those allowed in the United States,
and considerably higbar than tbosa allowad in
Great Britain.
My hanourable friand wil
realize that wbat 1 arn now saying is nlot by
way of criticism of bis suggestion, but I do
want ta point out tbat in aur minimum allowancas bel-ow wbich taxes are not payable we
are more liberal than is aither the United
States or Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: My honaurable friend
was speaking rather low and I do not know

whethar ha referred ta the changes on page 4
in regard ta medical expenses. That. bas ta do

with daductian of unusual madical expensas of
4 par cent instaad of 5 par cent of the incarne.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I did explain -that
bafara the hanourable genatar came in. At
prasent tha taxpayer is nat allowad ta deduet
unusual me.di-cal axpenses which. are less than
5 par cent of bis grass incarne. In other words,
if bis grass incarna was $5,000 and his medical
expensas wara not more than $250, he could
not make any deduction. Under the amendment ha will ha able ta rnake a daduction if

SENATE
bis medical expenses are greater than 4 per
cent of his gross incorne. ThIt is, if his gross
income is $5,000, ho cao deduct the amount
of bis medicai expenses in excess of $200.
That is a benefit to the taxpayer.
If honourabie members xviii bear wîth me
for a few minutes longer, it might be interesting to refer to changes in the taxes on corporations and businesses. For -the most part
these are alleviations in favour of the taxpayer. First of ail. there is a provision for
aliowances in respect cf scientifie research
made by a company or business. Dedýuctions
xviii ho allowed for three classes of expenditurcs under this heading: amounts expended
on scientiflo research reiated t.o the taxpayer's
own business; any contribution which the taxpayer makes to a scientifio research association
approved by the Minister: or a payment by
the taxpayer for scientiflo research to an approvcd university, coliege or institute. Any
sucb expenditures of a current nature may be
deducted from tlic gross income of the y-ear in
which flic-, were made; but a large expenditure of a capital nature may ho divided up
deductions spread over three years.
Another amnendment appiies to taxpayers
who sustain Mosses. Cases of this kind were
referred to this afteînoon by my honourable
friend frorn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig).
Under tlic proposed a mc udments a loss sustained iw a, taxpayer in his business may for
income box purposes ho spread over five years
-that is, over the three preccdiing tax years
and the next succeeding tax year, as weil as
tbe year in which the loss was incurred. The
provision is a littie complicated, but what it
amounts to is briefly this, that corporations
aod bus:nesses xviii ho able to average the years
in which they make profits with the years in
which they malte losses, over a period of five
years. and bhey will pay income box only on
the net amounit by whicbi the profits exceed
the losses in that pcriod.
It mav ho recalcd that last, year a provision
was inserted in the Act ailowing farmers te
deduct losses for a three-year pcriod. That
provision bias now bcen rcplaced by this new
one under which net oniy farmers but people
in ail classes of business xviii ho able to average their losses and profits over a period of
five years.

mbt

Hon. Mr. PATERSON: What about the
thrce precedinig years on which taxes have
been paid? Wili the taxpayer ho allowed te
go back over bis reburns for those years and
dlaim credits?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
0f course,
assessments wili have te ho reopened.
Hon. MIr.HUGESSEN.

the

Tlien there are some amendments intecnded
te encourage capital expenditures during the
peried of reconstruction after the war. There
is a provision that flie Governor in Council
may fix a period during which industries
making new investimeots in plant or equipment moy dlaim depreciation thereon at, double
the normai rates.

benefit is now limited to the average of the
charitable donations which the company made
in the two years prior to the 1st of July, 1942.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Pardon me. That does
not affect individuals?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No; this has to do
with corporations only. The limit applicable
to individuals is 10 per cent of income, and
that is not changed.
One further provision in regard to corporations may be of interest. It provides that
limited dividend housing companies will be
entirely exempted from income tax. The
object is to benefit investors in companies
whose chief purpose is to build low-cost houses
rather than to produce profits to shareholders,
the maximum dividend rate being fixed at
three or four per cent.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: What is the limit of
the cost of the bouses?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: This applies to lowrental housing projects under the Housing Act
of 1938.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:

Is it

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

$6,000?

Then there is a provision extending the
period within which members of the armed
forces who are serving overseas may appeal
from an assessment made upon their income.
In their case the time limit is extended from
the usual term of one month to any time
within one year after they cease to be on
the strength of their respective units.
As I say, there are a number of other comparatively minor modifications. I have tried
to touch on the principal provisions.
If any honourable member has a question to
ask, I shall do my best to answer it.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, when shall this Bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. KING: I would move, with the
leave of the Senate, that the Bill be read the
third time now.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time, and passed.

Yes.

Hon. Mi. PATERSON: The companies
must not make more than 6 per cent on their
investment?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I speak subject to
correction, but I think the permissible divident is less than 6 per cent. I believe that
on Montreal projects the dividend was limited
to 3 per cent.

There are a few administrative provisions
to which I think I should direct the attention
of the House, as these affect all taxpayers,
both persons and corporations. These too are
in the nature of alleviations. First of all,
the interest on overdue tax payments is
reduced from 5 per cent to 4 per cent during
the period before the notice of assessment is
mailed to the taxpayer, and from 8 to 7 per
cent for the period after the notice is mailed.
A second amendment limits the time in
which the Minister may reopen an assessment.
Under section 55 of the present Act, he may
reopen an assessment at any time after the
tax has been paid. That is to say, he may
reopen an assessment twenty or twenty-five
years after the tax bas been paid and impose
an additional tax. Section 15 of the Bill limits
the period in which an assessment may be
reopened to six years after the original assessment, except in cases where there has been
fraud or misrepresentation. In cases of that
kind, of course, there is no limit to the time
in which the Minister may act.

EXCESS PROFITS TAX BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. KING moved the second reading
of Bill 182, an Act to amend the Excess Profits
Tax Act, 1940.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, this is a comparatively minor Bill, and
I do not think it need hold the attention of
the House very long. Several of its provisions
are similar in substance to the provisions which
I explained a few minutes ago in regard to the
Income War Tax Bill. There are eleven
resolutions, none of them of particular importance, but if honourable senators wish to ask
any questions I shall be glad to do my best to
answer them.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Will the honourable
gentleman explain clause 2, in regard to capital increase through profits being left in the
business? This is of vital importance at the
present time.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. As I understand, it is a provision that where profits have
been left in the business, then for excess profits
tax purposes the taxpayer is allowed 5 per cent
on those profits.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: If the excess profits
are allowed to accunulate the taxpayer is
allowed 5 per cent profit on the accumulated
capital?

AUGUST 11, 1044
Part II of the Bill deals with the construction of houses for rentai purposes and covers
projects of a kind with which we are familiar,
by nieans of which a group of individuals
may îîndertake to put up 10 per cent of the
capital, the Government putting up the mernaining 90 per cent. The group agrees to
construet the bouses, manage them, coibeet the
rents, and carry the properties over a given
pemiod of time. Loans made under this authomity bear interest at 3 per cent, and continue
for a period of thirty or forty years. If the
property is wound up the money is repaid to
the Covernment by the loaning group. The
property rnay then be disposed of to the municipality, or other arrangements may be made in
regard to it. It is pmoposed tbat the bouses
built f or rentai purposes shahl be of at ehamacter and type that will rent at a loNw figure,
ýthus providing better housing for people who
are flot in a position to undertake the construction of homes themsebves, and $50,000,000
is set aside for this purpose.
Part 111 of the Bill covers rural housing.
If there are mortgages abready on the property,
the lonining company wibb take over these
mortgages and conisolidate them into one deht.
A total of $5,000,000 will bc set aside for
purposes referred to.
The provisions -of Part IV apply to repairs.
ilterations, modemnization and extension of
2xisting homes. For these purposes a total 'of
$100,000,000 is allotted. This, is an important
feature of the Bibl. We know that for a
number of yeams-I should say ten or flfteen
years-not much has been done in the way of
improvement and, extension of existing homes
throughout Canada. During the period of
depression the individuals, in common with
large operators, hesitated to venture into any
unusuai expenditure, and since the beginning of
the war theme has been a shortage of material
and labour. I am sure there is a great fiebd
for development under this part of the Bill.
Part V of the Bill is also very important
and interesting, having to d'o with housing
rcsearch and community planning. It authorizes inquiry and research as ta the best types
of housing for this country, and the most
satisfactory materials and their standardization. Studies may abso be made of ca-mmunity
planning. It is probable that considerabie
community planning will be undertaken, and
of course such projects will be carried on in
conjunction with provincial and municipal
govemoimeilts.
Part VI contains a number of general provisions. Heretofore bife insurance companies
have been more or less handicapped in the

431

lending of money for building operations. It
is provided in this measure that under proper
conditions, as laid down within the enactmenl
or in regulations to be drafted, insurance companties may make loans for housing purposes
up to 5 per cent of their revenue. In Canada
we have had very littie experience along this
line, whereas in the United States and, I
believe, in Great Britain, insurance companies
have found housing loans a profitable field for
large investments. It is well known that one
of the big American companies bas financed
thé development of extensive community areas,
which have been well planned to provide
modern bousing accommodation on a rentai
basis. These cornmunity areas ineluce not only
bouses, but apartments, stores, theatres, playgrounds, and so on. 1 bave not seen any of
t.hese developments, but 1 amn told Ibat not
oniy bave they proved quite sueeessful as an
investmient for the if e in-surance companies
but have been of great benefit to the coinmunity residents.
Io drafting this legislation the Government
did not depend solely on its own experience.
Under the cbairmanship of Dr. Curtis, a committee of experts outside the Government
serviceearchiteets, engineers, and othersmade a study, and in co-operation with the
Director of llousing and the Department of
Finance presented a report to the Goverament.
That report is of great interest, and I have no
doubt many honourable members have familiarized themseives with it. It is estimated that
the number of housing units required in the
first year after the war wiIl be from 50,000 to
100,000; and in the first ton yearz, 700,000.
The committee strongly recommended that
co-operative efforts sh&ould be encouraged
between municipal, provincial and federal
authorities. That co-operation will be partiticularly helpful in undertaking slum clearance
and town planning.
It is flot proposed under this legislation to
hand over money to provinces or municipalitics to be expended by them on housing
sehemes, as was done following the last war.
Experience has shown that the placing of these
matters under federal authority encourages a
dloser co-operation on the part of loaning coinpanies than can, be achieved by leaving sirch
matters in the hands of municipal or provincial authorities.
I might say that under former housing
schemes our lofses have been comparatively
light. Under the Act of 1938 there was a loss
of only 31,100 on total loans of $100,000,000;
and under the Act of 1937 the loss was about
$900 on an expenditure of approximateby $75,000,000. These resuits are very encouraging,

432

SENATE

and althicugha this Bill does flot make provision
for tlic ameunt, rccommended by the Curtis
Committec, it docs for the next, two or three
years make available sufficient funds for the
pur-pose in vicw. If further grants should be
found necessary, no doubt another Parliament
will make them available.
I have much pleasure in commending tbis Bill
to the favourable consideration of the Senate.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourahie
senators, tbis is not only most necessary but
also miost commendable legislatien, and I
fail to sc how anyone cao regard it with disfavour. We ail know that from one end of
Canada to t.he other, and more especially in
our large cihies. thiere is a dire necessity for
more housing accommodation.
Speaking of
my own city of Montreal, I regret to say that
housing conditions arc really deplorabie, and
a comp rehiensive plan to meet such conditions
is vcry timeiy indecd.
But, 1 am more particulariy interested in
what is going to be accomplished by community housing schernes. To-day people are
iooking for more comforts than they did in
days gone by, and when these community
houses arc huilt I trust they wili be buiît on
a large scale and wviil ho up-to-date in every
way ie reg-ard 10 sanitation, iighting and
central heating.
I notice it is proposcd to buiid certain very
lew-coet hieuses. The need for housing accommodation is so urgent, of course, that such
bouses wiii have to ho built; but unfortunateiy
they wili have to ho heated by coal stoves.
0w ing te the war our ceaI to-day is of very
poor quaiity, and families are hiable to suffocatien from gixs fumes. I have read in our
Montreal newspapers that many times the
Montreal Light, Heat. and Power Company
have had to scnd out their emergency squads
10 resuscitate people whio have been overcome
by ceai gas.
I am serry that theeliouses to be built under
the sclieme. whercby private enterprise xviii
contrihute 10 pier cnt. vil i net he ccntrally
heatýed. Those living in the upper storey, or
even thoze dewnstairs will have to carry up
their ceai.
And the rooms will be small.
Everyonc w-ho is able to work is actively engaged in war industries, and in ail probability
the fathcr and mother will bo absent from the
home. I am apprehensive of what might happen te the chiidren during the absence of the
parents if the ventilation of these stoves
should hecome defective and therehy cause
thc dissermination of gas fumes. I suppose we
cannot expert tee mucb to start with, and I
Hon. MIi.KING.

tluînk it ivas a generous gestuire on the part of
large incbustrY toe xprc-', a îvîll;ngnc-ýc to contrihute 10 per cent of the cesî.
Hon. Mr. KING: And 10 per cent of the
cost of managenment, which is very important.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: ALso, what is
more important stili, as my honourabie friend
lias pointed eut, they are going to manage
these lieuses. I have seen the list of the
people chosen in my own eity 10 manage these
proposed boeuses, and I know the work wil
ho well and efflciently done. I congratulate
the Governiment on being able to prevail upon
l)rivate industry and private citizens flot only
to contrihute ýmoney but to give their personal services in order that these bouses may
be properly constructed and properly managed.
On the whole, I heartily approve of the
legislation, and there is no necessity for me
te take up any furtber time of honourable
mnembers. I do hiope that work, wiii ho started
immcdiatcly, hecause the need of housing
accommodation is most urgent.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I w-as connected with a building comnpany

After the last wvar the city of Winnipeg

The sceeme was well worked out and it bas
heen a great success. The rates of interest on
the building boans were reason-abie for those

showed a profit of about $75,000.

We have a few people with sufficient m.eans,

AUGUST 11, 1944
Hon. Mr. KING: I beg to differ; it does.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It does if yau have a
situation like that in Montreal.
Hon. Mr. KING: The Bill provides for
low-rent houses, so that a man, over a period
af twenty or twenty-five years, buys his home
on a low rentai basis.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: On the prairies houses
muet be buit to withistand the cold winter
weather, and they cannot be built at a low
enough price to be sold on a rentai basis. Take
a man earning $100 a month, and you will find
that, figure any way y'ou like, hie cannot in
Winnipeg buy a house on a low-rental basis.
Hon. Mr. KING: Low-rental houses are
available.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But they are smail houses,
or the accommodation may consist of three
rons in the attic or four rooms on the second
floor. I know of as many as half a dozen
families living in one house in my city. A
survey made in Winnipeg a few months ago
discloscd that the hospitalization and other
expenses that the city or the province had to
pay came from just one arna, about one-sixth
of the whole city, and yet that is the area
where there are no low-priced houses.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I understood the
honourable senator ta say that hie had been
interested in a $5,000,000 housing scheme more
or less like the one proposcd under this Bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, na. We were building
houses ta seli at from $3,000 to $25,000 each.
We were in the speculative building business.
Han. Mr. LACASSE: Are the conditions the
honourable gentleman is now describing the
resuit af that undertaking?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no, no. Do not
misunderstand me. I am not objecting ta
this scheme for one minute; I think in many
respects it is excellent; but it does not touch
the lower stratum of workmen in our country
whose wages are under $125 a month. The
only way in which those people can be hclped
is by the municipality undertaking to put
the sehemie into operation. That is aIl there
is toit.
Hon. Mr. KING: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. HAIIG: There is no other basis on
which it can be worked out. My honourable
friend opposite objects to what I am saying,
but I am stating facts. Anyone who bas resided ini Winnipeg, Regina, Saskatoon or any
other of our western cities knows that we
must have proper housing accommodation ta
withstand aur long cold winters. As I have
106-29

a3

said, I am flot opposcd ta the Bill; on the
contrary, I am ail for it, but if I had had
anything ta do wîth drafting it I would
have covered this point. There is a demand
by the citizens generally, nat by an isalated
group, such as the C.C.F., that a certain
amount ai this money should be placed at the
disposai of Winnipeg or any other city-under
regulations if you like-so that the municipal
authorities could huild hauses and make thera
available for persans in the low-earning group.
I believe that is the only possible way in whieh
that situation cati be met.
Now, let me answer my honourable fricnd
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies). Winnipeg
is the best city 'on the continent ai N*orth
America for central heating. We have a long
winter with a steady cold temperature. There
being no rock substratum it is easy ta put in a
central heating plant. About thirty years ago,
ta the credit ai the legal profession, the Young
lawyers of Winnipeg invited the chief engineer of the City af, Chicago, which was the
first city in North America ta, install central
heating, ta came ta Winnipeg ta examine and
report on the feasibility ai building a central
he-ating system there. He made a thoýrough
investigation and concluded, bis repart in
these wards: 'This city affords the finest
opportunity for a central heating system of
any place that 1 have ever heard ai." True,
conditions woulct be just as favourable in
Regina or Saskatoon, but those cities are too
small ta support a central heating plant. In
aur province we bave ta heat our houses from
the l5th of September ta the lst ai June.
There arc two privatcly-awned central heating
systems in Winnipeg, anc on the north side
and the other on the south side ai the Assinibaine river. Many ai the houses now built in
that area enjoy central heating. The cost ai
the installation, if the work is done, in the
first place, is no mare than the cost of putting
in coal-heating equipment. As far as fuel is
concerned, there is fia shortage, because the
coal for the central heating plant is brought in
on railway cars and is dumped, with very little
labour, inta the bins. Aiter that it is handled
mechanically until it gets ta, the furnaces.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: What kind ai coal
is used?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Souris coal.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Is the system proving
satisfactoy to the people in their homes?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It. is delightfui. If you
had it in your home, as I have it ini mine, you
would be chased out of -the house if you suggested removing it.

UzV.mf E»riOi

434

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: How does the per
house cost of central heating compare with
the per house cost of other systems of
heating?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Here is the point. You
will pardon me if I refer to my own case.
My house had been steam-heated, and when
we put in central heating it was only necessary
to put in the pipes, at a cost of about $70, and
connect them with the mains. Central heating has one great advantage-there is no dirt
from it at all. As to cost, if you take into
account the money y.ou have to pay someone
to tend your furnace-as I have had to do except for the time when my own boy did it-the
cost of heating by coal is more than the cost
of central heating. Three new houses right
across the street from where I live have
central heating, and it will cost no more to
heat them that way than to heat them by coal.
The city of Winnipeg owns a plant which is
used for heating in the downtown district.
That plant makes use of surplus electrical
energy. There is no surplus now, so my
friend's coal from Souris is being used. But
even with the charge for electrical current,
the plant came out level, and it has given
great service. As I say, Winnipeg is an ideal
situation for central hea-ting. The city is flat,
and you have to go down 52 feet before you
strike rock. Consequently it is easy to put in
a plant.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Is it a steam system?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Steam or hot water. The
furnace is put in and the steam is brought to
you. Hot air furnaces are not put in any
more. Steam is cheaper. When hot water is
used the water bas to be brought from outside,
and there is no way of valuing it or measuring
the temperature.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: There is evaporation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It cools off, and people
who use hot water say it costs more money.
But that will not apply to the new houses.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I have been following my honourable friend's remarks very
closely. As lie knows, for twelve years I was
a resident of Winnipeg. I think the honourable gentleman should make it clear whether
lie would regard the experience of Winnipeg in
the matter of central heating as a fair criterion
by which to judge the value of central heating
systems elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think my remarks have
already indicated that the plant, to be ecoHon. Mr. HAIG.

nomical, must be easy to install. It takes a
considerable period to cover the overhead cost
of the plant.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Are the mains laid
in the lanes or under the roads?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Some of them are in the
lanes, but usually they come down underneath the boulevards. They only cross the
pavement at intersecting streets.
Replying to the honourable senator from
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) it is my opinion
that the cost of construction in Ottawa would
be too heavy. Furthermore, there is not as
long a period of consistently cold weather
here as there is in Winnipeg. The system
loses money in September and October, and
probably in November, and again in April and
May. At these times it is economical to the
householder, which means that during the
other months the cost is more than that of
coal.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: How does the thermostatic control system work with central heating? In other words, can you regulate the
amount of heat you are to get?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The thermostatic control
system is absolutely perfect.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Is the thermostat at
the central plant?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. It is right in the
house. For instance-if I may again refer
to my own house-the thermostat is in the
dining room, the room that is least used.
When I leave in the morning I set the thermostat at 65, where it remains until I return;
then it is set at 70, and remains there until
10 or 10.30, when it is cut down again. Of
course, if there are children in the bouse
and they are remaining in their rooms for a
large part of the day, the cost will be greater.
This system would not be economical in
lower-priced bouses; the cost of installation
would be too great. Furthermore, it could
not be made applicable to individual houses
but would have to extend over a large area
where the people wanted it. In Winnipeg
centralized heating is on the increase; practicatly all the new bouses have it.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
the charges?

What is the basis of

Hon. Mr. HAIG: They charge you on the
basis of the water that has been used as
shown by the meter. The charge is a reasonable one. Up until about a year ago the
company did not make any money. Now it
is about breaking even. As soon as there are

sufficient users there will be a profit. However,

AUGUST 11, 1944
as I say I woubd not recommend centralized
heating for general housing schemes. I believe
an attempt bas been made to apply it to
low-rent bouses ini Montreal. In our city we
cannot do that.
I prophesy that within a year or Vwo this
Government, or another, will be back ssking
for an amendment to the Bill. If we can get
the people out of crowded mroom and crowded
houses ini the city of Winnipeg we shahl save
money on hospitalization coats. I tbink the
aune would be true of every city in Canada,
because it is nlot healthy Vo have four or
five or six familles crowed into one bouse,
particuiarly when the chimate is such that
the doors and windows have Vo 'be kept
closed for five or six months of the year.
Wbat I have said it noV a criticîsm, but
rather a suggestion that next session, maybe,
soxnething like what I have outlined wiil be
asked for.
The motion was agreed Vo, and the Bill wua
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, when shail this Bill be read the
third time?
Hon. Mr. KING: Do my honourable friends
opposite want this Bill sent to Committee?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Unless the
honourable the Leader of the House is very
anxious to send it there, I woubd net be
inclined Vo do so.
Hon. Mr. KING: The Bill has been
considered very carefully, and if my honourable friends opposite agree, I Vhink we couhd
give it third reading now, and I would so
move.
The motion was agreed Vo, and the Bill was

106-29j

43à

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is your
pleasure, honourable senators, to adopt the
motion?
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
this Bill is a new departure in Canadian
legislation. As will have been noted, the
amendments to the Bank Act which was
discussed, in Committee last night, indicateas do the Bis relating to export credits, farm
loans and fishermen's loane--that there is a
desire to make capital more easily available
to those who may have need of it. The
In.dustrial Development Bank is, thought by
the Government to be necessary Vo meet a
demand that to-day is not taken care of by
our financial institutions.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Are we noV supposed
to have the Bill before us?
Hon. Mr. KING: It will be before us in
Committee. I have asked second reading
now to advance the Bill. I will send a copy
of it to my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: All right.
Hon. Mr. KING: IV is well known that cur
chartered. hanks are dependent for funds upon
not only the money subscribed hy their shareholders, but also upon deposits, which. may be
withdrawn by the depositors at any time. Our
Bank Act contains provisions designed to ensure that funds on deposit in cbartered banks
shall be at ail times liquid and available for
withdrawal.
The field that is propoe to be covered by
the Industrial Development Bank hýas not
been served by the ordinary banking institutior4s. 0f course, companies whose projeots
are of a magnitude and oharacter to appeal to
the general public may obtain funds through
the sale of securities on the market. Certain
financial institutions wibl underwrite boans required for the development of industries
requiring a few hundred thousand dollars or
a million or two; but it is difficult to obtain
relatively small sums in this way, since it is
net considered profitable to underwrite the
smali type of loan.
,Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I disagree with
my honourable friend there.
~Hon. Mr. KING: That ia the story I hear
from banking circles.
I was impressed by the evidence given before
a committee in another place by the, Governor of the Bank of Canada. He indicated
that for people desiring te obtain capital to
establish smali industries there should be a
medium which ordinary financial. sources today do noV provide. It was suggested by some

436

SENATE

people that portions of loans for such purposes
should be underwritten by the Government
with existing financial institutions, as is done
under the Housing Act and other measures.
The Government has not thought that wise,
but instead has taken steps to form within the
Bank of Canada a corporation to be known
as the Industrial Development Bank, which
will be a subsidiary of the Bank of Canada.
The Government will not furnish any money
to the corporation, but the Bank of Canada
will advance some $10,000,000, to be paid at
the time the Act goes into effect. In addition
the Industrial Development Bank will be empowered to borrow up to three times the
amount of its paid up capital stock and reserve
stock, through the issue of bonds and deben,
tures to the public. This would provide in
all $100,000,000.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
to be guaranteed by whom?

The loans are

Hon. Mr. KING: By the Bank of Canada.
In advocacy of this measure I am in a
rather fortunate position. In 1918-19 I happened to be a member of the Government
of British Columbia, which had an experience
that I think might very well be mentioned to
this House. Many men were then returning
from overseas to the province, especially to
centres such as Vancouver, Westminster and
Victoria, and no provision had been made to
assist them to secure loans for the purpose
of starting up busineses. In an endeavour to
obtain such assistance great pressure was
brought to bear by the veterans, individually
and in groups; in fact they came in such large
groups that we had to receive then at the door
of the Legislative building. The Provincial
Government of that day decided to bring in a
Bill, entitled an Act to establish a Department of Industries, and this was assented to on
the 29th of March, 1919. At that time the
province of British Columbia had had no experience whatever in the making of loans to
industries. The Act created a Department
of Industries, which was authorized to aid by
loan, guarantee or guarantee of securities, any
enterprise calculated to further the economic
welfare of the province, and to consider and
deal with plans submitted by representative
bodies of returned soldiers of British Columbia for promoting and providing employment
through establishment of new industries.
I have before me a report sent to me by the
Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry in
British Columbia, in answer to an inquiry I
made as to the results of that Act.
Loans amounting to a considerable total
were made to 108 companies manufacturing
Hon. Mr. KING.

various types of products, including cordage,
furniture, ladies' and children's wear, cast-iron
pipe, rubber roofing, building paper, box-board,
woollen goods, brick and tile, machinery, electrical fixtures, concrete blocks, and so on.
Hundreds of applications were received from
all types of industries, a large number of
which were not in a position to comply with
prescribed conditions.
Of the industries
financial'ly assisted under that Act, many are
to-day prosperous and thriving, employing
thousands of men and women. and a credit
to the industrial life of the province.
Unfortunately, because of inexperienced
management, competition and the depression
of 1930-1933, a considerable number of the
firms that received assistance failed, and the
Department of Industries was forced to assume
a financial loss amounting in all to $530,000.
It is generally felt. however, that the policy
adopted by the Government in financially
assisting and establishing new industries at
that time was wise and sound, as it materially
aided in the important work of rehabilitating
thousands of veterans of the Great War of
1914-18; and that the financial loss was far
overshadowed by the results attained.
In addition to financially assisting industry
by way of loans, the Department guaranteed
several bank loans, totalling $111,000. All these
guaranteed loans have been repaid in full
with the exception of two; and in those two
cases the debtors are steadily reducing their
liabilities to the bank and are in excellent
condition.
As I recall, the Government
assisted returned soldiers to secure loans by
guaranteeing the banks against losses.
I mention this case because I have personal
knowledge of it. As I have said, the provincial Government had had no experience
whatever in ventures of that kind, yet it succeeded in helping to get established a number
of very useful industries that are thriving
to-day and that during the war period have
been of great value to the nation. I have in
mind an engine works in Vancouver that has
supplied many engines for ships built on the
Pacifie coast.
Loans under the Bill now before us will not
be restricted te returned soldiers, the intention
being to encourage the establishment of industries wherever feasible and thus extend
employment opportunities throughout
the
country. This Bill will be launched under
much more favourable conditions than was
the Department of Industries Act in British
Columbia. The Industrial Development Bank
will be a corporation subsidiary to the Bank of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will there be
any business men to pass on applications for
loans?

AUGUST 11, 1944
Hon. Mr. RING: Oh, yes. Great care will
be exercised in that respect.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the boans
be passed on entirely by bankers, or will there
be some business men an the board?
Hon. Mr. RING: For my honaurable
friend's information, let me read what was
said ini another place by the Parliamentary
Assistant ta the Minister of Finance:
As ta the Bill itself, it. is. proposed that the
Bank will be a subsidiary corporation of the
Bank of Canada, having a board of fifteen
directors composed of the members of the board
of directors and the Assistant Deputy Governor
of the Bank of Canada, wit-h the Governor of
the Bank of Caflada as president.
That is, the board will be composed almost
entirehy of bankers.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Ail bankers.
Hon. Mr. KING: Bankers or others associated with the Bank of Canada. This measure
has been subi ccted to some criticism on the
ground that the Industrial Development Bank
will be administered by the Department of
Finance. On the contrary, the Bank will be
removed as far as possible from the Department, a feature which must commendi itself
te my honourable friend opposite who, I know,
is rather opposed ta a venture of this kind.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Very munch.
Hon. Mr. RING: Under this legislation
$100,000,000 wihl be made available. I do nlot
think it would be wise for me, a layman, ta
try ta describe the terras on which b'ans
may be made. Various provisions in the Bill
indicate that strict regulations will be laid
down for the exercise of care and judgment
by those entrusted with the funds made
available under the measure-funds te be
advanced, flot by the Department of Finance
or eut of taxes, but by the Bank of Canada
and by purchasers of securities of the Industrial Devehopment Bank. I think it will be
advisabhe ta refer this Bill ta the Committee
on Banking and Commerce, where an officer
of the Bank of Canada can expIai. the Bill
in greater detail.
I move the second reading.
Han. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, may I state at the outset of my
remarks that I ar nflt a directar nor a shareholder in any chartered bank or boan campany
operating in Canada.
I arn against this Bihl because- I see fia
reasan in the world why the Gavernment
should introduce it, other than in an effort
ta outdo certain extreme radical ehements.
Last night we passed the Bank Bill for the

437

renewal of the charters of aur commercial
banks. I need nlot refer again to their splendid
record of service to Caaaadian trade and
industry.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The Bill was paased
through our standing committee hast night.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Then I was
under a misapprehension. Chartered banks
are eager to..ol business; tbey want te make
ail the loans they can that they consider safe
and sound. What disturbs me about this
Bill is that when it was introduced in another
place two reasans were given for it: first, ta
aid small industry; and, second, to make
loans on undertakings that the chartered banks
would. not consîder good risks. The capital
of the proposed banks will be provided by aur
taxpaye.rs, and I certainly do not tbink that
this or any other Government is justified -in
taking u.nnecessary chances by loaning the
maney of aur -taxpayers on extra risky
ventures.
What does the setting up of a 'bank like
this mean? I shall refer later ta the fact
that it should flot be called a bank at ail].
In addition to providing headquarters it is
proposed ta eetablish branches from one end
of the country ta the other, and ta engage
a large staff. If the Clovernment wanted ta
aid returned soldiers and others why should
it flot have said ta the chartered banks: "We
wihl insert in the Bank Act a clause ta give
you greater loaning latitude and certain guarantees in order that you rnay look after
customers of the class that this bank proposes
ta deal with." The cbartered banks have al]
the necessary facilities and experience ta
investigate each and every boan and decide
whether or not it sbould be accepted.
It is proposed that a board composed of
bankers shahl decide how rnuch of the taxpayers'
money they will loan here, there and everywhere. When the leader on the other aide
was speaking I a.sked him if there would be
any business mnan on that board.
Han. Mr. KING: I did flot say no. The
board will be composed largely of bankers,
but no doubt they will have business men as
consultants.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do nlot see
how they -can do that. The chartered banks
usualhy have an their boards of directors
fifteen or twenty men representing aur large
manufacturing industries and financial institutions, and when the question of loans cames
before the board the advice of these experienced men is of inestimable value ta the
general manager. According ta wbat my
honourable friend has just stated, noane of
those wbo will pass on the boans will bave
had any business training at ahl.,

438

SENATE

Hon. Mr. KING: I thi.nk that is hardly a
fair statement.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: How could it
be possible for them to have eny business
training? If I enter a bank as a young man,
I arn a ban-ker, I arn trained in finance. True.
I gleen a certain amount of information about
business, but I certainly could flot be considered a business man. That is why the
ehertcred benks have on their directorates so
many cxperienced men.
Hon. Mr. KING: But your experience as
a business mon and as a banker wauld require
you to consult with those persons who should
know and ho able ta ad-vise you. You form
your judgrnent after consultation.
Hon.. Mr. BALLANTYNE: From what I
know of the persons who are going to manage
this bank, I do not think there is very rnuch
hope that they will consuit any outside
authorities.
I bave followed the debates in another
place, and I can find no indication of wbat
security the bank would want on a boan of
$50,000 or $100,000. Would they went 10 per
cent, 25 per cent or 50 per cent security?
There is no indication as to that at ail.
We bave been told that this bank is necessary to encourage srnall business. The day
of small-business onterprise is past, just like
the borse-an&buggy days. We are now in the
automobile age.

Hon. Mr. KING: No.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Industry is now
conducted on a very large scale. 1 know
there arc a few small industries, such as
sawmills, but the industrial field is thoroughly
eovered

by

large,

highly

specializcd

firms,

which do a large volume of business and' have
well organized research dcpartmnents, leboratories, and so on. The small manufacturer
has not a chance in the world of competing
with those large firrns. Therefore I would
consider it very unwiso for a man to sot up a
small industry in a field already covered by a
largo one. I do not sco how he could compete.
Nelirally, ho will say to himself: "Well,' after
ail, this is not rny rnonoy; I ar nfot risking
rny capital in tbis business et ail]. I arn not
able to get a foothold in the market, and

therefore I will eut the prico." Furtberrnore,
ho may say to bimself: "I have a very long
termi credit of ton yeers or twcnty yeers."
No, honourable senators, se far as small
industries are concerned, vou must not lot
that suggestion bulk very largely in forming
your opinion of this measure.
My bonourable friend ta!ks about belping
our returned soldiers.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Surely we' must do

everything we possibly can for them. But we
would flot cxpect a returned soldier to start
up in. business unless be had some experience.
To corne back to what I was saying at the
outset of my rernarks, the chartered banks
could have taken care of ail that rny honourable friend bas outlincd, and if they were
allowed to, do so there would beo no necessity
at ail to create this bank.
It bas been stated over and over again in
another place that this industrial bank will
flot interfere with the chartered banks. "oh,
no"we are toid, "it won't interfere with them
at al." Now, as 1 said yesterday, 1 ar nfot
an experienced banker, aithough I have had a
certain amount of experience. If I may repoat
myseif, I was ten years on the directorate and
also the executive committee of one of our
largest banks, and I have a considerable
knowledge of how loans are made and the
risks that are taken. Ail the chartcred banks
take risks and sustain losses. True, they are
careful enough to sec that their losses are flot
too great, otherwise tbey would become
insolvent. But if honourable rnerbers could
see the basses of our chartered banks over a
terni of years thcy would ho rather surprised.
The young sponsors of this Bill tried to

Bank will meet a demand which is fundamentally different. Its function will be to
provide permanent or semi-permanent capital
to industry, particularly to small and mediumsized concerns and new undertakings which
are not yet sufficiently established to be able
to obtain Joans from the chartered banks or
other credit institutions.
I think every one of us in his own personal
experience bas realized again and again that
there is a real need-I would even say an
acute need-for capital loans to small industrialists all over Canada. It is all very well
to say that small industry already exists in
different regions. It is all very well to add
that there is no necessity for improving our
financial machinery.
A reason, or many
reasons, can always be given for coming te the
conclusion that this is net the proper time to
do anything to take us along the way of progress.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I admit quite willingly
that our banking system is excellent. I consider that it is one of the best in the world,
and that we have every right to be preud of
it. That system has successfully withstood the
test of time and- of the great crisis which
occurred around 1930. Yes, it is a sound system and is remarkably strong and efficient,
but up to date it bas been characterized-and
I am net criticizing it-by a desire for safety,
a sense of prudence so perfect that it deserves
the epithet "conservative" in the fullest sense
of the term. From this desire for safety and
a desire for liquidity of loans and securities,
it follows that the chartered banks grant only
commercial loans and do not provide-and it
is not their function te do so-long term
accommodation. On the other hand, it is well
known that insurance companies have made
it their policy not te make loans on industrial
property. And finally the investment bankers,
who will underwrite a bond issue or undertake
to sell the securities of firms already well
known because they have existed during a
more or less prolonged period of time, will
almost invariably turn down the applications
of new or 'of purely local concerns. There may
be a few exceptions to this rule, but I am
speaking of the general practice which is a
matter of public notoriety.
I might refer to an example given before
the Committee on Banking and Commerce in
another place, as it appears at pages 1594 and
1595 of No. 47 of the Minutes of Proceedings
of that Committee. To repeat briefly the
illustration used by Dr. Clark, let us imagine
a small plant already in existence and, manufacturing a good product on a limited scale.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN.

The market for this product is developing.
This small concern-we may call it an infant
industry-in order te progress and expand
must have additional fixed capital.
The
owners of the plant are able to finance from
season to season with their ordinary working
capital, but cannot expand unless they secure
additional permanent capital. I am convinced
that at the present time such a concern cannot
obtain, on reasonable terms, at all events, the
fixed capital required to carry on the volume
of business which may now be donc. The
purpose of the Industrial Development Bank
is to cover precisely such cases by enabling
small concerns of the type just mentioned to
enlarge during the reconstruction period, to
apply new and scientific processes, to experiment in the field of electronics, plastics and so
forth. Our present system does net enable
returned men or men demobilized from war
industries to carry on industrial operations to
the largest extent possible.
The Industrial
Development Bank, however, will perform this
most useful function. It will fulfill a role of
real national importance, a role of vital
interest to all well-meaning and progressivelyminded Canadians by contributing to the maintenance of a high level of national income,
thereby making possible the social progress of
our own people.
To the sacred cause of social progress and
economic improvement I do not pay only lip
service. I have devoted the greater part of
my life to the study of labour problems. I
belong by birth, of course, to the so-called
"superior classes" but I do net call myself a
capitalist. I have, so te speak-and I say it
very sincerely-given my heart to our working
classes, because they have suffered much.
Our most pressing need at this time is to
raise the standard of living of the great
popular masses of our people, to secure ceoperation between capital and labour, to give
equal opportunities to those engaged in
ndustry and offer a fair chance te working
men, te encourage small-scale plants and to
multiply them from one end of the land to
the other. This is the main purpose of the
Bill before us.
With permission of the House, I would quite
willingly move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. KING: Can you net finish now?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: My remarks will probably take ten minutes.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Make it five.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I do not think this
discussion should be cut off, and if it is the
pleasure of my honourabIe friend to adjourn
the debate, I should be very pleased to participate in it later.

The Senate resumed; at 3 p.rn.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
now let us corne ta somne of the criticisrns that
have been made of the Industrial Development
Bank Bill. In the naine of prudence somne
persons-I arn willing to concede that they
are well-meaning-argue that this truly
national plan of industrial development is s0
speculative in its nature that the taxpayers'
rnoney should not be expended upon it. I
arn, honourable senators, a prudent man, moderate in temperament. But I amn not timorous; I do nýot suifer from an inferiority
complex; and to persons who are afraid of this
mensure or, to repent the words that were
used in another place, who are shivering on
the threshold of the better worl that we are
building for those who are now fighting oversens, or working in our war plants or in our
fields in the sultry hent of this summer day,
I say the best gunrantee of the.success of the
new bank is the nbility, the reliability and
experience of its directors, who are also
directors of the Bank of Canada. Personally
I arn quite willing to place my trust in the
Governor of the Bank of Canada, a wellrccognized "ace" in financial rnatters, and the
staff wbom hie will appoint ta assist him in
administering and managing the Industrial
Development Bank.
No one is justified in assuming or suspecting
that the new bank will flot be wiscly and
prudently managed in the intercsts of smaîl
industries. The mensure wiil benefit ail the
provinces. I do not wonder whether one
province or one clnss of people will be benefitcd more than another. In the Maritimes or
in Western Canada, for instance, emaîl businesses may require more assistance than
similar firme in the highly industrialized provinces of Ontario and Quebec. The rnajority of
Qucbcckers, I am. sure, coneider as I do that iii
is the duty of every one of us to contribute
to the expansion of industry in ail parts of the

tributed ail over Can~ada, the better it:w
be for the welfare and contentment of iour
population. Up to the present time -such
industries, have flot had an adequate chance.
That is a fact. I do flot criticize the banks,
nor do I intend to discuss the monopolistie
tendencies that have practically killed imall
industries in my own province and done so
much harm to the working classes in general.
1 only ask whether it is not clear that the creation and growth of small and medium-sized
industries should be encouraged nîl over Canada.
The plan proposed under this measure will,
by decentralizing industry, make our interests
frorn coast to coast more nearly identîcal. It
will help greatly, I arn sure, to consolidate the
different regions and elements in our Dominion. With nîl my heart I believe in such a
policy of national consolida'tion, or integration,
if you prefer that word. It is a policy urgently
required at presen-t ini every sphere of activity.
This measure will also tend to bring about
a more equitable distribution of -wenlth and
contribute to the stability and general
development of Canada; it will have a consolidating effect on the whlwde of our national
structure.
I trust that the new bank will operate succ*essfully and satisfactorily. Only if losses are
suffered can the taxpayers bô called upon to
shoulder a burden, and I arn confident that
losses will not occur frequently; at *the worst,
losses will be kept within reasonable limite.
As a senator from Quebec-still proud to pronounce the good old name of my native
province, which some people try in vain to
make the scapegoat of the Dominion-I wish
to assure bonourable memrbers that if we are
ever called upon ta make payments in order
to meet obligations of the new bank, the
complaint, will flot be made by Quebeckers,
whether English-speaking or Frencb-speaking,
that such payments are out of alI proportion
ta the benefits received by us. Our sincere
desire is simply to see that the new undertaking shaîl operate ta the general advantage
of the Canadian population at large. Our
patriotism, thank God, is indeed broad enough
to embrace the whole of the immense territory
of this country, and our thoughts are generous
enough to include the variaus regians of the
Dominion, wbich are so different economically
and otherwise. We muet sincerely endeavour,
while there is stiil tirne, te consolidate, to
integrate and ta unify this wonderful country
of ours. I have always opposed isolationisrn

words that I spoke in Quebec I arn willing
to speak also in Ontario, the great province in
which our national capital is situated.
Again I favour a policy of co-operationyesterday of agricultural co-operation, to-day
of industriai co-operation. I arn confident that
in apeaking as I do now I speak in the name
of my province, my dear province, which is
again the object of so much abuse. Let me
declare plainly to ail whomn it may concern
that it is absolutely unfair to denounce the
good, stable and courageous people of Quebec
as being fanaticai separatists. Everybody
knows perfectly well, or should know, that
our population is deeply Christian and lawabiding. It is conscientious, honest, hardworkîng and thrifty, and lias always shown its
sense of loyalty and stability, even in the nçost
difficuit and most provocative circumstances.
My last words on behaîf of the race to
which I arn proud to belong shahl be to assure
you that we fully realize our obligation to
contribute to the progress of our country; and
we understand that this progress depends of
course, first of ail, upon victory against our
common enemy. Quebec has proved its willingness to participate ini the defence of our
territory. Quebec ie always willing to cooperate; but the same cannot be said of
certain other people. We fully realize our
duty towards our returned men, our munition
workers and the like, and for the sake of every
one of thema we are anxious to contribute
to the industrial expansion and econornic
decentralization of Canada in order to make
ail our Canadian people more prosperous,
more contented, more united; and for this, as
a firet condition, we must ensure employment
to, the .rising generation, the sons and daughters
of our country. Because our Christian parents
raised large families in good old Quebec, we
do not believe that we appear before the
world in a shameful rois. We are proud of
our large families, and because of this pride
we fully recognize our responsibilities in providing for the welfare and prosperity of ail
Canadian chiîdren-not o'nly those of our own
province but also those of our sister provinces.
In this way we acknowledge our willingness
to, contribute to the industrial development
of ail Canada.
,Our policy is co-operation-co-operation
upon an equal footing of democratic brotherhood, co-operation everywhere and aIl the
time. We ask fair play for ail classes and
ahl provinces. Different races with different
religious ýbeliefs form our young but already
promising Canýadian nation. Powerful reactionary and disintegrating forces are now
working together against our liberal ideas,
against our national ideai of moderation and

harmony, of justice and progress. The present,
Bill is a measure of justice to small industry.
It will prove to our small industrialists and to
our population at large that there is to be no
discrirnïnation in our Canada of to-morrow, no
undue privilege in Vhis better land of the
future.
We are glad to have the opportunity today of offering in a practical way our contribution to the economic expansion which we
are anxious to inaugurate with the coming era
of blessed peace. We desire peace for the
whole world; but charity begins at home, and
we hope that appeals to prejudice wiil not continue to endanger our internai peace. Yesl
We must win peace, not only externally but
also. internally. In spite of all provocations
let us work together like good partners for
pPaee, progre.'s and harmony.
The legislation which it is now my privilege
to support makes precisely for peace, harmony
and progress, from the industriai as well as
from the social standpoint. The Bill moreover
is in complete accordance with my democratie
id4eal. It is not state socialism. On the contrary, it puts the financial resources of the
state at t.he service of private enterprise,
which deserves suchi assistance and cannot find
it elsewhere. It will be a great pleasure for
me to vote in favour of the Bill.
Hon, W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I arn going to speak briefly on this
Bill. I find myseif very much in accord with
the views expressed this mornîng by the
honourable leader -on the other side (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne). I have read a good deal about
the purpose of this Bill, and have studied the
evidence taken hefore the Standing Committee of the flouse of Commons on Banking and
Commerce, to which the Bill was referred, but
I must confess that I arn quite unable to see
any necessity for it. True, it is probably
another step towards socialism, but I think
already this session we have taken enough
steps in that directionSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: -and 1 do not feel
inclined to take very many more.
Let us look at this Bill. Statements have
been made about our banking system whîch
seemn to me Vo, be quite incorrect. I arn not a
banker. I only know the banking business
from the customners' side of the counter. The
honourable senator who lias just taken bis
seat (Hon. Mr. Gouin) said this morning that
our chartered banks wouid not make long
term boans. That is flot so. They make loans
for as long as five years at a time on proper
security. No one should want a loan for a
mucli longer period. I have known bank boans

AUGUST 11, 1944
to run six, seven and eight years, yet the
chartered banks have made no great fue so
long as a real honest attempt was being made
Vo grad-ually pay off the loans.
My feeling is that the proposed .industrial
bank will invade the business of the chartered
banks, without there being any necessity whatsoever for such action. We are told that this
bank is to lend money to those to whom credit
is not available elsewhere. Well, if credit is
flot available at any branch bank, the manager
of which knows everyone in the community
and is in the best position to weigh the
chances of succesa or failure of any industry to
be started on a bank loan, why should credît
be available anywhere else? IV 'looks Vo me
as if this industrial 'bank would be expected
to make loans Vo people who are very doubtful
ri.sks. But evidently that is flot what Mr.
Graham Towers, the Governor of the Bank
of Canadia, intends. His view is that the
Industrial Bank should loan money in exactly
the samne way as it is loaned by the chartered
banks. H1e gave evidence before the Banking
and Commerce Committee of the other House.
At page 1644 of the Committee's Proceedings
Mr. Towers was asked:
Q. In rny next question, Mr. Tower, perhaps
I had better include the Hon. Ministe of
Justice. In order to protect these industries
will it be -the policy Vo do so *by tariff protection, to shut out impo:rts that might cozmpete
and might even destroy an industry which had
received public assistance?

To this Mr. Towers answered:
WelI, as you say, perliaps that is a question
which should nlot be answered by myseif, but
I would say that the lending institution would
operate in exactly the same way as any other
lending institution from that point of view.
So there is no difference of method there.
AV page 1647 Mr. Towers was asked this
question and made this answer:
Q. What I arn now trying Vo bring out, perhaps in my novice way, is this. We are bringing
in an Industriel Developrnent Bank Bill here
Vo provide money for induetry in competition
wit money that is avaîlable, or credit that is
available to the extent of 2 -billion dollars in
the chartered banks. T'hat is correct?-A. No.
Because if an industrial concern could obtain
credit either f rom -the 'banks or through the
open mnarket on reasonable terms, as the Bill
indicates, it is noV the intention that the
Industrial Development B.ank should fi11 those
needs..
In other words, if the security is noV good
enough for a chartered bank then the Industrial Bank does noV want Vo have anything Vo
do with iV. Mr. Towers was also asked
whether Vhe Industrial Bank would advance

funds in connection with a certain fishing
industry. H1e replied:
If the particular enterprises concerned had
sufficient inoney of their own to put up, and

if the particular proposition looked as îx it
was going to be successful and therefore was
going. to be a reasonable bank risk.
Well, is that flot the exact basie on which the
chartered banks work Vo-day? The charte&red
banks wil lenL money on any reasonable risk.
Then why should we in-vade their field? I am
not pleading the cause of the banks. I have
neyer discussed this Bill with bankers, and
do flot know how they regard it; but I do
know from deallng with banks that they are
more than reasonable Vo their customers, and
I arn quite sure Vhey would consider and help
any legîtimate proposition. Surely, then, we
do noV need- Vo start a bank to help a lot of
lame duck&-tihat is, to put mo-ney into projects whir-h from the outset we are sure will
noV be successful.
As I have said before, I do noV quite see
why we should- have a bank of this kind aV

But be that as it may, Vhey. have local

SENATE

I 'have tried to suggest again and again that
it should not do so, will not do so unless it is
mismanaged. It will loan money to enterprises
where already capital is invested or where
capital from private sources is being provided.
So will any chartered bank; it will be glad to
get the business.
The banks' loans will supplement that private
capital to the extent that the lending institution
thinks it can sa-fely do so.
A member of the Committee said:
That is not provided in the Act.
to which Mr. Towers replied:
That depends on the management. The inanagement should not give money away; in ether
words, it should not take foolish risks; and if

the management is capable it will not do so.
Hon. Mr. KING:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: What kind of risk is
it going ta take? The chartered banks would
lend money on any good sound economic risk.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

No.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Did I understand the
honourable leader to say they would nat?
Hon. Mr. KING: There are certain risks
they will not take. We understand that. That

Hon. Mr. DAVIES:

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think that the
point overlooked by the honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) is that this
Bill provides for loans on capital extensions
and semi-improvements. As I understand it,
the Bank Act permits the chartered banks to
make loans for commercial purposes in connection with the turnover of business, but not
for capital development.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I think you are wrong.
Provided they get proper security, the chartered banks will make loans for reasonable
developments where the money is to be spent
upon bricks and mortar. I quite agree that they
will not take a mortgage on a building, but
they will take a bond mortgage as security for
a loan -to be used in erecting a building-and
that is practically the same thing. I am
speaking from personal experience. .
However, my purpose in rising was ta speak
on a different point. I have criticized this Bill
to some extent because I do nat think the
proposed Industrial Development Bank is
necessary, since the chartered banks would,
if given the opportunity, do almost anything
desired of them. What I want to speak about
principally, though, is the lack of a provision
lon. Mr. DAVIES.

that should have been in this Bill, if the Bill
is to be passed at all. To-day, under the very
heavy impact of taxation, there is no way by
which the estate of a man whose money is
tied up in his business can borrow funds with
which to pay succession duties. The honourable gentleman from Saskatchewan North
(Hon. Mr. Horner) told us yesterday of a large
business that had been built up in an American
city from a small blacksmith shop. Such things
happen in this country. Let us assume that
a man starts out in his early youth as a blacksmith. He is an inventive genius, and in time
he builds up a business, on a relatively small
scale, for the manufacture of implements or
things of that kind. He takes his two sons in
with him, and instead of withdrawing the
profits he ploughs them back into the business.
In order to facilitate banking and other
arrangements, he incorporates the company,
the directors and shareholders probably being
himself, his two sons and his wife. The profits
are not withdrawn, but are ploughed back into
the business, and when the founder of the
company dies the business is worth say,
$150,000 or $200,000. All the money that he
has made in his lifetime is in that business.
If the company is in Ontario the succession
duties will be heavy, for they are imposed by
both the Dominion and the province, and are
supposed to be paid within six months. Now,
what I should like to know is how the estate
is going to get money te pay those duties.
The beneficiaries can draw money out of the
business in only one way, by dividends; but
these are so heavily taxed that probably the
net receipts would be less than 50 per cent of
the amount paid out.
It is in cases such as this that I think an
industrial bank might have been of real benefit.
The succession duties might run as high as
$50.000,
and
the
executors
might find
chartered banks rather leary about lending that
amount on the security of the company. In
this country there are thousands of family
companies similar to the one I mention in this
hypothetical case, and it seems ta me that this
Bill might well have contained a provision for
making long term loans to enable executors
ta pay succession duties without having ta sell
out the business. Such a provision would have
been of great benefit, not to new industries
but ta established industries.
As things are at present, in a case such as I
have mentioned the executors could not borrow from a chartered bank or from the new
Industrial Development Bank, and in order to
obtain $50,000 cash with which to pay the
succession duties the business would probably
have ta be sold. And there is one curious
feature about this. Although the executors,
who are directors and shareholders of the

AUOUST 11, 1944
company, could nlot borrow from the Industrial
Developrnent Bank, outsiders could corne
along, form a new cornpany with a capitalization of $200,000, put up $75,000 of it themselves, and apply to the Industrial Development Bank for a Jean of 3125,000; and if the
loan was granted, as it probably would be they
could use the $200,000 for the purchase of the
company. It seerns to me that this Bill could
have been cfrafted a littie more in favour of
family industries and a littie less in favour of
mythical industries that are supposed to, spring
up aIl over the place.
That is the point I wanted to make. It has
been on my mind ever since the Industrial
Development Bank was first mentioned in the
Speech from the Throne. Some way must be
provided by which the estate of a man who
lias but up a successful family company may
be able to pay succession duties without having to resort to sale of the business. Auditors
and lawyers throughout the country are urging
men over sixty to dispose of their business
interests, so that when they die-and men of
that age bave to Iook at these things seriously
-there will be sufficient money in their
estates to meet succession duties and prevent
their faniilies from being financially ruined.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, it seems to me that in the
approacli to this Bit! a certain degree of confused thinking bas been apparent on the part
of honourable members who have referred to
the personnel of the Industrial Development
Bank's board whule overlook-ing the actual
purpose of the Bill. To my mind the question
that arises pre-eminently is whether or not
there is in the industrial field of Canada a need
for the class of capital boans provided for by
this measure; and secondly, if we satisfy our
minds on that point, whether the proposed
organization for dealing with this class of
business is satisfactory in its practical field of
operation. I think my honourable friend from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) lias just voiced
a popular misconception, which was expressed
iiu the Banking and Commerce Committee of
the other House and lias been frequently
stated in other circles, insidie and outside of
Parliament, to the effeet that the Industrial
Development Bank will offer credit facilitiem
to persons who woubd not be accepted as good
risks by the chartered banks. That, I believe,
is an incorrect conclusion to draw from the
Bill. As I understand it, the Bibl lias one
objeet, and one objeet only: to make it legal
for the Bank of Canada, through this subsidiary organization, to supply credit of a character altogether different from the credit that
can legally be supplied by chartered banks.

The chartered banks have neyer been permitted and are not now permitted to engage
in any such class of business as that which it
is proposed the Industrial Development Bank
shall handie. 1V is flot intended that the
Industrial Development Bank shahl go out
into the highways and by-ways of this country
offering to extend credit to customers whose
security woubd not be acceptable to the
chartered banks.
My honourable friend from Saskatchewan
North (Hon. Mr. Horner) and other honourable members referred yesterday to the definite need in the field of agriculture for a
measure such as Bill 134, which is designed to
encourage the provision of intermediate terni
and short term credit to farniers for the
improvement and development of farms. It
seems to me that the need for a similar cbass
of credit in the industrial field is just as great,
and that the Bull now before us is a response
to that need. The question arises whether
that cbass of credit can best be provided by
the chartered banks of this country, or through
this Industrial Deveboprnent Bank, under the
direction and control of the Bank of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask rny honourable
friend a question? How lias that credit been
provided in the past?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
provided.

It lias not been

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I arn well aware
thaV, as was stated by the honourable gentleman froni Kingston, in exceptional cases the
chartered banks have made it possible for
certain of their clients to borrow money for
capital development. The popular f ormn of
security given in these cases is debentures or
bonds, against which the banks make the
required boans. But those exceptions must
surely prove to anyone's satisfaction that the
wide field of industrial developrnenV for
aspiring young men who have had industrial
and teclinical experience buV no oVher capital
assets, cannot be served by tbaV claas of
loans. The cbartered banks are fanding a
way to make such loans as my honourable
friend from Kingston lias described. But
these are the exception rather than the rule.
and realby go to prove that the chartered
banks have noV been in a position publicly
to appeal for the class of business which this
Bill woubd empower the proposed Industrial
Development bank to undertake.
So far as I know our banks have not at
any time represented, publicly or otherwise,
that they want to engage in the, kind of
business provided for by this Bibl; but

446

SENATE

because of that fact, it dues flot follow, nor
is it correct to say, that the proposed industrial
bank will attract a class of business which
is flot acceptable te the chartered hanks.
The Bank Act, as I have already pointed out,
does not permit the chartered banks te handIe
any but commercial loans.
1 arn quite frank in saying that I should
like to know more about the forin of organÀzation of the industrial bank. What will be the
extent of the branch system referred to in. the
Bill, and wiIl its personnel be recruited from
the staff of our chartered ban'ks or will an
entirely new type of employees be engagedýemployees without any particular business
experience? Organization and personnel are
vital to the proper development and management of the proposed bank. The Bill is not
very clear in these particulars. We may be
able te, secure the information in committee.
Wbile there is flot any definite provision in
the Bill, there would be no reason why,
through its auxiliary, the Bank of Canada
should not in future co-operate with the
chartered banýks in developing this kind of
business.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The relationsbip in
this particulýar field between the industrial
bank and the chartered banks may be mucli
the same as that which bias developed during
the past ten years between the Bank of
Canada and the chartered hanks, witb good
results te the Dominion as a whole, botb
domestically and international]y.
The operatiens of the War Contracts
Depreciation Board, which lias been functioning since 1940, bias, it seemns to me, a very
definite hearing upon the prospective operation
of this kind of institution. The board was set
up for the purpese of assisting manufacturers
who desired to make capital expenditures on
plant extension for the purpeses of war
industry. The board, was presided over by a
judge, assisted by two ether menîbers, one
an accountant and the other a representative
of labeur. I have flot hîŽard the slighltcst
adverse criticism cf the board, which, through
fis own particular channel, hias autlierized the
spcnding of millions cf dolla~rs in eider te
increase the war production cf our industrial
plants and provided a ratio cf write-offs over
a period cf four or fiva years.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: ]Did net the leader cf the
C.C.F. party ebject te that being donc in
respect cf ene particular cempanyl It is a

famous case.
Hon.

Mr. LAMBERT.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: That may be so, but
it does net apply to, what I have ini mind in

this connection. Through the War Contracta
Depreciation Board the Government has
advanced vast sums of money for capital
expenditure, and this bas enabled Canada to
play its part in the industrial war effort. I
would recommend any bonourable member
who is interested in the subject to, apply to
the Department of Munitions and Supply for
details of what has been done. He will find
that as a result of the capital help received
through the War Contracts Depreciation
Board many of our smaîl industries were able
to make an impressive contribution to our
war effort. I amn sure my honourable friend
is familiar witb the case of a smaîl concern
in the city of Winnipeg, conducted by two
brothers--I will flot give their names. Before
the war they were repairing aeroplanes and
making aeroplane pontoons. By means of
capital assistance received through the board,
they have been able te build up an îndustry
which will, I hope, continue to expand in the
pest-war period. But during the war years the
earnings of this and other industries have been
far beyond their orignal capital structure, and

by way of taxes they have had te centribute
about 80 per cent of their net profits te the
Goviernment, lcaving them with ne werking
capital te meet future needs. I know of
another case of three brethers engaged in a
garage business in a small town within fifty
miles of Toronto. They îîndertoek, te make a
particular part cf aeroplane radioecquipment.
Threugh the hclp of the board tliey have in
the past three or four years expanded their
business volume te over $1,000,000 a year. But
although taxation bas left t.hem without, nny
working capital whatsocver. lie %vould indeed
be a shert-sighted nman wh.e weuld net predict
for these brethers a preminent position in the
future industrial life of Canada. Tiiese are
the type cf cases that I think the prcpcsed
industrial bank is designed te serve.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Those are establisbed
businesses. Is it the purpese of this Bill te,
cerne te their aid when tbey are in need of
help?
Honi. Mr. LAMBERT: I would remind the
heneurable senater frem Kingston that they
are net estahhished industries. They were
simply workshops before the war, but their
ewners, through their skill and energy, were
able te make a very substantial contribution
te the industrial output of the country in
furtherance of our war effort. The peint is
that through the operation cf the War Contracts Depreciation Board these men hy
their skill, their confidence and their ability
te do a job well have created a large capital

AUGUST i1, 1944
expansion of their plant, but they now find
theinselves without working capital, due to
the heavy war taxation, which often enough
lias been the subject of discussion in this
Chamber. These smali industries bhat have
expanded during the war will become an
important factor in the ,post-war develc>pment
of this country if by taking advantage of the
provisions of this Bill they can, through the
Industrial Development Bank, receive the
necessary help to enable them to build up a
sufficient capital reserve out of operating
profits.
This war has enlisted the services of a vast
number of young men at the thresbold of their
career. Most of them, whether in the Air
Force, the Navy or the Army, have been given
an intensive mechanical and technical training. Mnny of them will for the first time be
looking forward to an industrial 'career in
Canada, and it seems to me that the greater
opportunity in the field of industry that we
can offer to young men of that type the better
it will be for their future and for the future
of Canada. They certainly deserve well at the
hands of this country.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
until the honourable gentleman from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) spoke I had not intended
ta take part in this discussion. The honourable member from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies)
has raised the question of succession duty. My
honourable friend from Ottawa, says that
though men have done well in war industry,
war taxation has absorbed ail surplus profits
and thus deprived them of working capital.
Taxation has taken away moniey from ail who
have earned it. What are we goîng to dolend the money back to them? My lionourable
friend from Ottawa lias referred to a couple of
brothers in Winnipeg. I know them quite
well. To-day we have the largest industrial
machine in the history of Canada and thouglitfui persons are wondering what we are going
to do with it after the war. The proble.m we
have to face is not that of helping out some
new industry. I appreciate the fine idealism
of the speech of the honourable member from
De Saiaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin), but under
this Bill we shahl be deaiing witl'i other
peopie's money, not our own. When the taxpayer dies you are going to say to his executors:
"You have got to pay us $50,000 in succession
duties, cash on the barrei-head, because we
made a loan to a company in Winnipeg and
lost 350,000." That in effect is what we shahI
be saying.
An Hon. SENATOR: No.

40~

Hon. Mr. HAIG: We shall be saying to
some other industry: "We have got to impose taxes on you ta pay a loas on thone
boans."l That is why our taxes are increaaing.
Take the successful war industry to which my
honourable friend referred. To-day it is not a
question of selling the produet; ail a producer
has to worry about is how to get materiala.
Certainly industrialists can make money today-anybody could make money under sucli
conditions. I have known the suembers of that
firm for thirty-five years. They are fine feliows.
They are making money because the Government gives them orders for a mucli as they
can produce. These garage people also are
making money, for the same reason. There are
plenty of industries like these ail over the'
country to-day, and for the if e of me I
cannot see why any money should be taken
out of my pocket to lielp start new ones.
I have a sympathetic feeling, as we ail have,
towards young men and women who came
home from the war. But observe lite, and
you will see that the people who succeed
were not fed with pap. In every walk of lite
that is true. Take farming, for instance.
My honourable friend from Saskatchiewan
North (Hon. 'Mr. Hramer) is a guccesaful
farmer; but some farmers in the same neiglibourhood may be unable ta, get along witliout
assistance. My honourable friend from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) is a good, grain
man, one of the best in Canada, and lie did
not have ta be helped, ta, make a succes
of lis business. Dozens of other firme that
were started at the same time as hie was are
now forgotten.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That kind of thing
is always happening.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The reason my honourable friend from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies)
is worrying about succession duties is that he
Lots of
is a successful newspaper man.
newspaper men in this country d-o not have
ta worry about such things, for if they died
to-morrow their estates would not have to
pay any tax. The same thing is true throughout industry. Some firms expand gradually,
and as new capital is needed they issue bonds,
which are sold locally or provincially, and
sûmetimes throughout the Dominion. People
buy these bonds if they know the companies
stand a good chance of being successful.
Such conditions will continue.
I have neyer had any fear about a man
of ability getting on, wbether in law, medicine,
newspaper work, merchandising, shipping, grain
handling, farming, or any other Ene of activity.
The honourable. gentleman from Thunder
Bay-I hope lie will pardon my referring to

448

hlm again-has a large staff of men and wornen
working for hirn. H1e does flot need to be told
wbo are the people of ability in hais organization, for they corne to, the top. That is true
in every business. There is no difficulty in
getting money for any enterprise if you can
show the public that it will be made to pay.
After the war there will be too much money
available, rathar than too littie. The interest
rate is down to 3 per cent now. Large
numbers of people who saved a few thousands
of dollars for thaîr old age, expecting to draw
an income at 5 per cent, now are unable to
get much more than haif that rate.
We are taking the first step towards socialism. If I believed, in socialismn I should hold
up both bands for this Bill, for it is the thin
edge of the wedge. Goverament maney is
ta be lent ta business enterprises. We experirnented with that kind of thing in Manitoba,
in two fields: we triad to help farmers ta
boy stock, cattle and hersesHon. Mr. KING: I do flot wish to interrupt my honourable friend, but I arn sure
he is desirous nlot to ýmislead the buse.
H1e says the Government will be lending
money ta, finance business enterprises. As
I explained this morning, the first allotment
of the Industrial Development Bank's stock,
$10,000,000, will be taken up by the Bank
of Canada, and further allotrnents are ta be
offered to the public, wbo will be free ta
buy or flot.
Han. Mr. HAIG: What is the total capital,
$200,000,000?
Hon. Mr. KING: $100,000,000.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That will be the taxpayers' money.
Hon. Mr. KING:

No, flot at aIl.

Han. Mr. HAIG: The $10.000,000 put up
by the Bank of Canada will be the taxpayers'
m oney.
Hon. Mr. KING: No.
Han. Mr. HAIG: Tha Goveronent bas fno
meanýs of getting rnoney excapt out of taxpayers.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: My bonourable
friend surely knows that the Bank is expected
ta get back its capital investments out of the
business it does.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I say that thc capital will
not bc returned out of earnings. If the Bank
does what my hionaurable friend from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) said, it wilI not make
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

any boans; and if it does what my honaurable
friand from Ottawa (Honm Mr. Larnbert) said,
it will lose monay.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:
My
honourable
friend has in mind the evidence given by Mr.
Towers bafare the Banking and Commerce
Committee of another place. Mr. Towers was
simply stating that the Industrial Development
Bank would flot necessarily accept every application for a loan, but that eacb application
would be subjected ta tbe saine standard of
examination as wauld be applied by a chartered bank.
Hors. Mr. HAIG: That is exactly what rny
bonourable friend fromn Kingston saîd.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Thv point is that Mr.
Towers was referring ta a different class of
boan.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A banker bas naver rnade
that kind of boan and would not inake it naw.
The saine criterian is used by prospective
purchasers of bonlds offered on the market.
Take the Aluminum, Company of Canadathat is the cornpany I referred ta just naw.
Mr. Caldwell, the leader of the C.C.F., coinplained bitterly about the anmant wbieb that
company was allowed for depreciatian. Imcidentally, I notice this year it is $34,000,000.
Han. Mr. LAMBERT: Did yo

The depraciation was

votes and bis appanent gat 11,000.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Did you agree witb
Mr. Coldwell's criticism of the board on that
score?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbat i.s nat the issue.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Yes, it is. My bonourablo friend asked a, question a7nd answered
it at the sanie time. I knew ha was referring
ta tIre Aluminum Company of Canada, and
right here and now I want. ta make an absalute denial that Mr. Coldwelb's criticism of tbe
board's action wvas correct. It w as prox cd in
the other Housa by the Ministar of Munitions
and Supply that the criticism was withaut any
decent foundation whatever. That is why I
should like ta know whiether my honaurable
fricnd agrcas with Mr. Coldwall.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Coldwell made certain charrges, and Mr. Crcrar went out ta the
Selkirk constituancy and attamptad ta reply
ta them on a public platfarm. In every part

449

AUGUST 11, 1944
of the constituency where Mr. Crerar spoke

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Does that show that
Mr. Crerar was not right?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; but it shows t'at the
people beiieved Mr. Coldweli. Publie opinion
in this country is aroused over that tbing.
The day will came-I say this quite candidiy
-wben my bonourabie friend from Kingstan
wiil regret tbat he did not fight against this
Bill more vigorously. The lasses under it wiii
be tremendous. We experimented with this
kind af thing in Manitoba, by making rural
credits availabie, and we lost tbousands of
dollars. In the district of Roblin, for instance, a man had about $400,000 aut an boans
ta farniers, and the boans were sbaky. The
rural credits peaple came in, farmed a society,
and said, "We will teacb so and so that he
cannot charge 6 or 8 per cent." He got bis
money hack, and tbe province of Manitoba
toak the loss.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Did the province
of Manitoba go into the elevatar business too?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Yes, and had a similar

Hon. Mr. KING: But the Industrial
Deveiopment Bank will ha managed 'by men
wha know the banking 'business.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Theareticaliy, under ideai
conditions, this new bank wouid be a success;
but in the matter-of-fact business world it will
not be. The reasan is that people do not Iike
ta harrow money fram a governmenýt. Wby
do men who couid make boans fro.m friends
prafer ta ga ta banks and pay a bigher rate
of intereat? Because tbey do not want ta
disclase their business aiffairs ta friends. No
business man will borrow money from a government institution if he can get it anywhere
else. Tbe Government migbt change, and
then you cauid nat tell what would happen.
Even the Government supparted by my bonourabie friends opposite may change.
Hon. Mr. QUINN:

Not "may," but "wiil."

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will nat go that f ar,'
for I have taken part in so many elections and
bad sa many surprises that I arn neyer sure.
I do nat like this Bibl, wbich is advacatedand bargeiy, if tbe truth were known-by the
bead of the Bank of Canada bimseif.
Han. Mr. KING: No, no.
Han. Mr. HAIG:

Yes.

Han. Mr. KING: He gave reasans, sufficient reasons, for supporting the rneasure.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is bis Bill.
Hon. Mr. KING- I have great respect for
hie abiiity.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Because of bie control,
aver the Bank of Canada he wouid have control over part of the field in wbich the new
bank will operate. None of these officiais
should be allowed to have anything at al
to do with this new bank, because it will be
in campetition with other businesses that they
control.
I have neyer been convinced that anything
would keep an industry from getting started
and prospering if its prornaters were men of
reai ability. I arn persuaded that our problem after this war will be, not how to establish
new industries, but haw to, enable the industries we aiready have to keep going. The
solution of th-at prablem. will depend on world
trade more than on anytbing else. You cari
talk as much as you like about ail -these social
ideas that are in the air just now. They are
being tried out aco as to head off the C.C.F.,
and I do flot thiink they will accomplish that.
We shall have the same aid experience witb
,this Indlustrial Deveiopment Bank as we have
bad witb other theareticaily sound enterprises;
that is, we shall have to take the loas. If that
does not happen, the reason will be that the
bank bas not made any boans at ail.
I arn sorry to have taken up s0 much ýtime,
but I want to say again that I arn opposed
absoluteiy to the Bill and ta its principle.
This new organization is nat necessary. It is
not a bank, and it shouid have been called
what in fact it is intended ta be, a maneylending corporabiou.
It is late in the session and, a bot day.
Already one honourable member of this Chamber bas coilapsed whýile arguing about this
proposed bank, and I arn nat a bit surprised.
I hope he will soan recaver.
Some HIon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I feel very keenly about
this Bill. Such business instinct as I have
tells me that the measure should neyer be put
into effect. Fmnancial assistance ta farmers
and to, fishermen is an altagether different
matter; if we lase maney an that, it can be
looked upon as a form af subsidy. But there
is no need wbatever af risking rnoney on boans
of thje kind contemplated by this Bill, for any
enterprise that is sound can get ail the money
it wants. Furthermore, as I bave already said,
immed-iateiy after the war there will be toc
many industries, and we shah bhave enaugh ta
do trying ta keep ýthem operating, without encouraging the establishment of new ones.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: If by amendment to
the Bank Act provision were made for the
chartered banks to deal in short term and
intermediate lans in the industrial field,
would the honourable gentleman agree then
to the principle of this Bill?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes and no. Yes, if that
is the way the loans should be made. No,
because I do not want to put anything on the
shoulders of the banks that might tie up their
money and jeopardize their stability. I do
not think that will happen with loans to
farmers and fishermen, or I would not be in
favour of such loans. Fundamentally, I want
to keep the banks sound, so that when I wish
to withdraw a deposit, say, of $200 I can do
so without question. The business should
be done through the banks if done at all.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I asked the question
because I understood from the honourable

there was aùy need for industrial expansion.

WAR SERVICE GRANTS BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House o£
Commons with Bill 184-, an Act to provide
for the payment of war service gratuities and
for the grant of re-establishment credits to
members of His Mai esty's forces in respect of
service during the present war.
The Bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. J. H. KING moved the second read-ing
of the Bill.
He said: Honourable senators, thîs Bill will
be of greatest interest to those who have been
serving in the armed forces of Canada during
this war, which began nearly five years ago.
It bas a personal application to them, and I
arn sure the Senate will endorse its passage.
One couhd say a great deal regarding the.
service rendered throughout the war period
by our variaus arnied forces and by the
people of Canada as a whole. It bas been
service of a character which, I arn sure, makes
Canadians proud. The world at large nas
taken notice of our contribution towards
victory.
Though victory is assured, the war is not
yet over, and no one can predict when it will
end. As I have remarked, we have been at
war for almost five years. Many men, and
women are daily retiring from the forces on
account of physical conditions brought about
by service, or because the Department of
National Defence finds it advisable to reduce
the ýpersonnel in certain branches. Therefore
it is necessary that a measure of this kind
should be enacted now.
The principal object of the Bill is to provide
war gratuities. We ail know that the pay of
men and women in the services is limîted, to
certain specified amounts. Rccently we have
passed measures to provide certain post-war
opportunities or advantages for ex-members
of the arined forces; and the present measure
is designed to give themn some token of the
appreciation of Parliament and the people.
No one would for a moment pretend that the
token wiIl in any way compensate thern for
the service they have rendered to their
country.

452

SENATE

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KING: I ar n ot disposed to
speak on the measure at great length. It is
divided into three parts, preceded by a section
defining various ternis.
Part I deals with war gratuities. The
amount of the gratuity will vary according to
the field of service in which the individual
member of the forces may have served. For
example, a man with one year's service in
Canada and two years' service overseas is
entitled to a gratuity of $450, to, be paid to,
him in monthly instalments. As honourable
members are aware, during the last session or
two we have passed legisiation to provide
certain benefits for returned men, sucli as
unernployment insurance, grants for vocational and university training and post-graduate training, and also for their re-.establishment in farming, fishing or industry, or to,
ena;ble them to buy a home. Returned men are
aiso entitled to reinstatement in the positions
they filled before the war, and to a preference rating in Civil Service examinations.
Part IH deals wvith re-establishment credit,
and Part III contains general provisions.
This Bill is the result of sustained study by
officiais of the army, naval and air services
and by ministers, deputy ministers and
others who will have to do with the administration of the proposed legisiation. I suggest
to honourablc senators that after we have
given the Bill second reading we should refer
it to committee, w'here officers of the department will give a detaiied expianation.
I move second reading.

Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
I do not risc for the purpose of opposing or
in any way impeding the passage of this very
important measure. On the contrary, I desire
to express my entire approval of this legisiatien. which indicates in a tangible way our
gratitude to the brave men and women of

Canada who have staked their ail in the service of their country.
Some Hon. SENATOIRS: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. WHITE: We cannot be too generorîs in our treatment of our sailors, soldiers

and airmen. I take it that this measure wilI
recompense fairly generously the

men

and

women who have served their country well.
I believe the people of Canada will wholeheartedly
endorse
this
very
important
legislation.
Somp Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. K. HIJGESSEN: I think honourable senators will agree, as the two speakers
who preceded me have said, that we in this
Ron. Mr. KING.

country are ail most anxious to do everything
we can to help our returned soldiers, sailors
and airmen to re-establish themselves in civihian life.
We have not had very much time, of course,
to examine into this Bill; hut hast evening I
did devote some timne hooking into is provisions, and it seems to me that the measure
has been very carefully thougbt out, and that
its provisions shouid appeal to honourable
members of the Senate as being a well-designed
effort to help the members of our armed services to rehabilitate tbemselves after this war.
As my honourable friend the Leader of the
Government has pointed out, the Bill is
divided into two parts. Part I makes provision
for the war service gratuity, and Part Il for
re-establishment credit.
The war service gratuity is payable, and I
think very justly so, on the basis of the length
of time that a man has served in Canada
and overseas. That gratuity is at the rate of
$7.50 a month. for each month served in
Canada or in the western hemisphere, and at
the rate of $15 per month in respect of oversens service. In addition to that, every man
whio served overseas gets a further grant of
seven days' pay and a.lowances for each six
months that be served overseas. I would point
out to honourable senators that this is the
only provision in the measure, which recognizes
a distinction in rank between officers and men.
The main gratuity is payahle on an equal
basis, regardless of the rank a mean niay have
helýd; but this extra provision of seven days'
pay and allowances for every six months of
overseas service gives some recognition to the
higher pay received by an officer.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: iDoes the termi "overseas service" incliîde iservice in Newfoundland
and the W\est Indies, or does the termi "western hemisphere" cover them?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSE'N: The terni "oversens" includes everything but the western
hcmnisphiere as defined in paragraph (j) of Section 2, namely:
"Western Hemispher-e" means ýthe continents
of North and South America, the islands
adjacenit theretîî anîd the territorial waters
thiereof, including Neivfoiniiîdiii(, Bencuida and
the W'est Inîdics buit exehiidiiig Gi eeîîland,
Iceland and the Aleutian Islands.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Does the provision respecting the seven days' pay for six
months service, which brings about a distinction according to rank, apphy to officers onhy?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Oh, no. It applies
to ail ranks; but, as I was pointing out, it is
the onhy provision of the Bill which makes any

M«JGUST 12, 1944
distinctions between officers and other ranks.
The war service gratuity, calculated on the
basis I have just mentioned, is flot payable to
a man in a lump sum on his discharge, but is
spread over a period of months at the rate of
pay hie was receiving at the time hie was discharged. In a minute or 'two I shall give
honourable senators an example of how it will
work out. I should point out that before a man
gets a gratuity under this Bill, by the regulations now existing lie wlll receive at the
moment of lis discharge one month's pay and
allowances to carry hlm over the first month
after discharge, and in addition a clothing
allowance whicli, as announced by the Minister
of National Defence, lias just been increased
fromn $65 to $100. In a word, hefore lie begins
to draw lis allowance under this measure, lie
will have received one montli's pay and allowances plus clothing allowance.
Part II of tlie Bill deals with wliat is called
re-establishment credit. The re-establishrWent
credit is equal in amount to the war service
gratuity; that is, it is equal to the amount lie
receives in cash montb by month, at the rate
of $15 per month for overseas service or $7.50
per month for service in Canada. If, for
instance, a man were entitled to a war service
gratuity of $400, lie would also lie entitled to
$400 of re-establisbment credit. But tliat is
not paid month by month; it is a sort of
capital sum wbich can be used at any time up
to tan years to pay to a man, or someone on
bis behaîf, certain sums to aid in bis civil
rebabil itation.
Now, tlie nine different purposes for which
the re-establisliment credit can be granted to
a man are set out ln Section 9 of tlie Bill.
Tliey are: the acquisition of a home; tlie repair
or modernization of bis home, if lie owns one;
the purcliase of furniture and liouseliold equipment; the provision of working capital for bis
profession or business; the purchase of tools,
instruments or equipment for bis trade. profession or business; tlie purcliase of a business;
the payment of life insurance premiums-Hon. Mr. QUINN: How does that apply in
the case of a man wbo already bas life insurae wlien lie goes ovxerseas and wlio blas made
provision for premiumn payments montlily,
semi-annually, or annually, and those payments bave been made in full up to tlie time
of bis arrival home?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I understand that
the re-establisbment credit can be applied
only to special war veterans insurance policies,
not to ordinary insurance.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I see.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: This special reestablisbment credit does not apply if a man
already lias taken advantage of certain other

453

provisions previously enacted for the benefit
of returned men, sucb, for instance, as the
Veterans' Land Act and the financial provision
under it, or the educational and vocational
scliemes already set up by tbe Government.
If lie lias accepted any of these benefits lie
does not get the re-establishment credit provided for in Part II of this Bi.ll. Part II in
that sense may be regarded as filling a gap,
because it really makes provision for men
wbo have not taken up land under the Settlement Act or received the ISenefits of educational or vocational training. It is a sort
of provision for the benefit of men who bave
not availed themselves of tlie educational or
land beniefits.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask the lionourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Will the fact that a
soldier overseas comas back to the position
lie formerly had interfere la any way with
lis getting these advances?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
Way.

No, not in any

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Suppose a man after
discharge decides to take a collage or university course, or to finish a course that lie
started before lie went aWay, how would that
apply?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am not familiar
witli aIl the datails ýf the provision wbich
has already been- nmade hy the Goverament
for the benafit of men who wisli to go to
collage. They are vcry extensive. In fact,
it is anticipated that about 30,000 of our
ovarseas men wil > go to college wlien the war
is over, and there are provisions by wbicli
their fees and living expensas will be paid.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Under somne other Bill?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. And if thMy
avail themselves of those provisions they do
not get the benefits under this measure.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable, senators,
thare is a possibility of a man availing himself
of the provisions of paragrapli (h) of Section
9. There are cases la whichl a returned man
who could not avaîl himself of the educational
opportunities given by the other Act miglit
avail himself of the benefits of this measure.
I think, however, my honourable friend is
quite rîglit in stating that the otlier provisions are more favourable for educational
purposas.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
indubitably 80.

I tbink that is

454

SENATE

I just want to point out that after the
last war there was no0 provision made for
anything similar to the re-establishment credit
set up by this Bill. The result after the last
war, as I think honourable members will agree,
was rather unfortunate. Returned men feit
that while serving overseas they had suffered
unduly in a financial sense as compared with
men who had stayed at home and worked
in munition factories at high wages. Civilians
had been able to better themselves in a capital way, by acqiiiring homes, furniture, and
so on, whereas the men overseas had received
no comparable benefit.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: The sanie thing, is true
niow.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It is in an attempt
to avoid giving cause for that state of mind
,on the part of returned men that this capital
sre-establishment fund is set up. My honourable friend from Pembroke (Hon. Mr. White)
will recaîl that among the ranks of the returned men after the last war there was
considerable agitation for a cash gratuity of
$2,000. 1 well remember the slogan- "We
want our $2,000." That slogan had its force and
its effeet because of the fact that the men who
had gone overseas feit they had lost out in a
capital way as compared, with men who had
stayed at home and worked at high wages.
The capital payment that may be applied for
the benefit of veterans of this war is, I think,
an answer to that cry, which was raised at the
end of the last war.
Pcrhaps it might be interesting to honourable senators if I were allowed to refer to my
own case, by stating, first of aIl what happened
to me after the last war and, secondly, what
benefits I should have received under the
present Bill had I served in this war. I served
in the hast war for approximately three vears:
s;ix months in Canada and two and a haif
years in England and France. Upon returning
to Canada I received, if my memory is correct,
a lump sum of $350. That was paid to me
shortly after demobihization, and it was aIl I
ever got. It seemed to, me to be a fairhy
generous provision, and I had no objection to
it whatever.
That was the way our soldiers were treated

after the last war: they were paid a lump sum.
Honourable senators will reahize that it is not
always advisable to pay a man a considerable
amount in one lump sum immediately after
he comes home from overseas. It may lead
to abuse, as in faet it sometimes did after

the last war.

A returned man whose nerves

are shattered has net his normal judgment,

and in some cases the lump sumn gratuity was
wasted or thrown away in a short time.
%In. Mr. HUGESSEN.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Many cases.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The war service
gratuity provided under Part I of this Bill
wihh be payable to the veteran, not in a lump
sum, but over a series of months, starting one
month after bis dîscharge, at the rate of pay
hie was receiving when last in the forces. To
my mmnd that is better froin the point of view

of a returned man than the old systemi was.
It means that during a period of four, five or
six months, or maybe longer, after his discharge he will receive a regular monthly ahlowance, whîich will permit bim to look around
and choose a means of re-establishing himsehf
in civil life.
With permission of honourable senators I
wihl refer again to my own case, in order to
show the amounts I should receive if at the
end of this war I were, as I was at the end
of the last war, an unmarried sergeant with
three years' service, two and a haîf years of
which were spent overseas. First of aIl, on
diseharge there would be one month's pay
and subsistence allowance, totalling $103, and
a clothing alhowance of $100. That is entirehy
apart from the benefits under the present Bill.
Then, under Part I of the Bill, I should be
entithed to a war service gratuity at the rate
of $7.50 a month for the six months' service
in Canada, $45; then at the rate of $15 a
month for the two and a haîf years overseas,
$450; and, thirdly, seven days' pay and allowances for every six months overseas, $120.
That wouhd, make a total war service gratuity
of $615, which would be paid to me at the
rate of approximately $103 a month for six
months after diseharge. So with the one
month's pay received on discharge, there
would be a period of seven months during
which I would be in receipt of a re-guhar
income and free to re-establish myself. The
amount payable to a married man with dependents would be larger, for it would be comnputed at his own rate of pay plus the
separation allowances for bis wife and children.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: AIl these payments
are free of taxes, I suppose.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Every amount payable under this hegislation is free of taxes.
Then under part Il of this measure a gratuity of $495 weuld be available after my
return for any of the nine capital purposes
enumerated

in section 9 of the Bill.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: In addition to the
$103 a month?

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. Thjs is the
re-establishment ahlowance.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: How do you get $495?

ATJGUST 12, 1944
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It is the same as
provided for by section 3 of the Bill: six
months at $7.50 and two and a half yeara at
$15-thiat is $4U plus SM5.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: In your own case?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: In iny own case.
That i8 the amount I should be entitled ta,
if my service had been in this war. I must
apologize ta honourable senators for referring
ta my own case.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: It is a goad way of
illustrating your point.
Hon. Mr. HIJGESSEN: It seemns ta me a
good way ta show how the ps.yments are
reckoned.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Aiter the last war
was it flot conceded that the gratuity accorded
to Canadian veterans was fairly generous in
comparison with the gratuities paid by other
countries?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I quite agree witb
my honourable friend; I think that the payment received hy Canadian ex-service men
after the last war was generous in coruparison
with what was given ex-service men of other
countries. But I sam sure lie will agree with
me that this is a stiil more equitable provision, and that it is better calculated, and in
view af the provisions of this Bull, will in al
probability be better applied.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Excuse me for interrupting. We must alsa keep in mind that the
rate of pay for the people who stayed at
home bas been biglier diuring this war than it
was twenty-five years ago.
Han. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes, that is true.
To follow along the line of my honourabile
friend's thought, I would point out that in
this war the difference between the pay of
members af the armed services and that of
people in industry bas not been nearly sa
large as it was in the last war, when bloated
wages were paid by munitions factories.
The total allowances payable ta me, if I
had served in this war, would amount to
something more than $1,300, as compared with
the 8350 that I received- at the end af the
Iast war.
I believe hanourable senators will agree
that allowances on this proposed, basis are
adequate for the purpose of enabiing returned
men ta re-establish themselves in civil life.
I do not want ta use the term "generous,"
because it seems to me that is not an
appropriate word.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

455

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: You cannot estimate any amount of cash as being a generous
paymenit ta a man who bas volunteeredi ta
sacrifice bis life on your behaîf. Sa I will
not use the word, "generous." But I do think
that as a natian-I am not speaking for the
Governnient; after ail, this is a national Bill,
supported by ail parties-I do think that as
a nation we are entitled ta say that by means
ai this Bill and other legislation for the
benefit ai service menHon. Mr. QUINN: -we are doing aur duty.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I could flot put it
better than it bas been put by my honourable
(Hon. Mr.
friend from Bedford-Halifax
Quinn)-we are doing aur duty.
There is just one more thing I want ta say
about the general features of this Bill. I
desire ta adopt as my own the very cloquent
words used yesterday afternoon by the honourable senator from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr.
Gouin) in cannection with the Indestrial
Development Bank Bill. We ail realize,
whether we came from Quebec or any other
province, that this is a Canadiaji measure
and a Canadian obligation. True, it will be
costly; the estimated cost is $750,000,000, but
I am sure honéurable senators that there wilI
not be a word of objection to the cost fromn
anyone in the province ai Quebec or any
other part af the country.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: None of us in
Quebec will sit down and calculate bow much
of this maney wiil be paid ta the people af
one province and bow mucli ta the people af
another. We understand that this is an
obligation of ail the Canadian people, a
national obligation ta aur returned men, and
we in the province of Quebec are glad and
proud ta assume aur full share oi that
obligation.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN. Honourable senators,
aur honourable colleague f rom. Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugeasen) deserves ta, be heartily
congratulated upon the clear and interesting
explanation that he bas just given. We know
of bis modesty, and we wish ta assure himn that
he need offer no excuse for baving referred to
bis own case in illustrating the provisions of
this measure. On the contrary, he is ta, be
commended for so doing, because thereby he
showed in a speciflo manner how the gratuity
and allowances for aur returned men will be
Our honourable friend from
calculated.
Inkerman declared, frankly, that he considered
himself ta bav" been fairly treated at.the end
of the last war.

456

SENATE

I think it is wise not to pay gratuities in a
lump sum, but instead to average them over a
period of some months at the rate of pay
received by the veterans before their discharge.
It is always difficult to adapt oneself to a
suddenly changed condition. If a young man
is used to living within a certain budget, and
one fine morning he receives an amount which
to him seems like a small fortune, he is likely,
even though ordinarily prudent, to spend it
within a short time and without much thought.
Nowadays we often meet young men who tell
us of their preoccupation or even their anxiety
as to the future. I believe that everybody
will be pleased by the terms of this measure,
and that it deserves our unqualified support.
When for a couple of years I served as legal
adviser to a committee which we had in
Montreal to deal with the re-establishment of
soldiis in civil life, I acquired some practical
experience of the problems of our returned
mon. This experience convinces me of the
necessity for this measure, and I give it my
unqualified support.
Hon. IVA C. FALLIS: I rise merely to
endorse what lias been so ably said, from this
side by the honourable senator from Pembroke
(Hon. Mr. White), and to give my warm and
unqualified support to this Bill. As lias been
well said, there eau be no divergence of opinion either in this House or outside as to the
wisdom, the fairness and the justice of this
measure. We are all in agreement that the
best we can do-either individually or nationally-for those who have done so much to
assure our uninterrupted comfort and security
is hy no means a recompense for the sacrifices
they have made and the horrors through which
they have passed and are still passing.
Sone Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: But, as my honourable
friend has said, what we are now doing is at
least a gesture, and does show to those boys
and men that in our hearts we all desire to
do everything possible for them on their
teturn to civil life.
I should just like to add that I am espccally appreciative of the fact that by this Bill
hbe Government accords generous treatment
to the women who are serving in our armed
servicesSoine Hon. SENATORS: Hear hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: -and to the dependents of the men who have fallen in battle.
The great majority of these dependents will,
I regret to say, be women.
Had it been possible. I should like to have
seen the gratuities for those who served overseas based on the actual service rendered;
that is, something in the nature of a sliding
Hon. Mr. GOUIN.

scale according to the battle zones in which
they served and the nature of the services
rendered. I quite appreciate the statement
made by the Minister in the other House, that
the cost of the complicated system of accounting which this would involve would be virtually prohibitive.
But I hope that this
shortcoming will to a certain extent be made
good by his assurance that on demobilization
the men who have served in the various
theatres of war will be looked after first in
the matter of employment.
As to the remarks of the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
that this is a national measure and no one
could object if more money goes to one
province than to another, may I just say it is
obvious to all that if more money does go to
one province than to another, it is simply
because more men from that province have
been on active service. In a word, the money
goes to the men who have actually served in
'the various battle zones.
This is a national measure and will receive
national support, and I commend the Goverament for introducing it.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I heartily endorse everything which
has been said in support of this measure.
However, I should like to have the views of
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) on paragraph (j) defining
"western hemisphere."
I have been a little
worried about men who volunteered for active
service in the Army, Navy or Air Force, and
w-ho are still willing to go overseas, but have
been kept in the Western hemisphere.
I
wonder how they will regard this Bill. I am
thinking more particularly of men in the
Navy. We have quite a number of Navy
personnel stationed in Newfoundland for
convoy duty, which necessitates the maintenance there of a more or less permanent
staff. The same condition obtains both in the
Army and the Air Force, as I happen to know.
The great bulk of these men have, as I
understand, volunteered for active service
anywhere; but having been retained in
Bermuda or the West Indies or Newfoundland,
they will not be classed as overseas men.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I do nat think that a member of the
active service forces, who by reason of national
necessity was forced against his will to stay
in Canada or Newfoundland or the West
Indies, would feel any grudge against his
more fortunate companion who was able to
go overseas and do some fighting. I think
there is a good deal in what my honourable
friend from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) says

AUGUST 12, 1944
about certain classes of men who, for instance,
are in the crews of destroyers based on
Newfoundland, or in the Air 'Force based
on the Atlantic or the Pacifie coast, and, whose
ordinary work is to patrol the seas for submarines, and se forth. If I remember rightly,
the Minister in another place said that those
men during their heurs of fiight or seamanship,
although they happened to be based in the
western hemisphere, were in reality on active
service, and would be so regarded for gratuity
purposes.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Is it not cevered by the
words '<obligated to serve without territorial
limitation" in paragraph (i) of the subsection
defining service?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think so, though
I do not pretend te be an expert on the
details. llowever, as the Bill is to be referred
to committee, my honourable friend from
Kingston can get a fuller answer there.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Hon ourable senators, if
honourable senators will look to the definition
given in paragraph (b) of section 2 they will
find it perfectly clear that overseas service
includes service anywhere in aircraft or in a
seagoing ship of war.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Outside territorial
waters.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Outside of Canada and
the United States and the territorial waters
thereof. I think that practically all men in the
Navy have been outside our territorial waters.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Exactly.
Hon. NORMAN McL. PATERSON: Honourable senators, I should like to take a brief
moment to caîl attention to one matter which
is flot covered by this Bill. I happen to be
connected in one. way or another with the
St. John Ambulance Association and the
Canadian Red Cross Society. The St. John
Ambulance Association bas sent overseas at
its own expense quite a few of its members,
and the Red Cross Society in many cases has
sent over its personnel without pay. The
members of those two bodies are not covered
by this legislation, and while perhaps provision
cannot now be made for them I should like it
to go on record that Canada is greatly indebted
to those persons who have given of their time
a.nd effort, and in London have risked their
lives, in the diseharge of their duties. This
morning I had the privilege of areading some
letters of acknowledgment of the excellent
services rendered by the personnel of these
two organizations. They have rendered valuable services every day of the week in lo-oking
aftexr the comifort of our men on active service.

457

It may be that Canada will find somne way of
showing its appreciation of those services; but
for the present it can only be expressed in
words.
1 should also lite te say that while to us
five or six years ini the life of our young men
overseas may not seeni a great length of time,
and we may feel that in giving them gratuities
we are doing something, we are by ne means
discharging ahi our indebtedness, and wc shail
have to exercise the fulhest degree cf teleratien
and patience in assisting these yeung men to
re-establish themsehves.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON- Many cf them were
in their first year at college. After six years
overseas they will flot feel like resuming their
interrupteil studies, and they wilI need all
the help we ca-n give these.
The motion was agrecd te, and the Bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

lIon. Mr. KING: After the lengthy and
clear explanation cf this Bill which the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) bas given us, I should be inclincd
te ask for third reading now; but as the
Minister informs me that he has an important
amendment te make te the Bill, I would
move that it be- referred te the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce.

REPORT

0F COMMITTEE

Hon. W. H. McGUIRE: Honourable senators, the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, Vo whom was referred Bill 184,
an Act to provide for the payment of war service gratuities and for the grant of re-establishment credits to members of His Majesty's
Forces in respect of service during the present
war, have in obodience to the order of reference of the 12th of August, 1944, examined the
said Bihl and now beg leave to report the same
with following amendment:
Hon. Mr. KING.

Page 7, lines 8 and 9. For clause 25 substitute the follow'Dg:
25. This Act shall corne into force on the
first day of January, 1945, or on any dlate
between ýthe first day of October, 1944, and the
frst day of January, 1945, as may 'be fixed by
oclamation nothing Governor in Cotuncil:
v rovided that of the in this section shall be
deemed to impair any benefits which would
have hbeen enjoyed by the members of the
Forces or their dependents under the Act if
it had corne into force on the first dey of
Octoher, 1944.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, when shall this report be considered?
Hon. Mr. KING: Honourable senators, as
is known to honourable members who were
present at the meeting of the Committee on
Banking and Commerce this morning, the
Minister of National Defence stated that the
aînendment which bas just been read had been
agreed upon by himself and the Leader of the

Opposition in the other House. Sînce then the
Minister has informed me that he is desirous
of having a change made in the amendment.
Therefore, 1 would move that the report be
submitted to the Comnmittee of the Whole.
The motion was agreed to.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEF AND REPORTED

The Senate went into Committee on the
report of the C.ommittee on Banking and

Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair in the Chair.

On the proposed amendment:
Hon. Mr. HUIGESSEN: Hlonourable senators wbo wcre at the meeting of the
Committen on Banking and Commerce this
morning will recaîl that an amendment was
agreed upon, whereby the present clause 25
of the Bill would be replaced by a new clause
providing that the Act shouhd corne into force
on the first of January, 1945, or on any date
hetween the first of October, 1944, and the

first of January, 1945, as may ho fixed hy
proclamation

of

the

Governor

in

Council.

And to that amendment there was added this
proviso:
That nothing in týhis section shaîl he deemed
to impair any henefits which would 'have been
enjoyed hy the members of the Forces or their
dependents under the Act if it had come into
force on the first day of October, 1944.
Our Parliamentary Counsel advises us-and
I think honourahle senators wbo are members
of the legal profession will agree-that this
proviso is quite unnecessary; and further,
that if it were inserted it would immediately
cast douht upon similar sections that appear
in a lairge number of other bills without such
a proviso. Therefore, on the advice of our
Parliamentary

Counsel and in view

of the

AUGUST 14, 1944
wishes of the Minister, as now expressed to us,
I move in amend'ment that this proviso to the
amendment submitted in the Committee's
report be st;uck out.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Hugessen was
agreed to.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Honourable senators,
what has happened in this case serves to
ilýlustrate the risk that is run when Bis are
sent to, us front the Huse of Commons so
late that we have to give them. a hurried
examnination. I hope that future Governments
-whatever party may be in power-will take
a lesson from this incident and sec that legisiation is sent over here in time, to permit of a
thorough review by the Senate.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Hugessen was
agreed to.
The amended report of the Commjttee on
Banking and Commerce was reported, and

OVERSEAS REINFORCEMENTS
EMERGENCY SITTING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, on the 27th of January last, on
motion of Hon. Senator King, seconded by
Hon. Senator Ballantyne, it was ordered:

That for the duration of the present Session

of Parliament, should an emergency arise during
any adjournment of the Senate, which would
in the opinion of the Honourable the Speaker

warrant that the Senate meet prior to the time

set forth in the motion for such adjournment,
the Honourable the Speaker be authorized to
noti.fy honourable senators, at their addresses
as registered with the Clerk of the Senate, to
meet at a time earlier than that set out in the
motion for such adjournment, and non-receipt
by any one or more honourable senators of such
call shall not have any effect upon the sufficiency
and validity thereof.

Pursuant to this Order, on November 17,
1944, after consultation with the Government
and the leader of the Government in the
Senate, I issued to all senators the following
notice:
In pursuance of the Order of the Senate of
January 27, 1944, it is my opinion that the
Senate, which was adjourned on August 14,
1944, to January 31, 1945, should meet prior
to the time set forth in the motion for such
adjournment, and you are hereby notified that
the Senate will meet on Wednesday, November
22, 1944, at 2.00 o'clock in the afternoon to

transact its business as if it had been duly
adjourned to that day and hour.

Thomas Vien,
Speaker of the Senate.
In conformity with this Order of the Senate
and with the notification sent out ito all honourable senators, the Senate is now convened

and can properly discharge its functions.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
in summoning the Senate to assemble at this
time His Honour the Speaker has exercised
the right and the power granted to him by
the Senate early in the session. I was
in Vancouver when the Government in
its wisdom decided that it would be in the
interest of the public life of this country that
Parliament should be convened. The Prime
Minister, in speaking to me, asked me as
leader of this Chamber what would be the

disposition of the Senate with regard to our
meeting. As honourable senators know, the
resolutions passed in the two Chambers which
permit of their being summoned at a date
earlier than that stated at the time of adjournment, are separate and independent, so we are
governed by our own resolution and our own
initiative as to when we shall meet. I felt
there would be nothing on our Order Paper
that would require a meeting of the Senate at
this time, and little, if anything, coming
from the other place that would be
capable of decisionI say decision, not
discussion-in this Chamber. Of course, when
Parliament meets one never knows whether
any measure or measures will be introduced,
so there was the possibility of legislation
which would require consideration by honourable senators before it could become law.
After weighing these matters carefully and
considLering alsa the probability that we as a
branch of Parliament would wish to be here
to-day as a body, so that we might gain information from the discussions and proceedings
which will take place in the other House, I
decided to take the responsibility of indicating to His Honour the Speaker my feeling
that fiom the point of view of the Senate it
was desirable that we should assemble at this
time. I was pleased to see later that my
honourable friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) was of the same opinion. I had no
official communication with him, but I saw
a Press dispatch staiting he had expressed the
view that the Senate should be called. I
thaught I should make this explanation, for
our meeting necessitates a very long
journey for some honourable senators,
especially those who live on the Pacific and
Atlantic coasts and in the mid-West.
As I have intimated, there is n'o business
on our Order Paper. His Honour the Speaker
very wisely called our meeting for 2
o'clock to-day, so that we might hear a
statement from him and from myself and then
adjourn, in order that those who wish may
be present at the proceedings in the House of
Commons. As I understand it, to-day's sitting
in that House will be followed by another
important sitting to-morrow. To-day the correspondence that passed between the Minister
who has retired and the Government, as well as
other correspondence, will be read; it will
become a part of the records of that House
and will be available for our benefit and
information to-morrow. It may be anticipated
that there will be an interesting discussion in
the Commons Chamber to-morrow, so I intend,
with consent of the Senate, to move that
when the Senate adjourns to-day it do stand
adjourned until Friday at 3 o'clock.

SENATE
I trust honourable senators will accept that
motion, so that we may spend to-day and
to-morrow in acqu'iring the information tha.t
will be given in another place and fam'iliarizing ourselves with events that are in the
offimg.

I will not say more at present, except to
repeat the hope that my suggestion will meet
with the views of honourable members.
Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators, I find myself in perfect accord with
the views just stated by the honourable leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. King). The
only regret I have to express at this time is
that this branch of Parliament was not summoned at the same time as the other House,
for many senators who live at a great distance
from Ottawa must have experienced more or
less hardship in securing travelling accommodation on short notice.
The honourable leader of the Government
was fully justified in consulting with the Prime
Minister and recommending to His Honour
the Speaker of this House that the senior
branch of Parliament be summoned. As all
honourable senators know, at the present time
we are in the midst of probably one of the
greatest crises through which the world has
ever passed. Our troops have so far played a
magnificent part in the war, and the debate
in another place, and eventually here, will be
on the question of reinforcements. A number
of honourable members who came to the
Senate before I did were here during the last
war, and in our debate their experience will be
of the greatest value. Of course, every honourable member's opinion on this important
subject will be very valuable.
I also agree with the motion, which the
honourable leader is about to move, that this
House adjourn until Friday next. By adjourning until Friday we shall harve an opportunity
of attending at another place this afternoon
and hearing read the letters that have passed
between the Prime Minister and the former
Minister of Defence, and we shall be able to
acquire further information to-morrow, so that
when we reassemble we shall be in a much
better position to carry on our debate, whieh
I trust will be a fair and fruitful one.
I should like to inquire from the honourable
leader if all the honourable members who are
present here are likely to get accommodation
in the Senators' gallery of the other House.
Hon. Mr. KING: His Honour the Speaker,
in consultation with the Speaker of the House
of Commons, has arranged that in addition to
our own gallery in that House the gallery
opposite will be reserved especially for
senators. I believe honourable members will
Hon. Mr. KING.

agree that those two. galleries should afford us
sufficient accommodation. I do not know what
may come out of the -discussion in the House
of Commons to-day or to-morrow; but should
Parliament require information of a character
that can be disclosed only in secret session,
members of the Senate will have the privilege
of being present.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Do I understand that there is to be a secret session?
Hon. Mr. KING: I do not know. It will
depend on what develops in the other House.
His Honour the Speaker made the arrangements, and perhaps he will tell us what provision has been made for our accommodation.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, the leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. King) has just stated the position. This
morning, anticipating a considerable attendance of honourable members of this House,
and knowing that the Senators' gallery of
the House of Commons has only twenty-eight
seats, after consultation with the leader of the
Government I proceeded to the office of the
Speaker of the other House, the Honourable
Mr. Glen, who was kind enough to arrange
that the Officials' gallery of the Commons,
which is directly opposite our own, be reserved
for honourable senators. These two galleries
will give us fifty-eight seats. I believe that
this accommodation will be adequate for the
time being, as both galleries are reserved
exclusively for honourable
senators.
If
honourable senators desire accommodation for
any members of their families, they should
make application, through our Clerk, to the
Sergeant-at-Arms.
The Senate adjourned until Friday, November 24, at 3 p.m.

THE LATE SENATOR TURGEON
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, it
is with very deep regret that I officially advise
the House of the passing of one of our most
noble colleagues, Senator
and
honoured
Turgeon, at his home in Bathurst on Saturday
last. Senator Turgeon was born at Levis,

NOVEMBER 24, 1944
Quebec, in 1848. Be attended the seminary at
Quebec, and graduated fromn Lavai University
witb the degree of Baclielor of Arts. As a
young man hoe migrated fromn -the province of
Quebec to New Brunswick, and settled in the
town of Bath*urst. By profession hae was a
journalist, and. in 1927 hie publisbed bis
memoirs, a tribute to the Acadian race. For
this publication hae was honoured by -the
French Academy, which made bim the -recipient
of a gold medal.
Ou-r late colleague had. a long careýer as a
public man in the province of New Brunswick
and in the federal field. He was one of a group
of young men wbo entered public life in New
Brunswick sbortly after Confederation. In
1874 and, again in 1896 hie was a candidate for
,the Bouse of Commons, and aithougli defeated
in thlose two elections ha succeeded in gaining
a seat in 1900. Be en.joyed the confidence of
his constituency fromn that year until 1921,
baving been re-elected in the general electione
of 1904, 1908, 1911, 1917 and 1921. During this
period, as I say, bie was associated in, public life
with a group of young men, and I think it only
fair that I should mention the namnes of saime
of them, for although we are getting old, our
boybood memories of them stili live. 1 would
refer to sucb men as Sir George Foster, Andrew
G. Blair, H. R. Emmerson, Mr. Alward, Sir
Douglas Hazen and L. P. Farris--and if you
wiIl permait me. I sho-uld like te couple with
their camnes that of my father. Aithougli these
men were not aIl of the saine political striýpe,
tbey beld one another in very high respect,
and I know that the late senator was adrnired
and esteemed by the other membars cf this
group, regardless of differences of opinion on
public matters.
Senator Tu.rgeon was a strong party man;
lie maintained at ahl times tha principles for
which hae stood; but I think that aIl who were
associated witb bim will agrea that hoe was a
man of wide tolerance, always ready to listen
ýto the other side of any public question. He
apparently instilled into bis cbildren, or a-t
least inte his two sons, a political instinct.
This they developed in the Weet. I refar to
Bon. W. F. Turgeon, a former membar of the
Supreme Court of Saskatchewan and, now Minister Designata to Belgium, and. to, Mr. Gray
Turgeon, formerly a member of -the Alberta
Legislature and now a member cf the Bouse
of Commons.
Although Senator Tu.rgeon was by profession
a journalist, 1 think we might say that ever
since bis flrst entrance into public life, in 1874,
lie devoted bis time principally -to puýblic affairs
and the interests cf his people.
At this time I should like to extend to
Madanie Turgeon and the niembers of lier

famil5' in their sad bereavement, the sincera
sympthy of the group on this sida of the
Chamber.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
secators, the late Senator Turgeon served his
province and Canada faithfully and loyally iii
botb Bouses cf Pârliamant for over f orty
years, and lias left -a record of achievement
tbst it would be well for the youtb of Canada
ta try ta em-ulate.
It was gratifying.to bis friends that througbeut his ni.nety-eight years lie enjeyed good
healtb, and that lie retained ai bis faculties
un-til within a kew days cf his passing.
Senator Turgeon naturally tock grat pride
in the acbievements -of bis taented sons, one
being the Canadian
Ambassador, flrst
to Mexico 'and now to Belgium, and,
the other a distinguished member of the
Bouse of Commons. lJndcubted-iy tihey will
f ollow in the foeitsteps cof their illustrioqns
father and at ail times give of tbeir hast in
furthering -the interests cf Canada.
I join the lionourable -leader opposite in
expressing our deepest sympathy to Madame
Turgeon and ahl the members cf the family in
their great bereavement.
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Bonouinhie mem,
bers, I wish to a&sociate mysaif witb the
honouxable leader cf thé Government (Hon.
Mr. King) in biis expressions cf regret ut the
passing cf sny friend snd dask-mate, Senator
Turgeon. As our leader said, the late senator bad a distinguished career in the public
life cf this country, and as I listenoed my
thoughts turned to tha long aind happy aaaociatien w-hicb I enjoyed with niy desk-mate ini
the many activities cf bis career -in -tbe province cf New Brunswick, frnm wbiob we both
come.
Senstor Turgeen was a man of melny sterling
qualities cf heart and mind. Be bad an
attractive personality and always enoyad
giving a humorous touaih te ligbten the disonssieQn of serious matters.
The 'benourable leader referred te the
variaus electicus in wbicb cur late colleague
angaged from time te time. Many members
cf this Chaïmber bave some.thing more thsn
a dim memory of the election of 1917. It
is wortby cf note tbat Senator Turgeon, possessing the qualities which have been referred
te, 'lad the unique distinction and tbe signal
bonour cf being returned te -the Bouse of

As honourable senators aire aware, in affairs
of government questions of a troublesome
character sometimes arise, and cani best be
settled in a spirit of compromise. When confronted with such questions I always sought
the wise advice of my friend and late colleague, and by acting on it was sucoessful in
bringing about an arrangement satisfactory to
all concermed. Senator Turgeon was tolerant
and broad in bis views. His admirable qualities won the confidence and affection of bis
associates, and the admiration and respect of
political friend and foe alike.
The honourable leader bas referred to
Senator Turgeon's sons. The late senator took
great pride in bis family and was fond of discussing the careers of his sons. It was a
source of keen enjoyment to him that those
sons so greatly distinguished themselves in
the judiciary and in the diplomatie service of Canada. Personally, I very much regret the passing of our colleague, and this
tribute is my way of saying good-bye to my
one-time desk-mate, counsellor and friend.
Hon. A. J. LEGER: Honourable senators,
I share the sentiments of those who have
paid tribute to the late Senator Turgeon. My
long acquaintance with him ripened into a
friendship which I shall always cherish. Senator
Turgeon was proud of. bis country and attached
to lis compatriots. He was above all a great
Christian, and as such, perhaps, will be best
him
those who knew
by
remembered
intimately.
To all those who mourn bis passing I extend my sincerest sympathy. His passing is
a distinct loss to bis province and to tbe
country at large.
OVERSEAS REINFORCEMENTS
CLARIFICATION OF ORDER IN COUNCIL

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, on the Orders of the Day I crave
your indulgence for a short time in regard to
a matter of great urgency with which all bonourable inembers are familiar-the immediate
necessity of further reinforcements being sent
overseas. I do not intend to make a speech,
nor to open a debate on the question, because
I have agreed with the honourable leader of
the Government that it would be wise for all
honourable members to await the speech of
the Prime Minister-which I understand he is
te deliver on Monday next-as well as the
speeches of other members of the House of
Commons. Furthermore. the honourable leader
opposite bas informed me that it is bis intention at a later period of this sitting to
move that when the House adjourns to-day it
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

do stand adjourned until Tuesday night at 8
o'clock.
I am, however, confused in regard te the
very important Order in Council which the
Prime Minister placed before the House of
Commons yesterday, and I rise to ask the
honourable leader to clarify the situation.
That Order in Council gives authority to send
16,000 ýN.R.M.A. men overseas. I am confused to this extent. As reported in the press,
in' Parliament yesterday the Prime Minister
made the following statement:
Prime Minister King said last night in the
Commone there was apt to be confusion in the
publie mind on the statu&of men who will move
overseas following authorization to conscript
16,000 draftees for service overseas.
He said be would seek to put the position
simply by saying that if there were 1,000 men
called under the National Resources Mobilization
Act in a camp and none volunteered they still
would be N.R.M.A. men a week from now. But
if some volunteered they would become geeral

service men.
"If those general service men are sent overseas the public may assume that they are ether
than the N.R.M.A. men of

to-day.

But they

would net be, they would be exactly the saine
men."
Is Parliament to understand, according to
the Prime Minister, that all General Service
enlistmeints are N.R.iM.A. men? If so, iS it
the intention of the Government to send the
N.R.M.A. men who have been in training for
years-like those of the 6th Division at
Vancouver, for instance-and who have Lad
not only infantry basic training but, having
sen service in the Aleutians, battle training
as well? Is it the intention of the new
General
Defence,
National
of
Minister
McNaughton, to exercise the authority given
him by Parliament, in view of the urgent
need for reinforcemenets, and send N.R.M.A.
officers and men who are highly trained and
have been in the service for years, or will
he send only tiose who volunteer-sone fully
trained and others not-and refrain froin
exercising bis authority to draft N.R.M.A.
personnel who have been enlisted for years
and are highly trained?
I should be very much indebted to the
honourable leader of the Government if ho
could clarify this situation and make it
intelligible to me.
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, I
had hoped-in fact, I think my honourable
friend and I bad considered it advisable
that we should wait until the proceedings in
the other House had continued for a somewhat longer time before a statement was
made here. I can well understand, thugh,
why my honourable friend bas made an
inquiry to-day, for this morning on looking
at a couple of newspapers published in two

NOVEMBER 24, 1944
of our great cities, it seemed to me that
their editorials and front pages clearly indicate a desire and an attempt to confuse the
public with regard to the Government's policy
at this time. But my honourable friend and
the public will have no confusion in their
minds if they will read fairl the statement
of the Prime Minister and that made in
another
place
yesterday
by
General
McNaughton, the Minister of Pefence.
It is well-known in Parliament and throughout the country that the Government of the
day went into this war with the desire of
an al]-out effort by the people of Canada.
In that respect the Government bas had
absolute compliance by the people. One has
reason to be proud of the young men and
women of tbis country when hie looks around
and sees that some eight or nine hundred
thousand, realizing their duty, bave voluntarily enlisted in the armed forces. But it
is well-known to honourable members of this
flouse and to, the people generally that for
some time there has been a studied attempt
to frustrate the Government's effort to get
overseas-service volunteers from men called
up under tbe National Resources Mobilization Act.
Wben Colonel Raîston, the then Minister
of Defence, returned from overseas in October
and reported that among the infantry casualties had been greater than were anticipated,
the Government was assured tbat men were
ready to enliat to make reinforcements available. Unfertunately the casualties suffered
by our infantry brigades were heavy, and it
developed that in the coming year there
would be a shortage of personnel for replacements. That ivas the situation that the
Government had to consider.
Now, is there any variation in the policy of
Mr. Mackenzie King? In 1942, wben tbe
amendment to the National Resources Mobll-

izatien Act was passed, bie said that men would
be sent overseas as occasion required, and
the Order in Council that I have just tabled
provides the requirements asked for by the

Department of National Defence. The Department bas said that some 16,000 men are
needed to form a pooî to meet needs that will
arise after the New Year, and this number of
men will be dispatched overseas as rapidly
as transportation can be obtained for them.
Needless to say, I cannot advise honourable
members wbat the Admiralty will be able to
do in the way of furnishing ships, nor when
slips will sail, but I say to, honourable members that they can be satisfied in their minds
that as soon as it is possible to make the
necessary

transportation

arrangements

Minister will see that these men are moved
forward to their stations in Great Britain,
there to form a pool froma which they will be
transferred to the various war sectors as
recluired. There sbould not be any misunderstanding about this.
I do not intend to speak at greater length
now. 1 just want to add that any fairminded man who reads impartially this moruing's editorials in the two newspapers I have
mentioned, will* realize that these editorials
were published with the idea of embarrassing
the Goverament in its war effort. I have no
hesitation in making tbis statement, for it is
true. The Senate was called early enough this
afternoon to enable us to adj ourn in time to
go to the other Chamber and listen to the continued cross-examination of the Minister of
National Defence, General McNaughton. On
Tuesday evening I shaîl be glad to speak on
the Government's policy as it has been ou,-r
lined and is now being outlined in another
place, and at that time the policy can be
criticized or debated. I arn not prepared to
go on to-day.
I can assure my honourable friend that it
is the Government's intention to carry out the
Order in Council passed yesterday, which provides for sending overseas 16,000 men wbo are

already trained. Some 10,000 of these will be
ready to go into action ver>' soon, and sorne
6,000 will require a littie more training. These
men will be moved to depots in England, and
from there to the war front.
That is ail I baye to say at present; but,
as I have already said, on Tuesday evening
I shahl be pleased to speak on this matter at
greater length.

lion. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, may 1 intrude once more? My honourable friend bas not clarified my mind nor
answcred tbe direct question tbat I asked. The
Prime Minister said that ail N.R.M.A. men
were General Service men. The question I
askced was this: Whon this law is, enforced
and compulsion used, will men who bave been
in the Army for years be conscripted first and
the newer men, witb leas training, be called
later on?
Hon. Mr. KING: My bonourable friend is
net really acting fairly. General McNaugbton
is a good soldier and is aware of the Army's
requirements. My honpiurable friend knows
that General McNaugbton will select for overseas service tbe trained men w'bo are available in Canada, not under-trained men. You
can take tbe Minister's assurance for that; hie
said se in the lieuse of ýCommons yesterday.
No one bas a rigbt to assume for a moment
that there will be any variation in tbat policy.

OVERSEAS RENIPORCEMENTS
SEN VIE PRO<'EDURE

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, if
I may ho permitted, I should like to add to
wbat I said previously in regard to the Senate
being sumnmoned at this time. Wben I consiilted His Honour the Speaker about the
advisability of bis exercising the power granted
to hima early in the session to eall an emergency sitting of the Senate, I had in mind

NOVEMBER 29, 1944
that legislation might reach us from the House
of Commons. During the last few days we
have availed ourselves of the courtesy extended to us by that House. We have listened to the very important debate in progress
there, and it is now apparent that nothing will
come to us from that quarter. However, some
enactment necessary to adapt Government
policy to present eircumstances, or prorogation, was a possibility, and in either event
it would, of course, have been necessary to
convene the Senate. I realize my responsibility in having asked for this emergency
session, and I feel that I should have failed in
my duty had I not given you the opportunity
of assembling here at this time.
There is no business now before the House.
The important question under discussion in
the Commons will not come to our notice in
the form aof a bill. If we are to discuss that
question we can do so only by unanimous
consent, because I do not think it would be
advisable to give the forty-eight hours' notice
required under our rules for that purpose. I
repeat what I said yesterday, that it is not
customary for this Chamber to move a vote
of confidence or of non-confidence in the
Government. To do so would be very bad
practice and certainly not in the public
interest, for when a Government is defeated
on an appeal to the country, there is usually
in this Chamber a majority adverse to the
incoming Government. Though I have not
placed a motion on the Order Paper, any
member, of course, bas the right to bring
the matter before the Chamber if he wishes,
and can do so by moving the adajournment of
the House and beginning a debate on that
motion.
In conference with His Honour the Speaker
and my honourable friend the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne), it was suggested that
we might follow the practice that bas been
adopted in England during wartime. I understand that there, if it is deemed necessary to
call a special session of Parliament, the leader
of the Government is not required to give
any notice before proceeding to announce the
Government's policy. After he concludes his
statement, the Speaker indicates that it would
be fair and wise to hear the leaders of other
groups in the House on the matter the
Government bas presented. I believe that is
the limitation placed on the procedure. If it
is desired to have a discussion in this House,
I should like to make a few remarks, and I
should probably be followed by the honourable leader opposite. Then, with the concurrence of the Senate and His Honour the
Speaker there would be an opportunity for
106-31j

467

every honourable member who so wished to
take part in the discussion.
If that procedure is agreeable to the House,
I would ask leave to speak to-night, or, considering the lateness of the hour and the fact
that honourable senators have been listening.
to speeches all day, I would suggest, subject to
your approval, that I postpone what I have to
say until to-morrow, and that we adjourn
shortly to resume at 2.30 to-morrow. I say
2.30 because I believe there is a feeling abroad
-I have no knowledge of any foundation for
it-that the debate in the other House may
not continue at great length, but may be concluded on Friday. If we met early to-morrow
there probably would be time by Friday to
permit every honourable member who desires
to do so to take part in the debate, and our
sittings could be adjourned that day if that
were considered advisable. The decision as to
when we should adjourn can be made tomorrow or the next day, in the light of circumstances at that time. So with the consent,
of the Senate I would ask that we adjourn
now, and that I be allowed to go on to-morrow
afternoon at half past two.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I am sorry that the honourable leader on
this side (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) is not present,
although I am aware of what has gone on. I
am happy, as I am sure all on this side of the
House are, to agree with the suggestions just
made by the honourable leader of the Government. We shall give every facility to not
only the leaders on both sides, but every
other honourable member who may want to
discuss the matter that is now before Parliament. If I may say so, it seems to me that
the procedure suggested by the honourable the
leader opposite, as a result of his conference
with His Honour the Speaker and the honourable leader on this side, is very wise. I
think it is a good tradition. I entirely agree
with the honourable leader that we should not
vote either one way or the other on a motion
of confidence.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: We have no right
to.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know we have no right
to, and I say that we should not contemplate
it, even if we had the right. I agree entirely
with the leader in that respect. His suggestion
that we meet to-morrow at 2.30 also strikes me
as a good one. After the leaders on both
sides have spoken, every other honourable
member who wishes to speak should be permitted to do so. We still ought to be able
to finish on Friday without any difficulty.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
2.30 p.m.

I necd refer to only one otber conýference,

the Prime Ministers of t.he great dominions
within the Commonwealth met with the Prime
Minister of Creat Britain and dcecided there
shouid Le a declaration of policy as between
Great Britain and the component parts ef the
Empire. The repreoetations made at that ýconference by the Prinie 'Minister cf Canada were
accepted not only hi- the Prime Ministers cf
the dominions but by the great Prime Minister
cf Britain, and at the conclusion cf the conference the speech niade h3e Mr. Mackenzie
King in the halls of Westminster was one that
rang eut areund the werld and plaeed Lima in
the ferefront as a werld statesman.
I think it enly fair that I should say that.

industrial contribution to the war effort. In
every activity of life making for the success of
the war, our people have performed a task that
was inconceivable when the war started. I am
speaking of what bas been done by men and
women on the farm and in the factories. Many
a farmer bas been deprived of the assistance
of his son or sons and has had to carry on his
work with such other help as he could obtain.
In countless farm homes and other homes
throughout the country the mother bas been
left alone to take care of her household duties,
for her daughters, upon whom she relied before,
have gone to work in munitions factories or
offices. Ail the people of Canada are entitled
to the greatest praise and consideration for
the wonderful effort they have so far made
during this war. So it is indeed unfortunate
that at this time we should through the stress
of circumstances be called here in what may
be considered a crisis. Indeed I can assure bonourable members it is a crisis.
Conscription is something that British
people have never liked. There exists in the
world to-day an ideology-happily it is now
being defeated-which favours a policy of
total conscription, of making the individual
subject to the will of the state. It is true
that for long the nations of Central Europe,
where war was almost constantly imminent,
could invoke conscription of manpower
whenever war broke out. The morning after
war was declared in 1914, a million and a
half or two million Frenchmen were at their
posts. Why, pray? Because total conscription was the law of that country, as it was
of Germany and other European countries.
But -that was not true of Great Britain, nor
of the United States, and it bas not been
true of the dominions of the British Commonwealth. A matter of this kind bas to
be considered by every nation. From reading some of our newspapers one would gather
that Canada was the only country in the
world that had not considered the possibility
and the advantages of conscription. That is
not so. Every nation that goes to war must
consider whether it will or will not invoke
conscription of manpower for its fighting
forces. As proof of this statement, we have
only to look at what bas happened elsewhere.
Take New Zealand as an example. The
people of that- country, in their judgment,
said, "Yes, we are willing to have our manpower conscripted to fight wherever the
Government may send us." In Australiawhich, I believe, bas no racial problem, for
the people are principally of British stockthe question of whether or not there should
be conscription of manpower was submitted
to the people in a referendum, and the people
declared themselves against
conscription.

Australia to-day bas a legal ena.ctment with
regard to the conscription of wealth and manpower that is similar to our own-that is,
men are called up for home defence, but for
overseas service the recruits are volunteers.
For an understanding of the situation in
South Africa we must look back ta the year
1900, when the British overcame the resistance
of the Dutch inhabitants of that country.
Treaty arrangements were made, and in conformity with British policy of many years
standing the people of South Africa were
given a liberal charter. In time that country,
under the leadership of Prime Minister
Botha, who led the Dutch forces in 1900, was
granted the constitution of a dominion, and
became known as the Union of South Africa.
Well, when war broke out in 1939 what was
the situation in that great dominion? The
Government there no doubt considered the
question of whether a greater war effort
would be obtained through conscription of
manpower or by relying on voluntary effort.
We know what the decision was. It was made
by the people of South Africa, not by the
people of Canada or the people of the United
States or the people of Great Britain. The
question was decided by South Africans.
within their own borders.
Now let me come a little nearer home,
ta the British Isles. What bas been the
history of conscription in Great Britain?
Great Britain up to 1916 had depended on
voluntary service for both the Navy and the
Army. It was only in 1916 when the small
but highly-trained British Army had halted
the Germans on the Marne that, in view of
the scope of the military operations then impending, the British Government considered
it necessary to resort to conscription. Honourable members will recall the 900,000 men
which Lord Kitchener organized and trained,
and their magnificent record throughout the
Great War.
But at the conclusion of the war did the
British Government say: "It will be necessary to continue conscription and maintain
a large army"? No, they returned-unfortunately-to what was more or less a voluntary system of enlistment, and it was only on
the outbreak of the present war that they
again resorted ta conscription.
lu Northern Ireland, a part of Great Britain
small in area but great in power and prestige,
there was a strong agitation for conscription,
and public opinion ran high not only there but
in Great Britain also in favour of that policy.
Wlien the question came before the House of
Commons that great statesman, Mr. Churchill,
gave the world another instance of his sound
reasoning power. He in.timated that it would
not be in the interest of their war effort to

470

SENATE

extend conscription to Northern Ireland. I
ask honourable members what influenced him
to reach that decision? As honourable members know, at the outbreak of this war Eire
was giving Great Britain considerable trouble,
and the situation was fraught with dangerous
possibilities. Undoubtedly Mr. Churchill had
to consider whether compliance with public
opinion-a sentimental opinion-would seriously disturb the relationship then existing
between his Government and the Government
of the Irish Free State. I imagine, too, that
he was also taking something else into consideration. At that time the United States
was not at war, and in that country there is a
strong Irish-American element, as there is in
Canada an Irish-Canadian element and in
Australia an Irish-Austra.lian element. I have
no doubt that he weighed this and, the other
factors and decided that the application of
conscription to Northern Ireland would
weaken rather than strengthen Britain's war
effort.
I merely mention these matters by way
of introduction to the question that we are
concerned with to-day. We bear people saying-pople who are not reasoning, but merely
tailking-"Wbv don't we do as ;he United
States bas done-adopt the systen of universal militarv service?" What is the situation in the United States? The American
colonies succeded in their revolt against
Great Britain and set up a republic in which is
now incorporated one-half of this North
American continent. That the highest degrce
of freedom was enjoyed by its citizens was
advtrtised te the vorld byv the constitution
of that republic. and tiis attracted immigrants
from ail over the globe. The result is that
the population of the United States is truiy
cosmopolitan in its composition. In viefr of
this fact it is obvious that in the event of war
the Government of the United States could
net depend upon certain sections of its citizens-some of German, some of Italian, some
of Rumanian extraction-to unite in a war
effort against the countries of their origin.
Naturallv such citizens would say, "You are
attacking my country, and I will not be a
party to it." A moment's reflection must
convince one that tbis situation justifies the
policy off the United States in raising military
forces.
But I would ask honourable members not
to forget that there is also in the United States
a large body of citizens of British extraction;
and once the war is over the armed forces will
be demobilized and conscription will be discontinued. In peace-time the United States
maintains a nsall army of from eighty t6
one hundred thousand men. Their National
Ion. Mr. KING.

Guard is something like our militia. It is
called out each year for a short course of
training. There is also a group known as
organized volunteers, and a cadet branch. Ail
these groups are on a voluntary basis. The
officers are trained at the United States
Military Academy at West Point, and there
are other military acadernies throughout the
country. As I said, the American arny in
peace-time is an army of volunteers. It was
not until the outbreak of war that the
American Government again introduced conscription because they concluded that to get
the best results in this war they should adopt
that policy. I may mention that in the Civil
War the North had a form of conscription.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The United States
had conscription in the last war.
Hon. Mr. KING: During the war period.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: During the first
Great War.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. But as soon as the
war was over they returned to the voluntary
system. That is the point I wish to niake.
On the other hand, the countries of Europe
have always maintained their armies by conscription.
Now, it is easy to say that in Canada we
should have the sane army system as they
have in the United States, but in my opinion
our position is entirely the roivrse of teiirs.
That country was founded by nmen of the

revolution French-Canadian soldiers fought

for a moment to that great statesman, Sir
John A. Macdonald. who with the co-operation
of Frenci-Canadian leaders in tie province
of Quebec was able to bring about Confederation, despite the diffieulties encountered with
the Maritime Provinces.
In the Later stages of the last war the

introduced a conscription law. Sorne contend
that that enactrnent materially influenced the
war picture, whie others maintain that it did
flot.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But it did.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is a matter of
opinion, and I do flot intend to debate it
to-day. I do know this, liowever, that it had
a disastrous effect upon one great political
party, and 1 know that later that lesson was
taken to lieart by its leader. I have only to
refer to a statement made by one whomn I
considerHon. Mr. HIORNER: You are considering.
the political effect now.
Hon. Mr. KING: No, I arn not. I arn
ccming to the consideration that that great
leader gave to the aftermath of conscription.
This is a matter of record. In 19J25 Right
Hon. Arthur Meighen was leading the Conservative party in the House of Commons.
No one wouid doubt Mr. Meighen's energy
and bis ability to support a policy in. which
lie believed, and no onc* would for a moment
question his sincerity when as a member of
Sir Robert Borden's Government in 1917 he
supported conscription in Canada. But the
afterrnath and its effects -upon public opinion
in this country were such that he made an
important statement tipon his view of conscription, a statement that was supportcd in
1933 or 1934 by a very prominent membeir of
this House, the honourable senator from VanIn a speech
couver, (Hon. Mr. McRae).
at Hamilton, Ontario, and later -on in a speech
in Bagot County, Quebec, Mr. Meiglien indicated that, so far as lie and his party were
concerned, if war developed again conscription
would not be applied, nor would any Canadian
soldiers lie sent overseas until the whole questien ýhad been referred to the people of
Canada. That was bis position at that time.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will my honourable friend allow me? I think that Mr'
Meiglien also said that in the interim full
prepaxations would be made.
Hon. Mr. KING: Preparations in accordance witli the laws of the country, -under the
defence regulations, would of course lie carried
out. Mr. Meiglien said there would lie an
appeai Vo the country. He really over-shot
the mark at that time. After ail, whe-n Parliament assembled in September, 1939, there
was no doulit in the minds of members of
either buse as to the wisdom or advisability
of Canada's going into the war. The people
of Canada were fully aware that, if Germany
Great Britain,
succeeded in everrunning
Canada wouid lie the chief prize. As a people
and a nation we were satisfied in our own

minds that if we were to do our part we m-ust
declare war.
Now I wan't to cail my honourable friend'a
attention to the attitude of the Conservative
party mucli later than 1925, when Mr.
Meiglien expressed the opinion te whirh I
have referred. In 1938 there was a national
convention of the Conservative party in the
city cf Ottawa. The Right Honouralile Mr.
Bennett, now Viscount Bennett, had resigned
as leader of the party and it had become
necessary te choose a new leader. I do not
knoiv whether there was any strong divergence cf view as to the choice of a leader or
not, for I was flot at the conv ention. But when
Parliament met in September, 1939, Mr.
Mackenzie King was Prime Minister and Dr.
Manion, as head of the Conservative party,
was leader cf the Opposition. As honourahie
members know, other g.roups wcre aise represented in the other Ho-use .at that time. Was
there a word said that session in faveur cf
conscription? Did any leader or any member
have the temerity teo suggest that a policy
cf conscription should lie adopted? No. It
was net considered týhen; but later, in the 1940
election campaign Dr. Manion, as leader of
the Conservative party proclaimcd througheut Queliec and Canada that he and bis
party were net in faveur of conscription.
Those are matters cf fact, matters cf record.
Mr. Mackenzie King was returncd te office

Canadian Gcvcrnment, and since that time

We ail realize that in war-time a Government must lie prepared tc meet whatever

exigencies may arise.
Measures Act gave the ýGovernment almost
any power it could wish te invoke, it was
thouglit wise te pass in 1940 an Act ccnferring
upon the Governer in Council certain pewers
for the mobilizatien cf national resources. I
will read section 2 cf the National Resources
Mobilization Act cf 1940:
Subjeet te the provisions cf sectien three
hereof, the Governor in Council may do and
authorize sucli acts and things, and make from
time te time such orders and regulatiens.
requiring persons te place themselves, their
services and their prope.rty at the disposai cf

be deemed necessary or expedient for securing
the public safety, the defeece cf Canada, the
maintenance of public order, or the efficient
presecution cf the war, or for maintaining
supplies or services essential te the if e cf the
community.
The next section was the limiting one:
The powers conferred by the next preceding
section may not lie exercised for the purpose cf

SENATE
requiring persons to serve in the military, naval
or air forces outside of Canada and the territorial waters thereof.
There were no prominent leaders in Canada
who at the time of the passage of this Act
urged conscription of man-power. But in 1942
the exigencies of war brought about a different picture, because when Japan struck at
Pearl Harbor she became the enemy of the
United States, of Great Britain and of Canada,
and she certainly became a danger and a
menace to Canada. At that time operations
had progressed so far in Germany's favour
that ships were being sunk on both our coasts
and in the St. Lawrence river, and Halifax
Harbour had been mined by German submarines. These things were known to the
people in 1942, and there was a public demand for protection of our coasts and of
some areas along the banks of the St. Lawrence river. What was the position of the
Government? Our soldiers had gone overseas
to Great Britain, the spring-board for operations in Europe. No one will deny that that
was the proper place for them to be. It would
have been futile and unwise to have started
ferrying them back from Great Britain to
defend Canada against the menace that had
arisen. so the Government introduced an
amendment to the National Resources Mobilization Act, repealing section 3, the section I
read a few moments ago, which imposed a
limitation in respect of service oerseas, and
men were made available for the defence of
Canada. I remember well when we discussed
that amendment we had an excellent debate, a
reasoned debate, in which honourable members stated their views and convictions. I
regard it as one of the best debates I have
ever heard in the Senate, and I am satisfied
that we are capable of baving such a debate
agan.
An army was built up for home defence, and
in time it comprised some 120,000 men. In the
debate referred to I expressed the opinion that
not only would the army be one upon which we
could depend for the defence of Canada, but
that it would establish a pool of young men
who, once they had become trained in the
military art, would offer themselves as volunteers for the larger theatre of war. Did that
happen? It did. From the army that was
raised for home defence purposes some sixtyodd thousand men have volunteered for service
abroad, and many of them are now serving
overseas. Let me say here, that I feel it is
a terrible thing that the men called up for
service should have been given a name that
ire now hear commonly used. I repeat: It is
a terrible thing, and no doubt bas done much
to affect unfavourably the natural instinct of
these men.
Hon. Mr. KING.

When the amendment to the National Resources Mobilization Act was being debated in
another place, it was realized by the Government that an occasion might arise necessitating the service abroad of men called up under
the Act. The Prime Minister, Mr. Mackenzie
King, then said that if it should become necessary, an Order in Council would be drafted
to make the men available for service overseas.
When, a few weeks ago, the then Minister
of National Defence, Colonel Ralston, returned
from overseas, he intimated to the Government that reinforcements would be required
for the infantry. He stated that when he assured
the House of Commons that full provision had
been made to reinforce the Army, he was
relying on the estimates of the general staff
and of his own staff and believed there would
be no occasion to draw upon the forces in*
training in Canada. However, in the interval
the situation had changed, and it was now selfevident that some action must be taken.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am quite sure
the honourable leader opposite wants to be
fair to the former Minister of National
Defence.
Hon. Mr. KING: Very much so.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Over and over
again in the House of Commons the former
Minister of National Defence said that he was
counting on the N.R.M'.A. for overseas service
should an emergency arise.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is true; but as late
as last July the then Minister of National
Defence was able to give an assurance, based
on estimates from his own and from the general staff that there were sufficient reinforcements on hand. There is no reason to becloud the issue. It is true that Colonel Ralston
said he was relying on the declaration of
policy which had been made, and that if an
emergency arose he would depend upon these
trained men. There is no disguising the fact
that after he had met his colleagues some of
them were desirous of going ahead. They
felt that surely out of a military organization
of some 780,000 men it should be possible te
secure 15,000 men for overseas service.
I
have the warmest regard and the greateet
respect for Colonel Ralston. He is a good
administrator, and I believe he felt he was
acting wisely in recommending that N.R.M.A.
personnel be made available for overseas service. But the Government lad heard from
various sources that these young draftees had
been pooled to resist enlistment in order that
they might force the Prime Minister to pas
an Order in Council making N.R.M.A. men
available for overseas service.

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. KING: That cannot be denied.
It is well known.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What evidence bas
the h-onourable gentleman to su.bstantiate his
statement?
Hon. Mr. KING: I will give my honourable
fxiend the evidence that I had just a few
days ago, if hie wishes to know.
Hon Mr. BLACK: I should, like. to know.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is not arguable, it is
in the ýminds of the public. Hundreds of
people know that the attitude to.wards many
of those young men has -tended to drive them
to, that state of mind. But there were forty
odd thousand in the militia service who had
been partially or fully trained as infantry.
They were there when Colonel Ralston came
back from the front, and I 'believe they are
there to-day.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me? IV seems Vo me very
harsh to say that men were recruited int-o the
Home Defence Army, and iwcre then given
instructions to remai there.
Hon. Mr. KING: I did flot say they were

Hon. Mr. QUINN: That is the impression
I got, that those men were asked to join the
Home Defence Army, and wcre then instructed
by some of their friends-wbo, I take it, were
opp.onents of or unfricndly to the Government
-to remain there until tbey were forced by
the Government to go overseas. Is my understanding correct?

Hon. Mr. RING: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Just make that
clear, and leave us out of it. Blackguard the
other fellows.
Hon. Mr. RING: I am not blackguarding
anybody. There were influences at work, noV
inside but outside Parliament, to hold back
tbose young men from doing their duty as
tbey sbould have dcine it when they were required to enlist.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I cannot believe that.
You will have to, give us hetter proof than you
have given so far.
Hon. Mr. KIN.G- Go into the training
centres and you will find that influence operating. When the, people of Canada segregated those men into a group Vo whicb they

Hon. Mr. HAIG: But there must be individuals behind influences.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yeu have all read it in

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The press has net advocated anything of the kind. I challenge the
leader opposite to name one paper that encouraged men in the N.R.M.A. te refrain from
volunteering for overseas service. I listened
to Colonel Ralston yesterday afternoon and
last night, and he did net say anything of the
kind. If the honourable gentleman knows
of any paper or any individual that bas se
advised those young men, he should notify the
Mounted Police so that they may investigate
and, if necessary, lay proper charges.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am not making any
charges. I say there were influences abroad
to dissuade these young men from volunteering for active service. This is demonstrated by
their being segregated and classified as
"Zombies".

orderly fashion unless the honourable leader
is allowed te make his statement without
further interruption.
Hon. Mr. KING: I am glad my honourable
friend has called my attention to the inference
that might have been drawn from my remarks,
for I do net want to convey that impression.
I do net think that within the army itself
influences have been at work to keep these
men from enlisting; but I do say certain
influences were abroad in Canada which
tended to deter these young men from doing
their duty.
When General MeNaughton accepted the
portfolio of National Defence he was fully
convinced that he could appeal successfully
to certain publie bodies and organizations te
assist bim in bringing these young men te
their senses and in persuading them to
volunteor. In that, unfortunately, he failed,
with the result that the Prime Minister
he

gave the House of Commons in 1942.
Some 16,000 men were required as overseas reinforcements from April to May
in order to take care of the estimated
casualties and make good the shrinkages in
the infantry braneh of the service. The Order
îi Council is explicit. Those men are to go
forward as accommodation can be found, and
we are assured by the Minister of National
Defence that reinforcement pools will be
established net only in England but also in
the Mediterranean, the Dutch and the French
areas.
There is a tendency on the part of some
persons to regard that as a limited Order. I
would direct the attention of honourable
senators to the last paragraph, which covers
the situation fully. The Government, recognizing the necessity, have brought in the
Order covering thu requirements for reinforcements for the next period mentioned in the
Order. It is also provided:

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, at the outset, let me say that I
felt sorry for my honourable friend, the
Government leader, as I watched his laborious
effort during the last hour to justify the action
of the Government in at last imposing conscription for overseas service. He said that
the United States had to have a revolution
first of ail, and then that with its mixed
population conscription was necessary for the
conduct of war. I do hope he did not imply
that there was any necessity in this country
for such a dread event.
I intend to speak briefly. We are not here
to make political speeches. We are in the
midst of a great crisis. The Prime Minister
called Parliament for one reason and one
reason alone, and that was to consider reinforcements for our gallant soldiers, of whom
we are all so proud, who are fighting in the
various theatres of war. Therefore, so far as
I am concerned, I will confine my remarks this
afternoon strictly to that subject.
In speaking of our soldiers, both French
and English, words fail to express our admiration of and gratitude for their efficiency,
their brilliancy and their courage under the
most trying conditions that ever confronted
any army. The Government and Parliament
know, as do the Army and the people of this
country, that there is a dire necessity to-day
for the sending of reinforcements overseas.
The Minister of Defence admits, as everybody
who knows anything about it does, that there
is a shortage of reinforcements for the infantry.
I shall come to that later on, if you will allow
me. I wish to say at this point that although
we have entered the sixth year of war and
together with our Allies are fighting to great
advantage, although many brilliant victories

have been won and we can confidently say
that victory is in sight, we cannot say when

the war in Europe will end. We -also have to
bear in mind that after Germany bas been
beaten, we shall have to defeat Japan in the

Pacific theatre.
Now I want to turn back to the record of
this

Government's

war

beginning of bostilities.

effort

since

the

In January, 1940,

Parliament was called.
We met at three
o'clock in the afternoon, and by six o'clock
Parliament
was
inexistent.
The Prime
Minister apparently was not in a very good
humour that day, and he said that if there

was much eriticism of the Government he
would ask for dissolution-which had already
been indicated in the Speech from the Throne.
He stated as bis chief reason for the dissolution of Parliament after a short sitting of
three hours, that the then Liberal Premier of

Ontario, the Honourable Mitchell Hepburn
106-32à

475

had dared, as Prime Minister King said, to
pass a resolution through the legislature
criticizing the federal Government's war policy.

Then, as we aIl know, a general election
followed, and the Government was returned
with the largest majority that bas ever been
given to any government in this country. At
that time the Prime Minister, Right Honour-

able W. L. Mackenzie King, made a solemn
promise to this country that there would never

be conscription for overseas service. That
promise was also given by one of his very
able Ministers, a man whom I held in the
highest esteem, the late Right Honourable
Ernest Lapointe. After Mr. Lapointe had
pledged his fealty and loyalty to the Crown
and to his own native country, and expressed

bis earnest desire that the war would prove
successful, he said that he was absolutely
against conscription, and if it was ever put
into force ail the Cabinet Ministers from
the province of Quebec would leave the
Government.
As the war progressed and became more
serious,

especially

after

Pearl

Harbor,

the

Government felt it had to do something. First
it inaugurated what was called a thirty-days
plan of military training for young men of
twenty and twenty-one. It meant that the
men were given only about three weeks training. Afterwards the period of training was
extended to four months. Later on, the Government brought in conscription for the
defence of Canada, to remain in effect for the
duration of the war.
I want to say to my honourable friends
opposite that at that time the Government
created two armies in Canada, and we still
have two armies. If there is any friction such
as the honourable leader opposite referred to
a short time ago, I say plainly and emphatically that it is due to the organization by the
Government of two armies in the midst of a
great war. We ought to have had only one
army, with ail its members subject to service
overseas, and should have retained in this
country only a sufficient number of men for
the protection of our two coasts.
As my honourable friend opposite knows,
by 1942 the Prime Minister felt the pressure
of public opinion, so a plebiscite was held to
relieve him and the Government of the pledge
that there would be no conscription. Eight
provinces favoured conscription, but one
province, my own, said, "No." Then things
remained in statu quo for quite a long while.
As the war became more serious the demand
grew for a greater number of our sordiers to
be sent abroad; and once the Japanese menace
had been removed, attention was called to

476

the cost of the home defence army, which was

about $150,000,000 a year.
According to a statement made in another
place last evening by the former Minister of
Defence, Colonel Ralston, word kept coming
that the pools of reinforcements were getting
nearly empty and that there was a shortage of
recruits, so he decided to make a personal visit
to the front. I am not now and have not been
for many years a member of Colonel Ralston's
party, the Liberal party, but I want to say
that in the last war he proved himself to be a
gallant soldier, and in this war he has been
a conscientious and efficient Minister. On his
visit to the front, according to bis own words,
he not only consulted members of the Supreme
Higli Command in the various theatres of
war, but lie called on brigadiers, colonels and
other officers, and satisfied himself that the
situation was really alarming. Instead of staying overseas six weeks lie eut his visit in two,
and hurried back to Canada to inform the
Prime Minister and bis other colleagues of the
serious shortage of reinforcements.
It appears that in the debate that has been
going on in another place the Cabinet doors
have been opened to a certain extent. So far
as I know, it is the first time that this has
been done under our British Parliamentary
system. Colonel Ralston asserted last niglit
that as some secret information bad been given
eut by the Prime Minister, this justified him
also in giving certain information. The substance of Colonel Ralston's report te the
Cabinet was tiat reinforcements for the
infantry were badly needed, and at once. He
said that after presenting this report in great
detail te his colleagues in the Government, lie,
having in mind iliat the N.R.M.A. army had
been created net only for the defence of
Canada but in order that men miglit be trained
and in readiness for service abroad if required,
asked the Government to endorse his suggestion and give him the authority to use as
many of these men as were necessary for oversecas reinforcements.
We all know that after days of serious discussion Colonel Ralston's suggestion was
turned down. It is to be regretted that it
was turned down, because he said last night,
in a memorable speech, that he had all his
plans made for rushing N.R.M.A. men to the
front, where they are so urgently needed. He
had actually engaged space for the men on
ships. A minority of the Government favoured
his proposal, but a majority turned it down,
so lie was not able to carry it through. He
went on to say that therefore we have lost
valuable time. He spoke te this effect: Every
month, every week, every day, every hour,
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

counts. Hadi my fair and reasonable suggestion been accepted by my colleagues, there
probably would have been by now, or if not
now, certainly very soon, 10,000 men on the
way to the front.
The Prime Minister, according to bis own
statement, has always believed in the voluntary
system.
General
McNaughton,
the
former Commander in Chief and present
Minister of Defence, stated in two speechesone at Arnprior and the other at Ottawathat when the war began he favoured voluntary enlistment and still favoured it, believing that the necessary reinforcements
could be obtained under that system. Honourable members will recall that shortly after
General
McNaughton's
appointment
the
Prime Minister spoke by radio to the people
of this country in faveur of continuing the
voluntary system, and expressed the view
that Canada was very fortunate in having as
Minister of Defence the former Commander
in Chief of the Army, who thoroughly
believed in the voluntary system. The Prime
Minister virtually assured the people that
they could rest easily in their beds and have
no doiit that a sufficient number of reinforcements would be sent overseas.
Then Parliament wns called. I do net suppose that anyone in this generation or possibly
in the generations to come will ever sec another
exhibition of such a quick change in policy.
By conent of the other House General
MeNaugliton was allowed to appear before it.
On Wednesday of lat week lie was all for
volu:ntary enlistment, and so was the Prime
Minister, bot at Thursday's sitting there was
a lightning change. The Prime Minister and
the Government bad turned a double semersault on this question. The Prime Minister
introduced an Order in Council putting conscription on the Statute Book and enabling the
ncw Minister of Defence to call by draft or
compulsion 16.000 N.R.M.A. men for service
overseas. It is in many ways a curious Order
in Council, for the men to be drafted are called
upon to serve in a European war theatre only.
No mention is made of the Pacifie war theatre,
although the soldiers in our armies now overseas are sworn in te serve everywhere. This in
itself is an inequality.
Further, when the
Minister of National Defence desires more
men, lie must get them through a fresh Order
in Council. He may draft an Order in Council
for a thousand men to-day, another thousand
to-morrow, and so on, but for -the present he
is limited to 16,000 men. In common with
many other persons I have been wondering
why lie did net call all the trained N.R.M.A.
men. There are 42,000 in all, and of these it
is stated that 26,000 are fully trained as infantry. Why were they not all drafted?

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
Hon. Mr. KING: They are aIl subject to
being drafted.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: This war bas
flot yet been won. As I said a momfent ago,
16,000 men is in. this global war a small
number for which to, take authority te send
overseas. He may want three, four or five
times as many men. In any event, it would
have been only fair and reasonable that -the
Order in Council should have covered ail of
the N.R.M.A. men, especially as niost of them
have been in training for four yýears.
1 do not know that any good purpose would
be served by mny dwelling further on this subject. I think what drove the Government to
pass the Order in, Council was public opinion
throughout this country, and its refloction in
the press. Day hy day you cauld feel the
indignation rising as the peaple urged the
Government to, take the step to which 1 have
just, referred.
I do flot, think that either
Parliament or the people will be satisfied with
this limited measure of assistance. It is quite
possible that the Prime Minister and the Government will be given a vote of confidence in
the other Hanse. But even sa, the power
behind Parliament, the electorate, the men and
wom n from. one end of the country ta the
other, will not, 1 think, be satisfled with this
limitation. Myr own province is dissatisfled.
Undoubtedly the Government is in a rather
awkward position; but I want. it clearly understooci that w-e are nat opposing the Order in

of sending ovorseas these mon and as- many
more as may be needed, and we are ready ta
ca-operate with the Government in the future
as we bave in the past.
Before I road the platform of the Progressive-Conservative party adopted at a large
acd representative convention in Winnipeg in
1912, 1 wish ta make it abundantly plain that
w'hile 1 am enunciating the principles of the
party, there miây bo some of my good friends
sitting on this side of the ('hamhpr who conscientiously hold different views. If they do,
I hope they will express them hero. But it is
my duty as leader of the Progressive-Canservative party in this House ta place bef are
yau at this time the platform, with which,
no douht, honýourable members are quite

famili ai.
Same Hon. MEMBERS: Read it.
Han. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I will read it
with pleasure. The convention was held at
Winnipeg an Decemnber 9, 10, and 11, 1942.
Lot me read this pledge ta the Services:
We pledge to the mon and women in the Services at home, abroad and et sea, support ta

477

the limit of oui' resaurces, ta the end that they
shaîl be adequately supplied with reinforcements, equipment and munitions of war in order
that they can and shall be sa employed in
co.-aperatian with aur fighting Allies that
Canada shahl make hier due and honaurable
contribution ta a common and camplete victory.
Now a.s ta compulsory service:
Recagnizing that the world struggle in which
Canada is engaged requires a total war effort,
we believe in Comopulsary National Selective

Service, and that ail those selected -ta serve in
the Armed Forces should be available for service wherever required. We believo in the

effective total utilization and proper allocation
for war, by compulsion where necessary, of
all the resaurces of Canada, including agriculture, industry and finance, as well as manpower,
and that aur aima should ho at aIl times ta
bring about so fai' as human moans can achieve
it, an equality in sacrifice.
Notwithstanding any policies that may have
prevailed in the past, I repeat, that was the
palicy adopted at the Winnipeg convention
when the Hon. John Bracken was chosen
leader, and that is the policy which had his
full approval and that of the party. Not only
was that aur policy in 194, but it has been
aur policy ever since, and it is the policy
that we shaîl stand an ta the end.
Ilonourable sonctars cannat have failed ta
observe the striking similnrity of the prescrnt
sbortago of rocruits for the army overseas
and the shurtage which developed during the
hast w-ar. Perhaps honourable sonatars will
excuse a personal allusion. When I was in
Englaud in 1916 Sir Sam Hughes asked me
if I would nat endeavour ta raise a second
battalion of Canadian Grenadier Guards for
averseas service. Recruits wcre at that time
very bard ta got. I demurred awing ta my
lack of military knawledge, for I had been
out of tbc militia for many years, but eventually hoe prevailed upon me ta accede ta his
requcst. We stcrtod reruiting in September
1916.
Officers and friends collected over
$15,O00 to carry on the campaign. We had
large and smahl posters on cll the bill-boards;
we had bands parading the streets. and wo
had rocruiting officers gaing ta the factories
at lunch-time ta try ta induce mon ta enlist.
Theseoafficers even went sa far as ta say
ta the mon in their hattalians: "If you bring
in a recruit, and hoe passes the medical board,
wo will give you a -certain cash banus." After
nine months' bard work we had ta give Up.
Voluntary enlistment was at an end.
Thon Sir Rabert Borden intraduced the
Military Service Act.
The Conservatives
were in power with a good mai ority, but hoe
decided ta form a Union Government. This
is what hoe tohd me personally after I joined
the Gavernment. He had called a caucus of

178

bis party, and ail the merabers were agreed
on the Mîhitaîy Service Att, but there was
hy ne ineans unanireity with regard to a
Union Goxernment.
W/Bat did that great
statesesan, a mian cf wonderfui courage, say
to tihe Conservative
caucus?
Hle said,
'Gentlemen, mny mind is made up. If you
-want me as leader, I will be leader of a
Union Coveroiment and none other, but if
,you want to appoint someone cisc your
leader, it is perfectiy agreeabie to me." The

lias aiready been se detrimiental te us. conscription. I must once mocre air rny feelings on
tisis matter.
Twenty-sevon years ago, when a conscriptien measure was proposed by rny ostoomod
leader, Sir Robert Borden, I opposed it. Two
years age, when tBe right honnîrrabir Mackenzie King submitted the principie of conscription te, our consideration, I took the sarne

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
stand. To-day, we are concerned with the
same principle and I wish simply to restate
My opposition to it.
First, however, I must define the nature of
my feelings. I do not dlaim that conscription
in itself is a measure fully and. iuvariably indefensible. Conscription ta defend the country
against a ruthless aggressor, ta protect the
homes and altars, t-o prevent the native soul
fromn being trodden by ravaging hordes is a
taken of devotion to andi love of that majestic
and holy inheritance, the homeland. But
conscription or coercion for the purpýose of
tearing fromn their homes the pick of our
young men, to send. them. to foreign coun,
tries across the oceans and even to the antipodes, to fight on far-reinoved fields of battie,
is an abusive and tyrannical measure. The
cross-currents of politics have brought us once
again ini the presence of that type of conscription.
In spite of ail the con.scrîptionists may
eIaim, this frenzy of coercion is completely
foreign to the British turn of mmnd. Throughout the centuries, the English have been
averse to conscription. It is only when face
ta face with an impending, danger that the
Parliament in Westminster have been able to
pass a limited conscription measure in 1916.
Even then, illustriaus parliamentarians such
as Mr. Asquith, Sir John Simon andu others,
have not concealed their anti-conscriptionjst feelings. ObviGusly, in the prescit war, the
whole of England's human and material
resources have for the last four years been put
into a gigantic effort with a view to averting
the most appalling catastrophe which has
ever threatened hier in the course of her long
and glorious history. But she was fighting for
her freedom, her independence, and ber
national life.
Those who advocate conscription in thîs
country can neyer bring us ta admit that our
case is similar. Our case is that of a young
American nation, separated fromn the Old
World by 3,000 miles of ocean. Undoubtedly,
that extensive oceanie area has not to-day the
saine protective power as formerly. But it
will nevertheless be granted tbat the Atlantic
is wider than the English Channel, that small
arm of the sea whose protection has nevertheless saved the British Isies fromn a Hitierian
invasion in the dark days of 1940. No, we
were not and we still are not in the same situation as England, France, Belgium, Holland,
Denmark or Norway. Ours is the case of a
North American confederation which is a part
of the Britisb Commonwealth and which, in
view of the formidable onslaugbt of the Hitlerian menace, bas resolved to help the free
nations to cbeck the devastating torrent. To

479

help, to contribute, to participate in England'é
effort, and later in the United States' effort.
was and had ta be our rote at the outbreak of
the great world war. 1 have always believed
and 1 still believe that inl sa doing we were
taking a national course that was worthy of
approval. But such participation, as no one
has certainly forgotten, was to be in keeping
with our means of action. It was to be moderate, praportionate to our population, and to
the Canadian nation's resources. I shall show
in a few moments what it has been. But I
wisb to emphasize that difference, tbat disparity as regards obligation, duty and responsibility which undoubtedly exiats between this
country and the nations that were directly
threatened and to wbicb we extended aur help.
I know quite well tbat in 1940 and 1941 the
horizon became still darker, that tbe Nazi
supremacy appeared more threatening, and
that the danger became more dreadful, and I
quite understand an intensified effort on aur
part would result tbereby. Was it bound,
however, to increase out of ail proportion,
keeping. in mind our duties and responsibilities?
Now the sky has cleared, sinister clouds have
scattered and the dawn of victory rises on the
horizon of liberated nations. At such a time
are we assailed with frenzied clamouring for
conscription, a step from whicb we had swamn
to steer clear in aur military endeavour. 1
commend the words spoken in another bouse
by a man who played a very competent part
in our war effort; I refer ta the Hon. Charles
Gavan Power and quote the following passage:
Conscription may be justified in moments of
national crisis and in defence of one's country.
It might have been justified at certain periods
and phases of this war when w-e were on the
brink of almost certain defeat. It might haw'e
been justified if D-day bad been a smashing
catastrophe instead af a brilliant success. But
these days are now past. We have no rigbt to
tear this country asunder at this stage, and in
this etate of the war.
And I wish ta quote also these wardsg fromn
another statesman, the Rigbt Hon. Mackenzie
King: Since the landing, which relatively speaking
was carried through with amazingly small loss,
France bas been freed, Belgium. bas been freed,
part of Holland bas been freed, a still larger
part of Italy bas been freed, Greece has been
freed; in Yugoslavia the forces which were
opposed ta and fighting one another have been
brought together and are workin aaisth
enremy; the satellite nations afemanyRoumania and Bulgaria-instead of being at
ber side, have turned against bier and are fighting against her ta-day. Add ta ahl that that
Russia bas driven the enemy off bier soil and
bas invaded Gerniany and is figbting on German
soul to-day. Mare than that, United States

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
I shal 110W conclude. I wanted to register
my protest against ail those excesses in1 word-s
or actions which we are witnessing. We are
going to have conscription, in violation of ail
pledges and promises. We are going to have
that drastic measure whîch lias divided us,
which. will divide us again, and whicha we
ought to have avoided 'by following the
eminently judicious advice given in 1941 hy
the outstanding publie man who was then
Minister of National Defence, Colonel Ralston:
Were we to resort to the measures advocated
(conscription), we would be adopting a difierent
method than that implemented in the Commonwealth of Australia. May I point out that this
selfsame question had torn and divided the
country in 1917. We are now united. Let us
endeavour to remain s0 inâtead of introducing
a factor of disunity in a war effort of wbichi
Canada may justly be proud. 1 condemn the
attitude of public men and others who advocate
a different systema whicb bas not been provcd
necessary, because they thereby impair our war
effort.
This advice, given hy the Hon. Mr. Ralston
in 1941, is stili appropriate in spite of present
circumstances. It condemned conscription in
1941. It stili conderons thiýs disastrous measure in 1944.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I regret that I was not able to
follow the remarks of the last speaker. It
will be my privilega to read tbema when they
are translated.
I raad the speech that he
made here in 1942 on the Bill to amend the
National Resources Mobilization Act, and I
balieve ail honourable seiaators wiII agree
with me in saying that howaver mucli we may
differ with biin wa must, respect his views as
baving been expresseci conscîentiously and in
the ight of history as ha has reaci and

studied it.
Hlon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mm. FARRIS: The bonourabla gentleman frorn Granýdville (Hlon. Sir Thomas
Chapais) is one of the most respacted mcmbers of the Senate. In bis province he is

ragardcd as the hîghest authority on bistory.
I will venture to say that when bis speech
cf this afternoon is read it wjll be found to
contain no endorsamant of the Winnipeg
Convcntion's principles of conscription. I
.mention that at this time, honourable senators, becausa 1 have heard it asserted more
than once tbat the Liberal party is -reaping
what it bas sown in the province of Quehcc.
The Liberal party neyer sowed any of the
id-eas or ideals relating to conscription that
have heen pronounced by the honourable
senator from Grandville. I will ventura to
say also that ini the province of Quahec there
are a great many people who have received
their inspiration and their views fromn his

481

teachings and. pronouncements. That being
so, in approaching this question of conscription we must realize that ini regard to it
there are in Canada two views whidha in
principla and in conviction are dîametricahly
opposed.

I expressed my views when

Bill 80 was

hafora this House in 1942. I quote from page
319 of Senate Hlansard:
There is about this word "conscription" a
prejudice which is flot justified. The literaI
mcaning of the word is, "The act of writing
down on paper-an enrolment." Conscription
of men, in short, therefora is the ordemly systemn
of writing down the list of men who are available for war service and other services, and
then aftar the enrolment is complote it involves
procceding in an intelligent way ta select thosa
who from age, physical qualifications and freedom from f amily tics should be the fimst to go,
and to decide, on the same basis, tbe time wben
each mian's turn sbould corne. Tbis should be
donc, not by gucss-work, but intelligently,
accordiog to cstablished rules set up by conpatent public autbority in the intaeet of the
Stata and according to the ordinary principles
of fair play. It should bc regarded. not as~
compulsion, but as intelligent and practical
selection. The tbeory is based on the assumption that every man wbo is a worthy citizen
is willing ta serve,' but tbat the State shoiffl
say wbo sbould scrvc, ani wben and wbere be
sbould serve. Tt je logical, it is fair, it is
democratie and it is efficient.
I laid that down at that time as my belief in
the gencral principle of conscription. But I
stated then, and I repeat nýow, that circunastanes~ ins this country require us to modify
our viaws on the g-eneral principla so far as is
nccessary; and I do not mean mercly politically necessary, but practically necessarypractically necessary in the administration in
ordcr to secume the co-opemation of a unitad
people.
To-day there are still stronger
rcasons for taking that view than thare warc
in 1942, for the neccssity that confronts us
to-day is not that orderly selection should
apply in the first place without an clemnt of
compulsion, but that there should ha compulsion.
That is the most unfortunate
neccssity that could cxist in this country.
We bave been hera for over a week and
hava spent our time listaning to debates in
the Housa of Commons. That has not been
donc casually or as a matter of curiosity. It
bas beýen done as the basis on wbicha we as
senators must form our opinions and found
our discussions. If we as members of this
Chamber bad not been able to hear what the
Prime Minister saîd, and the statement and
axplanations of the Minister of National
Defence, and the vicws exprassed hy Colonel

Raîston as the former Minister of that
Department, it would ha uttarly impossible
for us intelligently and collectively to avaluate
and discuss the question. For that reason,
and because of the gravity of the situation,

SENATE

482

it seems to me that in our discussions we
must form our ideas and base our statements
on what has been said in the other House.
Technically, to a miner degree, we may have
to transgress the rule which forbids us to refer
to speeches made in another place; but I
think every senator will appreciate the necessity for indulgence, and certainly I will net
abuse it in the sense of making an attack on
any member of the other body.
I am net unmindful of the statement which
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne) made before we were called here,
that as a body of-I do not know whether Le
used the expression "elder statesmen"Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

No.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Well then, that as a
body of men experienced in public life our
views might be not merely of assistance te the
Government, but, what at this stage is almost
all-important, of assistance to a worried and
perplexed people. It is with that idea that
I propose to make my small contribution as
one of the members of the Senate of Canada.
The issues, I think, were fairly outlined by
the Prime Minister, and I would summarize
them as two. First: Is the action of the
Government adequate to ensure all necessary
reinforcements
for our forces
overseas?
Second: If the answer is in the affirmative,
should the Covernment at this time be supported in its war effort?
Is the action of the Government adequate?
I think it is our duty te sec tiat that issue
is no
it clouded by irrelevant speeches or
by irrelex ant discussions in the newspapers.
With all deference to my honourable friend
the leader opposite, I submit it is not a question of how many kinds of armies there may
be. After all, the National Resources Mobilization Act, so-called, was passed in 1940.
lon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

1942.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, the amendment
was )isse(l in 1942, but the N.R.M.A. with
its restrictive provisions that men should serve
only in Canada, was pasSed in 1940.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Correct.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My recollection is that
it was passed virtually unanimously by both
Houses of Parliament. That is where this
cleavage between the two armies started. It
was a policy approved by all Canadians as represented in the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There was no provision
in that Act to call men.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I beg my honourable
friend's pardon. That Act authorized the
tonscription of men, but under section 3 they
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

could not be sent overseas. The Act of 1942
simply repealed section 3. The basic operative
provision in regard to putting men into this
so-called home army was passed in 1940 by
virtually the unanimous vote of the Parliament of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There was a
grave menace from Japan in 1942, and that
is why the Bill was passed virtually unanimously; but after that menace passed away we
continuously opposed the measure.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am saying that for
reasons that were good and sufficient at that
time the Bill which recognized the distinction
between the two armies-and it was set forth
in specific terms-was unanimously passed by
Parliament.
The first question which I now ask in order
that we may answer it is this: "Is the action
of the Government sufficient to ensure that
adequate reinforcements be sent overseas?" To
my mind the essential thing there is not how
or from what type of army they come. But
bear this in mind. If the Act results in men
going overseas and facing the enemy, there is
in that sense only one Canadian army; and
the man who stands there and gives his life
or takes the risk of giving it, or whio is
wounded or suffers in other ways, is a part
of that Canadian army in the fullest sense, no
imatter how mustered or from what source le
came. That ought to be the spirit in which
this thing should be approached.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I very much doubt
whether any person has even thought those
men would net be part of the Cauadian army
when they went overseas. I arn certain they
will become just as good soldiers as those
who are already over there. The only question is how to get them overseas as required reinforcements.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I quite understand my
honourable friend taking that view. He need
not look at me so severely, for I quite agree
with him.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am saying that once
we are satisfied that the men are going, this
discussion of two armies in Canada seems both
superfluous and irrelevant.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
be an army left here.

There will still

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I will discuss that a
little later when I come to the question of socalled total conscription.
I think therefore that we in this Chamber,
as a nearly-united if net entirely-united body,
may approach the question with this proposition. I heard it first from General McNaugh-

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
ton. It was not recorded, but I see nothing
in it that should not be published. He stated
that the Canadian Army must not plull its
punches. The reason given by the General
seems to be fundamental in that connection
at least, and I am sure that honourable members opposite will agree with it. Secondly,
I think that most of .us here now find ourselves feeling, not that the voluntary system
has failed, but that it has reached the end of
its complete effectiveness. Thirdly, it would
appear that for the immediate situation the
only trained soldiers in Canada available to
be sent overseas are N.R.M.A. men, of whom
8,000 are f.ully trained and 8,000 trained in
part, but to an advanced degree. In addition there are other N.R.M.A. men scattered
over Canada, making in all-what was the
number my honourable friend said?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 26,000 more.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

42,000 in all.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is, there are
26,000 more scattered over various parts of
Canada, and in Labrador, Newfoundland and
the West Indies.
Evidently a substantial
number of these men could in due course
have their training completed. I say in due
course, for it cannot be done overnight. But
I think it should be emphasized, not for the
information of this body but for the information of people outside-that is, if anyone
outside ever reads what senators say-that the
only available soldiers whom this law could
reach at present are the 16,000 N.R.M.A. men.
Having come this far, the next question we
should ask ourselves is this. Do the facts
justify us in concluding now that the Government has made adequate provision to ensure
that the men available will go overseas? Well,
with all deference to those who take another
view, I say that this Order in Council is not
partial conscription, but an Order in Council
which in principle decides the question. The
Prime Minister has said so. He said that the
issue of conscription was settled in 1942, and
that the time of its application was when the
Order in Council was passed. The Order in
Council deals with men who are at present
available or can be made available in the near
future.
All that remains to be done, as
further men become trained and available, is
the making of a recommendation by the
Minister of National Defence and the passing
of one or more Orders in Council-a mere
routine for a Government which passes Orders
in Council as though they came out of a
sausage machine. That is no reflection on
the Govemment, because under war conditions
it is necessary to pass numerous Orders in
Council.

483

Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourable
gentleman a question? Is he sure that what
he has stated is the view of the Minister
of Agriculture?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know, and
I do not care. I am sure that it is the view
of General McNaughton, and I am sure it
is the pledged view of the Prime Minister
of Canada. I am also sure that if the time
comes when the Minister of National Defence
says, "I have additional men ready and they
are needed," an Order in Council will go
through or the Government will resign. That
is my firm belief, and in the light of my
experience and of what I have studied, I
know of nothing to cause me the slightest
doubt that that is correct.
In addition to other statements that have
been made, there was the declaration last
night by the former Minister of National
Defence that he accepted the Order in Council.
He was not satisfied with it alone; but he
said: "If the Prime Minister means what I
think he means, and if General McNaughton
means what I think he means"--and he was
not challenged in that-"I accept that Order
in Council." There is no object in my labouring that point. That analysis of the facts
satisfies my mind that the situation is secure.
I can think of nothing in the conduct of the
Prime Minister or of the present Minister of
National Defence to make me believe that
they will do anything to make the situation
insecure.
If that be so, let us come to the second
point. As I say, there are only two points
for our consideration. If the answer to the
first question is "Yes," then shall we give
support to the Government in its war effort?
That word "we" is very comprehensive. By
'twe" I mean not merely members of the
Senate and of the House of Commons, but
the people of Canada. And when I speak
of support, I mean not in the next election,
for we are not concerned with that at this
stage, but now and as long as it is necessary
for the present Government to carry on.
Under the system of responsible government as distinct from representative government-they both are constitutional systems
-an administration remains in office as long

as it has the support of the elected house.
If it loses that support, it goes out. I think
honourable members will agree with me that
all indications are that a vote of non-confidence in the Government will not be given
at this time. But the question I have asked
involves more than a vote of want of confidence in the Government. There is more
involved than the fact that Colonel Ralston
has grudgingly consented to vote with the

484

SENATE

Government on the resolution. That is not
enough. If it stood there I should feed that
certain vital things had been overlooked.
Colonel Raîston's support is flot enough. The
House af Commons' support is not enough.
Even the unanimous support of lhis Sonate
wouid be fac fromn enough. If this Government is to carry on successfully so that
Canada, may make its full war effort from
to-day, this tbirtieth day of November, until
sueh time as the Qovernment goes out of
office, it must have behind it a restored public
confidence and support.
Same Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If it does flot have
that, honourable senators, our war effort will
.nat measure up to what it bas been in the
past.
Hon. Mr. IIAIG: Hear, hear. You are
right.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS :I teck that to ha se.
I was going te say that bonourable members
who are fortunate aneugh te understand the
French language may have gained some insigbt
into the situation from the rernarks of the
hono-urable gentleman who preceded me (Hon.
Sir Thomas Chapais). I was told by an
henourable gentleman wbo site near me that
the bonourable senater from Grandville (Hon.
Sir Thumas Chapais) spoka alung semewbat
the sama lina that ha fellowed in 1942, but I
presume that ha brougbt bis ramarks up ýte
date.

tary systern from the. beiinning of ýthis war
until the Order in Council was passed. Quite
dispassionately and without fear of having my
ramarks judged critically by those who rnay
raad them, I want to submit to, you why I
think -that is se. In the first place, this voluntary system brought a united Canada into the
war. There is nlot an honourable member
present who will challenge that statement. I
repeat, it was the veluntary system which
brought Canada inte the war as a united
nation. It is on record, the honourable leader
bas mantioned it, and I have baf ore me a bost
of quotations that I could cite. It is on record,,
1 say, in tha pages -of Canadian bistory tbat
immediately prier to the war, at -the time we
came into the war, and during the election
of 1940, the voluntary system contributad
to, unity in Canada and should be contiuued
as long as it was practical. Net only did.
that systam 'bring a unitad Canada into
the war, but for five years and some. montbs
that system bas kept Canada in the war with
a full all-out contribution as a united country.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask you, wbat
about tbe plebiscîte and a united country?
Hon. Mr. FARRIýS: I ad-mit thera was a
plebiscite, but wbat in the we'rId that bas got
te do witb the question of unity I do net
know.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It did net show unity;
tbat is a cinch.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: In any avent, wbat ha
said would apply te Quebcc, and would net
explain the attitude of men who coma from
other parts of the ceuntry. It is thair attitude
that I arn worried about.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Now, adbering te my
text, I submit tw*e propositions on wbich I
want te basa my argument that the people
should continue thair confidence in this Govarnment in order that the country may make
its hast war effort. We know that undar the
present administration Canada's war effort has
heen a magnificant succass. We canno't ignore
that without doing injustice te every Canadian
who has participated in the effort. I amn sure
the Prime Minister weuld be the last oe te
say that ha, alene ought te receive credit fer
its success. But these thinge de net just
bappan, and this magnificent success could net
have heen achiaved under incompetent leadership and a disorgenized governmen.t.
Tbe second proposition that I submit fer
your consideration, honourabla sanators, is that
confidence, in Mackenzie King should net ha
lessaned because of bis support of the volun-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. It sbowad eight
provinces on ene &ide and oe province on the
other.
Hen. Mr. FARRIS: That is trua; but wbat
I amn saying is tbat notwithstanding the
plabiscite Canada bas gene on until October
of this yaar witb a full-out war effort.
Hon. Mr. HAIG - Let me ask my bonourable friend a question. One part of Canada
faveurs the voluntary systam, ýeven when
compulsien is found te ba necessary; but the
otbe, parte say, "No, we balieve in giving the
Government power te put in conscription."
It is they wbo are raising the objection to
partial Ineasures; nobody else.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If rny honourable
friend is looking for someene to place the
blame on, he is at liberty te do se, but 1 arn
net d.iscussing that attitude. I arn not blarning anyone. I arn in sympatby with *my
henourable friend who speke ahead of me.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honeura-ble gentleman misunderstands my question. He is asking us wby people have lest confidence in the
Government.

486

SENATE

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Oh, no.
Hno. Mr. HAIG:

I think you are.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No. I am showing
now why they should have confidence.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is the same thing.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, it is not the same
thing. I say first that under the vol.untary
system this country was brought into the war
as a united nation, and I submit it could not
have been donc in any other way. Blame
anybody you like; it could not have been
accomplished in any other way. The fact is
that every public man of responsibility in
Canada recognized that at the time, and for
that very reason approved of the voluntary
system. I have already stated my view that,
as a method of selective service at the start
.Of a war. conscription is undoubtedly the
fairest and the most effective system. But
"if meat shall cause my brother to faint, I
shall eat no meat"; and if such a belief rammed down the throat of a sister province is
going to create an impossible situation in this
country, then I say it should not be adopted
unless the time bas cone when no other way
can be found of securing the needed reinforcemonts for our troops overseas.
For five years and some months, until last
October, Canada' svoluntnarv sytem resulted in
a unitcd effort and a magnificent performance.
Our war-time production under the direction
of Ministm:s like Mr. Howe in Munitions and
-with
all deference to my friend opposite I
think
i mnay mention him-Mr. Gardiner in
Agriculture and Mr. Humphrey Mitchell in
manpower, is something that every Canadian
is proud of and that our Allies point te with
the highest commendation.
The Canadian
people have subscribed generously to our war
loan.s. but they have donc so under the earnest
direction of Mr. Ilsley and Colonel Gibson.
Our young mon of the Navy have covered
themselves with glory.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
lon. Mr. FARRIS: There is no question
about that. But the Nay w-s organized and
made its magnificent record under an effective
leader-hip. Service in the Navy hbas been 100
per cent voluntary. and undoubtedly that
systom will continue to the end of this war.
The same remarks apply to the Air Force.
The man woe under a system of voluntary
enlistment organized our Air Force, the man
who. so far as Canada i concerned. gave
leadership to that great organization known
as the Commonwealth Air Training Plan, has
withdrawn from
the Government in a
protest which is the direct opposite of that
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

of Colonel Ralston. I am confident his withdrawal will be recorded in Canadian history
as a tragcdy. To some of the significances of
that I shall in a few moments direct the
attention of honourable members.
Colonel Ralston was responsible for the
splendid organization of our army. I have
not before me the speech which he made in
the House of Commons on the 10th day of
Julv last, but I have road it with great interest
and marked it for reference. In that speech
ho proclaimed that from the start of the war
until the day ho was speaking the voluntary
system had been successful in relation to our
army operating overseas. No man questions
the honesty or the accuracy of that statement.
Let me compare that record just for a
moment, not to attack conscription or the
recognition to-day of its necessity, but simply
to get the viewpoint and justification of the
ministry in its hesitation to bring in conscription at the first intimation of necessity.
As honourable members know, many unkind
things have been said about the Prime
Minister, both in the newspapers and on the
public platform, to the effect that all ho is
doing is playing politics. Well, that strikes me
as incomprehensible. I do not believe there
is a member of this HouseHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Why did he
refuse to Mr. Ralston what later he gave
General MeNaughton?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is a fair question
and I will deal with it. But I hope my
honourable friend docs not mean that he
thinks the Prime Minister lias taken his
course in order to play politics.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, I would not think
so. But that is the issue I amn asking honourable members to consider at this time.
lon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Dots my honourable friend know that the leader of one of
the great parties of this country at a public
meeting in this city called the Prime Minister
a coward?
lon. Mr. FARRIS: I

Io not know that.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It is in the newspapers.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I think my honourable
friend should state who it was.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
Bracken.

The Hon. John

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I would suggest ihat vou

for the past tbree years. They are volunteers.
I do not tbink I would say that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I did flot say that.

Well, my
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
honourable friend cal.led on the honourable
gentleman to state wbo it was.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It is in tbe newspapers.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quota the text

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I arn offering no disrespect to Mr. Bracken. 1 bave been inforrned
of and have the fullest, appreciation of the
great contribution he is making to this war;
but notwitbstanding that, if Mr. Bracken
made that staternent, I say it is just too
bad. I think instead of rny honourable friend
taking objection to what I arn doing hereHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

No, I arn not

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honouraýble friend
fro-m Winnipeg is.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 arn objecting to somýe
alleged statement being introduced which
makes a political issue. Do not misunderstand
me, I arn quite willing to discuss it. I know
John Bracken better than any other man
in this Chamber. I sat with hirn in the Manitoba Legislature for -thirteen years, and I
know hirn inside out. 1 do know that hae bas
four sons, three of whom have been in the
arrned services overseas for three years. I
think it is vcry questionable whether bis namne
should be brought into this debate. If any
man can stand up and say hie bas three boys
in the arrned forces overseas, then bie bas a
not
rigbt to criticize John Bracken; but
otberwise.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not accept the

suggestion

that public

discussion

must be

measured 'by the number of boys you have
overseas.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But you are rnaking poli-

tical capital out of it.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No, my honourable
friend bas no rigbt to say that. I bave made
no political capital out of anything, but since
this question bas corne up, I will say that no
matter ho>w many sons a man rnay have overseas, I do not think hie bas the right to cal
the Prime Minister of this country a coward.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNEMr. Bracken did.

I do not think

487

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I hope not. My honourable friend fromn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Haig) ought to t.hank me for bringing this Up,
because in a few minutes we shaH get to the
bottom of it. 1 would say of this story, as
of some others, that the sooner we get to the
bottomn of it the better. There are too many
insinuations being made in this country-and
they are not ail made on one side of the
fence, by any means.
I corne back to the issue that I arn asking
honourable senators to consider. The recognition by ail public men in the past of the
desirability of maintaining the voluntary systerr as long as possible, and the difficulties and
animosities that were created in the last war,
teach us, flot that we should flot have conscription if it hecomes necessary, but that we
should flot have it unless we are satisfied it is
necessary. The longer the war continues, the
nearer we are to the end of it, and the greater
the certainty that conscription, if hrought in,
would be regarded as straight compulsion, and
not as national selective service, the greater
should be the care not to, invoke it unless
necessary. That is the submission 1 would
make to honourable senators.
Colonel Raîston bas stated what his views
witb regard to conscription were in the last
war. I understand hie was a strong supporter
of it at that time. In the speech made here
by the honourable senator frorn Grandville
(Sir Thornas Chapais) in 1942, he quoted
something that had been said in the preceding year by the Minister of National Defence
-who was, of course. Colonel Raîston. I did
not check the quotation, since I felt satisfied
that it was accurately given by the honourable
gent-leman fromn Grandville. This is what. the
Minuster said in 1941:
If the method which has been suggested were
adopted. it would be a method different fram
what the Commonwealth of Australia bas
adopted. 1 point out that this country, in 1917,
ývas seared, was divided by the verv issue which
is mentioned. We have unity in 'this country.
Let us try to preserve it rather than attempting
to drive a wcdge of disunion into a ivar effort
of which 1 think Canada ought -seli ta be

proud. 1 deprecate in public men and in others

the attitude of advocating something different
for which no need has been established. because
I believe it interferes with aur war effort.
I think that Colonel Raîston bas neyer
departed frorn that point of view, and that bis
the Goveroment last
recommendation to
month was made, as he said, not because he
felt that the voluntary systemn had failed but
that its complete effectiveness had come to an
end.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Correct.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not tbink any
object would be served by reading fromn my
notes quotations fromn staternents of other

488

SENATE

public men. I have here a statement made by
Dr. Manion, which in 1942 was queted by an
honourable colleague te rny right, from the
House of Gommons Hansard of 1939, volume 3,
page 2440.
I say to bonourable senators--and I ask
themn kindly to withhiold any dissent until I
have argued the proposition-that what hias
happened in the last month lias been flot a
condemnation of Mr. Mackenzie King's policy,
but a a'indication of it. The declaration lias
gene eut to the world that after adhering to
the veluntary systema of enlistment for five
years and some months, Canada bias been
forcod te resert te compulsion in order te
obtain sufficient soldiers for service everseas.
I tbink that is one of the mest unfertunate
things that bias happened since woe entered
tbis war. I think that flie Prine Minister,
any Prime Minister, weuld have hoon justifl&(
in prohing and testing the situation te the
utmost limit before permitting a development
that would result in that declaratien te the
world.
I have hiere extracts frein the New Yerk
Suinday Timnes of four davs ago-a friendly
liaper, a great palier, with tremcndous powe r
and influence. iltre on the front page is the
beading, "Theusand Troops Jein Protcst of

there is an Ottawa dispatehi from the Associated P'ress. I hold up) a i.lipping of it se that
benourable imeînibrs mav sec its lcngth. On
the inside pages there is a lot more. Is that
good for ouir war effort? Is that gond for
ce-epe-ration withi our neighibours te the south?
I have net seco the Chicago newspapers, but
I imagine it would bc worth while te look at
one paper in particular and read wbat it
bias said during the past weok about Canada
and her united war offert. New, 1 put this,
question te honeurable sonaters: If that sert
of thing is appearing in the newspapers of
our neighhbour, friend and allxy, do you think
it is not appearing on a greatly magnified
scalo in Jerman newspapers? I helieve-and
I have derived this idea fromi varieus utterances and editorials that I have read-that
one of the things the Gorman propagandists
are telling their people is te bold out, that
seener or later the Allies will blow up; that
there will ho a rift hetween Russia aod the
United States, or hetween Great Britain and
tbe United Statos, or between Russia and
Great Brîtain. Dees any honeurable member
imagine that the turmoil we are goiog through
here is net heing twisted eut of aIl proportion

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
Now, honourable senators, all I ask is this.
Did the Prime Minister have the same obligation to give consideration to those questions
that Colonel 'Ralston had. Cannot anybody
read between the lines and learn what the
situation is in this country? Let us go back
to four weeks ago. Colonel Ralston has said
that at that time he would have accepted
this Order in Council. Why? Because it
would have brought about a reasonable accomplishment of what we wanted, and it
would have prevented the disruption of the
Government. That is what he meant. I ask
my honourable friend, whether the Prime
Minister was not involved in the same kind
of consideration. Did not the Prime Minister
from the standpoint of public welfare have
the same obligation to avoid disruption of
the Government?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I should like to make
this interjection, since I understand the honourable gentleman will not be here to-morrow,
when I intend to reply to him. My answer
is this, if you put the question t me: The
need was there and quite plainly visible in
October. Then why not repay the Minister
who was tried and true, and so save this
turmoil you are speaking of?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is there anything to
indicate that at that time the Prime Minister
could have put through this Order in Council
without disrupting Canada?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Absolutely, just the
same as now.
Hon. Mr. rARRIS: I know this. One of the
Ministers that I think all of us admire as
much as any member of the Government, one
who is familiarly termed even by those who
are not closely acquainted with him as
"Chubby" Power, the man who had done a
wonderful piece of work in organizing the
Commonwealth Air Training Plan. a man of
fine intellect, went out of the Government
even after the Prime Minister had again
demonstrated his willingness ýto give the voluntary system a second trial. My honourable
friend laughs. Is it not ,a fact that the
Minister of Defence for Air has resigned, and
is it not a fact that other members of the
Government-probably just as many as take
the other view-hold more or less the same
view as Mr. Power? Is it not a fact that if
we are to carry on a united war effort we
must have in the Cabinet representation from
the province of Quebec?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Borden's ministers left him.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes, that is so. But I
ask my honourable friend, would he not sooner
have had the Order in Council that was finally

489

worked out than have seen a sufficient number of Ministers resign last October to make
it necessary for the Government t .retire,
thus throwing the country into the turmoil
of an election?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not know.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: All right, if honourable
members opposite are prepared to say. "No.
We would sooner have busted things wide
open; we would sooner have submitted that
issue to the people at that time and made
an exhibition of ourselves to all the world.
including Germany"-Hon. Mr. HORNER: They had an election
in the United States without any turmoil.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: They never had an
election in the United States with the breakup of a Government on an issue of that kind.
That is the difference. I do not say that
an election at this time would create that
situation, but I say an election on that issue,
with the animosities it would create, would
have seriously endangered national unity.
My honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) is listening to me very carefully. He will, I am sure, confirm me when
I say that no matter how necessary the election was in 1917, there were some very unfortunate features about it. He will confirm
my statement that a bitterness was stirred
up which, if possible, it would have been
well to avoid.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It was nothing
compared to the bitterness that prevails
to-day. I happened to have the honour and
privilege of being the first Liberal to enter
the Union Government.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am very glad my
honourable friend confirms the point I am
making, that the bitterness to-day is more
intense, and consequently that an election in
these times would have been just that much
It would have given
more unfortunate.
encouragement to the enemy much greater
than he is deriving from the present situation.
Any Prime Minister who has stood in the
breach and attempted to work out a solution so that there may be a continuance
of the Government has done a service to
Canada, and he should not have been
attacked so bitterly-at least the attacks
should be modified when the full situation is
appreciated.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I at this point
in the honourable gentleman's argument offer
what is simply an opinion? I have followed
him very closely, and I must state that I
agree with much of what he says. This ques-

490

SENATE

tion is undoubtedly an exceedingly contreversial one. If at all possible controversy
should be avoided during the war. As bas
been stated, several countries, such as Australia, South Africa, and Northern Ireland,
have not accepted the principle of compulsory
service. It seems to me that so far as the
future is concerned, that question should be
decided in peace-time and not during war.
Seme Hon. SENATORS:

Ilear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Once the Parliament
of a democratic country decides on war, as
our Parliament did unanimously, and starts
on a purely voluntary system and carries it
on for more than two years, to follow that
with a conscriptive system is exceedingly
dificult and is bound to result in great disunity throughout the country.
In the last war exactly the same thing occurred as has occurred in this war. We started
out on a voluntary basis and continued on that
basis until around the end of 1916, and the
compulsory system rtally came into operation
in 1917. We have exacly that situation today. It d'oes not differ materially in any
respect at all that I can see. The time came
when the voluntary system failed, if we were
to carry out our commitments. A similar
situation exists to-day. But tbere is one very
material difference. In the last war our forces
got inIo uhe field early in 1915, and hey continued in the field during 1916 and all through
1917. In this war D-day was on June 6 of this
year. True, wc iad certain forces in Italy
before D-day, but in the last war our forces
were longer in the field and their casualties
were very great. Consequently, if we were to
meet our commitments conscription had to
be adopted. Our casualties have been excecdingly heavy since D-day. At any rate, we
know there is absolutely no question at ail
that if we are to fulfil our obligations reinforcements must bc secured.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I agree with every
word my honourable friend has said. My argument was simply directed to this question:
First, that the form in which the present Order
in Council is drafted meets a situation, and
meets it better than would-what shall I say?
-a rubbing-it-in Order in Council, because, as
Mr. Ralston has said, under it we are able to
carry on.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:
Hon. _Mr. CALDER:

But to what point?
To the limit.
No, no.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I disagree entirely with
my honourable friend. I say that the Order
in Council, plus the promise given by the
Hon. Mr. CA LDER.

Prime Minister, plus the declaration made by
the General who for five years commanded
our army overseasHon. Mr. CALDER: Probably I misunderstood the honourable gentleman. I understood
him to say that the provisions of this Order
in Council will be all that is necessary. Colonel
Ralston did net say that. He said that the
16,000 additional men will carry us over until
the end of next May.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: But any requirements
after May will not be provided for unless
further Orders in Council are passed.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honourable friend
knows that passing Orders in Council is the
easiest thing a Government can do. With al]
deference, it seems to me that these things are
-I was almost going to say quibbles; but I
know my honourable friend does not quibble.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:

No.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I think we are dealing
with non-essentials. The main thing here is
a thing of substance. Yeu have a Government
to-day carrying on under an Order in Council
which establishes the principle of conscription,
and also you have the pledge of the Prime
Minister and thc General who organized and
led our Canadian Army overseas, and who is
now the Minister of National Defence, that as
further reinforcements are needed, everything
vill be done to procure thcm and send forward
as rtquired. You have got the thing of substance; why worry about the form?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I add one word?
I understand this is the view Colonel Ralston
takes. If that policy is pursued-I quite
understand why the Covernment desires it,
and I am net criticizing it on that account
-but if that policy is pursucd, you have two
separate forces in the present conscripted
home defence army. One section of these
forces must go to Europe and another section
is, at least for the time being, excused from
going to Europe. Now, I say that if that
policy is pursued very much further you are
only going to intensify the disunity that now
exists.
There is a further point to be
considered. Everybody knows-and the men
who were discussing this before us at the
secret meeting know it perfectly well-that
there is a possibility, if not a likelihood, that
the war will continue until after May, in
which event additional reinforcements must
be ready to go. What harm would be done if
all the men were put into one class? They
would net have to be sent out of Canada
unless they were required, but if required

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
they would be ready to go. And there would
be the additional advantage of liaving every
man in tlie force on, exactly the 'same basis.
Bon. Mr. FARRIS: The answer to that
is two-fold. In the first place, no matter
how the Order in -Council may be drafted,,
tliere are at present only 8,000 men avail-able to go.
Bon. Mr. CALDER:

Quite riglit.

And there are only

fit them to be the next ones to go.
Bon. Mr.

Be uses almost the words of Colonel Ralston.
Mark you. lionourable senators, that was in
May, 1917. Then on page 740 he refers to a
conference held at Government Bouse on
August 9, between himself, Sir Lomer Gouin,
and Sir Wilfrid Laurier, and lie says this:
Finally I proposed: 1. Coalition; 2. Suspend
Military Service Act for six months; 3. Extend
parliamentary terma for six months; 4. United

appeal for recruits.
He says, on page 741, that he was urged to
offer to Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the Bouse of
Commons what had been proposed at that conference, but upon consideration he thought

this would lie unwise.
There is Sir Robert Borden's own statement.
Be came back fromn overseas in April or May
of 1917, and on the l5th of May he said:

"Voluntary enlistment lias failed, and there is
urgent need for conscription." ,Yet, for the
sake of unity in Canada, on the 9th of August
lie madle a proposai that would have postponed
the operation of the Military Service for six
months.

Bon. Mr. CALDER: I was thinking of the
viewpoint of the men in the force.

Bon. Mr. CALDER: But he had a very
good reason for doing that.

Bon. Mr. FARRIS: I think the way to
handle men in the force is to tell thema that
they are requireci to go overseas because reinforcements are necessary, and, not to encourage them to feel that they are being disecriminated against.
I also want to deal with my honourable
friend's statement that in the last war conscription was recognized as necessary and put
jnto force as soon as possible. I would point
out to him that Sir Robert Borden was confronted with the same problem that bas confronted Mr. Mackenzie King.

Bon. Mr. FARRIS: 0f course lie liad.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If lie could have
formed a union with Sir Wilfrid Laurier at
that time. during the next six months volunteers would have been recruited on a greatly
inereased scale.

Hon. Mr. CALDER:

'Certainly.

Bon. Mr. FARRIS: I ýmean thc problem
of disiinity. Sir Robert Borden offered to go
to greater lengtlis than ever Mr. Mackenzie
King lias done. I sliould like to read a couple
of quotations from Sir Robert Borden's

Memoirs. In tlie second volume, at page 698,
lie says:
I myseîf stated to Parliament
This was on May 15, 1917.
I myself stated to Parliament that noth7lng
but voluntary enlistment was proposed by the
Government.
That was up to that time.
But I return to Canada impressed at once
with the extreme gravity of the situation, and
with s sense of responsibility for our furtlier
effort at the most critical period of the war.
It is apparent to me that the voluntary system
will not yield further substantial results. I
The Government bas made

every effort witbin its power, so f ar as I can
judge.

Bon. Mr. FARRIS: That is what lie hoped.
But when the present Prime Minister is confronted, more or less suddenly, with a serious
situation, my honourable friends are not willing that lie should take three weeks to consider it, under the advice of the manBon. Mr. CALDER: Don't blame me.
Bon. Mr. FARRIS: I am not blaming any
one. I say, it seems to bie feit that he should
not have taken three weeks to consider this
serious problem, under the advice of the man
who for five years was the Commander in
Chief of the Canadian Army. For three weeks
the Prime Minister thouglit it advisable to
give the voluntary systemn a further trial,
under the leadership of General MeNaugliton, for the sake of what? Not for the sake
of saving the Liberal party, but for the sake
of the preservation of organized government
in this country.
Bon. Mr. BORNER: But lie neyer thought
of consulting the Opposition, as Sir Robert
Borden did.
Bon. Mr. FARRIS: Sir Robert Borden did
flot consuit the Opposition until after lie had
adopted and announced his policy. I remem-

ber that one of the complaints Sir Wilfrid
Laurier made was: "You have nlot given me
an opportunity to co-operate in wbat was to
be done. You have settled the policy .and put
it Up te me to take it or leave it." I ar nft
de.sirous of going into, that naw, and referred
to it o'nly by way of ýreply to my bonourable
friend. I certainly ar nfot questioning the
great work tbat was done by Sir Robert
Berden and others during the last war. I arn
painting out that Sir Robert Borden recagnized the gravity of the problem, and hie knew
it was wortb wbile to try to avoid disruption
in this country. If tbat precautieýn was necessary in 1917, my honourable friend bas emphasizcd how mucb more it is necessary now, for
hie pointed out that the inten.sity of feeling
at presenit is far greater than it was at that
time. And that intensity is flot on one aide
alone; it is on bath aides. I arn afraid that
if we do not keep aur heads there is danger
of a very serious break-up of unity in this
caun Lry.

(Hon. Sir Thomas Cbapais), ane of the mast

I biave no do-ubt, also, that the turmoil

But I say this, that in the middle cf Octeber
the Prime Minister cf Canada had greater
reason fer apprebension than Sir Robert
Berden liad in those trying days cf April,
May, Jane, July and Aýugust, and even later,
in 1917.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: But Sir Robert
Berden fermoed a union geverument and
offered ta resign.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do net, tbink that a
unien government would solve the problcm at
this stage. There would býe an acrimanieus
election campaign and numerous demonstratiens of lack cf unity in this country.
Honouraýble senators, I have spoken longer
t han I intcnded. But if I biad been subjeet
te a time limit, His Honour the Speaker
would have made generous allewancc for the
many interruptions. In closing, 1 waot ta say
a word abeut General McNaugbton and Mr.
Mackenzie King. I did bave some material
ready about certain newspapers, the Globe
and Mail in particular. I boe that paper
will have occasion te recognize that the gevernmeýnt cf this country must. be carried, on,
and tbat if a vote cf confidence is passed it
must for the time being be carricd on under
the prescrnt administration; and further, that
in the interests cf ail newspa)er andl all (itizens it is cs,,cntial under tboý.c conditions tbat

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I arn serry my bonourable friend turcs a deaf car ta my argument.
It is ne refiection on bim whien I say I hope

xvider outlook.
Now I want te say a word about General
MceN"augbton. I have befere me a quotation
frorn a report cf a speech by Mr. Bracken.

NOVEMBER 30, 1944
He speaks as a public man, and I take it
that my friend from Winnipeg will concede
my riglit to quote his remarks, even ta criticize them.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Surely, if yau want to.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: This is a Canadian
Press dispatch which went out ta the newspapers of Canada:
The Prime Minister bas dropped a tried and
experieneed administrator and taken an one wha
had been dismissed but a few months befare.
I da flot knaw whether Mr. Bracken said
that or not, but my information is that
General McNaughton was not dismissed. It
was stated by Mr. Ralston that General
McNaughton, being in iii health, had tendered
bis resignation, and it was accepted. I think
if Mr. Bracken made that statement my hionourable friend sbould get hold of him and
give him the facts. I am sure if hie did so
Mr. Bracken wauld correct his statement.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Why did General
McNaughtan came home?
Han. Mr. FARRIS: It wa-s stateýd by the
then. Minister of National Defence that the
General was in iii health.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He got better very
quickly.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Not sa very.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: You don't want
hima ta die, da yau?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 'He denied the iii health
part of the statement.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know whether
hie did or flot.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Never make a statement
unless you know it is correct.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know of any
evidence to support the statement that
General McNaughton was dismissed. He went
overseas with the first contingent of the
Canadian Army.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Why did he really dame
home? Tell us. You know.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honourable friend
has no right ta put his question with that
implication. I arn trying to conduct this
debate fairly, and I do not think my friend
should attach any implication ta his question.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Don't worry. You had
better stay and listen ta me to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am nat running away,
but 1 arn not so sure that anything my honourable friend may say would justify my remaining over.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: All right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I think I may survive
if I read his speech later.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am sure you will.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If my honourable friend
wants ta put in a wedge of ili feeling that
may continue for some time hie is quite at
liberty ta praceed along the line hie is now
taking. I subrnit that the man who for five
years was good enough ta be the Commander
in Chief of the Canadian Army, who was
looked upan. with admiration by the people
of Canada, and who built up an armny that is
the pride of Canada, should nat he harshly
criticized because for three or four weeks hie
thought hie could do something which later
he frankly admitted he could flot do. What
has happened as a result of his effort bas
made it possible for the Government ta, carry
on without an election.
Let me refer again ta eamething that I
have related bef are in this Chamber. In
company with my hanourable friend the
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. King) I came
ta Ottawa ta appear before the Supreme
Court on behaîf of the province. I was acting as Attorney-General. We went dlown ta
the Victoria Museum, where the buse of
Gommons and the Senate were being accornmodated after the fire which destroyed the
aId Parliament Buildings. We called on Sir
Wilfrid Laurier. The impression I ýcarried
away with me was that his main cancer. was
not the winning of the impending election;
hie did not helieve he could; but rather the
holding togýether of Canada and the making of
a contribution te, the people of Quebec who
had confidence in him, so that after the turmail xvas over unity might continue in this
country. As you know, at that timne Sir
Wilfrid was reviled. In 1942 I read into the
record quatations fram Skelton's book about
the scandalous charges then made against Sir
Wilfrid. To-day I arn confident niy honourable friends opposite will pay their tribute to,
hima for his high ideals and for carrying out
his duty in accordance with those ideals. I
make this prediction, and I make it in the
samne spirit that prompted me ta support Sir
Wilfrid Laurier at that time: that when the
turmoil and the bitterness of the present
occasion is past, when the actions and conduct
of Mackenzie King are seen in proper perspective, hie will be fully àppreciated and
generous tribuýtes will be paid ta him, and
along with Bo>rden and Laurier hie will go
down in the bistory of this country as a
great statesman who served Canada faithfully
and well.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh, no, that is quite a

a number of speeches, wby not sit to-night
as well as to-morrow, in order that we may
eonclude the debate.
Hon. Mr. KING: It has been difficuit for
me to advise the House on the procedure we
should follow. We might continue the debate
to-morrow afternoon and bring it to a conclusion, and at that time we should be better
informed on developments in the other
Chamaber. I gather from the information that
bas come to me that the debate in the
Commons may not be concluded before next
Tuesday. That being so, if we are able to
conclude ýour business to-morrow afternoon
we could ndjourn tintil next Monday and
await developments in the other House.

of spcnking at all, but I think the discussion
this afternoon was of such an interesting
character that the continuity would be better
if the Senate were to meet to-nigbt ns woll as
to-morrow.
Hu. Mr. KING: I arn in the hands of bonourable senators. My bonourable friend from
Winnipeg advised me a short while ago that he
would like to ndjourn the debate and proceed
to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is riglit.
Hon. Mr. KING: It secms to me a reasonable request. If be would adjourn the debate,,
we could adjourn until 3 o'clock to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thanks very mucb. Like
the honourable junior member fromn Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris), I want to get out
of town to-morrow night. I move the adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
SITTINGS 0F THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Before we adjourn, may
I ask the honourable leader opposite whether
he tbinks it necessary for the Senate to continue in session nfter this debate is concluded?
In ahl probability there will be no legisiation.
Hon. Mr. KING: Probably flot.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It seems to me that once
this debate is concluded the Senate might welI,
adjourn.

DECEMBER 1, 1944
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. But while the other
House is in session no one can say definitely
that the Government might not find it necessary to introduce legislation to give effect to
some particular policy. That is one of the
reasons why we were called here in the first
place. There was also the possibility of prorogation, but I think that is out of the'question, since the Prime Minister has given notice
of motion that when the House of Commons
adjourns it will stand adjourned until the 31st
of January.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He has.
Hon. Mr. KING: We had better wait until
to-morrow, when we shall probably be in a
better position to decide our course of action.

He said: I should add, honourable senators,
that this adjournment will be subject to the
resolution passed at the beginning of the

to summon the Senate at any time he may
deem it necessary.

OVERSEAS

REINFORCEMENTS

POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the policy of the Government with respect to overseas reinforcements.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I listened yesterday afternoon with a good
deal of interest to the addresses by the honourable leader of the House (Hon. Mr. King),
and the honourable leader on this side (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne). Maybe some of us inter-

495

rupted the leader of the House once or twice,
but I can assure him now, if he does not
know it, that we did it with the best of good
will. I am sorry that the honourable gentleman fromn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Faris)
is not in his place, for I should like to say
the same thing to him. The interruptions
were not an indication of ill will towards him
or opposition to what he was saying. A virile,
experienced debater like the senator from
Vancouver South does not fear interruptions
very much; in fact, I think lie does not fear
them at all, but rather welcomes them.
I am going to try-I may fail-to address
myself to this subject in a manner that I consider befitting to a member of this House.
No part of our governmental machinery has
a greater responsibility in seeking a solution
of the present problem than has the Senate.
We do not need to get excited about whether
we are going to lose votes in Manitoba or
British Columbia or any other place because
of what we do here. We can also bear in
mind that irst and foremost we all are Canadians. I am not trying to tell other men what
they should do; I am not trying to give you
a lecture; I am j'ust stating my own attitude.
My esteem for my fellow members of this
House is so high, that I believe their attitude
is the same. We may differ, even sharply,
but I think the motive of everyone of us is
to do what in our judgment is best for
Canada. Our judgment may be wrong, but
at any rate that is the motive of every member of this House. That is the feeling I have
acquired with respect to my fellow members
in the short time that I have been here. I
may at times take violent exception te what
some honourable members say. I liked something that I heard Hon. Mr. Cardin-if I may
mention his narne-say in another place last
night. He said, "I wish I could talk as quietly
and as easily as the former Minister of
National Defence did; but I cannot do that."
Now, I am a little like Mr. Cardin, for I cannot do that either. After I have been going
a while I get warmed up. But I will try to
approach this subject in the attitude that I
at least should like to take not only towards
this House but towards my fellow Canadians.
On the 9th of September, 1939, those of us
who were then members of the Senate of
Canada stood up and voted unanimously in
favour of this country taking part on the side
of the Allies in the great struggle against
Germany and the other totalitarian nations.
We did it of our own free will. Speaking for
myself, I was under no misunderstanding as
to what I was doing. As I said once before
in this House, I knew quite clearly that some
six young men of my kin would come under

SENATE
the obligation to go to war. One of them bas
ah'ready paid the supreme sacrifice in A.frica;
four of them at this moment are in France or
flying over Germany, and the ether is on the
sea. I knew wlxat I was deing, as I think
every hon-ourable mnember knew what he was
doing.
We knew also that Canada wo-uld
make a great war effort, net enly la industry,
but in finance, in agriculture, in f orestry and
1n the field of Sur natural rescurces. Some
of us entertainýed the feeling expressed yesterday by the honourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Sir Themas Chapais).
I must
be quite boneat with myself, and te be frank,
I wonder somretimes whether we, a amal

DECEMBER 1, 1944
a candidate for a seat in the House of Gommons I make a promise te, -the electors, the
on]y way I can get a release from it is by
resigning my seat, going back to my. riding
and telling the people, "I withdraw my
promise. Now, will you re-elect me as y.our
representative?" I think the same principle
applies to a promise made by a Government.
If the plebiscite vote showed unanimity ini
every province, then it might be said that
Conservatives, Liberals, and C.C.F. members
of Parliament were released from their
promises. Take the people in Manitoba who
voted "No." These may have been the very
people whose votes elected the varins candidates. Well, -they certainly d.id flot release the
candidates. However, that is past, and gone.
The plebiscite was accepted as a release of the
Government's pledge.
In 1942 we passed an amendment to, the
National Resources Mobilization Act and
thereby empowered the (}overnment to authonize by Order in Council the sending of
drafted men anywhere they might be needed.
Up until June of this year our infantry forces
had flot been extensively engaged in warfare.
True, they were at Dieppe; true, they were at
Hong Kong; true, they were in Sicily and
Italý. But the engagements in those places
were noV large, when one considers the size of
the army. Large scale operations by the infantry commenced with the land.ing in France
on fl-day, and have been gning on there ever
since. Within less than six months cf that
landing the crisis arose.
Now, let me go back and consider wliat
caused that crisis. The first cause of it, of
course, was our declaration of war in 1939,
which we made unanimously. The second
cause was the size of oui military commitments to our allies. I do flot know how
these commitments are made, for I neyer was
in a goverfiment, but in some way or another
we agreed to place so many divisions in Italy
and so, many in France. Now, don't forget
that, as -the fhonourable senator from Grandville (Hon. Sir Thomas Chapais) pointed out
yesterday, nearly one million men have volunteered in this country. But some tw-o
hundred thousand or so have been released
for medical, and ýother reasons, and as we
have been told, the casual-ties have been
higher than were ex3pected. So the only way
to prevent the barrel from being drained to
the bottomn was to apply conscription. If I
understood correctly what Colonel RaIston
said ini another place, General Stuart intimated in June that the pools were short of
reinforeements, but that he was switching men
from other branches into the infantry and
though-t lie could take care vof Vhe needs.
106--33

Hon. A. L. BEAURIEN: In August.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that was stated
in August, but in June it was suggested that
a problem might arise because of the shortage
of men. In August there was a direct cablegram from General Stuart stating that there
was a shortage -of reinforcements for the infantry, and that lie *was transferring men from
other arms of Vhe service. -That was a report
Vo the Minister, who of course could have
repudiated wliat was being doue if he did flot
like it.
Now I come to, a further explanation of
how this crisis arose. AIl over Canada Canadian fathers and mothers whose boys were in
Italy or France were getting letters indicating
that Vheoee were shortages in the ranks and
that some raw men were being put mn-I do
not mean completely raw men, but men not
fuýlly trained. Let us not forget that those
letters were being re-ceived all over Canada.
I myself read one wnitten in France on the
l6th of Septemnber hy my young nephew. He
was not criticizing anybody at ail, but reporting to his dad. Then in September a wounded
soldier, by the name of Connie Smythe, came
back to lis home in Toronto, and stated that
men whose trainýig had not been completed
were being 'used as reinforcements. I do not
know what 'other honourable members did,
but from then on I watched the newspapers
oonstantly to see what reply the Minister of
National Defence would inake Vo that criticism. Soins papers said Connie Sinythe was
looking for polîitical prefeninent. Maybe lie
was; I do flot know. We did know that lie
was a soldier who had faced the enemy's guns
in France and been ,wounded. Before going
overseas lie had linon the man-ager of a great
hockey organization, and had noV been in
politics. I1 was a bit worried about Vhe statement he 'made, as I think everybody else was.
And Colonel Ralston said noV a word in reply
Vo it.
The next thing we 'heard was that Colonel
Raîston lad left tVo, iake a tour of Vhe battle
fronts, and we were more disturbed Vlan ever.
Now, let no one think that we politicians--if
that is what we are-,were Vhe class of people
chiefly disturbed. We were not haîf as disturhed as the people all over Canada whose
boys were in Franoe and Italy. They were
really disVurbed. Then euddenly we heard
that Colonel Raîston was on Vhe way home,
and, next day, that he had arrived. The day
after that Vhe Cabinet crisis began.
The present Prime Minister lias lissa
opposed to the policy of compulsory
iitary
service. That is what lie saysg, and lis record
Vo date bears it out. On the 13th of October,
1 think it was, he got a cable froin Colonel

RaIston and was confronted witli the serious
problemr arising fromn lack of ýoverseas reinforcements. The seriousness of the problem
was conflrmed on the l9th, when he saw
Colonel Raîston personally and was told that
15,000 trained mien were needed overseas at
once, and that the only men available to
meet this nieed we:re N.R.M.A. draftees.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May 1 interrupt
my honourable friend for a minute?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Surely.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Did Colonel
Raiston state that his officers d'enied the
accuracy of the charges mado by Major
Smythe?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It was net the kind of
denial that Colonel Raiston is known to roake,
and it did not stick. H1e docs not depend on
his officers.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
he is an honest man.

Everybody says

Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 amrn ot quostioning
that. The denial did not ring true; it left a
feeling that there was somethinig yet to carne.
it did not convinco me anyway. ,I hoped that
Major Smythe was wreng. but when I got a
letter fromn my nephew 1 was convineed that
the Major's charges wero well founded. That
lad of twenty, a member of a tank crew, told
me what was happening.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Mr. Coldwoll, the
C.C.F leader, on returning to Canada fromn a
visit to the war fronts declared in a press
conference that he had spoken to varins
officers and they hiad made ne complaints te
him.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: H1e teck a Cook's tour of
the front. Colonel Raîston did not take that
kind of tour. After a thorough inspection of
the battlefronts in Italy and France, conferring with commanding officor,, and comnmanders in theo battie-front, he returned home
and submitted to the Cabinet his recommendation for the conscription of N.R.M.A. men
in order te provide overseas reinforcements
to meet an urgent nood. The Prime Minister
refusod te accept the recommendation, and
Colonel Ralston stepped eut. The Prime
Minister brough.t in another man, and that
man said the voluntary system ceuld be made
.' work and woold furnish the reinforcements
n-eeded oversoas. I do net intend te discuas
whether ho addressed the war veterans at
Amrprior and in this city, or whether ho summonod ail the District O.C.'s te a conferene
at heaciquarters te devise ways and means of
spocding up recruiting, for those things are
ne longer important. By the way, I see that
Hon. Mr. HAIRt.

the O.C. of the Manitoba District bas resigned
because he feit that, the voluntary systein
h.aving already been given a therough trial
and having failed, manifestly it would be a
waste of time te resort to it again te secure
recruits.
Parliarnent was called together in ernergency session te consider the situation.
1
think that was the proper course for the
Government te take. I arn net sure that politically it was the 'best thing for the Government te do. When we were called here on
the 22nd of November the Gevernment's
pelicy was that the veiuntary system. should ho
continued te supply the much-needed reserves. When the Liberal members arrived
here 1 helieve there was such an uprising that
the Government saw at once that. prompt
action must be taken or it would net survive
the impending criais.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN:
jecting te that, are you?

Yen are net eh-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn net objecting te it.
I arn trying te set down in chronological
order what led up te the Government's suddon change of frent. Whatev or precisely happened in caucus we d'o net know, but next
day an Ordor in Council was laid on the table
of the Commons and aise on the table of this
House authorizing compulsory military service. It may ho argued that on the 9th of
September, 1939, we started on the road tewarcls compulsory service, that when wo
passed the National Resources Mohilization
Act in 1940 we thereby approved of compulsory rniiita-ry service, and that this was aise
the effeet of what we did in ý1942 when wo
passed Bill 80. But I have bad mon say te
me, "Tho Liberal party has net given the
country compulsory military service."
No
man can say that te me new. The Order in
Ceuncil passed on the 23rd of November
authorizing compulsory military service was
passod by the Liberal Government.

Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Are yeu scolding
the Goveroment for that?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; but 1 arn scolding the
Government for this roasen: for twenty-three
yoars, wvith one short exception. the Liherai
party bas hoeld office because of -%vlat happened

DECEMBER 1, 1944
in 1917. That is what I object to. The Nazi
party in Germany has proved beyond the
shadow of doubt that by skilful and subtle
propaganda you can educate people to do
almost anything you desire. For twenty-seven
years we have had a system of education in
parts of Canada, my own province included,
to the effect that only one of our political
parties would be responsible for compulsory
military service. Now we know that, given
the necessary conditions, every political party
will be for it. No matter how much this may
be denied, I repeat, every party will be for it.
Let me say a word or two more about
what I think may be done. I was a little
surprised yesterday at the honourable senator
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris) indulging
in such high praise of the Prime Minister. I
did not know that this was an issue at all.
I thought the issue was: Are we going to
get reinforcements for our infantry in France
and in Italy? If I were a candidate in the
next Dominion election, and I wanted to
attack the present Prime Minister, what would
I do? Would I talk about him? No, I woukf
just send to every one of my electors a copy
of Colonel Ralston's speech and stand or fall
by that. That is my answer to the honourable senator from South Vancouver. I ask
nothing more than that the people of Canada read what Colonel Ralston said about the
Prime Minister in one of the most memorable
speeches ever delivered in the House of
Commons.
I believe that we as Canadians now recognize the fact that when. we go to war we
must be ready to make an all-out war effort.
Further, if we make commitments beyond
what a voluntary system will meet, we then
have to impose compulsory military service.
Our people, if they accept the first proposition, must accept the second.
I hope that after this war is over we shall
never again hear the statements I have heard
for the past twenty-five years in my province.
I hope there will be no more thought that only
the Conservative party send our men to war;
that no other parties do. The day that
such talk ceases I believe we shall be a more
united Canada than we have ever been since
Confederation. I have no doubt that men like
my honourable friend opposite are just as keen
as I am, perhaps keener, to make Canada a
great united nation. - But you cannot accomplish that if over the years one political party
continues to fan the embers of resentment
against compulsory service. The Government
never would have had to apply conscription if
the war had ended six months ago, or even
three months ago. Then its supporters could
have gone up and down the country and said:
106-331

499

"We ran a five-year war without conscription.
The Conservatives ran a four-year war and
resorted to conscription."
Hon. Mr. BENCH: What bearing would
that have had on the present war?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I will come to that, don't
worry. I say that you sit in this House, as
do other men, because of the dividends that
campaign gave to the Liberal party. The
only reason why I, and several others of us,
sit in this House-I am quite candid about itis that somebody allowed 50,000,000 pounds of
butter from New Zealand to land in Vancouver two weeks before the election of 1930.
Otherwise I would never in the world be
sitting here.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That is quite an
admission.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is the truth.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: You slipped in on
butter.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I slipped in on butter, but
I was not the only one; there are several
others sitting on this side of the House.
Hon. Mr. KING: It was a little more than
that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Maybe, but that was the
main cause.
Hon. Mr. KING: The ending of unemployment next day-that was the promise.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Let me give my honourable friend some facts that may surprise him.
In 1925 the Conservative party carried 112
seats in eight provinces; in 1930 they carried
only 113, but they were returned to power
in 1930 by the votes of one province. Make
no mistake about that. If the twenty-five
candidates in that province had received the
same support in 1925 that they received in
1930, Arthur Meighen would have been Prime
Minister of this country. After the war is
over we can all close our ranks and stand up
in Ontario, Quebec, the Maritimes, the
Western Provinces and British Columbia and
appeal to the Canadian spirit, without bringing
in the extraneous issues that have beclouded
the political life of this country for the past
twenty-five years. I plead for that better
understanding.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, when yesterday afternoon I
suggested that the debate might suitably be
continued to the evening, I said that I had
no intention of taking part in it. Owing,
however, to the unavoidable absence of two
or three members on this side I have since
undertaken to contribute some scattered impressions and thoughts.

500

SENATE

At the outset I must say that the reports I
have read in the press are, in my opinion,
remarkable for their omission of any reference
whatever to one of the ablest speeches that
I have ever heard delivered in this Senate,
namely, that contributed yesterday afternoon
by the honourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. Farris). This inattention to our
deliberations prompts me to remark that our
discussion has at least the merit of selfdelectation, and I shall proceed with that in
mind.
The honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) should be congratulated on
the spirit of conciliation which pervaded his
speech. I am afraid, however, that at tines
he rather left an impression of insincerity, but
I am not attributing to him any ulterior
motive.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
should
gentleman
"m'.sincerity."

I think the honourable
word
the
withdraw

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: If the word "insincerity" is unparliamentary, I am quite willing
to withdraw it. The honourable senator from
Winnipeg reminded me of a young medical
student watching with almost morbid curiosity
the details of a rather complicated operation
being performed by a skilled surgeon. But I
would suggest to the honourable gentleman
that it is not a post-morten examination
that he has been watching. On the contrary,
the operation that has taken place in the last
three weeks has been a very successful one,
and in my opinion it has left the patient in
a nuch better condition of luealth than that
patient has enjoyed for many a year. I am
among those who believe that the so-called
crisis which we have had in Canada during the
past threc or four weeks is one of the moest encouraging signs of denocracy this country bas
seen since Confederation. It seems to me that
if our people have been suffering from one
thing more than another since war broke out,
it has been the tendency to fall into a rut or a
routine of life under war-time regimentation.
As a result of the conomic and financial
prosperity that the war bas brought tc Canada,
i certain callousness has developed rather than
a live awareness of all that has been involved
in the war. So I for one pay my measure of
tribute to those who have been successful in
arousing public opinion to the pitch that has
brought about this meeting of Parliament and
the developments that have occurred in the
other House.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: In the special session
of 1939 I had the privilege of moving the resolution of acceptance of the Speech fron the
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

Throne which marked the entry of Canada
into the war. I said then that Canada would
prosecute her part in this war to the utmost
of her ability. It is absolutely with that
point of view in mind that I would speak now.
We have no time to be threshing old straw.
There is nothing to be gained now from discussing the respective merits of voluntary
service and conscription, nor, in my opinion,
is there anything to be gained by defending
or criticizing or extolling the record of any
member of the Government or of the Government as a whole.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The fact is that the
present Government is required by the people
of Canada to finish the job it has undertaken
to do in connection with this war. I think
it has been made abundantly clear in the last
few days that just now there is no one, other
than the present Prime Minister, to hcad this
Government; and if there were, the country
would net at this moment spare the valuable
time required to do all that would be involved
in making a change in leadership.
As a matter of fact, I am inclined te make
the prediction that if current authoritative
opinion regarding the probable duration of the
war in Europe is correct, the life of this Parliament is more likely to ba prolonged than to
be curtailed by dissolution in the near future.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: My honourable
friend is making a very important statement
there. I suppose he must have some authority.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I am expressing my
own personal vicw, which I will support with
a further statement. I think that beyond
doubt one of the effects of the present crisis
in our affairs has been the elimination from
the public mind of any thought of an election
until the war is over. Despite all that the
Prime Minister may have said to the contrary,
I trust that, if necessary, he will net hesitate
te prolong the life of Parliament for the
duration of the war.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
promise?

Even in spite of his

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I say in spite of all
that he said to the contrary, I hope that, if
necessary, he will net hesitate to prolong the
life of this Parliament. And I do net think
he as thus far said anything to preclude that
possibility.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Oh, yes, he has.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He said he would not
extend it.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I am stating my
opinion. I am speaking for no one but myself.

DECEMBER 1, 1944
Hon. Mr. BLACK: A good deal of wishful
thinking.
Hon. Mr. LAMBE'RT: It seems to me
that at the moment there is only one issue,
and it can be expressed in both military and
the most human of termis, ancl that is the
sending of reinforcements to our men overseas
as quickly as possible, in time to be of service
to our men on the battie line, and in time to
save Canadians at home from the inexpressible
shame of having failed to support their men
overseas in the hour of need-a failure which,
I submit, would seriously dim the lustre of
this eountry's war effort to date, and very
materially lower its national status in the eyes
of the Allied world.
On the question of national unit.y. which
has been referred to so often and is so close
to our minds at, this time, I made my position
perfectly clear diuring the debate in -this
Chamber on the amendment to the 'National
Resources Mobilization Act. It is sufficient
now to say that anyone who wouki endeavo-ur
to introduce into this issue any suggestions of
racial or interprovincial bitterness would certainly be contributing nothing at ail to its
solution. 1 believe sincerely, however, that
the cause of nationhood in Canada is vitally
involved in the question that is before us; and
if we fail to do our duty in sustaining the
men of different racial origins who compose
our overseas army, and who have given. us sucli
an inspiring example of Canadian unity abroad,
we shaîl have sown deep the seeds of discord
J or another generation in this country to
uproot.
As the representative of Ottawa in this
Chamber, and one who is intimately
acquainted with one of its valiant units overseas-the Cameron Highlanders of Ottawamay I take the liberty of illustrating at least
one example of national unity. That battalion
is made, Up of men of English-speaking and
French-speaking backgrounds drawn from this
community and the adjacent districts, and has
given distinguished service on the western
front in Europe since D-day. A young
English-speaking lieutenant of the Camerons
in writing to me the other day proudly
described the men in his platoon, all of whom
were recruited from the so-called "lower town"
district of Ottawa, as "the toughest fighting
group in the battalion," and hie went on to,
say that that was true of thema ever since the
fighting began. I mention that simply by way
of emphasizing to honourable senators that
there is no problemn or question of national
unity for those Canadians engaged in the
Battle of Germany; and in my opinion it is
our supreme duty to support them with ail our
st.rength.

.501

One thing more before I take my seat.
Regardless of the extenit of Canada's war effort
to dàte, with ail its expend.iture of man-power
a.nd wealth, and its huge accumulation of
debt and taxes for years te comne, the job has
nlot been completcd yet; and juýst as a chain
is no stronger than its weakest link, s0 our
part in this war will be no greater than the
complote achievement of our national undertaking waged to the utmost of our ability.,
In the classic words of Drake's historic
prayer, we m.ay well say:
When Thou givest to Thy servants to endeavour any great matter, grant us aiso to know
that it i s not the beginning, but the continuing
of the sanie until it be thoroughly fi,,ished,
which yieldeth the ýtrue glory.
Honourable
Hon. R. B. HORNER:
senators, as the leaders on both sides have
stated, we ahl are free to, express our own
views on the question that we are now considering. Well, I think all honourable senators know what my stand is. Back in 1916,
I think, or early in 1917, 1 was running for a
seat, in the Saskatchewan Legislature. At
that time the whole cou.ntry was discus.sing
whether conscription would become neeessary,
and 9,t one of the meetings that I addressed
I was asked what I thought about it. I said
that the provincial Legisiature could have
nothing at aIl ta do with that question.
However, the audience wanted to know what
I thought about it myseif, so I replied: "To be
perfectly frank with yo.u, I believe there is
only one proper method of raising an army,
and t.hat is by selective secrvice." I have neyer
at any time changed that opinion, notwithstanding the statement made by Mr. Meighen
after the list war as te what he thought the
position of the Concservative party should be.
I neyer subscribed to the view that hie
expi-essed, and I do not know that any large
body of people subseribed ta it. To the proposal that hie madle I have the very same
objections that I have to the voluntary systema
of enlistment.
It bas been suggested by some supporters
of the Government that there m.ust be some
influence at work preventing N.R.M.A. soldliers from volunteering for overseas service;
and some people seem te wonder why there
has not been a greater response to -the appeal
mnade by the Prime Minister. Personally, I
thînk that if lie had ever raised a famiily he
wouid not have made such an appeai. I amn
not alone in holding that view. As I corne
from the Prime- Minister's owu constituency,
I consider it necessary ta take a-keen interest
in any special statements that lie may make,
and I listened carefu.lly to bis broadcaist appeal
for volunteers to reinforce our overseas army.
Next morning I called on the president of

SENATE
ofle of the Libenal organizationa, a man who

ail tbrougli the
and worker for
"Wbat do you
Prime Minister
"It would have

ycars has been an organizer
that party, and asked him:
think of the speech that the
made last night?" He said,
been m-uch botter had he not
spokon at ail, much better." That was my
opinion t4o.
I want to say sometbing about the way
university students have heon troated. The
examinations are severe, and if a boy fails to,
make a certain mark bis name is given to,
the military authorities and he is pounced
upon by them. H1e is away from home, and
an appoal is made to him to act as a man.
Well, some honourable senators know that a

boy of nineteen is flot a man.

The Prime

Minister and bis Cabinet of mature mon, who

have been olectcd, in a domocratic way, tako
full autbority to tax us to tbe limit, hut on
this most important question of military service they appeal Vo the boy of immature years
to do his duty as a man, and place hlma in a
very trying position. 1 have a boy who bas
beon in the Navy for eight months and is stili
only nineteen. I may say that he passed at
the univorsity, so no ono pleaded with hima to
join up. H1e stayed with me for a wbile in
my hotel ronm, wbere I got a cot for 'him,
and he tossed araund and talked in his sleop
just as he bad donc whon ho was a cbild. I
was reminded -of somotbing the late Senator
Taylor told me about. At the timo of tbe
last war be was a member of the other House,
and ho challengcd bis fellow mombors to go
witb bima to tbc Lansdowne Park camp after
midnight. He said: "The boys are brave in
day-time, but at night you can bear thema
talking in their slecp and calling their mothers.
Men of mature years are calling theso boys
men, wbich it is a physical impossibility for
tbema to be at their age."
I say that once war is declared, thc only
proper way to get men is by na;tional seloctive
service.
Then tbese boys do noV bave 10o
make up their own minds as to wbat tbey
aught to do; the question is decidod for them,

Canada into war-Vof e for the Liberal candidate and there will be no war. Tboy came to
me, and I bad to do wbat I bave dono ail
tbrough the yoars of tbe war-defend the
action of tbe Prime Minister in making thiat
statement to these new ('anadians.

1 challenge anyone Vo consider the position
of Canada in its enormous war effort, witb
the hurdens placed on the people by a party

Government, and then tell me wbether anything like tbat is happening in any other free
country. I would also challenge anyone to
show me any free country wbere the goverfiment bas roceived the full support that this
Government bas received from the officiai
opposition.
Now apparently we are to ho
singled out as tbe party responsible for compulsory military service. Tbe people are to ho
told, "It was tbe wickod Conservatives that
forced us to take tbis action." That is the
only conclusion I an come to after obsorving
what bas taken place in the Parliament of
Canada during the last few days. The leader
on the other side intimated that it wvas well

known to honourable members of this Huse
and to the people generally that for some time
there had beon a studied attempt to frustrato
the Government's effort to get overseas-servico
volunteers from men called up under tho
N.R.M.A. What did the honourable gentlemon mean by that? The frustration must
have heem
broughit about by the indignities
that were hoapcd on these mon.
And by
whose order? Evidently ho %vas referring to
thie offleers.
But
the gov ernment had
control of the offleers who wcre said to bo
doing the undermining of the voluntary effort
to secure recruits, so who did the undermining? Certainly not we. WVo lent overy
support we possibly could. I did wbnt I
could in every way, shape and form, but I
was alarmed and concerned about tbe kind
of reception these boys would got, and wbat
their feelings towards Canada ivould ho after
tho treatment they had received.
A year or so ago tbe leader on the other
side told us about the exî>unditure of five or
six bundred million dollars on the Home
Defence Army, and explained that the heavy
expenditure was caused by the fact that 50
many mon enlisted overy day from the
N.R.M.A.
That is truc.
But I know an
instance of a young fellow who enlisted and
hiad bis papers aIl ready and ivas sent down
to Regina.
The officers thero nover even
looked at the papers but just threw themn on
the desk and sent hini on to the medical
examiner.
This man said, 'Wby, a strong
boy like N'ou oughit to have enlisted." The
boy replied, "I did enlist."
The examiner
said, 'ell, these papers don't show that you
v-oluintcered." The boy repoated, 'But 1 did
cnliýt ." Thiev ilîc

office, where they were told, "Oh, neyer mind,
it is ail right. He is taken as a draftee, flot
as a volunteer." I suspect there are a number
of such cases. It is wholly the Government's
fault that there is any disunity, and if I were
a member of the Government I would hasten
to make some amends, for I certainly would
ike to see those whom we expect to fight for
the country treated at ail times with dignity.
Bon. Mr. KING: Hear, hear.
Bon. Mr. HORNER: The leader on the
other side complained of the press and
quoted at great length speeches made in the
other Bouse, so I presume that I arn free
to refer to what was said there. I would
direct the attention of bonourable senators
to this sentence in the Prime Minister's
speech lest Monday:
I believe some of the officers have flot tried
to get voluntary enlistments.
Then hie puts the question:
Bow was the public appeal supported?
He is speaking of the special appeel for
volunteers for overseas service when the
reinforcement situation became critical. Be
should have known that it would be impossible to secure satisfactory resuits. Bere are
the Prime Minister's words:
How was -the public appeal supported? The
moment that we started on the public appeal,
that moment the opposition to anything of the
kind on the part of the interests that lie behind
this organized effort to force conscription began
to make itself f elt in every direction-in the
press, by meetings, resolutions by veterans'
orgenizations, representations to -members and
so forth, with the result that instead of the
appeal reaching the ears of the people' the ears
of the people were dinned by the efforts that
were being put forth by those who were determined they were going to have conscription no
matter what the cost might be.
There we see preparation bcing made again
to accuse the Conservative party of forcing
compulsory military service on our people.
The appeal may not succeed in some sections
of the country, but undoubtedly those who
are making it hope it wiIl bring results in
Western Canada. I want to say to honourable senators that there was no organized
effort, as charged by the Prime Minister.
The Legion did organize its membership, but
who in Canada have a better right to reproach
the Government than the men who in the
lest war fought for their country? In another
part of the Prime Minister's speech I fnd
the following:
As I have said, I believe with aIl imy heart
that a public appeal would have succeeded if
we had received the support of honourable
leaders opposite, if ive had received the support
of their following, if we had received the support of their press. Does anyone douht that
for one moment? I say we would have had
the neeessary men through voluntary enlistment

but for the organized opposition that was taken
to voluntary enhsýtment.
Bon. Mr. ASELTINE: Who said that?
Bon. Mr. BORNER: The Prime Minister.
Bear in mind, this is a party governiment.
In the country to the south the President
invited two of the Ieeding men of the opposition party into bis cabinet to take important
war posts. As I set in the gallery of the
other Bouse and listened to the Prime Minister, I could not help feeling that hie was
going to meke a slip and use the words
"Liberal party" when hie was declaring hie
passionate interest in the country. I was
afraid thet would happen.
Bon. Mr. KING: Be does not make many
mistakes.
Bon. Mr. BORNER: Any time last spring
the Prime Minister could have told the peopie wbat his party would and would not do.
But hie led us to expect what bas turned out
to be an impossibility, s0 any difficulty hie
finds himself in now is of bis own making.
"Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall be also
reap." The Prime Minister sowed wbat hie
is now reaping.
I hope the Government will not continue to
accept for active service youtbs of eighteen or
nineteen years of age wbo are willing to
enlist, and allow men of twenty-two and
twenty-three years of age to remain bere as
draf tees. Frorn the very start tbe war effort
of this country bas been directed by a party
government. I do not believe any honourable
member cen tell me of a similar case among.
the free democratie countries with wbom we
are ellied in the war against Germany and
Japan.
Bon. F. B. BLACK: Bonourable senators, I
was mucb surprised to hear a statement that
came from the lips of the honourable senator
fromn Ottawa (Bon. Mr. Lambert). 1 do not
know whether bie was "flying a kite."
Bon. Mr. GRIESBACB:

*Ask him.

Bon. Mr. BLACK: I do not tbink hie would
tell us. I say ta him that if it bad not been
for the desire of the various parties opposing

the Government to see that urgently needed
reinforcements were sent to the front i'mmediete]y there would bave been an election at
this time. It is only because of that feeling
in Parliament and out that thîs Government is.
allowed to continue. I think honourable
members should keep that very clearly in
mind. If the honourable member from Ottawa
is under the impression that tbe country will
stand for the prolongation of Parliament
beyond the statutory period, I amn confident,

504

SENATE

if I understand the temper of our people,
that events will prove him wrong.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I ask, the honourable gentleman this question? Would he
favour having the country delay its war effort
while a new government was being organized
and an appeal made to the country? If so,
and if the war is yet in progress-for after
all the last laip of the race is most important
-would he still favour an election campaign
with all its disturbing effects?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: The honourable gentleman is making another speech.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: No, I am merely
asking a question.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: If this Government is
as able as the honourable gentleman thinks it
is-and there are some able ministers-it must
know that the term of this Parliament lapses
on the 17th of April next; and knowing that,
I submit the Government ought to make the
necessary preparations for an appeal to the
countrv.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Would you favour
an appeal in spite of any other condition?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: There is no precedent in
Canadian history for a government prolonging
its own life,Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: 1916.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: -and
there is no
demand from the people of Canada for a
prolongation of the life of this Parliament.
Therefore, unless very extraordinary conditions arise, such as a situation fraught with
the greatest danger to the nation, there should
be no prolongation of this Parliament.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: May I be permitted
to say this, because the question may not be
mentioned again? I am quite sure the member from Ottawa knows that the Prime Minister, not once or twice but severa. times within
recent weeks, has stated that in so far as he
is concerned he is not in favour of the prolongation of the life of this Parliament.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: But is it not true
that he also said with equal emphasis that
he was net in favour of an election while the
war was in progress?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That makes no difference. The honourable gentleman has asked
the question, whether or not the honourable
member from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black)
would be in favour of an election. The Prime
Minister has repeatedly made the statement
-ho made it only the other day in the House
of Commons-that he would not at any time
be in favour of prolonging the life of ParliaHon. Mr. BLACK.

ment; that a general election should be held
in due course when the time arrives. That is
quite clear. Pardon my interruption.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I am glad the honourable senator from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
has called our attention to that point.
Let me direct my remarks to the events
which led up to this session and to what has
bappened since.
We were called here in
emcrgency session at this critical time for
what we all supposed was one purpose onlyto get Parliament to approve of a certain
policy, because of the dismissal or resignatien. wbiebever it may have been, of Colonel
Ralston and the appointment of another
Minister of National Defence; and alse to
get the opinion of Parliament as to whether
we would call into the active forces N.R.M.A.
men who are now in training in the so-called
Home Defence Army. I believe that when
the Prime Minister met the House of Commons last Wednesday that was the only thing
in his mind. I listened very carefully to his
speech, and I am convinced that at that time
he had no idea but to continue the voluntary
system. He brought in General McNaughton
as Minister of National Defence because the
Generl had told him and the public that he
folt confident he could get enough reinforcements for our troops overseas by voluntary
enlistment.
What happened?
The master
magician, came before Parliament. What did
he say then? He admitted frankly that he
was unable to pull recruits out of his bat,
that he was unable to throw fire from his
finger-tips to annihilate the enemy; in a word,
he had to recommend sending to the battlefronts as reinforcements the only trained men
we now have in Canada, the N.R.M.A.
draftees. That at once put a different face
on the whole matter. The Prime Minister's
address and General McNaughton's further
explanation on the second day of the emergency session clarified the situation and
showed that the Government was prepared
to cet immediately. I take that to be what
the Prime Minister meant when he said that
he would sec that at least 16,000 trained troops
were dispatched at once as overseas reinforcements. Undoubtedly everyone in Canada was
greatly pleased to have that assurance. Truc,
it came rather late. The Government should
have taken this action just as soon as Colonel
Ralston made his report on his return from
overseas.
Almost everyone who has been in touch
with the fighting men overseas has known
that for some time that there has been a
critical shortage of infantry. I have many

equal numbers of I.iberals and Conservatives.
It included such pronmnnt Liberals as Mr.
Fielding, Mr. Sifton, and two, honourable
gentlemen here, who tvere flot senators at that
time-Mr. Ballantyne and Mr. Calder.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Mr. Guthrie.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
Mr. Fielding was
not, in the Governrnent.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: In that Cabinet there
were exactly as many Liberals as Conservatives, and the Liberals were arnong the strongest mýembers of their party in the House of
Commons. Why arn I st.ressing this? I arn
flot aecusing anyone, for I think those men
did just what they ought to have done. There
was no0 other course they could take, since the
Goverament had been advised that the voluntary enlistinent. systern had fai]ed to produce
recruits in sufficient numbers to replace the
casualties in France. So a committee of Parliarnent composed, as 1 have said, of an equal
number of prominent Liberals and Conservatives, formed the Union Governrnent, and conscription mwas put into force.
It, is clear, therefore, that a Conservative
govcrnmnent was not responsible for introducing conscription. It is just as clear that a
Liberal govcrnment was not responsible for
introducing it. I repeat that the two part.ies
combined to enforce conscription in 1917. That
was ail right, but what happened afterwards?
Throughiout certain parts of Canada the Conservative party ivas held up as the one that
alone had been responsible for conscription.
Nothing could have been farther frorn the
fact than the accusation which was so wid'ely
circulated.
I wanted to stress that fact, honourable
senators, because once again it bias been found
necessary to, enforce conscription. The Goverament of to-day finds itself in exactly the
same position as that wbich tle Government
of 1917 occupied. But whereas in 1917 a coalition governrnent was forrned for puttîng conscription into effeet, in 1944 it is being done by
a governmnent composed exc]usively of rnembers of the Liberal party. I do flot blarne
that government-I do not think it could do
anything else-but I want to have the fact
placed c]early and distinctly on the record. The
people of Canada, and cspecially the people
of the province of Quebec, should be made
aware of that fact.
May I he alloxwed to digress for a moment
and refer to French-speaking soidiers of Canada, as I know them?
Hon. Mr. CALDER:
Would t.he honourable gentleman permit mie to interrupt him,

tin order to have the record correct? The
conscription law itsclf was flot passed after the
Union Government was formed.
The law
itself was passcd in the latter part of the
session immediately preceding the formation
of that government. when the Conservative
party was in powver. The enforcement of the
law was carried out, by the 'Union Gov-crnment, as the honourable gentleman said. The
war-time election w~as lield for the purpose of
ascertaining whether the people of Canada felt
conscription sbould be enforced by a national
government instead of a party government.
Hon. Mr. BLACIÇ: That is right.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It is just as well to,
keep the record straight.
Honý. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Quite so, but
ive do not wan't to get confused. A Conservative government introduced the Military
Service Act, but that Act became law only in
January. 1918, under the Union Government,
and it wvas put into effect hy that goveýriiment.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That i.s right.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The Act was
not passed by the Conservative Governmont in
1917; it was passed by the Union Governmcent,
in January, 1918.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I submit that everyt.hing
I have said with regard to conscription in the
last war is aceurate.
Hoýn. Mr. CALDER: The honourable leader
on tbis side (Hon. Mr. Ballanïtyne) is right.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: Sir Robert Borden
asked for a year's extension of t.he life of
Parliament.
Ho.n. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Yes.

Hon. Mrs. WILSON:
The honourable
gentleman from Westmor]and
(Hon. Mr.
Black) said there would be no precedent for
such a request at this timp.
Honý. Mr. BLACK: I apologize to the
honourable senator. It slipped my memory
that an .extension had been gra.nted far a year.
Nevertheless, I arn opposed to an extension
at the present time.
I arn sorry that thero are not more honourable senators from Quebec in the Huse at
the moment, for I wish to pay a compliment
to our Frenchspeaking fellow-citizens. In the
last war I had serving under me a number of
young Frenchmen-I sbould say, net Frenchmen, but French-speaking Canadians, for of
course tîtere are no real Frenchmen in Canada.
Thiose to, w'hom we sometimes refer in that
way are descendants of people wbo have lived
in this country for three hundred years, and

DECEMBER 1, 1944
if that does Dlot make thern Canadians, 1 do
flot know what would. My people have been
here for two hundred yea.rs, and while 1 arn
of Scotch descent I should flot think of calling
myseif a Scotchman, except ini a joking way.
I arn a Canadian, and so is every Frenchspealcing citizen of Canada. I know the
Acadian French very well, having lived with
and among them ail my life. I have visited
at their homes, I have been present at the
weddings of their daughters and their sons, as
weIl as at the burjal services of their old men
and old women. In short, I arn proud, to say
that I have just as rnany friends arnong the
French-speaking people in Westrnorland. as
any Engiish-speaking man in the county.
1 also want to say that the French-speaking
boys in. Sackville and vicinity-I know each
and every one of themn there-enlisted just as
frieey and as promptiy as did the Englishspeaking boys. Many of my French-speaking
einployees have enlisted, and those who are
stili living are fighting just as bravely and
vigorously as any other men at the front.
I would add this, that if the people of the
French tongue in the Maritime provinces had
been left alone and flot misled by propaganda,
there would have been no division there between those Canadians who speak French and
those who speak English. I arn very strongly
of the opinion that if there had been less propaganda in the province of Quebec, and more
education to instil into the people a broad
Canadianism, in place of narrow parochialism,
there would not be the acute condition that
prevails to-day.
Let me say in ail sincerity that, the two
great parties having openly and freely corne
together on this question of conscription or
selective service, or whatever one may term
it-the calling up of men frorn ail sections
of the Dominion on an equality, and only on
an equality-we should now try to get our
French-speaking compatriots to regard themselves flot only as citizens of Quebec but also
as citizens of Canada. If Quebec continues to
feel that it is a place apart from. the other
provinces, we shall not get together in a long
long tirne, and while that sentiment prevails
Canada will be a disunited nation.
Unfortunately there is between Quebec and
Ontario a feeling of rivalry tinged wîth
antagonism. There is no such feeling between
the Martirne Provinces and Quebec. In the
Maritime Provinces we neyer hear of any
differentiation between those who speak
French and those who speak English. Why
shouId there not be the samne friendly feeling
between Ontario and Quebec? As a matter of
fact, each of these two provinces, if you personify them, is carrying a chip on its shoulder,

501d

and saying, "Now knock it off if you dare.'
That antagonistic spirit produces trouble. Let
us get together and forrn a united Canada
rather than continue a disgruntled and disunited nation on this haif of the North
American continent.
As I have said on two previous occasions
in this buse, I comrnend everything the
Governrnent has done in furtherance of our
war effort. The last tirne I addressed honourable members I said my complaint was that
the Governmcnt was slow in getting into action
and that its tardiness had cost frorn six
months to a year. But when the Governrnent
realized that the people were heart and soul
in the war, it did what it could to maintain
the impetus which the people had imparted to
the war effort. This has resulted in a magnificent contribution not only by our fighting
forces-the, finest in the world-but by our
mechanies, our lumbermen, our farmers, our
business mnen and our financiers. They have
aIl worked with a wilI.
In some quarters we are told that there
should he conscription of wealth before conscription of rnanpower. I would say to-this
House and to the country, that we have conscription of manpower. and there is not mauch
of a reserve left. And wealth is already
conscripted.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BLAiCK: I arn stating a fact. I
arn not blaming the Governrnent for war-tirne
taxation, I arn quite willing to contribute
xny share, but to-day the Government by way
of taxation conscripts from 50 to 75 per cent
of every man's incorne. But this is not the
only levy. When a man dies the Governrnent
constitutes itself his heir, and after payment
of federal and provincial succession duties very
little of a man~s estate rernains for the benefit
of his farnily. Notwithstanding what the
C.C.F. party may say, wealth is now pretty
comnpletely conscripted, in this country, and if
we go any further along that line, there will
be. littie encouragement either for business
initiative or enterprise. That is sornething ta
be guarded against. We have to keep private
business going. We have to encourage initiative in our citizens, because if the Government were to operate every industry, every
farrn, every mine, the people of Canada might
sink to the level of what that opprobriaus terni
"Zombie" talle to mmnd. We do flot want to
get into that undesirable condition. We must
encourage industry and enterprise, for if we
do not, when aur young men corne home
there wiIl be nothing for themn to look forward
to. I join with those members who have preceded me in the earnest hope that when the

SENATE
noise of battie ceases and our young men and
wornen return to civil life there will be available for ecd and ail a good job and a good
borne.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I intervene before the debate is adjourned? Referring to what bappened during the debate th 's
afternoon, 1 arn happy to say that ail of us
xvere right 'but for a little variation. The
Barden goverrnent introduced the Military
Service Act, and. it was passed by Parliarnent,
but it was not put into effeet until the Union
Governrnent carne into power in January, 1918.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes. The legisiation was

-inMr.
BLACK-

Whien I carne to Ottawa on the 22nd of
November it was in the expectation that we
would hear frern the Governrnent an explanatien of the circumstances relating to the reinforcement of our overseas armny, this to be
foilowcd by a declaration of the policy whicb
had been adopted.
I thought there would
be an objective approach to the problern, involvinig the shortest possible discussion, that
the policy would bce ither approved or rejected, with the sole puripose in view of meeting any emergency whicb rnight be sbown te
exist.
Notwithstanding rny reluctance, along with
that of many other honourabie senators, to see
a policy of cornpulsory service for overseas
introduced at this late stage in the war, I
do nlot liesitate to, say that I carne here, witb
a certain preconception of the course of action
which 1 wouid foilow shouid the matter corne
before the Senate in any forrnal way. If it
were domonstrated that our fighting forces
overseas were Iacking reinforcemonts, or there
wvas indicated even the slightcst doubt of the
sufflciency of the voiuntary systenm, I wouid
have ýboon bouind in conscience ta vote for
the ompioymcnt of N.R.M.A. personnel.
Now, xvhat actually bias transpircd since we
reconv,ýened? First of aIl, the Government bas

poiicy and the subsequent statement. True
there lias been de:bate along these linos, but
the fondamental issue bas been bcclouded,
even larg-eiy side-tracked, hy attacks upon the

DECEMBER 4, 1944
"having turned a double somersault." Elsewhere lie lias been cliarged with being "weak
and vacillating," and according to the news
report read to us the other day by the hionourable senator fromn Manitoba wlio sits to my
riglit (Hon. A. L. Beaubien) the Prime Minister bas been charged witli laving had "a
capacity for evasion and a cowardly war
policy."
These descriptions of a great statesman are
mn striking contrast to the opinion expressed
by the Right Honourable Mr. Churchill, wliom,
if I rnay be pardoned for saying so, I sliould
like to describe as the world's outstanding
Conservative. Let me read, if I may, some
of the expressions of regard for the Prime
Minîster of Canada which have been uttered
by Mr. Churchill. In 1943, in speaking of the
Prime Minister of Canada, lie said of himsaid to him, as a matter of fact:
In tlie darkest days Canada under your
leadership remained confident and true. Now
the days are brighter, and when victory is won
you will be able to look back with just pride
upon a record surpassed by none.
This year Mr. Churchill referred to Mr.
Mackenzie King as the one man who could
have lirouglit Canada througli the war as a
united nation. Addressing hîm again, lie said:
Neyer, perliaps, lias the world held Canada in
Liglier esteem than in these five years of bitter
confliet, during whicli under your inspiring
guidance as Prime Minister, slie has played so
splendid a part in the now imminent overthrow
of the powers of evil.
I amn not complaining of the political character of the speeches that have been made in
this and other places. Indeed, as the issue lias
been developed in the country, it is difficuit
to see how the question could be discussed at
ail witliout reference to party policies anil
platforms. What I arn concerned about is the
inclination in some quarters to relate the
criticism not to the policy itacif but to a man,
or perliaps I should say to men wlio are but
two members of tlie Government whicli is
responsible for the policy, and to tlie Liberal
party to whicli tliey belong.
This Order in Council is not the brainchild of any one man nor of any two men. It
is the product of the Governor of Canada in
his Council, a policy representing the opinion of
experienced men upon a question regarding
whicli we know tliey lield, at the outset at
least, widely divergent views.
The other day ini this Cliamber the lionourable and *much respected leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) mentioned the bitterness that lias developed over this question. In
that regard I think no one will attempt to
deny wliat lie said. I recaîl ini only a vague
sort of way the comparable situation in the
last war, but I do nlot doubit t-hat recent pubi-

lic feeling lias reached an ail-time high. 1 arn
not exaggerating wlien I describe it as almost
hysterical. One was obliged to liold very
firmly to the anchor of reason to avoid being
cauglit up and carried along in the torrent
of passion which seemed to threaten our
people.
I think that I cannot better
describe that situation tlian by quoting froan
an article which appeared only a few days
ago, written liy a gentleman, a veteran of the
last war wlio received very serious wounds in
that war, and who lias only recently returned
fromn a five months visit to our troops overseas. His name is Leslie Roberts. I do not
know the gentleman, and as a matter of fact,
so far as I recaîl, this is the first time I have
seen any of bis writing. What lie says in a
column written by him, or at least purportinig
to be written by him, in the December lst
issue of The Canadian. Mining Reporter, pubilislied at the city of Toronto, is this:
What first impresses the returning traveller,
setting foot in the home country after five
montlis' absence and stepping across a troopship
gangway into the middle of the conscription
crisis, i. 'that Canada lias suddenly gone stark,
screamîng mad.
After a few days back in
circulation, bowever, hie realizes that what
actually i. happening is that the Canadian
people are struggling againat almost overwhehning odds to retaîn their sanity in a
typhoon of confusion whipped up by a frenetic
press and political cynies posing as patriots.
A people wliose war effort, second to none, lias
been achjeved in the most difficult and hazardous to, govern of ail the deocratie countries,
have suddenly been pushed to the lunatie fringe
of dementia praecox.
Now, that is strong language, honourable
senators, but I must say that it expresses my
appraisal of the situation better than I could
hope to do. The dying embers of oId racial
and political jealousies were fanned into flame,
and the situation generally certainly boded
no good for the future of this country. Happuly the point where there miglit have been
a national conflagration seems te have been
passed. Nevertlieless, we shaîl carry for many
long years the scars resulting from this wound

to our national unity.

For that particular

situation I blame a certain section of the press
of Canada, wlio by every device ini the
editorial repertoire, news columns, cartoons,
front page feature articles, anonymous letters
from aur troops and printed opinions, have
played upon the affections and. anxieties of

Canadians citizens until they reaclied almast
the breaking point." This was no spontaneous
outburst of public sentiment on an important
national issue expressed tlirough the medium
of an independent press. Here was a studied
propaganda carried on over a period of many
months, dating back long before the naw
famous statement of Major Smythe, and
even before our overseas forces were in action.

510

SENATE

To test the sincerity of that, campaign, one
need only remark that the former ýMinister of
National Defence, now hailed as a national
hero by this group of journaliste, was regarded
by thern only a few short months ago as wh.olly
tinfit to direct our arrny, while the present
Minister, upon whom they now daily heap
their contempt, was held out by them as one of
the greatest Canadi-an soldiers and the rnost
outstanding of our citizens. I feel confident
that Colonel Raîston will flot be taken in by
this sudden demonstration of affection.
When we were last here the honourable
gentleman from Saskatchewan North (Hon.
Mr. Horner) made some mention of a national
government. Perhaps hoe ïill recall with me
the proposai which was put forward some time
ago, that we should have such a Government
and that none ùther than CeocraI McNaughton
should ho brouglit borne to Canada t.o lead it.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: 1 arn the scootor fromi
Saskatchewan North. Is the bionourable genticman referring to me?
Hon. Mr. BEN('CH: It. was suggestcd that
t.here should be a national governmnent and that
(cncral McNaughton, the man who from one.
end of the countr 'v to the other is n0w heing
(riticized-I was going to use a stronger t.ermi
should ho broughit home and put ini the leadership of that gox errnient. 1 ask mvY bonourable
friend if hie recails that suiggestion.
Hon. Mr. HOR'NER: Never frorn me.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I arn sorry.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Not that Generai
McNaug-hton should ho hrougbt home; but
t.hat a national government shouid be formed.
ves.
Hon. Mr. BENCU: Perbaps iny nernory is
a little longer than that of the bonourable
gentleman opposite. and quite as trustworthy.
I amn drawing attention to these circurnstances for the purpose of iliustrating that
these newspaper.. carrying as thev do a grect
publie responsibility, have cither proven tli"ir
fiekleness or a complet(, iack of sincerity. If
t.he people of this country wiil take this lesson
to beart, perhaps wve rnay hope to avoid in the
future a repetition of this kind of thing. I
say tbat, this campaign in tbe press has heen
disgraceful and that it bias done Canada a great
disservice.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Riclimond-West
Cape Breton): Before my bionourahie friend
proeeeds ftirther I shouid like t.o ask, him a
question. Uns nlot the agitation in the press
of this country hrought about the support that
eut troops are to-day receiving, together with
the action of Colonel Raîston?
Hon. NMc.BENCH.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I know my honourable
friend would like me to answer his question in
the affirmative.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Certainly, you cannot do othe-rwise.
The party to which the honourable
gentleman belongs has answered for him.
Somie Hon. SENATORS: ýOrder.
lion. Mr. BENCH: 1 arn sorry I cannot
accommodate mv honourable friend in that
respect.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD L(Richmond-West
Cape Breton): I know you cannot. You are
too partisan for that.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Honourable senators, I
hope rny honourable friend opposite is not
misuinderstanding anytbing I arn saying, and
that lie will treat me in a more friendly spirit
than to charge me with partisanship.
Somne Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As I say, the Order in
Couincil which enuinciates the policy of the
Government in this particular eircumstance,
was broughit about ýby the statement, that
there was a shortage of reinforcernents, which
wvas checked by Colonel Raîston and fotind to
lie correct. That is what really hrougbt about
the situation. My honourable friend surely
would not suggest to me that hecaiise a certain c.abal of newspapers demanded this or
that any Government would thereupon pass
an Order iii Council witbin the next few days.
There sureiy mnust he sonie more effective suipport for an orderi in council.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It aIl came about
over nigbt.
Hon. Mr. KING: 1942.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I suppose that all depends on the point of view.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: It is a matter of bistory no\v, not a point of view.
Hon. Mc. BENCH: I was about to say,
bonourabie senators, that certain people in
this eountry, the efforts of which on all fronts
have heen second to none, arc shouiting to the
world that there is a skeleton in the ivar
cioset, thcrebv diseounting hefore the eyes of
ail rnankind the great things that have been
aceompiisbed.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Has the honourable
senator rend tbe American press, P.M. and
other papers? When I read tbiem 1 just bang

Hon. Mr. BENCH: My bonn'rahle friend
opposite will hav e an opportunity to repl 'v.
I want to aceommodate hima aIl I can, but 1

DECEMBER 4, 1944
hardly see what bearing bis interjection has
on the point 1 arn now making.
Hon. Mr. MACODONAjLD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Before the honourable gentleman proceeds. I understood him to make the
statement that there is a skele ton in the
Cabinet war closet. I would like bim to explain that. If there are any skeletons in
there we should like to know more about
them. We have already found out about
some of tbem.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Order, please.
When an honourable senator bas the floor a
question can be put to him only by bis leave.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Certainly.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is entirely out
of order to interrupt and enter into an argument with the bonourable senator wbo bas
the floor, and as be now desires to continue
bis remarks, be sbould lie allowed to do so.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richimond-West
Cape Breton): Yes, but, Mr. SpeakerHon. Mr. KING: Order.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Tbe bonourable gentleman bas
gone quite far enougb I tbink.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Sit down and take
your medicine.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Ricbmond-West
Cape Breton): I am flot taking any medicine
from you.
Tbe Hon.. tbe SPEAKER: Wben tbe Speaker
stands tbe honourable member must sit down.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): I sit down.
The Hon. tbe SPEAKER: A ruling of tbe
Speaker cannot be tbe subjeet of discussion.
It may lie appealed from to tbe Flouse.
My ruling is that wben an lionourable senator lias tbe floor no other honourable senator
may interrupt him except witb leave, and
in no circumstances may anotber lionourable
senator enter into an argument witb bim.
Eacb bonourable senator lias tbe opportunity
of speaking for himself and developing bis
own argument. Interruptions, tberefore, must
be limited to questions put with tbe leave of
the member wbo bas the floor.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton): Mr. Speaker, I sbould like to
ask my bonourable friend a question. Will
be explain the statement lie bas made in reference to the-skeleton in tbe war cloeet before
be proceeds any furtber? I arn very sorry that
we bave to take-

511

Tbe Hon. the SPEAKER: Tbe bonourable
gentleman wbo lias tbe floor bas not given bis
consent. He may proceed.
Hon. Mr. MACDONALD (Ricbmond-West
Cape Breton): I bave asked bim a questionTlie Hon. tbe SPEAKER: Order! Tbe
bonourable senator wio bas the floor lias thie
rigbt to develop bis argument in any way lie
desires, and it is not in order for anotber
bonourable senator to tell bim liow lie sbould
proceed with it.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I sbould be glad to,
answer the question put to me by thie bonourable senator frorn Richmond-West Cape
Breton if it were based upon a sound foundation of fact. I did not say tliere was a
skeletoin in our war closet. I said tbat tbe
attitude of the press and a certain section of
the people of this country souglit to give thie
impression that there was a skeleton in our
closet. That is ahl I said. Perbaps I arn in
bad voice to-night, for I bave a stiglit cold,
and the bonourable gentleman opposite may
not bave understood me. I think tbe situation
is *best described by the gentleman 1 bave
just quoted, Leslie Roberts, wlio says in anotlier part of bis article that we seem to be
taking an insane pleasure in wasbing our dirty
linen at tbe village pump, surrounded by
pbotograpbers.
By way of comparison I sbould like to
make some reference to tbe part this country
played in thie prosecution of the last war and
of this. Canada's participation in tlie last war
really cannot be fairly compared with what
she lias done since 1939. During the last
five years we bave been producing b.uge quantities of guns and ammunition, we have been
building sbips, we bave been supplying
motorized equipment, we 'have been building planes, and we hbave been furnishing
untold quantities of otlier war goods. In
the years. 1914 to 1918 our industrial effort
was-shall I say?-trifling. True, we tben
furnisbed large amounts of wbeat, but in tbis
war in addition to supplying wbeat, we have
produced and sliipped to our allies tremendous quantities of bacon, eggs, cbeese, rnilk
and otlier dairy products, and of beef and
otlier varieties of foodstuffs.
In 1918, after four years of war, our total
enlistments of maies were 632,006, or about 33
per cent of tbe country's maie -population in
tbe 18 to 44 age group. Iu tbis war to the
end of December, 1943, wbîch is the best comparative term I could obtain, our total
male enlistments were 908,169, or about 38
per cent of the eountry's male population in
thbe age group of 18 to 44 years.

512

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should like to be
able to, accommodate the honourabie gentleman frontî Saskatchewani Northt, but I arn
afraid 1 bave nlot those figures. I said that et
the end of December 1943-last Decemberour total enliitments were 908,169.

Tbat is te place tbera on a comparative basis
with the increase in our population.
The third gives current figurcs for- this war.
The firist item sbows tbat in tbe lest war we
bad 6,823 men in tbe Navy. Adding sixty
per cent te tbis figure to place it on a comparative basis witb the increase in our populatien, wouid make it 10,916. Actually in tbis
war we have 90,000 in the Navy.

Hon. Mr. CRIESBACH:
For the Army
alone, or does that also include the Navy and
the Air Force?

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I say te
rny bonourable friend that in the iast war we
bcd virtually ne navy at ail.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Will the honourable
gentleman give the figures for the diseharges
during that period?

Hon. Mr. BE-NCU: Ail services. That is
about 38 per cent of the maie population of
this country ie the age group of 18 to 44
years of age, as compared with 33 per cent
in the lest war.
When I bring the figures up te the end of
October of 1944. 1 find thet our total enlistments are 972,330, whicba is almost 41 par
cent of our maie population in that same age
bracket.
Now,*it does, serin to mne thiat thîs is a

rnany of tbe 972,000 troops were active, and
how manv -were non-active or Canadien hlome

Hon. Mr. BENCH: In so, far as I know.
tbese figures include enlistments botb under

Wihile 1 arn on the subject of comparisons,
perbeps bonourable senators wiii permit me to
boister this brancb of my case by reference te
-n article which appeared in tbe Financiel

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I arn quoting thcm frorn
the Financial Post. Tbat is net a publication
that is known. as being friendly te, tbn
G overnment.
Hen. Mr. GRIESBACH: I rernember that
a good many years ago it was said in another
place on behalf of tbe Governrnent of the day
that the figures of Canadiens servîng in tbe
Royal Air Force could net be given. I wender
where tbe Financial Post got its figures.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I arn sorry J irn unabie
te give rny honourabie friend freini Edmonton
that information. I arn assurning that tbese
figures mnust have been secured frorn some
authoritative source.
In tbe Army in the last war w~e bcd 454.585
men. Adding sixty per cent te, riake this
figure comparable with our inca'ease in population, we shouid bave 727,336. Actually we
bave 764,000.
On the item of wvar supply, in tbe last war
thcere xvas sprnt by Canada one biliien and 69
million dollars. The addition of 60 per cent
wouid give us a figure of oe billion 710 million dollars. Ac tuaiiv we bave spent in tbis

DECEMBER 4,1944
war, exclusive of aid to Britain, 10 billion, 743
million dollars.
When I read that tribute to our people and
their war-time government, when I think of
the vigorous leadership which has been given
to Canada in fiscal policy, price control and
other fields for the better prosecution of our
effort, I have grave difficulty in accepting the
proposition that Mr. King's war policy has
been evasive or cowardly. On the contrary, I
only wonder if we have not attempted too
much.
Now let me turn to the charges which have
been made that Mr. King and his government
have turned "a double somersault" on this
issue, that the Order in Council is only a partial measure and an evasion of our full responsibility. To meet these allegations, it is
necessary for me to go back to the passing of
the National Resources Mobilization Act,
which is chapter 13 of the Statutes of 1940.
By that measure the Government was given
power to mobilize all the effective resources of
the nation, both human and material, for the
defence and security of Canada. This power
was made subject to the express restriction
that persons could not be required to serve
outside of Canada and the territorial waters
thereof. However, as honourable senators know
better than I, in 1942 by an amendment to the
Act that restriction was removed.
I-was not in Parliament when the National
Resources Mobilization Act was passed, but I
understand that it passed through both Houses
almost unanimously. In the light of present
criticism it perhaps is important to remember
that the powers contained in this legislation
were designed and approved by Parliament.
Without them, the Governor in Council could
not act; nor, having been granted them, could
he thereafter act except in compliance with
the provisions of the legislation, which must be
strictly construed.
There seems to be some opinion abroad
that the Government has a free hand to call
up for service and send out of this country
any number of persons at any time, regardless
of the need. I contend that such a view is
not correct. The National Resources Mobilization Act gives to the Governor in Council
the power "from time to time"-these are
the words of the Act-to require persons "to
place themselves, their services and their
property at the disposal of the His Majesty in
the right of Canada, as may be deemed necessary or expedient for securing the public
safety, the defence of Canada, the maintenance of public order, or the efficient
prosecution of the war," and so on. I submit

513

to honourable senators that the language I
have just quoted does not grant an unlimited
discretion to the Government. There must
be shown a necessity, or at least a measure
of expediency for requiring persons to place
their services at the disposal of His Majesty.
Then, a necessity having been demonstrated
for a particular purpose-such as, for example,
the immediate defence of Canada itself-I do
not think anyone will contend that personnel
requisitioned for such purpose could, under
the Act, be used by the Governor in Council
for some other end, regardless of whether
need was shown or not. In effect, what
Parliament said in the National Resources
Mobilization Act was this: "We give 'you
the power to require persons to serve in
our armed forces if, as and when, and
only to the extent which from time to time
is shown to be necessary or expedient for the
efficient prosecution of the war."
Having regard to that, the first point that
I want to make is that there was no need
shown for the employment of N.R.M.A.
recruits in any European theatre until there
arose the situation which brought us here.
Up until then the voluntary system of enlistment had proved adequate to meet our needs.
When it was shown that reinforcements were
required in connection with our present operations, and that these reinforcements could not
be obtained in any other way, the Government
took advantage of the power which had been
vested in it by Parliament. The current need,
projected some three or four months ahead,
is for 16,000 men for the Mediterranean
and Northwestern-European operations. The
Order in Council meets this demand. No
necessity has been shown, and I submit none
could be shown, for the present employment
of troops in the Far East. We are not fighting
in the war against Japan as yet. When our
commitments in the Pacific are announced,
that will be the time to make an appraisal of
the need there.
What I am saying is that undér the
restricted authority granted to the Government by this Parliament in the National
Resources Mobilization Act, the Government
has exercised its powers to the limit, and at
the earliest possible time, to send N.R.M.A.
troops to European fighting fronts. Other and
later necessities as to time and place may
arise. If they do, the Government will be
free to resort again to the N.R.M.A. personnel; but, in the view which I take of the
legislation, cannot do so until that time
comes and the extent and nature of the
needs of that time are determined.

SENATE
The other day the honourable senator from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Black) stressed the
necessity of keeping the record straight on
certain historical phases of the development
and treatment of the conscription issue in
Canada. I thought, and I still think, that this
is a good thing to do. Desiring, as I
do, to support the opinion which I hold
regarding the proper interpretation of the
powers of the Government under the National
Resources Mobilization Act, and also to show
that the Prime Minister has not been indulging
in acrobatic exercises on this problem, perhaps
honourable senators will permit me to draw to
their attention certain statements made by
Mr. King. These statements will, I think,
indicate that he has always regarded the powers
under the National Resources Mobilization
Act as being subject to the restriction which I
have mentioned. They will also show, I think,
that throughout he has maintained a constant
course.
On June 10, 1942, when Bill 80 to amend the
National Resources Mobilization Act was before the House of Commons, the Prime Minister spoke in support of it, and I desire to
present to honourable members some quotations from that speech as it appears in the
House of Commons Hansard. At page 3228
he said:
The result of tie plebiscite leaves no doubt
as to the freedom of the Governrent and of
Parliament to discuss the question of conscription for service overseas upon its nimeits. Il
equally leaves no doubt as to the freedon of
the Government and of Parliament to decide.
for or against conscription for service overseas,
either conditionally or unconditionally.
At page 3234 he is reported as follows:
If the Bill is amended as proposed, it is not
the intention of the Government to resort to
conscription for service overseas unless circumstances should arise which would render thc
use of compulsion imperative, such, for example.
as the maintenance of the necessary reinforcements for Canada's army overseas.
The Prime Minister proceeded to discuss the
divergent views of our people upon the question of compulsory service for overseas, and
at page 3236 will be found this passage:
There is unfortunately, a third view-a view
which I believe, accords with the opinion most
generally held throughout tihe Dominion. It is
that conscription for service overseas shouild be
inaugurated only if and w-ben, in the opinion
of the Government, it becomes necessary to the
security of our country, and to the maintenance
of its war effort. That view is the one whicl
is held by the Government. It represents the
Government's policy with respect to conscription for service overseas. In a word, that
policy may be described as not necessarily conscription but conscription if necessary.
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

On the 7th of July following, in connection
with the same Bill, the Prime Minister made
one or two other statements which I should
like to quote. They will be found at page 4013:
It bas, I think, been made abundantly clear
that, so far, at least, as the present administration is concerned, any decision respecting conscription for overseas service will not rest
solely with the military authorities, but that
any action taken under the present Bill must
and will be authorized by the Governor in
Council. In other words, tise decision will be
the decision of the Cabinet, subject always to
its responsibility to Parliament. I have already
also given to honourable members an assurance
that all relevant factors would be taken into
account by the Cabinet in reaching a decision.
"All relevant factors." I quote further from the
same page:
This debate, necessarily comes to be a matter
of the degree of confidence which Parliament
and the people have in the administration
charged with the responsibilities of carrying
on the war. This does not constitute a reason
for a second debate on the conscription issue.
Il is, however, the strongest of reasons why a
Government, once il tas reached a decision that
the needs of a situation demand a certain
course of action on ,which opinion may be
divided, should take the earliest possible opportunity of making perfectly sure that it

enjoys

the confidence of Parliament and that il may
rely -with certainty upon the support of Parliament in giving effect to the decision reached.
There, honourable senators, for all the world
to sec, is the course outlined in 1942 by Mr.
King. That, I submit, is the course which
has been followed to the letter by him and
by his Government. That record, I submit
further, does not support the charge of
evasion any more than it supports the charge
of double somersaulting. Reviewing the circumstances dispassionately, I think honourable
memnibers will agree with me that this is about
what has taken place:
(1) Parliament gave to the Government the
right to conscript our manpower for military
purposes, and so to employ it only if and to
the extent needed from lime to time.
(2) The Government through the Prime
Minister, gave an undertaking to the country
that the power to compel military personnel
to serve outside of Canada would be used
only when, and not before, the necessity arose.
On that understanding Parliament passed the
legislation.
(3) The Government, in keeping with its
pledge. exhausted every other ineans of maintaining and reinforcing our overseas army.
(4), The need for employment of N.R.M.A.
personnel in the limited, present number arose.
and then the Government exercised its power
to the full extent prescribed.

DECEMBER 4, 1944
(5) Having done s0, in compliance with
its further promise, it now reports to Parliament and seeks an expression of confidence
from the House of Commons.
Parliament, I say, made the rules, and the
Government has strictiy observed thern. If
the step wbich has been taken by the paasing
of th-is Order in Council is sufficient to meet
the need that has been shown-and I suggest that both Colonel Ralston and General
McNaughton are agreed on that fact.-then, I
submit, that should be an end of the matter.
This is especially so when we have the assurance of the Government that as further need
arises additional reinforcements will be drawn
from the available N.R.M.A. pool.
Now let me say a word as to the circumstances which led up to this crisis. There are
two or three features which I acknowledge
have left me with a feeling of some uneasiness,
which I knorw is shared by many other people.
I do not agree with the proposition that we
should not be concerned with the developments whicli brought tbis situation about.
We must pay some attention to them if for
no other reason than to avoid a possible
repetition. A few minutes ago I gave the
Blouse some figures showing that we have
enlisted in our Services very close to 1,000,000
mnen. Out of a total population of 12,000,000
that is a very large iiercentage, partieularly
when we consiclpr the very beavy demands
upon our human resources resulting frorn our
agricultural and industrial cornritmnents at
borne. The press reported last Friday that
our Army casualties for October were 7,921,
and that they have been 9,338 in August
and 8,445 in September. It is clear from alI
this-at least it is to me-and from ail we
have heard, that Canada bas reached almost
the bottom of bier figbting-manpower pitcher.
and tbat now she is required to dýrop in
pebbles to bring up the level of tbe reinforcements.
D.uring the session of 1942 the establishment of our Canadian Army overseas was
decided upon and approved by Parliament;
wben the war estimates of the Department of
National Defence were passed. We were to
have five divisions and, in addition-I arn
flot sure about this, but I think I arn correct
-two armo-ured brigades. In some quarters
I know there is opposition to Canada reducing
lier commitments. There is a feeling that
if tbis were done our national honour would
be impaired. I express no opinion on that
beyond pointing out that in the last war we
were finally obliged, as I understand, to
reduce our arrny in the field from fiye divisions to four-

515

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I interrupt my honourable friend there? The Fifth
Division neyer lef t England, but its organization was started. We had four divisions
actually ini the field.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I arn grateful to the
bonourable leader opposite. I was -regarding
the United Kingdom as being in the field of
operations. Nevertheless, the fact that we
were obliged-as I .understand the bonourable
leader oýpposite now to confirm-to reduce our
military establishment overseas f rom fiye
divisions to fourHon. Mr. CALDER: They neyer were
reduced, tbe Fifth Division was still in
England.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Tbhey were
broken Up.
Hon. Mr. BE'NCH: I arn obliged to
the bonourable gentlemen opposite, who
were directly engaged with the problem at
that time. I arn only saying we had an
establishment of five divisions overseas, and
that we did reduce tbern; and I was going on
to say tbat 1 thin-k that was done without
bringing any discredit on us.
H1on. Mr. CALDER: Tbe honourable
gentleman sbould realize that those men were
not retired from the army, they were not put
into the reserve, they were still available if
required.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I understand that. I
arn very sorry if I bave given a wrong
impression.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: You are talking as
if they bad disappeared altogether.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I did not mean to say
that. My understanding is that we had in
tbe last war an establishment of five divisions.
My point is that as the fiye divisions could
not be properly reinforced we had to reduce
our establishment to four divisions, so, that
the fifth was made available to the other
four divisions as reinforcements.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Quite correct.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I arn grateful to the
honourable senator from Saltcoats for helping
me to make that clear. As I say, so far as
I arn aware, that reduction in our military
establishment was effected without reflecting
any discredit on us. Perhaps in this connection it is useful also to point out that on the
basis of manpower emloyed in this war in
ahl the services, army, navy and air force,
we have enlisted sometbing in excess of the
equivalent of ten army divisions. I am
expressing no opinion whatever as to the

SENATE
effect that a reduction of our commitments
would have on our national honour, but I
would point out that already during this war
one of our sister nations in the British Commonwealth has twice reduced the number of
men in her military establishment. I speak
of Australia.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is another
fact I should like to point out to the honourable gentleman. In the last war the strength
of a Canadian division was close to 25,000
men, whereas in this war it is about 15,000.
It is important to remember that, as bearing
on what the honourable gentleman is discussing now.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I assume there would
have to be included the ancillary troops, if
that is what they are called, the headquarters
establishments and so on. If you divide
25,000 into a million, you get far more than
ten. I thinlk I was being rather conservative
in my estimate.
I was saying that on two occasions during
this war Australia has reduced her military
was in
first time
The
establishment.
October, 1943, when she took 20,000 men out
of the army. These were in addition to men
who had been discharged for medical reasons
and so on. Last month she withdrew another
56,000. I repeat, that I express no opinion
as to whether a reduction of our commitments
might reflect on our national honour; but,
as I sec it, even if we do not reduce the size
of our establishment, we might very well consider a rearrangement. To fight an army,
and a small one at that, on two fronts must
involve a higher casualty risk than to fight
it in only one theatre. In addition, the
supplying of two army corps in widely
separated areas, with the maintenance of lines
of communication, the manning of hoadquarters establishments and the carrying on of
other services, must constitute a considerable drain on our numerical strength. The
honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon.
Mr. Criesbach), w-ho has had a much greater
military training and experience than I have
had, will know whether my appraisal of this
situation is correct; but this is certainly the
impression I have.
I am not blaming or criticizing anyone for
the circumstance that our army is divided in
this way. The dispositions were undoubtedly
made on the best military advice obtainable
and as the developing conditions of war
demanded. However, now that the offensive
programme has reached an advanced stage,
now that we recognize our limitations, it
seems to me that the Government might very
well consider consolidating our forces on one
front without Canada in any way losing
national prestige.
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

Something else about this situation that
troubles me is the great suddenness with
which it developed. We have been told that
the Government was not informed of the
critical shortage of reinforcements until some
time in October, and learned of it only after
Colonel Ralston had himself visited the fighting theatres. As I have said, my military
experience has been very limited, but, speaking as a layman, I find great difficulty in
understanding why the minister did not have
more notice of the progressive inerease in the
rate of casualties and the depletion of the
reinforcement pools. There may have been
good reason for it. I am only saying I de
We do know that the
not understand it.
problem was developing overseas as early as
the beginning of August. We also know it
was necessary for the then Minister of
National Defence himself to go to Europe to
get all the facts, and that the true state of
affairs did not come to light until midOctober. I repeat, I have difficulty in understanding how this situation could arise with
such complete surprise to our military staffs.
When Major Smythe published bis now
famous statement, my immediate impression
was that it was very strange that we should
be getting this information first from a battery commander. If the facts werc as he
stated them, why should they not have becen
known to our chiefs of staff?
And when I am speaking of Major Smythe,
let me draw attention to another situation
that concerns me deeply. Since he rushcd
into print there has been a regular parade of
statements from army officers. I do not need
to recite them all. There was the press interview given by a group of high-ranking oflicers
on the Pacifie coast, another by the District
Officer Commanding at Winnipeg. Honourable senators know that that does not exhaust
the list. I think, and the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
will correct me if I am wrong, that all of
these statements were clearly contrary to the
King's Regulations and Orders. I say that
this exhibition of disregard for constituted
authority and of army regulations worries
me.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Excuse me, but
what is the present situation as regards that
discussion? First of all, a number of officers
made the statement which you say was contrary to the regulations, as it probably was;
thon an officer was dispatched to investigate
that statement, but before he could start an
investigation the Government had changed
its policy and admitted that it was no longer
able to get men through the voluntary systeni
and that conscription had to be put into

DECEMBER 4, 1944
force. Is the Government still going to
prosecute these officers for having said that
the men could not be raised under the voluntary system, or is the officer who was sent
out to investigate now being called home?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I think the change of
policy referred to by my honourable friend
is irrelevant. I know of no change in the
King's Regulations and Orders which permits
officers in uniform to rush into print. What
has happened since the present Minister of
National Defence undertook to investigate
this matter, as my honourable friend has
reminded us, I do not know; but I expect
we shall hear more of it.
I, was saying that this parade of, shall I
say, insurrection among officers of the Department of National Defence worries me. To
make an adaptation of the declaration of one
of Shakespeare's famous characters, it leads
me to believe "there is something rotten" in
the Department of National Defence. Moreover, I know that there are lots of people
who share that view.
;Recently I have been making some addresses
designed to better acquaint the public with
the purpose and function of the Senate of
Canada, and to meet some of the criticisms
that have been levelled at this branch of Parliament. In the course of those speeches I have
ventured to suggest that with the increasing
emphasis that is being placed on the administrative side of government, the Senate more
and more could act as the eyes and cars of
Parliament, and that many inquiries now delegated to 'Royal Commissions might be conducted by committees of this House. I have
proposed that our committee work might
follow more closely along the lines upon which
the Senate of the United States functions. I
have felt that in this way we icould make a
very real contribution to the machinery of
government, and at the same time provide a
parliamentary forum for the expression of
public opinion on matters of national importance.
One specific proposal which I put forward
is that a standing committee of this House
be constituted to inquire into charges of impropriety and inefficiency in the administration of public affairs. An example of the type
of thing I have in mind when I offer this
suggestion is the charge made last spring that
the Douglas D.C. 4 aircraft production was
transferred from a Malton plant to a Montreal factory so that some financial benefit
might accrue to a man friendly to the Government. Another instance is the recent charge
by the Joy Oil Company of misconduct and
inefficiency in the office of the Oil Controller.
To those two examples, I would now add the
Major Smythe charges.

517

If some public body, detached from the
partisan interests of Government and Opposition parties-as the Senate is-would undertake investigation of matters of this kind,
there would be fewer irresponsible charges;
and sueh as are well-founded would, be more
quickly brought to light and the improper
conditions more speedily corrected. In the
case of the Smythe charges a great deal of
anguish-causing controversy in the press might
have been avoided. The public would have
had facts instead of editorial opinion as a
basis for its judgment, and much of the confusion and misunderstanding that have been
created might have been prevented.
Along the same lines, I think there is a
duty on Parliament to sec to it that our
Department of National Defence is so organized that we may avoid a recurrence of a
crisis such as the one we are now passing
through. The country is entitled to the satisfaction of knowing there are no missing links
in the chain of responsibility from the Minister down to the last battalion commander.
God forbid that we shall ever again be called
upon to engage in war. Nevertheless, that is
a possibility which we must ever keep before
us in the future. I am not witch-hunting.
I am merely saying that if mistakes have
been made that could have been avoided, we
should profit by our experience.
While we are still at war, and especially
when we are so nearly approaching an end
of the struggle, probably no good could resuit from further muddying of the waters.
Let us now rather keep our energies centred
on our main objective-the defeat of our
enemies. When that has been accomplished,
there will be time and opportunity for a general stock-taking. At that time I should like
to see this branch of Parliament, through the
agency of a committee established by it, examine into the entire structure of the Department of National Defence, at least in so far
as it has to do with the army. There are in
this House honourable gentlemen who, by
training and experience, would be well qualified to carry out such an inquiry and to formulate recômmendations designed to obviate a
repetition of the present crisis. If there is
need for a Military Affairs Committee of the
United States Senate, there is also need for
one here. As far as I am concerned, if there
had been any doubt on that score, recent
events have been sufficient to remove it.
I cannot leave this subject without giving
some expression to the regret which I feel that
this country's magnificent contribution could
not have been carried through to a finish as a
purely voluntary effort. That achievement
may still be possible if our young men now

518

SENATE

enrolled as N.R.M.A. recruits find it possible
to come forward and put their services without
restriction at the disposal of their country. To
them I should like to say that when they leave
Canada for our fighting theatres they will go,
not as "zombies"-a term which I abhor-but
as Canadian soldiers carrying in their charge
the honour and glory of this great country.
They will go to join their comrades-in-arms
in continued assault on the citadels of evil.
They will go to stand in the places of those
whose will to resist aggression knew no limits
of sacrifice, and to whom I would humbly
address the words of Pericles uttered 400
years before Christ:
But each one, man by nan, lias won imperishable praise, each lias gained a glorious gravenot that sepulchre of earth wherein they lie,
but the living tomb of everlasting remembrance
wherein their glory is enshrined; renembrance
that will live on the lips, that will blossom in
the deeds of their country-men the world over.
For the whole earth is the sepilchre o f
heroes; monuments nay rise and tablets be
set up to them in their own land, but on far-of
shores there is an abiding niemorial that no
peu or chisel bas traced; it is graven. not on
stone or brass, but on the living heart of
huianity.
Take these men for your example. Like them.
renember that prosperity can be only for the
free, that freedom is the sure possession of
those alone who have courage to defend it.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
I am sure you will agree with me that we have
had an exceedingly interesting debate, a debate
that for the most part bas been carried on
with moderation. For a minute or two this
evening it looked as if we might have a little
strife, but the threat soon disappeared.
I
trust that what I have to say during the course
of this debate will be along the line that bas
been well marked up.
The honourable gentleman who bas just
spoken (Hon. Mr. Bench) is a new member;
I think he came to us last year, and probably
this is his second or third speech. He will
be heard from again. He will in all probability be here much longer than I shall, be will
learn much, and some years from now will
likely deliver speeches based on material a
little more definite and, in some cases
probably, a little more realistie than that
which at times he used to-night. It seems to
me we must in debates of this character always
endeavour to be sure of our facts. It is
impossible to present convincing arguments
unless your facts are correct.
I was glad to hear the Speaker's ruling ta the
effect that members must not interrupt the
member who bas the floor. I have been in
public life for a fairly long time and have taken
part in many debates, but I never took part
in an important debate without making notes
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

and using them. I am unable to do so to-night,
for reasons that you know, and consequently
what I say nay be of a more or less rambling
nature. I do not therefore want to get into a
trap, for I shall not have before me a few
sheets of paper to check up and find out
exactly where I was before the interruption.
I do not object in the slightest to interruptions
if they are material to the question at issue,
and I shall be glad to answer any questions
that honourable members may ask.
If I
make an inaccurate statement I should like to
be corrected at once, because it is very irmportant to get the facts.
As I say, we have had an intensely interesting debate. We have had our difference of
opinion, properly, rightly, naturally so, but I
am inclined to think you will all agree on one
fact-we have witnessed elsewhere a crisis that
is unique. Nothing like it bas ever occurred
before in this country so far as my knowledgc
of Canadian history goes, and I doubt very
much if anything like it has ever occurred in
any other democratic country in the world. I
am not objecting to that crisis. I am not
thinking at all of the personalities concerned
in it. Let us forget all about those who took
part. The fait is that the crisis is unique.
Just let me illustrate. One day the Government take a certain stand on a question of
policy, and because they take that stand a
ininister retires. On the follewing day the
Government change their policy. Then another
minister resigns because the Covernment decide to do what the first minister asked for.
I say such a situation is unique, and probably
is one of the considerations that led to the
crisis.
My honourable friend who bas just spoken
has again tried to indicate to us that that
crisis was more or less organized. He attributed
it to at least a certain section of the press,
and intimated that to some extent. probabiy.
there were other influences at work as well.
At any rate, that has been intimated elsewhere.
Does the honourable gentleman really believe
that the crisis was so organized? We witnessed
the other day the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris) take exactly the
opposite view. Every member in this House
knows exactly what happened and what caused
that crisis. It was not because this paper and
that paper and the next paper used cartoons
and wrote editorials. This is still a free country. and if any papers wish to print cartoons
and editorials-and they do it ail the time-they have a perfect right to do so.
Let us for a few moments look at what
bappened. I did not intend to touch on it
at all, and I will refer only to the high spots.

DECEMBER 4,1944
Colonel Raiston went to Europe. We ail
know the purpose for whieh he went. What
happened immediately he did so? People
began to wonder why he was there, and the
newspaper men-as they always do and have
the right to do-began to g.uess; rumours
began to float about. . That is customary,
there i5 nothing novel about it. But in this
case it happened to be Colonel Raîston who
went overseas. The newspaper men were
gathering news, and the story of his visit to
Europe was told in ail the papers throughout
Canada. Ail right. Colonel Raîston arrived
back in Ottawa and met the Cabinet, and
people wondered what was happening. What
did happen? There was Council meeting after
Council meeting; these meetings carried on
for days, and every reporter here, whet-her he
represented a newspaper of Canada, the
United States, Great Britain or any other
country, was busy gathering news. For days
and days the news consisted of gossip and
guesses and ail that sort of thing. This is not
at ail unusual, it occurs every day in connection with any event of importance. Did any
political party or any person organize it?
That news appeared flot only in Lîberal papers
and Tory papers, it appeared in ail the pres
of Canada.
Very well. Those Council meetings were
held, and not until a certain day did Colonel
Ralaton resign. Then there was a blast across
the country. From whom? From the public of
Canada. The people asked: Why in the world
did this man who bas been in office for four
or five years resign? They were told the story
by ail the press of Canada. Then followed
the appointment of General McNaughton.
After this the Prinie Minister took to the
radio to, tell what had happened. He was foliowed by Colonel Raîston, who told his story.
General McNaughton addressed meetings here
and in Arnprior, and the newspapers of the
country from ocean to ocean simply reeked
with the information-not merely one or two
or three or four or five, but ail the newspapers
of Canada. T-hen Parliament was summoned
and the members of both Houses assembled
here. Everybody in Canada knew what we
were called together for. There was a question at issue; and. any attempt to indicate that
this was the result of an organized effort,
made either by a political party or by some
group, is simply nonsense, that is ail. In fact,
we know what happened. As a resuit of that
very wide distribution of news certain facts
stared everybody in the face. The public
became deeply interested, and from the right
motive.
Now, hono-urable senators, let me ask, did
flot every one of y<>u 'wander around while
you were at home and meet the public? I

myseif saw many people.
1 met some
on the street, some cailed on me. During that period of crisis there was nothing
talked of anywhere except this issue. In the
home, on the street, in hotels, in buses, in
stores, everywhere. Arn 1 not right? Is that
not. a fact? Ail honourable senators know it
us. Neyer since I have been in public life
have I seen the people of my province and of
Canada so aroused by and interested in a
question of public policy-for that is what
this was.
I say they were aroused and
unterested. They were inquiring in evcry
direction, and discussing everywhere and at
ail times, day after day, in an endeavour to
reach a conclusion as to what should be done.
And eventually they made known their
opinion, by Iiterally thousands of letters to
the press. I am talking of the whole press
of Canada. By means of thousands of letters
in the press of Canada they gave expression
to their views. Some of these letters may
have been anonyrnous, but a, very large number of them were signed by the writers. In
addition to that, as we know, thousands of
letters and scores of telegrams reached members of Parliament, telling them where the
voters stood on this issue. It was that accumulation of public opinion, expressed as I
neyer saw it expressed in this country before,
that finally forced the Governrnent to change
its policy within twenty-four hours.
Hon. Mr. KING: Oh, no, no.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No what?
Hon. Mr. KING: The Government policy
was declared in 1942. That policy was to go
into effect if certain things happened, and
those things did happen.
Hon. Mr. CALDER:- On the 22nd day of
November the Prime Minister stood in his
place eisewhere and declared that he was in
favour of the voluntary system.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: He declared that he
believed the voiuntary system would succeed,
that he was not in favour of conscription, that
he neyer was in favour of conscription and
would not enforce it.
Hon. Mr. KING: Unless it was necessary.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Until it was necessary.
Hon. Mr. KING:
1942.

That was declared in

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wise men change
their minds, and fools neyer.
Hon. Mr. CALDER- I quite agree that
wise men change their minds.

1 say we had in effeet a policy whereby a
Canadian defence force was conscripted. That
was extendcd by Order in Council so that
members of this force could be used in certain
Iirnited areas outside of Canada. On November 22 that-no more and no less-was the
Government's po]icy. Now, what did Colonel
Raiston stand for on that day? 11e stood
for the extension of the application of the
National Resources Mobilization Act to service in Europe. Why did hie resign? It was
because the Government refu.sed to accept
hisHon. Mr. HOR'NER: Recommendation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: His recommendation.
That is why Colonel Raîston resigned, beciuse
the Covernment would not budge f rom the
policy it had in force.
Hon. Mr. KING: UntilHon. Mr. CALDER: Well, now, pardon
me.
Hon. Mr. KING: Continue: -until the
Goverumont ascertained that these men would
not go voluntarily.
Hon. Mlr. CALDER: 'Until the necessary
pressure wvas brouglit on the Government that
forced it te do what it did not want te do.
Hon. Mr. KING: Have it your way, if you
wish. but tlîat is net the fact. The fact speaks
for iftself.
Hon. Mr~. CALDER: Wliat is not the fact?
Hon. Mr. KING: The Governiment would
not use compulsion until satisfied thýat these
men declined to go into service voluntarily.
That was quito evident. And that was stated
as the pelicy in 1942.
Ilon. Mr. CALDER: I do not understand.
Hon. Mr. MACDON_ýALD (Richmond-West
Cape Breton) : Order!
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I should like very
mucli te hiave a clear statement frorn the
benourable gentleman.
The Hon. the SPEAK~ER: I would say to
the lienourable gentleman fremn RichmondWest Cape Breton (Hon. Mr. Macdenald)
that the present situation is the reverse of
ene titat arose soine timie age. The honourable
gent1inan whlî
bas thec floer (Hon. Mr.
Calder) has askec the honourabie leader of
the Ceeeet(Hon.
'-\r. King) a question,
se a peint ef eider does net arise.
Ilen. Mr. CALDER: His Honor is quite
Correct.
1 have ne desire hi state anytliing tbat is net
accurate, and slî:ll heoenly tee pleased if the
henourable leader xvilI point eut wherein I ani
wreng.
Hm. Mr. CAXLDER.

Hon. Mr. KING: I do net wish te deiay
at ail.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It is net a question of
delay.
Hon. Mr. KING: I thrnk that what happoned is quite evident. In 1942 the Prime
Ministor made a clear and concise statement
with regard te conscription of men drafted
under the National Resources Mobilization
Act. He said if the time came when it was
necessary and desirable te conscript these men,
they would be conscripted. There is ne need
te go ever what lias bappened within the last
few weeks. We are ail conversant with that.
We know that Colonel Raiston resigned, and
tbat the Prime Minister breught into the
Cabinet General McNaughton,
who had
believed that lie ceuid induce the N.R.M.A.
mon te volunteer. Whien they faiied te do
that, the Prime Minister carried eut the
undertaking ho made in 1942.
Hon. Mrt. CALDER: That dees net alter in
the slightest degrce the statement I made. I
have net disputed that the law whicli xas
pastscd gave the Government foul powers te,
sentI these mon whierever it chose. That is
net the issue at ail; that is net what created
the crisis. New, understand me. A Government may put a principie in the law, but in
doing se it takes power te exorcise a certain
})oli(cy.
Hon. Mr. KÇING: Or an alternative.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the honeurable
gentleman just, permit nie te follow eut my
argument? The Government took power te
appiy this law in part only, fer the time being.
In the year 1942 the Governiment, as a matter
of policy-I emphasize that-cenfined the
appic(ation ef that law te eur home defence
forces. Is thiat truce?
Hon. M-,r. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. C~ALDER: AIl right. A littie
later on, by reasen cf conditions thon oxiting, the Govornmoent issued under that law
an Order ini Courncil autherizing the sending
of treeps te Jaînaica, Bermuda, N-,ýewfotundland, the Aicutians and I think somnewhere in
the Aretie ocoan. Is thiat riglit?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
lion. 'Mr. CALDER: Titat was donc as ri
matior of I)olic.y,. Thero stili remained in the
law the poweor te do somoetiing cisc, -but the
Govornment, nover exorcisod that power. Now,
what Colonel Ralsten asked wa7 titat the
Covcrnment, as a matter of poliocy, sbould
exorcise tbat power under the law; but the
Governmcnt weld net do that.
Hon. Mr. KING: Ne1ýt at that time.

DECEMBER 4. 1944
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It simply would flot
do that. The honourable gentleman need flot
say, "Not at that time." That does flot make
the slightest difference.
On the 22nd of
November the Government would flot adopt
that policy. And what was the consequence?
Colonel Raiston resigned.
Hon. Mr. KING: Previous to that.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Previous to that. He
was present in another place on that day,
but hie had previously resigned bis office. On
the 'following day the Government decided to
adopt another feature of that samne policy,
and on the next day the Government said:
"Ail righit; you people want it, s0 now we
wilI adopt a further policy, which will require
these men to go to Europe." It was that
change of policy which resulted in the resignation of my good, dear friend "Chubby" Power.
As we sat in the gallery of the Commons, we
saw the two men--one who had res'igned because the Government would not have overseas
conscription, and the other who on the following day resigned because the Government was
prepared to have it. That is why the change
was called hy my honourable friend here (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) "a double somersault."
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Not the following
day, surely. It was two or tbree -weeks later.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: What is the differente? Colonel Raiston had retircd prior to
the 22nd of November. but he was present
wben the Prime Minister spoke on that
day. "Chubby" Power was to the left
of the Prime Minister. They were both
there, and my bonourable friend knows the
conditions under wbich they resigned. So
much for that. It bas taken a long time to
try to clear up that issue, but I hope I have
succeeded.
In all the proceedings that we witnessed
elsewhere, my most vivid impression was of
seeing democracy actually in action. Regardless of personalities--for I do flot wish to be
critical in týhat respect at all-what impressed
me was the. extraordinary change of events
within a very short period of tîme. ýIt was
that wbich made the situation unique in our
political history. I agree with my bonourable
friend fromn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) that it was the very clearest sign that
in this country democracy stili lives, and that
it can and will act whenever it is necessary
to do so. Democracy certainly bas acted during these past few days.
References have been made to wbat bas
been done in the air force, in the navy, in
industrial production, in the supply of foodstuifs, and so on. None of those things are

521

called into question at ail. Everybody knows
that an excellent job bas been done in production. And in saying that, we must not
forget that the major share of the praise
should go to those who d'id the job, not to
those who organizcd it. It should go to the
men and women in our factories, on our farms,
in our forests and mines and so on. They put
their backs into the job and produced whatever was necessary, regardIess of party considerations or anything of that kind. Is that
not true? If a nation ever hiad its back in a
job of this kind, Canada had diiring the
past five years; and while we are quite ready
to give credit to others, to governments or
organizers, the people who did the actual
work must be principally .rcmcmbered.
I am not going to deal with the mass of
figures that we have been given by the honourablýe member who spoke before me (Hon.
Mr. Bench). He presented many figures in an
endeavour to make a comparison between this
war and the last une. If honourable members
will only think for a moment, I am sure thcy
will agree with me that there is no ground for
comparison, for the last war was entirely
different from this one. We had, then a few
planes flying alid we had very few ships. In
general, the machines and power used in this
war are quite different from th-ose used in
1914-1918. There are other notable differences.
When the last war broke out, Russia was our
ally, right from the start, and 50 was Italy.
Portugal, Roumania and Japan also were our
allies. Therefore, you simply cannot compare
what bas happened in this war with what happened in the previous one. Furthermore, because of ail sorts of new inventions, the striking power that bas been placed in the bands
of men in our armed forces is su entirely
different fromn what it was a quarter of a
century ago that my honourable friend's
references to figures mean notbing.
What is the situation to-day in Great
Britain as cumpared with what it was in the
last war su far as manpo-wer and womanpower
are concerned? Especially, what is it compared with the situation in Canada? By the
law of conscription practically all the men
and ail the women in Great Britain are d'oing
what the state compels themn to do. I ask
you, is not that correct? To-day every man
and every woman in Great Britain from
eighteen to well on forty years of age is in
that position as a result of conscription. Have
you beard any complaint about it at ail? I
have not. In Great Britain, the land, recognized throughout the world as the very heart
of freedoni, the people have accepted alI-out
conscription, and not a murmur against it bas

ever reached here. I arn saying this simýply
for the purposge of illustrating that necessity
bas driven the British people to that point,Hon. Mr. KING: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: -and we b<'rç in
Canada, in a sense-I do flot wish to use a
harsb term--quibble oveT wbether or not we
have reached the point where we have to
decide to send another 16,000 men overseas.
Hon. A. L. BEAIJBIEN: Will the honourible gentleman tell me wby conscription was
flot applied to Northern Ireland?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: For the very simple
reason given by Mr. Churchill in the British
Bouse of Commons. He was asked, just as
my honourable friend bas asked me, why
conscription was not applied there. H1e said
he would consider the matter and let bis
questioner have a reply. Later he stated that,
having looked into the question, in bis judgment the application of conscription to Northern Ireland might do more harm than good.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That does flot
mean anytbing.
Hon. Mr. KING: Just reasoning.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, it is common
sense.
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes, common sense.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: There is a great
difference betweon war as waged to-day and
in the last century. Then troups were few
and mostly mercenaries. Under existing conditions, when a nation declares war there are
in my judgment only two ways in which that
war can bo carried on: either sufficient volunteers must be enlisted or conscription must be
applied. Northern Ireland must be one of
the Commonwealth nationsHon. Mr. KING: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It is actual!y part of
Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. KING: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Thoen Great Britain
had authority to put conscription into force,
but evidently there were reasons which made
it desirable not to do so. What those reasons
wvore I do flot know.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Because opinion
is divided in Northern Iroland as it is bore.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Consider what the
situiation mighit be bore. Suppose the people
of my province of Saskatchewan were, in
arc not going to submit
effct, to say, 'Nwe
to the conscription Iaw passcd by the Parliamcnt of Canada, we don't like conscription,
we don't favour it at ail," and that opinion
flon. -. CALDER.
%r.

was made vocal tbroughout this country, I
wonder whether they would have tbe right,
either morally or legally, to resist the enforcement of that law? That may have been
exactly the position in Northern Ireland.
For particular reasons, not known to me, the
Government decided flot to apply conscription.
That is their business.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That is tbe British
Government.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: It must have been
the British Government.
I arn much longer on my feet than I
expected to be, and if no one objects, I would
move that the debate be adjourned now so
that I may continue to-morrew.

POLICY OF THE GOVERNMENT

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned dehate on the policy of the Government with respect to overseas reinforcements.

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable senators,
wben I adjourned the debate yesterday afternoon I was, if I remember correctly, having
a discussion witb an honourable gentleman on
the other sideHon. Mr. MURDOCK: The
senater from St. Jean Baptiste
Beaubien).

honourable
(Hon. ;Mr.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: -with regard to the
Irish prohlem. I was cither trying to reply
or had completed a rely to a question that
be bad put te me. There appeared to ho, so
far as I ceuld hear, seme question as to
whether my answer was of any value or niot. 1
do net know. 1 arn not familiar witb the facts.
But last evening I bad an eppertunity of
meeting an Irisbman, a real Jrisbmnan from the
north of Ireland, an elderly gentleman, but
still with ail bis intellect, and 1 put the ques-

DECEMBER 5, 1944
tion to him. I asked him: "Wby in the world
haven't you got conscription in Northern Ireland?
They have it throughout Great
Britain." Do you know what hie reply was?
He said: "We wont have it. Do you think
we are going to allow those Scotch people
and those English people and those Welsh
people to force us to do wbat we don't want
to do? They can't do that, and they daren't
do it. If tbey try to, do it, we will fight."
This Irish gentleman went on to say: "We
don't need any conscription. We have no
men Ileft to be conscripted, because ail our
men are in the fighting forces now, and have
been there for a long time. They have been
fighting in Singapore, Malaya, North Africa,
Sicily, Italy, ail over the desert and everywhere else. Some of t-hese men are desert
rats. So we don't need conscription, and we
won't have it." Now, whetber he is right or
wrong, I do not know. If my honourable
friend fromn St. Jean Baptiste bas any doubt
about it, there is another Irishman sitting
somnewhere on the other sideHon. Mr. MOLLOY: Right here.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I say to my honourable friend from St. Jean Baptiste: .Asic him
wbat is the position in Northern Ireland, and
why it is that way. He wiil give you a ver
much better answer than I can, for I do not
know the facts.
I wish fromn now on to dcalHon. Mr. MOLLOY: Wiil the honourable
gentleman permit me?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: I might say that
there was no conscription in Soutbern Ireiand
either, and about 200,000 men from there
have enlisted in the British Army.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: The answer Mr.
Churchill made when he was asked about
conscription in Northern Ireland was that if
conscription were applied it would do more
harmn than good.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. Notice Mr.
Cburchill's words, "It would do more barm
than good" to put conscription into force in
Northern Ireland. If the gentleman to whom
I have referred was correct in bis statement,
tbe great bulk of the men who would have
been taken by conscription bad aiready gone
into the British Army.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Would not that
apply aiso to England and Scotland, before
conscription was put into effect?

523

Hon. Mr. CALDER: No. Conscription went
into effect in Great Britain the day war was
declared.
An Hon. SENATOR: Before.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, not before the
war started. The iaw was enacted before the
war started, but it was not put into effect
then; that is my understanding.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is right.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I propose to get; a
lit tie dloser to the question now actualiy at
issue bere on Parliament Hill. Before doing
so I mnust make reference to the declaration
of war by Parliament some time eariy in
September, 1939. AIl members of Parliament
were present; they were here, in both Houses
of Parliament, from every province of Canada.
Every man knew why he was bere. If my
recoliection is correct, every member of Parliament joined in that declaration of war.
We must assume that they knew exactly wbat
tbey were doing and ail that war meant. Yet
every member in that Parliament-the last
Parliament, not this one-joined in tbe declaration of war. Every senator here knows
exactly wby we went into the war. No honourable member regrets that we went into it;
I arn quite confident of that. We were fighting for a real, definite, well-understood purpose. I ask you, bonourabie gentlemen, "Is
that not correct?" I am sure your answer
wili be, "Yes, it is correct." When we j oined
in making that deciaration at that time we
knew exactiy wbat we were going to figbt
for, and not one single member of that Parliament, eitber here or in the Commons, made
any suggestion as to the extent of our war
effort, tbe manner in which the war shouId be
conducted, the forces to be used, bow they
shouId be raised, or anything of that sortflot one singie member of Parliament at tbat
time did anytbing in order to modify or
change or restriet the Oovernment in the
slightest degree. In other words, at that time
the Government were given power-not in the
declaration itself, I suppose, but probabiy by
the introduction of the War Measures Actto wage war relentlessiy against the enemy.
I think you wilI agree with that. Tbey were
given power, without restriction of any kind,
to do just what I bave said. I think necessarily so; and personally I approve entirely
of what Parliament did at that time.
Well witb wbat result? Parliament adjourned,
and the members of the Government got busy.
They had to get busyr: it was war. Tbey got
busy with their plans--I arn speaking now
only of the war effort of the Governmentand their miiitary officers everywhere got

Britain and in the other Commonwealth
nations . Ail were busy making plans. The
Gox crnment bore eonsidered what they had to

dorie but they did not makze those plans ail
by îlïemrselves. They got into conference with
Ilbcir allies cither bore or in London or in
Paris er somnew bore else. and they sat around
a table. Tbey z-aid. "Now, we must do this
and wve must do that ;" nnd 'Should we do

tlian we are ablo te, do.
lion. Mr. CALDER: Wel. I aceept the
Stafement, and 1 apologize sincerely to the
bonoorable gentleman if I have taken a, wrong
impres-.,ýion from what he said. But what ho
says now has exactly the same implication.
What ho says, in offect, is that in view of
existing conditions in Canada-I presumne that
relates to the question of population-there is
just a possibility that undor the arrangement
we moade too many mon were taken intio the
forces.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Does my honourable
friend not admit that there mighit ho a limitatien f0 wbat we oaa do? There must ho somo
limai tation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The answer te that
will ho found on yesterday's record.
\Ve
sbhould aslî ourselvos what the people of
Great Britain clid, and what they are doing
now. Tliero is no comparison at ail between
wbiat we are doing and what they have donc,
and ai-e stili doing to-day. At any rate. the
Goveroment, alono had the d-uty of deciding
w-bat the size of our fore.s should ho, and
tho Goverroment did decide. The docision
was not mado by membors of this House or
of tHe other House. Did any member ever

DECEMBER 5, 1944
move a motion to the effect that the forces
should be reduced? There was plenty of
opportunity to do so in the other House, when
money was being voted to cover the cost of
the armed services, but there is no evidence
to show that any honourable member of that
House ever presented a motion to reduce the
commitments that had been made. Is that
correct? I think we should leave that question just where it is. We made the commitments, rightly or wrongly, and my view is
that we must stand by them.
There can be only two reasons why our
commitments ought to be modified, and if
these do not exist, our commitments should
remain as they are. One reason would be
necessity, real necessity. Let me give an
exaggerated example of what I mean. Suppose that to-morrow the Canadian forces in
Italy were surrounded and unable to get
further supplies of food and ammunition. In
consequence they would be taken as prisoners,
and would be lost to us. Suppose that three
days afterwards the same thing happened to
our forces in France-I am not basing this
entirely on imagination, for that kind of thing
can happen and does happen in war-well,
inside of a week or two we might lose our
whole Canadian army. Then our commitments would have disappeared completely.
That is exactly what happened to the French
armies. France fell because she lost a million
and a half soldiers within a month or two.
Of course, in those circumstances any commitments that France had made became
absolutely void.
The other possible reason for reduction
would be an agreement reached in conference.
Has anyone heard of our Ministers of the
Crown or any of our military officers taking
part in a conference of that kind? I have not.
So far as I know, there has been no conference
with any one of our allies with the view of
reducing our commitment for the infantry.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: If the honourable
gentlemanHon. Mr. CALDER: Will my honourable
friend pardon me just a moment, until I
finish this part of my argument. Then he
may ask me a question, if I do not deal with
his point in the meantime. Yesterday the
honourable gentleman said that Australia had
withdrawn men from her army. But that
change in Australia's commitments was made
as a result of conference and agreement-and
for a good reason, of which we all know. I
listen for hour after hour to the radio every
day-that is about all I have to do-and I
have good ears and a fairly good memory. I
recall the day I first heard that Australia
was taking steps to reduce her commitments.
Australia did not do that by herself; she did

it after a conference, and because it would
be to the advantage of the United States
military forces. The United States had a real
war on in the Pacifie, and in 'carrying on that
war was faced with a tremendous task. I do
not know the exact distance, but I assume that
Australia must be somewhere between six and
ten thousand miles from the United States.
That is a long distance to transport supplies
of any kind. But the American government
did not ask Australia to supply guns, tanks
and that kind of thing. No. The United
States wanted to send men to Australia in
large numbers and was trying to avoid the
necessity of shipping them all their food supplies as well. So the government of the
United States said to Australia: "You produce
the food that we need and we will be able
to send more men for our armed forces."
That matter was considered in conference, and
Australia agreed to meet the wishes of the
American authorities. There was an amicable
understanding as to why Australia's commitments should be reduced.
Now, if' my honourable friend wishes to
ask a question, I shall try to answer.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I am grateful to the
honourable senator for a brief opportunity
to correct what appears to be misconception
by him of what I said last night. I expressly
said that I understood there were objections
to the reduction of our commitments, and
then I went on to say that, having regard to
the existing emergency and the things that it
appears to be teaohing us, there might be very
good grounds, without reducing our commitments, to rearrange them. That was all I
suggested.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I did not get that impression. I may have been wrong.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I am sorry, but that is
what I expressly said. I in no way implied
that there should be any weakening of our
will to do our utmost. I simply said we must
recognize that there are some limitations
upon our capacity, and that probably we
should consider rearranging our commitments,
not reducing them.
Hon. Mr. CAILDER: But that cannot be
done by us alone; it must be donc in conference with our allies. I had conceived of
implications which the honourable gentleman,
from what he said, apparently thinks do not
exist. I apologize to him, and he has apologized
to me, so I think we might drop the matter.
I have been dealing with the question of
commitments of the Government, and I think
I have finished all I desire to say in that
regard.

SENATE
I come now to the real issue in this discussion, both in this House and in the otherthe question of the voluntary system versus
conscription. I think I can base my argument
on this illustration, for we must get at the
fundamentals. I will take my own province.
Let us assume that we go to Saskatchewan, or
any other province, and pick up, say, a
thousand young men, reasonably fit mentally
and physically. I can explain it much better
if I am the actor. These men are here a
thousand strong. They are not called up, I
have simply picked them out to ascertain
something. In the first place, I have them
graded. There are three elements-age, running, say, from twenty-one to twenty-six years,
physique, and mentality. I have them ail
examined and put then in line, graduated
from the highest standard to the lowest. I
say to these thousand men, "There is a war on.
How many of you right now are ready to
volunteer to join the army?" Those who
are ready now hold up their hands. There are
variations in the mentality, outlook, physique
and everything else of those men, and when
they hold, up their hands, here and there
along the line, they do so not according to
their real qualifications. I say to those men
who have raised their hands, "Please take two
steps to the rear," and they stand back. There
you have your volunteers. They are ready
to go now. In this country and in every other
country in the world where the voluntary
system prevails there are men who are ready.
The volunteer is waiting to go. He is young
and has an urge to go; he wants to get into
action; he wants to see the world. There
are a thousand reasons why he takes that
stand. Patriotism is almost certain to be
among them. That type of young man will
be found in every part of the world. I think
you will accept that statement as a fact.
Out of that line we find, say, two hundred
and fifty who are willing and ready to go
at once, and they stand back in line ail by
themselves. Then I say to the other young
men, "Now, are there any of you who would
like to volunteer now, but who are not ready
just at this moment to go? If so, hold up
your hands?" Again you have got the same
sort of pattern. There are men in every
part of that line who are willing to go, but
conditions vary-some come from farms, others
from factories or stores, some of them may be
in business, and they simply cannot volunteer
at the time. They have to make their arrangements before they can leave home. One of
the young men may be just married and building a house. Yes, be would like to go, but he
has got to complete that bouse for his wife
and family. However, the question is asked,
- Hon. Mr. CALDER.

the hands are held up, and these men are
put back in another line. There you have
two lines, one of volunteers who can go immediately, and the other of men who are
willing to go but whose conditione are such
that it is quite impossible for them to go for
some time. Then we have a remnant. I do
not need to ask what it is. They are men
who do not want to go now, they do not
want to go in a short time, they do not
want to go at ail. That condition exists in
every group that may be taken from every
province of Canada. Exactly the same conditions exist in every line of a thousand men
that you might take indiscriminately, not for
military purposes, but merely to ascertain
those facts. Am I correct? I think I am.
All right. In due course of time the first
two lines of volunteers go to war, and the
remnant remains. It is in that remnant that
the voluntary system fails-not completely,
because some of those men eventually go,
and I think I can tell you why. Let me give
you one or two illustrations. In a little
hamlet, say twenty miles from Ottawa, there
are ten boys. Of those ten there are four
who will not volunteer. They are left in the
remnant. One of those boys is in a blacksmith shop, another is on a farm, the other
two are d'oing practically nothing. But no
matter what their occupation, they come in
contact with their home people, and one day,
let us assume, a somewhat elderly man runs
across one of those boys. "Hello, Don." lie
says. "Where is Dick? I haven't seen him
for quite a long time." The boy tells him
Di.ck is in the army. The old man does not
need to say anything to that boy, not a word.
That happens again and again in the home
community. Everybody there is interested
in the local boys. After a while some of the
boys who have gone into the army corne back
in uniform, and everybody in town is proud
of them, and everybody greets them. If those
boys corne home by train, the people are ail
at the station to greet them-all but those
two or three boys who are in the remnant.
They are not in the welcoming crowd at ail:
thev stand aloof. Now, do you imagine that any
one of those boys is not thinking, thinking,
thinking ahl the time? He certainly is. He
realizes the position he bas placed himself in.
And I suppose the most powerful influence
that is bro.ught to bear upon such a lad is the
girls. As he walks down the street he meets
one of the girls that he went to school with
and bas known for years. He says, "Good
morning, Annie," and Annie replies, "Good
morning," but she does not stop to talk to
him, she just passes him by.
It happens
in every community. In other words, there
is a home influence brought to bear upon the

DECEMBER 5, 1944
lad who is nlot wiiling to volunteer, and as a
resuit of that home influence some of that
remnant flnaily enlist.
But there îs stili a reninant, and here in
Canada of late it is iargely that remnant that
our military forces have been trying to, secure.
It is a terrifie job, -and it can only be done by
bringing pressure to bear on those boys. I
ar n ot saying that this lias been done, but
I say those lads can be secured only by sorne
sort of actual pressure. If that pressure is of
a certain cbaracter-I am n ot saying it is-it is absolute torture for those lads, and in
my judgment shiouid neyer be exereised. We
mu&st aiways remember that under the pureiy
volunteer systern every young man bas a
perfect rigbt to hold whatever view he bas,
and if we are using a voluntary system, no
one lias a right to apply compulsion of any
sort. Freedom of conscience, freedon of
thouglit, is what we are fighting for, and no
one bas the right to point bis linger at a boy
who, takes the stand I have referred to. Under
our law be is free to hold, any opinion lie likes
on that question, and I say again, that any
person wbo applies any kind of pressure is
doing wbat is absolutely wro'ng. I arn sure
we are ail eonvinced of the truth of tbat
statement. But as a consequence of that
situation, if at some stage the need for men
becomes acute, your voluntary systern is not
worth anything. It is ended. That is where
we are to-day.
The Qoverument bave
aiccepted tbat position aind indicated tbat tbey
crannot hope for a great deal from tbat system.
But tbere is anotber feature of tbe situation tbat I do not like; not that I arn opposed
to it in itself but because of what I may cal!
the apparent resuits therefrom. We bave a
home defence army, and 18»00 men from, that
arrny bave been moade available for overseas
service.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 16,000.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, 16,000. Now, I
ask lionourable members to tbink of wbat I
arn saying. On the 23rd of November it was
announced that these men would be sent to
Europe. The Government bas said tbat 5,000
wiIl go in December, 5,000 in January, and
s0 on. Tbat decision lias been made and is
now law. Every one of tbose 16,000 men is
available to go overseas. Yet tbe military
autborities are striving to get volunteers frorn
among these very men wbo, under tbe present
law, must go overseas. Every day I read in
tbe papers or bear over the radio about the
wonderful success of tbe efforts to obtain
g volunteers from among these men. Arn I
over-stating Lt?
I wonder if the men who now volunteer
from tbis -home defence force wili eventually

be listed with the reai volunteers. None of
tbese 16,000 men can now be 'volunteers, for
tbey know tbey bave to go, and tbey sbould
not be classed as volunteers. In my judgment, ail tbis effort to get as many as possible cf themn te volunteer sliould cease.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Would you
separate thern from tbe otbers on tbe fighting
front?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not at ail. Tbey
should go rigbt in arnong the men already
there, who are wanting reinforcements and
will welcorne tbem. Men wlio have been
figbting day after day and week after week
in rnud and slusb, as sorne of our overseas
troops have been doing, sbould be able to get
a littie rest occasionally, but it is impossible
for tbem to get it wben tbeir units are flot
up to strength.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Wby try to make
a point by saying tbat the men who are going
over now wiIl be different from those who
volunteered before tbe order for compulsion
%vas passed?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Tbe men wbo are
going now are not volunteers; tbey are ail
required to go.
Hlon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Wben tbey get
to tbe front tbey will ail be on the same
footing.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I do not understand
tbe honourable gentlemnan's argument.
Hoin. A. L. BEAUBIEN: My honourabie
friend dlaims there wiil be a difference
between tbe men wlio are sent over now and
the volunteers.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I hoped thai I liad
made myself clear, but I qhall have to try
again. On the 23rd of November the Government passed an Order in Council making
16,000 men in our borne defence army hiable
for service overseas.
Now, among tbose
16,000 men are sorne wbo reason in this way:
"Oh, under these circurnstances, I may as
well volunteer."
Hon. Mr. KING: A man would feel better
if be said tbat, wouldn't lie?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, nlot one bit
better. The Government lias passed an Order
in Council requiring hirn to go, wlietber lie
volunteers or not. You would expect tbese
men to say to tbernselves: "This asking us
to volunteer is pure nonsense. We ail bave
got to go Sflyway, s0 why in the world sliould
we volunteer?" My point is tbat these men
cannot be volunteers, in the sense that men
who went over previously were volunteers.
Hon. Mr. KING: That is ail riglit.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is the wbole

that these mon wvill be shown as volunteers

To that degree 1 would continue the voluntary

Any
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Quito right.
home defence troops who are not among the
16,000 have a perfect right to bo real
volunteers.
Now I should like te express my opinion
on some points in confection with conscription. The subjeot is nlot an easy one to deal
with. Every governmont in the world bias its
own ideas witli regard te this metbod of securing the necessary forces to wage war, and
goos about it in its own way. I suppose
thiere are scarcely two countries that enforce
conscription on exactly the saine basis. Lot
me rofer to a few countries by way of example.
First I will take France, which long ago
learned of the necd for conscription. If I arn
not mistaken, France had military conscription in 1870, during the war with Germany.
Hon. Mr. RING: That is right; and also
diuring the Napoleonie wars.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I know that in the
war of 1870 she mobilized hier forces over nighit.
Nýow, wby did France have a compulsory systom? I suspect it tvas because of the noed te
bco always ready to dcfend herseif. On evory
one of lier borders she had an enemy or a
potential enemy who might strike at nny
minute, and she bad to be prepared.
Do
hionourablo members think that the people of
France like conscription? Not at ail. Do you
think people anywhere in the world like conscription? Not at ail. Everybody bates conscription, definitely bates it, yet nation after
nation ahl over the world bias been compelied
to adopt it on grounds of necessity.
Let us look at the UJnited States. That country bias net had in the past the samne need that
France bias bad for conscription, but to-day
full conscription is in effect there. If my
rocollection is correct, the United States bias
ttvice in its bistory adopted tbe principle as
a national policy, that when war came the
mon requircd to serve at the front sbould be
gatbered together under a system of conscription in ordor that any man who was drafted
would share in the burdens of war. The basis
of the systema is equality of service and sacri-

DECEMBER 5, 1944
fice. In my judgment the Government of the
United States acted wisely, because conscription avoids everything of the nature of what
has taken place here in Canada.
I come now to Great Britain. When did
Great Biitain adopt conscription? Can anybody tell me?
Hon. Mr. KING: 1916.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1916.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In 1916, during the
throes of the last war. In other words, Great
Britain all through the centuries in all her
wars never had conscription, simply because
in later years most of those wars were conducted on a purely voluntary basis, and prior
to that on a voluntary and mercenary basis
-that is, the troops were gathered from every
part of the world, and as long as they were
willing to fight, Great Britain was willing to
pay them for their services. But eventually
Britain was compelled to adopt a policy of
conscription in order to obtain the forces
required to carry on the last Great War,
and she adopted it in 1916; not until then.
You must bear in mind what I have already
said: no people in the world would be opposed
to conscription as strongly as the people of
Great Britain were. If there is one libertyloving nation in the world it is Great Britain.
She has been and is the bulwark of liberty
throughout the world. Yet Great Britain was
eventually forced by necessity, in the interest
of the state, to adopt a conscription policy.
Then in 1917 conscription came in Canada.
I need not dwell upon that. We know what
the situation was, and what was done. Again
it was a case of necessity. We had tried the
voluntary system and it had failed, just as
this Government has found it to fail in this
wat. Its failure was inevitable, for the reasons
I have stated in explaining the voluntary
system to you. As I say, it is unnecessary
for me to dwell upon what happened then
and afterwards.
Now we are in exactly the same situation
right at this minute-with this difference, that
the necessity arises not now, nor did it arise a
few months ago when Colonel Ralston went
to Europe, it arose two years before that.
Do you agree with me? You must. The
necessity arose two years ago, and while we
had little differences, you might almost say
major differences at that time, there was no
crisis. Why? Because the character cf te
conscription adopted at that time was not the
character of the conscription proposed now.
Hon. Mr. KING: It was of a character
and kind to meet the situation then existing.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Exactly, I will go
further, I will say to meet a situation that
106-35

nfu

529

necessarily existed. Now let me point out the
difference, and it will take me only a minute.
What was the situation of the war at the end
of 1941? I have already told you what had
happened in Europe, and I have told you
about the U-boat menace. What was the
condition in Canada as a result of all those
events? The people of Canada from coast
to coast had a fear in their hearts. Otherwise, do you think we would ever have had
observers stationed on our coasts, or ahl the
talk about getting sirens to blow warnings,
or the trips that our wives and families were
making to get material for a blackout? There
was in this country actual fear of an invasion,
fear that U-boats or aircraft carriers would
appear off our Atlantic coast and launch planes
that would drop bombs on Ottawa, Montreal,
or other parts of the Dominion. When the
Japanese came into the war there was the
same fear on the Pacifie coast. Is not that
true? You know perfectly well it is true.
There was actual widespread fear of an attack
by the enemy.
As a consequence of that we found ourselves here in Canada without any defending
force at all. All our men who had volunteered
were gone overseas, and we had no troops
with which to protect ourselves. Thereupon
the Government realized the necessity of
bringing into being a home defence .Jorce.
That force was created, not on a voluntary
basis but under a conscription law enacted by
the Parliament of Canada. Under this law
some thousands upon thousands of men from
all parts of Canada were compelled to join
this force. Since then we have had extensions
of that enactment, and the other 'day it was
made applicable to the war theatre in Europe.
I do not blame the Government for that
policy, not in the slightest degree. On the
contrary I agree that the Government did the
only thing they could do in those circumstances. We had reached the stage where a
home defence force had to be created, and
there was at that time only one way in whieh
it could be created-by conscription. That is
why Mr. Cardin, the minister, resigned. He
was opposed to conscription.
Now let me deal very briefly with the situation which exists right at this moment. So
far as providing reinforcements for our infantry
commitments overseas is concerned, there is
no doubt as to what will be done. We still
have to await the voting in the House of
Commons, but in view of all that has happened here during the past week or ten days,
I think there can be no doubt as to the result.
Those reinforcemente will go forward. The
Government's decision- and undertaking in
that respect will be carried out.
=TON

SENATE
What has happened in this country was
bound to happen at some stage of the war.
I think the most unfortunate feature of the
whole situation is that to some extent an
agitation has grown up and, in addition,
there is a split in the unity of Canada.
In my opinion our French-Canadian friends
are liable not to see the whole situation exactly as it is. This conscription trouble is not
confined to Quebec, it exists in every part of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. KING:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
In every part of
Canada there are people opposed to conscription. The number may vary from province to province, but that feeling exists
everywhere. The same remark applies to the
creation of an army composed of volunteers;
there is a similar difference of opinion. Down
in the province of Quebec thousands upon
thousands of young French Canadians have
joined our forces, and fought with marvellous
courage. I believe that if our friends in
Quebec would look upon conscription as a
national rather than a purely local issue,
the degree of opposition to its application in
any province would make very little difference.
I do hope that the conduct of affairs in this
country during this crisis, and hereafter, will
as far as possible tend to close the rift, and
that everybody will try to avoid doing or
saying anything that may promote national
disunity.
I have finished. I fear I have talked too
long, but I hope I have said something that
may be of some use to somebody somewhere.
I thank you very much.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: Honourable
senators, this debate originates under a practice recently established in this House. There
being no question before us, and apparently
no limitation whatever upon what any senator may say, as to being in order, most honourable members who have taken part in this
discussion have prefaced their remarks with
the suggestion that what they are about to
discuss is the only important matter. Perhaps
we may all have the same view of the subject.
However, I should like to discuss some matters
which have not yet received consideration, at
any rate full consideration, and to wander
about from point to point.
In the first place, I should like to say that
the turn which the war has taken meets with
my entire approval. The determination of
the Germans to defend their country city by
city and town by town is just right. It will
enable our armies to destroy the towns and
cities as they advance. and bring home to the
people of Germany what war means to the
Hon. Mr. CALDLl.

people of other countries. It will do more
than anything I know of towards educating
these people, pending the arrival of the Russians, who of course should make a very complete job of it. I have long feared that while
soldiers might win the war the politicians
might lose it, but I think that under conditions now prevailing or about to prevail the
soldiers will win such a thorough victory that
the politicians will have little or nothing
to do.
I should like to say a few words about conscription, of which much has already been said
in this debate. I have never heard a reasoned,
logical objection to conscription. I was not
a member of the other Chamber in the last
war, and I was not in this House when the
subject was under discussion in this war, so
I missed the points that were made against
conscription on those occasions. I repeat that
I have never heard a reasoned, logical argument against it from anybody. The general
proposition is that conscription is democratic,
fair and effective, and I do not know anyone
who has met that assertion.
I want to say a few words about the history
of conscription. In Canada there was conscription under the old French regime. Men
could be called out not only for purposes of
war, but also for labour.
When General
Murray was making out the terms of the
capitulation of Montreal, if he had said the
old conscription law would be continued there
would have been no objection to it and it
would have remained in force to this day.
Prior to Confederation there was conscription
in Nova Scotia, which had about 100,000 men
under arms. Under the old Militia Act, which
is still in force, Canada may compulsorily
require military service of all men between
the ages of 16 and 60. During the Fenian
Raids men were catled out under that Act. In
the old days Great Britain had compulsory
service for the Navy, and everyone is familiar
with stories of the press gang; and there was
also compulsory service in the militia, from
which for many years men could be compelled
to transfer. Great Britain finally dealt with
the matter in a formal, legislative way in
1916 or thereabouts, when she introduced
conscription for the purpose of maintaining
her armies in the field.
The story in the United States is interesting
because in many respects, apart from their
greater population and wealth, the people of
that country are very much like ourselves.
Conscription appears to have come into effect
for the first time there in 1864, towards the end
of the Civil War, when it was obvious to
everyone that many able-bodied young men
who should have been at the front were staying

DECEMBER 5, 1944
at home. So the American government introduced what was called the Draft Act, under
whicb men could be compuisorily taken into
the army; but at the saine tume it enaeted a
provision that d.rafted, men might hire other
mnen to substitute for them in the .army. I
tbink it is a matter of record that many stout
Canadians went over to the United States, sold
theniselves as altern.Ves, or whatever you may
cail tbem, then deserted and came back to
Canada with the money. In fact, some of my
relatives probably joined the American army,
and af terwards bolted back Vo Canada with the
bounty. The American authorities did not
know just wbere they went to once tbey bad
crossed the -border. In fact, some of theni
came te Hawkesbury -and tbat neighbourhood,
where they spent 'their rnoney.
The United States entered the last war in
1W1, and although for a while there was some
volonteer enlistment, conscription was adopted
almost immediately. Then, saine time between
the end of the last war and. the beginning of
this war, prob-ably about 1924 or 1930, the
United States General Staff submitted to Congress a memorandumý whicb provided for the
raising cf an army of ten million men in the
next war by conscription. That memorandum
was accepted by Congress and thereupon became part of the organic law of the country.
Consequently, wbhen this war broke out, there
immediately went into effect a national selecive system, under which. men were called,
examîned and taken into, the service. So far as
one can learn from reading American newspaplers, there bas been no complaint whatever
about tbla metbod of raising an army. In the
army there are many men who no doubt would
like to be at home, many wbo, feel that their
business and private affaira have been seriously
interfèred witb, but in general the system bas
worked weli -and I have not heard of any untoward events. In the last war the United
States bad diisciplinary battalions, and some
ehooting and killing bacl Vo be resorted te to
enforce disoipline, but, se far as I can learn,
the present system bas been operating
emoothly, and tbere can be no doubt about
the willingness of American troops to figbt to
the finish..
After you examine the story of conscription
in Great Britain, tbe United States and Canada, one faet emerges, namely, that under the
voluntary system the creamn of our young men
go to the war firs9t, and what la lef t -at tbe end
is the iitary dregs of the population. Never
forget that the creamn cf Canada's youth bas
been and is now overseas, and that what we
are deai-ing with bere is the military dregs.
It is truc, as was pointed out by tbe bonourable gentleman who preceded me. (Hon. Mr.
10"-51

531

Calder), that every year among the men who
reach military age there are a number of the
right sort in birth and breed-ing, who immediately go active or volunteer for active service before tbey -are calledl out. I do not
include these young men in the terni "military
drtegs." They are naturai-born warri-ors, intent
on getting to the war es soon, as they can.
Some people, who do nlot know the facts, may
think that these young men who volunteer i
this way are of the samne stripe as those who
have been conscripted. Tbey -are not. Tbey
are part -of the cream of the population who

army. I know wbat I arn talking about, because for quite a few months I held an important job in the military service of this
country, and I met the various types of young
men.
What appears from a study of the subject
is that conscription is nlot necessarily a war
policy. It mîght more properly be described
as a peace policy. At best it ia a policy for
the raining of young men in time of peace,
so that when war cornes these young men may
be required to serve in the armed forces of the
country. Wbere that poiicy bas been adopted
in peace, before war breaks out, a it was in
the United States, it bas worked smoothly,
but in every instance where compulsion bas
been postponed tili near the end of the war,
and it becomes necessary to deal with the
country's military dregs, as I have described
tbem, there is trouble. As I have pointed out,
trouble was caused this way in the American
Civil War, and bonourable senators are aware
of the trouble we had here ini the last war.
Ail such difficulties could be avoided by the
adoption of compulsory military service in
time of peace, as the system. would be well
in operation wben war broke out.
There was some discussion of a proposai that
because of the shortage of men our establishments xnight be reduced. It has been suggested that in making our commitments someone failed to calculate properiy. Well, if al
the provinces had made a proportionate
contribution of manpower to the army, there
would have been no shortage of men. That

The situation is rather confused by the possibifity of a shortage of reinforeements

Europe to diseuse the matter wjth the officers
commanding units at the front in order to

story they had told bim, whieh was the story
already in the possession of our people. One
young man I know, who is in command of a
battalion overseas, wrote to bis father nearly
three months ago pointing out that bis battalion bad shrunk from four companies to
three,. and the companies instead of 'being
110 strong were down to 50 men. That je a
very eerious state of affaire, because the
shortage would run tbrough the technical sections in the came proportion. The public

left him ignorant of the actual conditions, and

Hon. Mr. KING: I tbink my bonourable

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: From the beginning my information bas been better than the

Hon. Mr. RING: You read letters.

and there is to-day.
Hon. Mr. RING: That was not Colonel
Ralston's report to the Goverament when be

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I know that. I

I say I find it more reliable than the Government's information.

Hon. Mr. KING: I would flot say that.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do say it. I
say the Minister was misledHon. Mr. KING: I amn sorry to hear you
say that.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: -by his officers,
who did not give the facts, and this accounts
for the Prime Minister saying, "I was taken
by surprise." The information contained in
lettere fromn the soldiers overseas to their
relatives at home is more reliable than the
officiai information. Those men are right on
the grou-nd, they are holding the front. That
matter of misinformation should be looked
into.
The decision arrived at and embodied in the
Order in Couneil is to dispatch 16,000
N.R.M.A. men as overseas reinforcernents.
I have already said that there is now and
has been for sorne time a shortage of reinforcemnents, and therefore these 16,000 men
should be dispatched immedia.tely. But knowing those men as well as I do, I express the
feare of many other officers whn also know
them well, that if you give tbem embarkation
leave you wili cee scarcely any of tbem again.
Indeed, it is just on the carde that three
months hence the Government wili meet
Parlianient and say, "Well, we ordered these
men 'to be dispatcbed; but they have not
gone; they are -not under control." When a
body of young men march down the streets,
destroy the Union Jack and make speeches
against the Government, that is ta political
demonstration and the Government must
deal with it politicaliy. But when you have
men in uniform carrying arms, marching
through the streets of any town and defying
the Government, that is mutiny. I notice
the papers have shied away fro.m the use of
that word. But such conduct is mutiny, and
it means that the men are flot under control.
Any Government that abdicates ite responsibility and its duty to maiintain discipline in
the armed forces in time of war is in a bad
way. These men have got to be deait with.
As I say, if you give them embarkation leave
you will neyer see tbem again; as tbey go
through Eastern Canada they will ail disappear into the bush. It is quite on the cards
that these 16,000 draftees will neyer reach the
port of embarkation. Some may tell me,
"Oh, that can be arranged and provided
against." It bas not been so far. I can tell
from the wording of the dispatches that the
thing ie bei'ng rigged rigbt now. We are told
already that six battalions stationcd in British
Columbia have Ieft for Quebee. Those men
are going home, and naturally they will give

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: As a matter of
information, niay I ask the bonourable senator
whethrr hie attaches any importance to the
statemnent mrade earlier by the commanding
officr
to the effect that the response of
these men of the Home Defence Army to
comipulsion for rolistinent was simply this:
'Wr are conscripted. Wr are flot enlisting
volnntarily. If the Government want to send
us to another place, let themn send us; we are
willing to go." That was the point of view of
the men, as exprcs-sod by commanding officers
favouring the compulsory sending of N.R.M.A.
men overseas. Evrrything that my bonourable
friend bas said about the attitude of these men
srems to be contrary to the reports made
by commianding officers. I should, like to
k1now what importance he attaches to those
reports.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My mind gors
back to how thry got their information. Was
a meeting held at which there was a show of
liands to a definite proposition? Or did the
officers on the moraing parade question some
of the men tvho said, "If wr are compelîrd to
go wr will go"? How wvas the information
obtainrd? I go to that right away. Somebody
out there said, "If these men arr conscripted
they will go."
All right, how did lie find
that out? Was it by a show of bands fromn
the battalion, something that would bind the
men, or did he brar it from one or two
men? I asIc again, hiow did hc get bis
information?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT:

I do not know.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yon do not know,
and I do not know rither.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Would yon not
assume that the non-commissioned officer
wonld be able to get that information?
lion. Mr. GRIESBACH: His information
is of very littîr value becanse, among other
things, the attitude is s0 unreasonable.
I
cannot sýee how anyhody conld get that information unless he had the whole battalion
on parade and commandrd a show of bands.
There i. somrthing wrong-.
A gond many
fishy stories appear in the paper that, do not
make sense to me.
Hon. Mr. RING:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What is that?
lion. Mr. CALDER: He agrees witb you.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII: That is a very
comfortitig thonght.
The Japanese war is still before us. Our
proximity to the United States and our interrelationship with that country in many

DECEMBER 5, I94
ways, to say nothing of the conversations that

have taken place between the President and
our Prime Minister, necessitate our taking a
real part ia the war against Japan, puiling
no punches, but playing a real part to the
utmnost of our capacity. How are we going
to figlit that war? Are we going to demobilize our army, pay gratuities and so on, and
then re-enlist the men, or are we going ta
compel those who bave served in Europe
to remain in the army and flght in the
Pacifie? What is the plan? There must be
a plan to raise some kind of army. I arn
wondering whether it will be done by compulsion., or by bribery, or how. The public
should be enlightened on that at this time,
1 think.
Our future relations with the United States
are gaing to be on a different basis from
what they have been. President Roosevelt
declared the determination of United States
to corne ta aur rescue if we got into trouble.
There was a double meaniflg in that declaratien. It rneant that we ought not to, get
into trouble, that we must keep an army
capable of defending our frontiers and preventing an enerny from corning dawn upon
the richest part of United States, which
lies irnmediately ta the south of the Ontario
and Quebec frontier. If we fail ta maintain
an adequate military force, our relations with
the United States will not be very cordial. We
should be thinking now of the kind of army
that we are going ta have after the war, in
order ta preserve gond relations with our
neighbour. Shail we have conscription? Or
shaîl we rely on the voluntary systern? The
voluntary system bas broken down in this
country, for reasens which I could discuss if
tirne permitted. Whatever system. we aciapt,
the United States will expect us ta proteet
aur own frontier, and thereby its own.
One thing is quite clear: the United States
will nat consent ta the establishment of a
gingerbread republic on the banks of the St.
Lawrence. We van count on, that. We cannot
count upon the United States interfering in
oui, affaire to a considerable degree, for
mihitary reasons, unless we maintain. wellorganized and well-diseiplined armed farces.
A band-ta-mouth, day-by-day policy is likely
to land us in a good deal of trouble. I should
like ta knaw that somebody is giving some
thougbt ta this question, but I do not see
much evidence af it.
Canada is great in area, and in natural resources,*and as a result of normal development will some day become a great cauntry.
Canada cannat be a bermit nation. As the
years roll by-we shaîl become of more and
more importance in the world. We must
theref are interest ourselves in world affaire.
Our geographical location, amongst ather

5

things, makes us an important nation and
requires that we shall play our part in the
international arena. We cannot afford to be
a mean or a servile people. We cannot aff ord
to corne under the influence of wornanish
hysteria; we have to deal with facts in a
manly fashion. 1 think the Spartan valeur of
aur soldiers gives us some ides, of the kind
of people we ought to be.
We have spent decades in striving for national unity, and this is the stage we have
reached: we of the ma.iority are asked to
forget our Mother Country and to stand aside
while she faces the enemy alone and by her
exertions and example saves civilization. We
are asked to ignore the plain teaching of hietory, namely, that when predatory nations get
on the march they must be met and stopped,
or the whole world will be enslaved. We cannot stand idly by in Canada and say that
what goes on elsewbere bas nothing to do
with us.
Hon. Mr. KING: We have not done that.
Han. Mr. GRIESBACH: No, we have not
done that, and we mnust continue to play our
part. That very fact gives rise to many
problems that will have to be discussed. We
shall have to maintain a substantial air force,
a substantial navy and a substantial army.
1 submit there is no escape from that. I
submit, moreover, that. we sbould be devoting
our attention now to the inauguration of a
system of conscription which we are going to
make effective, for we cannot any longer rely
upon a voluntary system in event of emergency.
In our endeavour to achieve national unity
we have been asked to ignore1 the plain teachings of history, that the wor d is contracting
and that aggressor nations have ta be stopped.
The honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. King) points out that we have nat
stood aloof from world affairs. But we were
asked to restriet our activîties to our own
frontiers.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: By whom were we
asked ta take that attitude?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We were asked
by the C.C.F. party, which said that we
ought to have nothing to do with this war,
beyond sending supplies abroad. And the
view of Quebec, which was expressed in
speeches in this Hause, was that the war is
a British war which bas nothing at ail ta
do with us.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Who said that?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not remember
at present who said it. As a matter of fact,
it was said by a good many people.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Not in this Chamber.

536

SENATE

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I have not the
referenece now, but 1 shall look it up. There
certainly is no doubt that many people expressed that view through newspapere in
Quebec. It was said that this is a British war,
and, it bas nothing to do with us. That is the
price we have been asked to pay for national
unity. Nobody ever asked us what our feelings were, or what we thought about the matter.
We were told that if we wanted national unity
we should have stayed out of -this war; and
that now we are in it, we should do as littie
as possible. Honourable senators, that is too
high a price to, pay for national unity. Somebody should state the truth about this. The
truth is that a majority of people in this
country are fed! up with trying to purchase
national *unnty at a price that is too high.
We will flot pay that price. What we do hope
to have in this country is democratic rule hy
the m-ajority. for a change. We hope that our
public men and leaders will have the intestinal
fortitude to carry out that policy, let the
chips fail where they may.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does any other
honourable senator desire to speak? If nlot,
I will declare the business before the House
concluded.

Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators, 1
arn advised that t.here is no likelihood or expectation that the other Chamber will have

That beinig so, I would remind honourable
senators of a motion that ive passed here on

I will now move the adijournment of the

are subjeet to recali by His Honour the
Speaker at any time.
Hon, C. C. BALLANTYNE: Before the
motion for adjournment is put, 1 wish to thanl,
t.he honourable leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. King) for having the Senate convened on this, occasion. We have not ail seen
eye to eye on the various aspects of the subject
that bas been considered, but during the debate
much valuable information bas been ohtained.
In my opinion, it was well worth while to have
the Sonate meet at the same time as the other
House, and now that our debate is finished, 1
agree with the honourable le-adier that it is
Hon. Mr. LESAGE

well to adjourn. Before concluding, let me
emphasize that these sittings have been valuable and profitable.

THE LATE SENATORS LOGAN AND
GRIESBACH
TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. J. H. KING: Honourable senators,
it is with regret that I have to advise the
Houso that two of our colleagues have recently
doparted fromn this sphere. I refer to the
senator frorn Cumberland, (Hon. Mr. Logan),
who died on the 27th of December, 1944, and
to the senator from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach), who died on the 2lst of January
this year.
Senator Logan was born in the year 1868,
at Truro, in the province of Nova Scotia, and
educatod at the Piotou Academy and Dalhousie
University. Ho entered polities while a very
Young man, and was elected to the House of
Commons in 1896, 1900, 1904, and again in
1921. During the time hie was a member of
that House hie was interested on ail occasions
in matters pertaining to the welfare of the
Maritime Provinces. At the session of 1921
hoe discussed and interested members of the
Government and of the House of Gomamons in
the opportunities for and advantages of greater
trade between Canada and the islands of the
British West Indies. As a consequence he was
asked hy the Government Vo proceed to those
islands and to intimote to the authorities there
that a conference might result in better trade
relations between the Vwo countries, He under-

JANUARY 31, 1945
took the mission and was successful, and at
a conference held in 1925 a trade agreement
was entered into between Canada and the
West Indies. As part of that agreement the
Government of Canada undertook to establluh
a line of steamships between the islands and
ports on the Atlantic coast of Canada; and, as
bonourable members are aware, an excellent
line of steamships known as the "Lady" line,
went into operation and did much to promate trade and to, better Canada-West Indies
relations gen-erally. UnSortunately the war has
disrupted that service, but we can be liopeful
that it will be renewed after the war is over.
In 192 Mr. Logan, as lie then was, became
a director of the Canadian National Railways;
and after serving in that office for a year lie
was summaned ta the Senate.
It is xny desire and, I am sure, the deaire
of ail wha surraund me. ta extend to
Miss Lucy Logan, as well as ta other bis sister,
relatives
and near friends, aur sympathy in their
bereavement.
Senator Griesbacli likewîse had a long
political career. H1e was born at Fort
Qu'Appelle, Saskatcliewan, in 1878. That takes
one back ta the early days in the histary of
Saskatchewan which, like Alberti., was not then
organized as a province, but was part of the
Northwest Territaries. H1e was educated at
St. John's Callege, in Winnipeg, Manitoba,
and was called ta the Bar in 1901. H1e became
interested in municipal politics in the city of
Edmanton, and was elected alderman in 1905
and 1906, and mayor in 1907. He also was a
candidate for a seat in the provincial legislature in 1905 and again in 1913. In 1911 lie
entered the federal field as a candidate in the
canstituency of Edmonton, and in 1917 was
elected ta the Huse of Cammons for West
Edmonton.
Althougi lie gave so much of lis time and
ahility ta politics, lie was primarily a saldier.
As a yaung man lie served in the South African
war. and for bis service in tliat campaign was
decorated witb the Queen's Medal and four
clasps. At tlie outbreak of the Great War,
in 1914, lie volunteered for service and served
tbrougliout tbat conflict. In October, 1915,
lie arrived in France with the 29tli Battalion
witb which lie served until February 12, 1917,
wlien lie was promated ta Brigadier General
in command of tlie First Canadian Infantry
Brigade. For bis services ini the Great War
lie received tlie D.S.O. and Bar, C.M.G. and
Ce, and was six times mentioned in dispatcbes. In 1921 lie was promoted ta tlie rank
of Major General. In tliis war lie served as
Inspector General for Western Canada, a
position from which lie retired in April, 1943.
I am informed that during the last few mantlis

the late senator spent some time in writing a
history of the early days in the great West,
wbicli he so ably represented. The publication of bis book, I understand, bas not yet been
completed. When it is, it sbauld be a work of
great interest.
I am sure that my honourable friends about
me will join with me in expressing deepest
sympatby ta Mrs. Griesbach and other members of the family ini their sad bereavement.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, it is anly a few weeks sinoe this
House adjourned, and in tbat short interval
two of aur members bave passed ta the Great
Beyond. I refer ta Senators Logan and
Griesbacli.
The lionourable leader of the bouse bas
fittingly mentianed thie important raIe that
Senator Logan played in the Parliament of
Canada when lie enjoyed the good bealtb that
was bis for a number of years. Unfortunately,
in later years lie si¶fered from 111liealtb and
tberefore was nat able ta give ta bis duties
eitlier in tliis bouse or in committees that
attention wlicl formerly lie had been in the
habit of giving. Thie lionourable leader spoke
of the great service that was rendered, not
only ta Canada but ta the West In-dies, when
Senator Logan arranged for the conference
out of wlich developed a large and lucrative
trade between tliase two countries. In the
performance of bis full duties in this Cliamber,
and in anotlier place, aur late colleague set
an example tbat it would be welI for the youtli
of this country ta emulate. I join witli my
banourable friend in expressing the syrnpathy
of ahl on this side of thie bouse ta the late
senatar's sister in her bereavement.
Senator Griesb-aci was one of the rnost
colourful personalities of this Cliamber, and
will 'be greatly missed. H1e was fortbriglt and
fearlees in thie expression of bis opinions on
public matters. As a particulairly keen student
af military affairs lie followed in the footsteps
of bis father, wbo commenced inilitary life
in India and, wlien be passed away in, Victoria
some years ago, was a retired superintendent
of the Royal Canadiani Mounted Police. Thie
late senator was active in civie, politicai- and
military affairs, the 'last being not the least
prominent branch ai bis activities. His military views were bighly valued and mucli sought
after. H1e was a veteran of tbree wars, with a
long list of military honours. Vigorous in
appearance and speech, lie delivered, just before the end of aur sittings last December, one
of the most forceful and important speeches on
the war situation. From the time that lie was
summoned ta this Cbamber, Senatar Griesbacli
took an active interest in and was at ail times

SENATE

538

a decisive and intelligent speaker on the legislation coming before us. His work in committees was also of the greatest value.
All on this side of the House join with the
honourable leader of the Government in
expressing to Mrs. Griesbach our deepest
sympathy in ber bereavement.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
having been intimately associated with our
late colleague Senator Griesbach ever since lie
became a member of this House, I should like
te pay a tribute te his memory. He was a man
who made a valuable contribution to both the
of this
public life and the armed forces
country. Although I had known of him by
reputation for many years, my first acquaintance with General Griesbach was during the
last war.
He was a patriotic Canadian and a firm
believer in the maintenance of our partnership within the British Empire. His military
record, which has been referred to by the
honourable leader of the House, was one of
which any man might be preud. His first
venture, while still a very young man, was
to serve with the Canadian Mounted Rifles
in the South African War. Retaining his
interest in military affairs, in 1906 lie took a
commissioned rank in the 19th Alberta
Dragoons. At the outbreak of the Great War,
in 1914, he proceeded overseas as second in
command of that unit, which was the First
Canadian Division Cavalry Squadron. Promoted to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel in
December, 1914, lie came back to Canada to
raise and command the 49th Infantry Battalion, with which, in 1915, lie returned overseas. Later be was promoted to Brigadier
Ceneral, in command of the First Canadian
Infantry Brigade. As the honourable leader
lias stated, our late colleague received many
decorations for his war services and was mentioned in dispatches no fewer than six times.
In September, 1921, lie was raised to the rank
of Major-General in the Canadian Militia.
In the present war General Griesbach again
offered his services to his country, and be was
appointed to an important position; but unfortunately, owing te ill health, lie was later
compelled to retire. He was, as we all know,
a very strict disciplinarian. Nevertheless, lie
always enjoyed the esteem and confidence of
every officer and man who served under him.
This was due to the fact that lie was fearless
and would net order his subordinates to assume
any risk that lie himself was not willing to
take.
The public record of General Griesbach in
the service of his country is, I am sure, well
known to every honourable member of this
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

Chamber. In his demise the Senate of Canada
lias suffered a serious loss. I join with my
colleagues in extending to Mrs. Griesbach our
deepest condolences.
Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, as one of the members of this honourable body from the province of Nova Scotia,
I feel it my duty to rise on this occasion and
say a few words especially with regard to
one of our deceased colleagues. No one will
expect me to say muci about General
Griesbach, for I was only slightly acquainted
with him; but I appreciate the tributes that
have been paid to him as a fighter. Members
of this Chamber, in common with the people
of the country, admire a man who fights.
There is no question that Senator Griesbach
was never afraid to express his opinion. He
was always fearless and said just what he
thought.
My chief object in rising is to say a few
words about the senator from Nova Scotia
who has passed away since we last met here.
I had the honour of knowing Senator Logan
since 1896. That goes back to the first electien in which I cast a vote. Mr. Logan was a
very young man at that time, but he was
virtually the idol of Cumberland county. He
was a lawyer, practising in the town of Amlierst, and be bad a good practice; but when the
call for public service came he, like young
David, took his sling shot and went out and
slew a giant. In other words, lie defeated
one of the Cabinet Ministers of the Government of that day, the Honourable Mr. Dickie.
In 1900 lie ran again, and was re-elected. That
tinme his opponent was Honourable C. H.Caban, who afterwards became Secretary of
State in the Bennett Cabinet. Mr. Logan
was again re-elected in 1904. He was a candidate in 1908 and 1911, but on both occasions
lie was defeated by another gentleman from
Nova Sceotia wbo later on graced the Speaker's
chair in another place ýand, still later, was
summoned to this Chamber. I refer to the
late Senator Rhodes.
In the wartime election of 1917 which, I may
say was a very difficult election for anyone in
Nova Scotia-Mr. Logan was chosen by the
people of Cumberland, but lie was defeated by
the overseas vote. Again his opponent was
the late Senator Rhodes. In 1921 his people
elected Mr. Logan once more, and lie came
back to the other Chamber for another four
vears. Then, in 1929, lie was appointed te this
Chamber, of course for services which lie performed in the interests of the Liberal party in
Nova Scotia.
We in Nova Sceotia, who knew Senator
Logan best, appreciated the fact that he was
a square shooter. In spite of what was said,

JANUARY 31, 1945
he never did anything wrong. The people of
that province, both Conservatives and Liberals,
always respected him during his long public
career, and now that he has gone they respect
his memory.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.
PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
The Honourable Thibaudeau Rinfret, the
Deputy of the Governor General, having come
and being seated at the foot of the Throne,
and the House of Commons having been summoned, and being corne with their Speaker,
the Honourable the Deputy of the Governor
General was pleased to close the Fifth Session
of the Nineteenth Parliament of the Dominion
of Canada with the following speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
The war is now in its sixth year. To-day,
decisive battles are being fought on German
soil. Under sustained pressure the defeat of
Germany is but a matter of time. Present
operations involve bitter fighting and heavy
losses. The last phase of the struggle in Europe
may weld be the most costly of al]. To effect
the utmost saving of human life, every effort
must be put forth to end the war as swiftly as
possible. This clearly remains the supreme
objective.
In the year that has passed since the opening
of the present session, German forces everywhere have been compelled to yield ground.
The whole territory of the Soviet Union has
been liberated. The long awaited offensive in
the West was successfully launched on June
16th. One by one, great European capitals have
been taken back from their conquerors. The
enemy has been almost completely swept out of
France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Poland. The liberation of Holland,
Norway and Czechoslovakia has begun. Germany's satellite states have ail been driven
from her side. Her frontiers have been
breached. Her war industries are being systematically demolished. On the east and the west
and from the south, the Allied forces are
pressing on to the very heart of Germany.
In the struggle against Japan, the long
Chinese resistance bas been maintained. Allied
forces have successfully invaded the Philippines. Significant gains have been made on the
Asiatic mainland. Bombing raids have brought
the war home to the Japanese islands and their
industrial strongholds. On both sides of the
world, the United Nations have gained supremacy at sea and in the air. It is but a matter
of time until the combined power of the Allies
will be concentrated against Japan.
Throughout the year, Canada's navy and air
force continued their vital work In the North
Atlantic. In the landings in Normandy. and in
aIl the campaigns since D-day, the navy and the
air force have supported Canada's army. Our
soldiers have won a foremost place by their
magnificent conduct in battle in Italy, In
France. in Belguim, in Holland, and on the
borders of Germany. Canada's fighting men of

539

aIl the services, wherever they have fought
around the globe, have brought imperishable
honour to our country.
In the campaign in northwest Europe, infantry casualties in ahl Allied armies were
much heavier than had been anticipated. In
order to guard against a possible shortage of
fully trained infantry reinforcements, it became
necessary and advisable to adopt the procedure
outlined in 1942. Reinforcements have been
regularly forthcoming on the extended scale
thereby provided for. To our armed forces,
Canada has given, and will continue to give,
the fullest support in men, munitions and
supplies.
As an integral part of a total national effort,
Canada has continued to provide mutual aid to
our allies. For the joint and effective prosecution of the war, Britain, Russia, France,
Australia, New Zealand, China and India have
been furnished with Canadian war supplies and
foodstuffs.
With your approval, the principle of mutual
aid was extended to include contributions by
Canada to relief and rehabilitation in.liberated
countries. In the period of transition from war
to peace, the provision of international relief
will help to maintaif full employment of Canadian man-power and resources.
As in the previous sessions, your attention
has been directed to the winning of the war as
the first of ail objectives. Next to the winning
of the war, the winning of the peace is the
supreme end to be achieved. My ministers hold
strongly to the view that peace can only be
made lasting through co-operative action on
the part of peace-loving nations. They believe
that the nations now united in the common
purpose of winning the war should seek
unitedly to ensure an enduring peace. To this
end, Canada has sought to make a positive
contribution.
During his visit to Britain in May, my
Prime Minister exchanged views on the subject of a world security organization with the
Prime Ministers of other nations of the British
Commonwealth. Since that time, preliminary
conferences of the greater powers, on the establishment of an international security organization, have been held at Dumbarton Oaks. In
anticipation of a general conference, Canada's
views respecting some aspects of the proposals
of the preliminary conferences have since been
communicated to these powers.
World security is the basis of lasting prosperity and of social security. Prosperity, like
security, cannot be the possession of any nation
in isolation. Prosperity, likewise, demands international co-operation. Canada's prosperity
and the well-being of our people are bound up
with the restoration and expansion of world
trade. To the efficient employment of vast
numbers of Canadians, export markets are
essential. Similarly. to raise the standard of
living, larger imports are needed. In this belief
the Goverument has continued, in accordance
with the principles of the Atlantic Charter, to
explore with other countries the means by
which, after the war, international trade may
.be revived and developed.
The vital importance of exports in maintaining employment was recognized in legislation,
which has since been brought into effect, to
provide for the insurance and guarantee of

fM40

SENATE

export credits. Provision was also made for
the expansion of the trade commissioner service
of Canada.
During the session, ail customas duties on
farm implements were removed, thereby helping to keep down farm costs, with benefit alike
to the producers and consumers of agricultural
products. By this important measure, my ministers have also given concrete evidence of
Canada's readiness, in association with other
nations, to further international trade by the
reduction of tariff barriers.
The assurance of opportunity of employment
for ail who are willing and able to work is the
corner-stone of the Government's programme to
achieve prosperity and social security. There
is a special responsibility to establish the men
and women of our armed forces in useful and
remunerative activities. The maintenance of a
high level of employment and production after
the war is the first essential of a policy which
also aims at a rising level of human well-being.
The many important measures enacted at the
session now closing mark substantial progress
towards the attainment of these goals. Practically ail these measures are already in force.
Viewed collectively, they form an impressive
legislative achievement. In their comprehensiveness and inter-relation. they constitute a
major instalment of a programme to prevent
the possible recurrence of unemployment and
insecurity in post-war years.
To further the Government's policies of full
employment, social security and human welfare,
three new departments of government have
been established, ail of which are now under the
direction of responsible ministers of the Crown:
1. The Departnent of Veterans Affairs;
2. The Department of Reconstruction; and
3. The Department of National Health and
Welfare.
The Department of Veterans Affairs has
charge of the rehabilitation and re-establishment of members of the armed forces, and of
the administration of veterans' pensions and
allowances.
The new department is already administering
measures directly related to the re-establishment of veterans in civil life, the care of disabledc veterans, and the provision for the
dependents of those who have given their lives.
The administrative machinery for this vast
undertaking is being steadily developed and improved. Nearly 200,000 veterans of this war
have already been re-established in civil life.
The War Service Grants Act and the
Veterans Insurance Act, passed at the present
session, round out the most conprehensive
programme yet adopted by any nation for the
welfare of its war veterans and their return to
active civilian pursuits.
The Department of Reconstruction is engaged
in making preparations for the speedy conversion of war industries to meet peacetime
needs and to niaintain industrial employment.
It is also promoting and co-ordinating programmes of national and regional development,
housing and community planning, and other
projects which may be required to maintain
employment in the post-war period.
It is
responsibile for the orderly disposal of surplus
war assets in the national interest. Representative agencies are already engaged in this large
and important task.
To assist in the conversion of war plants, and
in the development of small and medium-scale
enterprises, an Industrial Development Bank
bas been established. It is now in operation.

In keeping up the level of employment after
the war. housing should play a large part. To
provide for the construction of new bouses,
the repair and modernization of existing bouses,
and the improvement of urban and rural
housing and living conditions, the Nationnal
Housing Act was greatly expanded in scope.
In the decennial revision of the Bank Act,
made at the present session, special recognition
was given to the importance of credit in stimulating employment. The new Act bas greatly
improved the credit facilities and the banking
services available to the people of Canada. By
supplementary legislation, special provision was
made for intermediate and short term credit
to farmers for the improvement and development of farms ani farm ho-mes.
The Department of National Health and
Welfare is engaged in organizing and adiministering important activities of the federal Government in the field of health and social
welfare.
In opening the present session, I said that,
in the opinion of my ministers, plans for the
establishment of a national minimum of social
security and human welfare shouldi be advanced
as rapidly as possible. In the establishment of
this national minimum, the new department
has the responsibility for federal measures to
promote health and welfare, and for the planning of comprehensive insurance against social
hazards.
A considerable measure of social security is
already provided under federal and provincial
social legislation. But the working out of a
comprehensive national scheme in whici federal
and provincial activities wiil be integrated will
require further consultation and close o-operation with the provinces.
I announced, at the opening, that the Government was prepared to recommend a measure to
provide for federal assistance in a nation-wide
system of health insurance. Such a neasure
would include assistance to the provinces for
preventive medicine. I also stated that the
Government was prepared to support a national
scheme of contributory old age pensions on a
basis more generous than that of existing
pensions. The introduction of these measures is
conditional upon suitable agreements witlh the
provinces. My ministers reaffirm their readiness, as soon as such agreements are reathed.
to proceed with these great social reforni.
Recognizing the importance, to the maintenance of post-war employment and te the
achievenent of social security. of close cooperation with the provinces. the Governient
undertook and is carrying forward preparations
for the holding. at the earliest appropriate
date, of a Dominion-Provincial Conference.
In the belief that the family and the home
are the foundation of national life, provision
bas been made for family allowances to aid in
ensuring a minimum of well-being to the
children of the nation, and to help ,ain for
them a closer approach to equality of opportunity in the battle of life. Family allowances are being administered by the Department of National Health and Welfare. The
registration of children begins to-morrow. The
payment of allowances is to begin from Jly 1.
In the opinion of my ministers. the Family
Allowances Act and other social security
measures designed to ensure a national minimum of human welfare will aid materially in
maintaining production and employment.

JANUARY 31, 1945
The basic standard of living of the Canadian
people and the purchasing power of the dollar
ave continued to be successfully protected by
the price ceiling and other policies of the Government designed to prevent inflation.
The
value of these policies will be more apparent
than ever in meeting post-war problems.
As a further safeguard of a basic standard cf
living, provision was made at the present
session for floors under the prices of farm and
fish producte. These measures insure two great
primary industries against the hazard of a
collapse of markets or prices after the war.
To advise and assist the Government in the
regulation and development of civil aviation, an
Air Transport Board has been established.
Under the Government's policy regarding postwar civil aviation, of which you have been
informed, international and transcontinental
services are reserved for public development;
local services may be developed by private
enterprise.
In April and May, a meeting of Prime Ministeis of the British Commonwealth was held
in London. My Prime Minister participated
in its proceedings and, while in London,
addressed a meeting of the members of both
Houses of the Parliament of the United
Kingdom.
In September, for the second time during the
pesent war, the Government was host to the
Prime Minister of Great Britain and the
President of the United States and their
advisers, at a conference held at Quebec.
In the same month a meeting of the Council
of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was held at Montreal.
During the year, Canada was also represented
at the International Monetary Conference at
Bretton Woods and at the International Conference on Civil Aviation at Chicago. There
were continuons conferences on a variety of
subjects between my ministers and the governments of the United Kingdom and the United
States.
The Sixth and Seventh Victory Loans, held
during the year, substantially exceeded their
objectives. In each loan, the number of individual subscribers established a new record. You
will be gratified by this unparalleled response,
and will desire me to record your appreciation

541

of the splendid services of the National War
Finance Committee and its provincial and local
organizations.
During the past year, relations between employers and employees have been increasingly
harmonious. A larger number of workers have
been employed throughout the year than ever
before. The production of food-stuffs and of
the raw materials and finished munitions of
war exceeded production in any previous year.
Too high a tribute cannot be paid to the
unselfish devotion to wartime duties of the vast
majority of our people in all walks of life. In
addition te their daily tasks, hundreds of
thousands have given freely of their time and
energies te indispensable voluntary activities.
By their efforts at home, the men and women
of Canada have demonstrated their eagerness to
support te the utmost the fighting forces overseas.
Members of the House of Commons:
I thank you for the financial appropriations
for the prosecution of the war.
The provision you have made for the exercise
of the franchise in a general election by the
men and women in the armed forces will a.fford
them the widest opportunity te exercise this
fundamental right of citizenship.
lonourable Members of the Senate:
'Members of the House of Commons:
Canada's war effort over the past five years
speaks for itself.
As I bring te a close this fifth session of our
war Parliament, I join with you in a prayer for
a speedy end te the horrors and sacrifices of
war. In God's keeping, we leave our heroic
dead. We shall ever honour their memory.
For the bereaved, we ask comfort and consolation. For the prisoners of war, the missing and
the wounded, we pray for an early release
from their privations, anxieties and sufferings.
More than ever our thoughts are of the
hundrede of thousands of our young Canadians,
who, with their comrades-in-arms from other
lands, have offered their lives te save from
conquest and servitude the free nations of the
world. We humbly pray that Divine Providence
may grant te all who survive the ordeal of
battle an early and triumphant return te their
homeland.
