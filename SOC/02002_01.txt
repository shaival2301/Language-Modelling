lis Excellency arrived early in that year,
arrompanied by lier Royal Highnees the
Princess Alice. After a warm welcome fs-cm
the government andI the people, Their Excelloncies at once took up their enerous duties
with great energy and enthusiasm. They made
severai ardueus tours of Canada from ocean
te ecean, inspiring the people i0 every walk
of life tei put ferward their groateet effort,
thus enabling Canada to play an important
role in the global war which, after nearly
five yoars, ended in the unconditional surrender, within a few menthe cf ene another,
of Gensuaay andI Japan.

MAROR 15, 1946
Their Excellencies, when touring Canada.
visited the various service hospitals, the war
plants, and the many agencies of the Red
Cross. Their visite to the hospitals brought
comfort anid courage ta those who, at great
personal sacrifice, had served at the front.
Ris Exceilency, who had a distinguished
career in the Imperial Army, bath in war and
iu peace, took a special interest in our armed
forces, and ail ranks keenly looked forward to
his visits.
May I be permitted to make a personal
reference to Her Royal Highness the Princess
Alice? She was indefatigable in her attention
to the 'Red Cross bospitals and other agencies.
Rer visits were greatly appreciated and did
much to sustain the morale of our people.
Today parliament is expressing to Their
Excellencies, who are about to leave Canada,
its appreciation of and gratitude for the service they have rendered and their devotion
to duty during their period of office. I arn
certain that they will carry with tbem also
the appreciation and gratitude of the
Canadian people.
We contemplate the departure of Their
Excellencies with a tinge of sadness, but we
know they will have the satisfaction of carrying with tbem the best wishes of the Canadian people. We trust that they may have a
pleasant and safe returu ta England, and we
hope that they may long be spared to continue in the service of our King. We are
sure that when Ris Excellency is reporting
to lis Mai esty he will convey to him ourl
continued loyalty and devotion to the Crown,
and will assure bim that ahl Canadians rejoice
lu the thought tbat Canada will ever remalu
the senior dominion in the British Commoiiwealtb of Nations.
Hon. VINCENT DUPUIS (Translation):
Hanourable senators, the term. of office of Ris
Excellency the Governor General, the Earl of
Athlone, is about to expire.
Parliament deems it proper ta, give official
recognitian to that event, and the government's representative in this bouse ba& requested me ta say a few words as a Canadian
of French descent.
May I say ta His Excellency and ta Rer
Royal Highness Princess Alice how much we
regret their departure. I wisb ta express in
the most sincere- ternms aur feelings of deep
gratitude and aur heartfelt appreciation for
the memorable part His Excellency has played
wîth so muýchnobleness and distinction as the
representative of Ris Majesty tbe King in
Canalda.
Ris term of office amang us cavers one of
the most troubled periods in world bistory.

5

During those years of arjguish which t.he
recent confiict brouglit us,, aur Goveruor
General, assisted by his royal spouse, waa flot
sparing of bis time, nor was he free froma
fatigue or worry. Ris endeavours have alwamys been great. He has gane wherever he
could encourage us tbrough his words and
example. He bas ever been for *us -a living
symbol of gallantry and indomitable courage.
Ris high personality bas been for us a stimulant in aur determination ta serve aur country.
Now that aur people and our victoriaus
armies have acquired a warld-wide reputation,
we take pleasure in acknawledging the fact
that we are indebted ta bum for a considerable
part of our success.
In the speech fram the throne which he was
pleased ta rend ycsterdiay, he said that Her
Royal Highness Princess Alice and he were
proud of the privilege they had of sbaring
aur joys and aur trials, and that tbey will
ever keep a deep affection for us. 0f that we
are convinced.
In turn, we want them ta kn.ow that their
sojourn amoang us bas lef t such a deep impression in aur hearts that we consider tbem
as fellow-Canadians. That is why we shauld
be very proud if they were willlug ta accept
from us the titie of Canadian citizens.
Then, on bis return, when. aur Governor

it would be a comf art ta us if he kindly
delivered the following message from us:

Hon. A. J. LEGER (Translation): Honourable colleagues, I arn deligbted ta join tbe
honourable senators wbo have just spoken lu
conveying, an behaîf of tbase I represent, a

and gratitude ta the distluguished Governor

Even though, since the autset of Canfederation, Canada bas always been fortunate lu
the choice of the incumbents designated by

6

SENATE

the Imperial government to represent the
British Crown and direct the destinies of our
country, few Governors have to such an extent
deserved the general esteem and respect that
was merited by the fond care, the sure and
refined judgment and the deep cordiality
constantly exercised by the Earl of Athlone.
It may be stated that the Earl and the
Princess have won the souls and hearts of the
whole Canadian people, not only because of
their lofty and distinguished positions, but
also by the worthy manner in which they
discharged their functions, and more especially
because of their sound social qualities and
numerous examples of tender solicitude, as
well as their constant effort to co-operate
with us to advance the prosperity and future
welfare of Canada.
It is with deep feelings of admiration and
regret that we bid them adieu.

THE LATE SENATORS TANNER
MARSHALL

AND

TRIBUTES TO THEIR MEMORY

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, before proceeding with
the business of the House, I regret very much
Hon. Mr. Leger.

to have to advise you of the passing, since
we last met, of two of our esteemed colleagues. I refer to the death of the Honourable Charles Elliott Tanner, K.C., who died
at lis residence in Ottawa, on Sunday, January 13, 1946, and of the Honourable Duncan
McLean Marshall, D.Sc., who died in Toronto,
on January 16, 1946.
Senator Tanner was born in Pictou, Nova
Scotia, on October 7, 1857, the son of Richard
Tanner of Bandon, Cork, Ireland, and Jane
Brown of Dumfries, Scotland. He received
his education at Pictou Academy, where he
graduated in law. He was admitted to the
Nova Scotia Bar in 1878, and was appointed
King's Counsel in 1895. On September 15,
1886, ho married Alicia May Macdonald,
daughter of James Robert Macdonald, who
survives him.
For many years the late Senator Tanner
occupied a prominent position in Nova Scotia.
He served Pictou in the capacity of stipendiary magistrate and town solicitor. Holder
of a distinguished military record, he was a
member of the lst Regiment, Halifax Artillery,
from which he retired with the rank of major.
An ardent sportsman in his younger days, he
was an able lacrosse, cricket and golf player,
and an expert curler. To him must go the
credit for organizing and promoting many
sports fraternities in Nova Scotia.
Senator Tanner's public life extended over
a period of fifty years. He was elected in
1894 to the Nova Scotia legislature; was
defeated in þis attempt to win a federal seat
in 1908; was later chosen leader of the Conservative' party in the provincial field in 1912,
and held that post until defeated in the provincial elections four years later. In 1917 he
was appointed to the Senate of Canada. and
was a member of this House for almost
thirty years.
As is well known to the honourable members, the late Senator Tanner was highly
respected for his ability and judgment. He
occupied a prominent position in the Senate
and served on many committees, among them
the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous
Private Bills. of which he was chairman until
shortly before his death.
I knew him personally from the days when
he was in the Nova Scotia Legislature and,
like many othors, can bear testimony to his
unfailing courtesy and consideration. Partly,
I suppose, because we both came from the
same province and had sa many friends in
common, and partly because he had known
my forbears, there existed between us despite
the disparity in years a very warm friendship.
In the passing of the late Senator Tanner,
the province of Nova Scotia and the Dominion

MARCH le, 1946
of Canada bave lest an outstanding figure;
and I and xnany thousands of others, both
within tbat province and without, feel tbat we
bave lest a friend .
SenStKor IMarsball was bon 'of Scottisb
parents on a pioneer farmn in Bruce County,
Ontario, on September 24, 1872. Here be spent
bis early years. He was educated at Walkerton Higb School and Owen Sound Collegiste
Institute. At seventeen years of age be began
teacbing scbool at Gillies Hill, and taugbt for
five years. Well known as organizer of tbe
Patrons of Indflstry in -tbe early days of the
movement, be later bec-ame interested in newspaper work in Ontario, and stili later in
Edmonton, Alberta, wbere be xnoved in 190.
In March, 1909 bie was elected to tbe Alberta
provincial legislature as Liberal member for
Olda; after baving purcbased a farmn of unbroken prairie in fIat vicinity. During tbe
next. few years fhe late senator establisîed a
superior berd of pure bred Sborthorn cattle,
the progeny of whicb won awards et many
exhibitions, including tbe Cbicago International Livesfock Show. Ha was elecfed President of tbe, Dominion Sborthorn Breeders
Association of Canada in 1922 and 1923, and
for four years was also a member of tlbe
National Liva Stock Records Committee. He
was one of tbe few Canadians whose portraits
bang in the unique gallery of livesfock men
in tbe balla of the Saddle and Sirloin Club of
Cbicago.
Tbe lat e Senaf or Marsalal was sworn in as
Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary of Alberta on November 1, 1909, and
was re-elected at tbe by-election of November
23, 1909, and tbe general elections of 1913
and 1917. He beld tbe office of Minister of
Agriculture for over twelve years. During
fIat time be establisbad a system of egriculfural scbools whicî bas frequently been referred
to as tbe best system yet devised for tbe
training of farm boys and girls in Canada.
After Ieing a candidate in tbe constituency
of East. Caigary in the federal1 election of 1921,'
Senator Marsalal returned to Ontario. He was
appoinited Commissioner of Agriculture for
the Dominion of Canada and took an active
part in negotiating for tbe removal o fIhe
British embargo against Canadian cattle. In
this be was successful, and, fIe embargo was
rexnoved in April, 1923. Hie efforts in tbis
e
connection were widely apprecieted. Tb' tben
Minister of Finance, Ilonourable Mr. Fielding,
paid tribut e to tbe very valuable service rendered, and stated fIat tbe success wbich
attenided tIe conference was largely attributable f0 'the energetic work of our late colleague.

Senator Marshall then engaged for several
years in the advertising business, and during
this period compiled a number of text--books
on agricultural subjects. In the Ontario provincial election of 1934 hae was Liberal candidate in Peel county, and was elected, and
for the following three years was 'Minister
of Agriculture of the province. On June 10,
1935, be received the bonorary degree of Docfoer of Agriculture from Iowa State College,
being the only Canadian to be so honoured.
On January 20, 1939, hie was appointed a
member of the Canadian Senate and took a
most active interest in legislation, particularly
that pertaining to agriculture. He continued
te contribute articles on agriculture to newspapers and farm periodicals, and just prier to
bis death completed a handbook on farmmng
in Canada.
Senator Marshall will be greatly missed by
his colleagues in this chamber. He was an
eloquent speaker, well versed ini public affairs,
and particularly well equipped to serve the
cause of agriculture, ini which, he was so deep]y
interested.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, at flua time it is neither my wish nor my
desire to speak at any great lengtb, and if
I may, I should like to ask the honourable
senator from South Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly), to speak of Senator Tanner, who for
many years was his desk-mate. Ail I shail
say la that on this side of the bouse, particularly among tbe older members, Senator
Tanner will be missed very mucb. I always
tbink that tbe naine by wbich a man is called
means sometbing. The late senator was always
spoken of as "Charlie Tanner.>' To me that
indicates tbat hie was well liked by bis fellow
men.
Now I wish to say a few words about the
late Senator Marsbali-Duncan Marshall, as
he was known to us in tbe West. It is probably unique in Cenadiain political bistory for a
man who is a minister in one province to retire
to another and become a minister in that
province. So far as my memory goas, the late
Senator Marshall is the only one who bas
done that. He was a miinister in the province
of Alberta, and later became a minister in tbe
province of Ontario.
The members of tbis bouse will miss bim
very much, and hie will ha greatly missed by
the scientific farmers of Canada, to wbose
interests be gave much of his time and energy.
Time, of course, takes ifs toil of fhis boeuse,
and 'to me it is always a painful experience
t0 be called upon to pay tribute to one who
bas passed on. Yet, it was good for Canada
that- men like Senator Tanner and Senator
Marsball were born and raised in our country,

FATE
and were able to contribute sa much to its
betterment. It is my hope that their families
may realize how greatly we cberisb the
memaries of these honourable gentlemen.
I would now ask the honourable senatar
fram South Bruce to speak as ta the late
Senator Tanner.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Hanourable members of the Senate, 1 desire to associate myself with the very eloquent and well-deserved
tributes whicb bave been paid to Senator
Tanner and Senator Marshall by the leader
opposite and the leader on this side of the
bouse. The leader of tbe government bas
given sucb a detailed outline of tbe activities
of the two gentlemen that I will confine myseif
to somte genieral remarks.
It bas been said that Senator Tanner came
to the Sonate almost tbirty years ago. I was
here at tbat time, and I remember Senator
Tanner wben be came. We knew that he bad
had long oxperience ira public life in bis native
province. As the bonourable leader opposite
bas stated, bie was four times elected , and at
one time was bouse leader of bis party.
Aýside from bis past experience ho bad a
fine presonce and good command -of language.
Wbcn Senator Tanner rose to, speak. bis
enunciation was so perfect tbat one could
always be sure of wbat lie had to say, and
whetber one agreed with bim or not one had ta
admire tbe courage witb which be supported
bis convictions.
During the thirties it was my privilege to be
desk-mate with Senator Tanner for four or
five years.
Later on my friend Senatar
Gordon had some trouble with his eyes, and
asked me to sit witb him. After Senator
Gordon passed on I again bad the privilege
of sitting witb Senator Tanner as deskmate. Some twelve or thirteen years ago hoe
was chairman of a very important committee
of wbich 1 was a member, and I am certain
tbat hoe did everytbing possible ta bring aut
the faets and ta endeavour ta be fair witb
aIl persans con'cernied.
Members recently
appointed ta the Senate will not aýppreciate
fully tbe wortb of Senator, Tanner. Some
four or five years ago, bis bearing failed biso,
and altbough hoe tried variaus bearing aids he
neyer appeared ta be able ta get one that wu.
a success. As a result bis life was less pleas.
ant tban it otherwise would bave been. Hie
was a good conversationalist and bad a fine
sense of humour, so hoe was always excellent
company.
As we bave, been told by the bonourable
leader of the bouse. Senator Tanner was married in 1886. It was bis good fortune ta have
,the companionsbip and couns-el cf a good wife
Hlon.

Mr. Haig.

for sixty years. Those of us wbo have visited
at the Tanner home and wbo have seen Senator Tanner's wife around the buildings here
are aware of the thorough and Ioving way in
wýhich she lôoked after his every need.
I
know I can assure Mrs. Tanner and her son
that they have the sincere sympathy of every
member of this chamber.
Now I sbould like to say a few words about
Senator Marshall. As lie told the Senate on
more than one occasion, hie was born in Bruce.
That county was settled about ninety-five
years ago, and possibly its name was responsible for the fact that so many Highland
Scotch people came there. Among those who
came was the senator's father, who settled in
the township of Eldersie, where Senator
,Marshall ivas born andi raised. I was raised
in the adjoining township of Creenock, where
I spent my early days and where, in fact, my
home is now.
I had the priviiege of knowinig Senator
Marshall for a number of years. I first saw
him. acting in a public capacity when, as a
boy of about eighteen., lie was adldressing a
political meeting for an ind-ependent candidate
in the old provincial riding of Centre Bruce.
While I did nlot agree with the arguments he
was making, I was much impressed with his
ability as a puhlic speaker. Later on hie went
into newspaper work. I could tell you about
bis going to Alberta, where lie became a prov'incial cabinet minister, and of his return to
the province of Ontario, in xvhich ho also became a cabinet minister. But these facts bave
alroady been referred to.
As honourable membeTs know, Senator
Marshall was greatly interested in Shortborn
cattie during mast of bis life. Tbrough bis
writiags he became k.nown as an authority on
this breed, in whicb I think bis interest was
aroused when. he was a boy in Bruce. At that
time a wealtby lumberman, Mr. Cargill, who
represented East Bruce in the flouse of Commons, spent money lavishly in establisbing on
his large farmn what was admittedJy the best
herd of Sbortborn cattlýe in Canada. After
bis death bis son did nnt take the samne keen
interest ina the herd, so it was disposed of, but
from it sprang many of the well known 'berds
ina this country today. Senator Marshall bas
told me of seeing Mr. Cargill's cattle on the
farm and at various fairs, and of how he
acquired the ambition to become a dealer in
that breed of cattle. We ail know how successfully he fulfilled that ambition.
One day in the later part of September lat
I saw Senator Marshall rise ina his place here,
before the Ordcrs of the Day were called, and
I woaadered what ýhe was going to say. I was

MARCH 19, 1946
greatly surprised to hear bima refer to an e.nniversary that my family and I were cedebrating
at that time, and make some complimen.tary
remarks about -us as people of Bruce. I could
.not recaîl having seen Senator Marshall in the
bouse after that occasion, and this morning I
found, on looking up the records, that he neyer
appeared here again. So that was my friend's
last utterance in the Senate. That fact makes
me feel bis passing ail the more keenily.
Senat>or Marshall, like Senator Tanner, also
had a happy married life. During bis travels
as a young man he spent some time in Prince
Edward Island, where hie met the you.ng lady
who afterwards became Mrs. Marshall.
Throughout their nmarried, life bler one care
has always been the welfare of lier husband
and family. I am sure that every member of
the Senate j oins with me in exteînding to
Mis. Marshall and bier three sons our deepest
sympathy.
Hon, W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, I knew the late Senator Marshall
when he was in the weekly newspaper business
in Ontario more than forty years ago, before
he went to Edmonton to, manage the Bulletin
f or the Honourable Frank Oliver. That was
about 1905, 1 believe. Since his return from
the West I knew hlm much more intimately,
and eni oyed a warm friendship wit~h him. I
should, therefore, like to add mny tribute to
his memory today.
The late Senator Marshall was descended
from Scotch pioneer stock. His father came
to this country from Scotland as a young man,
and for a time worked for other farmers.
Senator Marshall told me on many occasions
that one of the guiding principles of bis
fatber's life was neyer to buy anytbing if he
could flot pay cash for it. When the senator's
father had saved enough money, hie bought a
farm in Bruce County whicb I believe bas
îemained in the family ever smnce. Ahl the
sons worked on the farm. Duncan Marshall
worked on the faim in the summertime and
went to school in winter. I)espite this handicap, when bie wrote the entrance examination
hie got the highest marks of any acholar of
the year in Bruce County. He persevered with
bis education, and after securing the necessaiy certificate became a sehool-teacher. Ris
appetite for liteiature baving been whetted,
bie became a great reader and accumulated in
bis home a fine library of goodbooks, whlcb
hie thorougbly enjoyed.
Duncan Marshall was a true Canadian. He
believed that Canada was a country with a
glorious future. He also had a great love for
Scotland, the land of bis ancestors. On more

9

than one occasion I have heard him deliver an
address on Scotland, in which hie quoted
Burns and Scott with great fluency.
The late Senator Marshall was a flrma
believer ini the usefulness of the Senate. He
frequently told me how much hie thought the,
non-political discussions in this chamber helped
in arriving at sound conclusions on public
questions.
His main interest, as we &Ilknow, was agriculture. He was for twelve years Minister of
Agriculture in the province of Alberta, and
for three years Minister of Agriculture in the
province of Ontario. In both positions, I
think it will be agreed, he made a fine contribution to the agricultural life of this- country.
Senator Marshall lived a long, active and
useful life. He has lef t behind him the sweet
memories of a, kind father, a loving husband
and a most congenial companion.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: May I be permitted, honourable members, to add a few
words of tribute to the memory of our late
colleague from Pictou. Coming as 1 do from
Nova Scotia, and having known Senator
Tanner for over forty years, I feel that I owe
him this mark of respect and affection.
Senator Tanner was born in the county of
Pictou-a county noted for its outstanding
contribution of men prominent in the political, prof essional and business 11f e of this
country. Charlie Tanner was one of them.
He entered the political arena at an early
age. I was a follower of his thirty years ago,
when I unsuccessfully contested a seat for
the county of Halifax in the Nova , Scotia
Legisiative Assembly.
Senator Tanner was a loyal Nova Scotian
and a patriotic Canadian. 1 do not know of
any man more familiar with the political bistory of Canada than he was. The older nierabers among us can recali his earlieî days when
hie took an active part in our proceedings.
He was fearless and forceful in debate, and
neyer backward in expressing his views.
Whether you agreed with him or not, as the
honourable senator from South Bruce (Mr.
Donnelly) has said, you could not but admire
him for having the courage of bis convictions.
I shall always cherish hlm. as a warm friend
and a wise counsellor, and 1I loin with the
other bonourable senators ia their expressions
of sympathy to his widow and son.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, may I have the privilege of
payin a tribute to my former warmi personal
fen , Duncan Marshall? I feel called on to
do so because hie was a colleague of mine in
two Houses. flrst. for three rigorous years in
what was known as the Hepburn government,

lu

SENATE

and later, of course, in the Senate. Prior to
joining him in the Ontario administration, I
knew Senator Marshall for many years.
My earliest recollection of him goes back to
the very first years of the present century
when I was a reporter on one of the Toronto
dailies. Even in those early days he was making
his mark on the public mind as a forceful and
eloquent speaker. As has been recounted, he
went west and, became a prominent figure in
the public life of Alberta. On his return to
Ontario I met him once again, and some of
my most pleasant associations with him were
in the early 20's when he was organizer for the
Liberal party. While lie was Minister of
Agriculture of this province I recail him as an
eloquent and convincing speaker with a vivid
and extensive knowledge of affairs, particularly
in his own department. I have always admired
his courage in debate and his lucidity of
ex.pression.
During the three years in the Ontario government to which I have referred, the members
of the government had a private dining room.
There we met nearly every day, and Marshall
entertained us with stories and reminiscences
and references of serious import drawn from
a memory that seemed to be well nigh
inexhaustible. My pleasant associations with
him were resumed when be became a member
of this chamber.
In paying tribute to his breadth of knowledge and fine human qualities, I should like
to join in the expressions of sympathy to his
widow and his splendid sons. I trust that our
admiration for our late colleague, and our
assurance that be will long be remembered by
us. will be some lit-fle consolation to his near
relatives and friends.
INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS

CANADA'S

FOREIGN AFFAIRS

SENATE

COMMITTEE

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, before the orders of the day are
called, may I direct the attention of the Senate
to an editorial which appeared in the Citizen
this morning.
It is captioned "Non-party
Foreign Policy." I shall refer to only one
paragraph, which reads as follows:
If a foreign affaiTre non-party commàttee couild
be formed in the Senate to watch over Canad'a's
reiationships with other countries, it cousd do
much to enlighten and steady public opinion
whenever that might become necessary.
The Ottawa Citizen may be interested to
learn that already there is in this House,
and bas been for a number of years, a committee such as they recommend.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of His Excellency the Governor General's
speech at the opening of the session.
Hon. J. RAOUL HURTUBISE moved that,
an Address be presented to His Excellency
the Governor General to offer the humble
thanks of this house to His Excellency for
the gracious speech which he has been pleased
to make to both houses of parliament.
He said (Translation): Honourable senators,
it is with a feeling of deep emotion and not
without realizing my responsibility that I have
consented to more the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne.
Addressing this honourable assembly for the
first time, I feel some diffidence when I consider the long parliamentary life of our elders,
their experience, their shrewdness and their
wisdom. I must therefore request your forbearance.
I should like, in the first place, to voice
my gratitude to the government for having
raised me to the dignity of a member of this
honourable house, and to convey my sincere
thanks to the leader of the Senate, who bas
kindly invited me to move the Address.
I accepted that invitation as a tribute to
the fine constituency of Nipissing, which for
fifteen years I had the honour to represent in
the House of Commons. as well as to the
beautiful and prosperous northern part of the
province of Ontario, which has had a large
share in the development of our nationaIl
economy.

MARCH 19, 1946
All parts of Northern Ontario heeded the
call to arms and made a splendid conIndeed,
tribution to the Allied victory.
Nipissing has supplied a substantial number
of men and women to our armed forces. Our
mines and our industries also have increased
their production so as to supply the United
Nations with the nickle, the steel, the copper
and the forest products without which victory
would have been impossible or considerably
delayed.
A few months ago we were hailing with
joy the end of hostilities with Germany and
Japan. During six long years, the Prime
Minister and his associates have had to work
without respite on the prosecution of a war
effort which circumstances demanded for the
protection of Christian and democratic countries, including Canada. With the generous
help of the Canadian people, they have
earned not only the gratitude of the allied
countries, but universal acclaim. Unfortunately, the peace we had envisioned is long in
becoming established, and even harder work
will be required of then to put our domestic
affairs in order and to :lay an international and
Christian foundation upon which to erect the
structure of a permanent peace, if the latter
is possible. The attainment of such a result
will require much mutual good will; and we
shall have to beseech Divine Providence,
without any false piety, but with frankness
and faith, to instil into human hearts the
principles of justice and equity which alone
can ensure an enduring peace.
The Speech from the Throne first expresses
deep concern about the European countries
which are facing acute shortage and, in some
regions, widespread famine. Further on, it
states:
The government has steadily pursued fite
efforts to restore former markets, to seure new
markets and generably to expand peacetime
exporte. l pursuit of this 'pollcy, export credits,
for whieh additionail provision was made at the
'last session, have been extended to several Of
our war-time allies.
At thie session you wid'l ibe asked to approve
an agreement, recently conaluded, for a loan
to the United Kingdom which w1il1 help maintin the British market for Canadian food prodýuets and other exporte. The agreement wil also
ontribute ta the steady development of trade
between the two countries, the remova of trade
barriers and the free use of currencies for international trade.
Wbile Canada, in commonS with all countries,
continues to experience dislocations nevitable
in a perdod of transition from war to peace, in
na other country has te transitian proceeded
more speedily or with less friction.
Canada bas just entered into an agreement
with the United Kingdom government whereby
we lend England twelve hundred and fifty
million dollars at a very low rate of interest.

-il

In various quarters, concern is felt over the
heavy sums of money Canada has already
spent on its war effort and on loans to England
or our other allies.
There is nothing we can do about the cost
of the war. We had to make sure of victory
at any price. No one in Canada wished to
come under the iron rule of Hitler or
Hirohito. Thanks to Divine Providence, our
exertions have not been fruitless and our victory over Germany and Japan has been complete and decisive.
As I said a short while ago, we have not
yet finished our task, for we must now consolidate peace. How can we achieve this if
we do not first of all re-establish the regular
flow of international exchange? Nations like
England and France, whose moral integrity
and will to survive cannot be questioned, need
our help to recover from the heavy losses
inflicted by war and even the process of
liberation.
Since various inventions have minimized
distances and since our means of transportation have attained such a remarkable degree
of perfection, all nations have become more
and more interdependent, and we could not
long remain prosperous if misery afflicted the
rest of the world. In the international sphere,
the principles of Christian fraternity compel
us not to ignore those who wish to borrow
from us, but even on the more restrained
level of purely Canadian interests, it is evident that, since Canada exports three quarters of its production, our prosperity depends
on our foreign trade. In order to re-establish
this commercial flow, we must of necessity
help the nations that used to buy our products and will do so in the future.
I am aware of the criticism to which the
loan has been subjected, and some of it
To re-establish peace, however,
is sound.
optimism, trust and good will are needed. We
have just given the world conclusive proof
that we do not lack these qualities.
It is stated in the speech from the throne that
several wartime restrictions have now been
lifted and that others will disappear as circumstances permit. It will be necessary to maintain certain controls in order to prevent inflation and promote the general welfare of our
population.
We are advised also that it wilH be necessary
to reconstitute the Special Veterans Affairs
Committee. I have no doubt that an agreement wi'll be reached at this session and that
our veterans will be presented with an act
which will be acceptable to them and which
will provide them with guarantees for the
future.

12

SENATE

With the lifting of numerous restrictions on
building materials, I trust that the Government
will devise some means of meeting the demand
for permanent housing and, in the meantime,
to provide emergency shelters.
In regard to the proposed redistribution of
representation in the House of Commons, I
am personally aware of the meaning of a fair
distribution based on the population of the
constituencies. For fifteen years, I represented
in that house 65,000 constituents, most of
whom lived in rural communities. The development of our country is proceeding apace
and we must adapt ourselves to circumstances.
Those who heretofore have enjoyed some kind
of political preserve will have to make sacrifices so that everyone may be treated fairly
and equitably.
At this session we shall be asked to pass
upon two bills which, in my çpinion, are the
logical extension of the Statute of Westminster.
The first deals with Canadian citizenship.
Having in mind all the embarrassment which
we have experienced in the past in trying to
clarify the definition of Canadian citizenship,
I hope that the committee entrusted with the
revision and the clarification of this definition
will eliminate any ambiguity, and that in
future we shall all be plain "Canadians", a
title of which we are already proud and which
we shall continue to bear proudly.
The second bill deals with a national flag.
I shall say only a few words in this connection,
as the matter will be discussed in detail
later on. The time has come when the houour
of Canada demands and without our being
any less loyal to His Majesty the King
than the other members of the Commonwealth
that we have our own national flag. Further,
the discussion of this matter must not be unduly protracted in order to please all those
who-and I cannot blame them-are determined to emphasize their origin, however noble
and glorious it may be. For my part, I am
in favour of anew and distinctive Canadian
flag.
We will be asked to approve other legislation; I have mentioned only a few matters
which the Canadian people are impatient to
see settled.
I have endeavoured to impose upon your
attention as little as possible, honourable senators. Before concluding, I beg your leave to
associate myself with those who have mentioned the sentiments of attachment, gratitude
and respect which His Excellency the Governor
General and his very charming consort, Her
Royal Highness Princess Alice, have gained
from the Canadian people during their stay
in this country. The Earl of Athlone may
Hon. Mr. Hurtubise.

well take pride in having represented His
Majesty the King in Canada during most
critical years and in having accomplished his
delicate mission with a diligence and discretion
that have won the admiration of everyone.
Their Excellencies have taken a keen interest
- in all spheres of Canadian activity. We have
been deeply moved by Princess Alice's last
gesture whereby she offered the parting gift of
the women of Canada for the foundation of
a magnificent Canadian social organization
which will happily commemorate her presence
among us. It is therefore with deep respect
and sincerity that I approve, in the name of
the French-Canadian people, the address
moved by the leader of the government and
seconded by the leader of the opposition, and
I wish to associate myself with the compliments
which the honourable senators who spoke before me have addressed to Their Excellencies
on the occasion of their departure from Canada.
Hon. GEORGE P. BURCHILL: Honourable senators, in rising for the purpose of
seconding the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne, I desire, first of all, to express
my appreciation of having been given the
privilege of performing a duty which I feel
is an honour to my constituency and to the
province I represent.
This is the first occasion on which I have
had the privilege of addressing the House, and
I want to avail myself of the opportunity it
affords me of thanking honourable senators
on both sides for the kindness and courtesy
extended to me since I entered the chamber
as a new member. I have been greatly impressed: by the character of the work of the
Senate, the high level of debate, amd the very
evident willingness to accept and discharge
whatever responsibilities the constitution imposes on this branch of parliament. I must
confess that I have been enlightened as to
these and many other important functions of
this body in the past few months, and I think
it is a matter of great regret that Canadians
generally are not better informed as to the
character of the work which the Senate is doing.
No legislative body that I know of receives
such poor publicity as the Canadian Senate;
and in these days when the value of everything seems to be measured by the amount of
propaganda it gets, on the screen, by radio,
or in the press, it is net hard to understand
why the important work done by this house
is sometimes underestimated.
I should like to pay tribute to men in
public office at the present time. I am thinking particularly of those leaders who directed
and administered the affairs of this country
during the critical war years, many of whom
are still carrying the heavy burdens of

SENATE

Here at home our first concern must continue to be the welfare of our returned
veterans and their re-establishment in civilian
life. The period of readjustment to "civvy
street," particularly when so many thousands
of boys stepped from school into the ranks, is
a difficult one for all, and the various ways by
which the governmenit ihas endeavoured to do
everything possible to assist our fighting men
over this period are receiving the hearty approval of Canadians. It is particularly gratifying to learn that the educational opportunities which have been made available are
being taken advantage of 4y such a large
group, and that the veterans are giving such a
splendid account of themselves in the various
universities where they are entered. At my
own University of New Brunswick, where the
normal enrolment is between 300 and 400, returned men have swelled the rolls to nearly
1,000, and it is expected that facilities will
have to be made available for at least 1,200
at the opening of the next year. The president,
Dr. Gregg, is impressed and delighted with
the way these boys are working-for the
courses are not easy-and has stated that,
with standards of curriculum maintained,
there has been a smaller percentage of failures
at the first term examinations than in prewar days.
Of course, the ultimate object of all domestic
legislation which deals directly or indirectly
with our veterans is to make available and to
maintain satisfa.ctory and congenial employment, with pay adequate to the maintenance
of a decent standard of living for themselves
and their families.
This is a necessary
condition for a happy and contented people,
and is the goal towards which domestic legislation affecting veterans is directed.
Like many other business men, I sometimes become impatient with controls and
restrictions, and rebel against regulations
which seem to me to be no longer necessary;
but I do not think anyone wants controls for
controls' sake, and on investigation I have
always been shown why the particular regulation about which I have .complained must be
retained. I think the job these controls did
for Canada and Canadians during the war is
one of the finest examples of what democracy
is capable of doing for the world. The men
who conceived, organized and directed operations and held the line-the large number of
men who left their positions and homes and
came to Ottawa to do what was, in many
cases, a thankless job under numerous difficulties and at grave risk to their healthrichly deserve the thanks of the people of
Canada. They are the unsung heroes of the
Hon. Mr. Burchill.

home front. With commodity shortages still
serious, I can quite see the necessity for retaining controls until the country is on a more
even keel. Business, labour, the householder,
and Canadians generally, I believe, are anxious
to see the end of government regulation, but
I am quite satisfied that this can only be
brought about gradually and as -conditions
permit, and I take the government at its word
that it is as keen as the public is to reach that
position.
The process of conversion in Canada is not
made any easier by the many physical differences which one finds in this great Dominion
when travelling from the Atlantic to the
Pacific-differences in natural resources, in industry, in provincial economies and in racial
backgrounds. The economy of the Maritime
Provinces, with their distances from the larger
population centres, will, not respond to the
same fiscal policies as the power-house of ind.ustrial Ontario or Quebec; and the prairies
and British Columbia have problems which do
not yield to general, over-all treatment. We
are all inclined to see the picture from our
own viewpoint. With these diversities in mind,
I am sure we -have all followed with keen
interest the proceedings of the Dominion-Provincial Conference as an event of first importance 'to the future of this Dominion. As
indicated in the Speech, -the conference will
reassemble on April 25; and as a Canadian I
should like to express the hope that satisfactory conclusions will be reached which will
help to unite all sections of Canada in stronger
boids of attachment as a prosperous and
virile young nation under the British Crown.
But unity is essential. During the war, under
the British Commonwealth Air Training
Scheme, boys from the British Isles, Australia
and New Zealand mingled, with Canadian lads
wben posted, to training schools on flying fields
in every province of Canada, and when they
left this country they carried away with them
a knowledge of our conditions and people
which, apart from the friendships made, will
bear much fruit in the future. Here in Canada
we have got to learn to know each other better, andi how to live wtih each other, and I
suggest ta our Canadian universities from
Halifax to Vancouver that they work out some
reciprocal arrangement whereby students from
the West will meet and hive with students in
the East, and vice versa. An arrangement of
this kind would, I am sure, do much to create
a better understanding and to cultivate the art
of getting on together.
On the road ahead Canada must be united.
To carry our weight in world affairs and
measure up ta the high destinies which are
ahead of this great country of ours, Canada

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, 1 desire to move the adjournment of the
debate, but first I wish to express my regret
at having 'been absent on Thursday last, when
Paliarnent opened. The fact is that prior
responsibilities called me elsewhere. I hadl
Vo attend the Canadian annual curling competition, which was held in Saskatoon.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hion. Mr. HAIG: For the last thirty-six
years I have neyer let anything interfere with
curling.
1 regret also my absence on Friday, when
the Hous, - .dopted an Address to the Governor Generai and the Princess Alice. Canadians as a whole feel grateful to them for
their splendid service to this country during
the war. Their Excellencies were no doubt
happy tha, in turne of need they were able
to serve the empire which they love so well.
Certainly we regret their departure, but we
realize that the British people have always
been able to furnish a worthy successor to
act as Governor General of Canada. We
shall welcome Lord and Lady Alexander with
outstretched nrms. The boys who served
overseas in Africa and in Italy will be very
happ3ý to know that their commander during
those operations is to be our Governor
General.
I arn glad to notice in the press that His
Mai esty the King and Her Mai esty the
Queen are soon to visit South Africa. Our
recollections of their presence among us are
very dear. Their personal charm showed us
why they were able to hold the empire
together by bonds of love rather than hy
reliance on constitutional ties, and I am sure
the people of South Africa will be just as
proud and pleased as we were during Their
Majesties' stay in this Dominion. I am also
glad to sec by the press that the Princess
Elizabeth, heir presumptive to the Throne,
bas arrived in Northern Ireland to preside at
the launching of the latest addition to the
Royal Navy, the aircraft carrier Eagle. I hope
that at no distant date she and her sister
will be invited to Canada.

MARCH 20, 1946il
Hon. THOMAS 'VIEN: Honourable senators, last session, I recali, there was some
question respecting a report similar to the
one before us. It appeared that soxne of the
senators selected to serve on certain committees would have preferred to be on some
other committees. If there is any urgent
reason why the report of the committee should
be eonsidered now, I would not care to stand
in the way; but if there is not, I should like
to see it put over until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I would not say there is
any great urgency, but I think I should point
out that we took great pains to leave one or
two vacancies on each committee so that
changes could be made if any honourable senators so desired. It had been hoped that the
various committees might meet tamorrow
morning for the purpose of organizing, but if
.there is any serions objection to dealing with
the report now, I wauld not press the point.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, may
I add a word to what bas been said? On the
regular committees we Ieft two vacancies; on
new cammittees which have a large amount of
work outlined we left five or six vacancies.
In this way I thin-k we covered the point
raised by my honourable friend opposite (Hon.
Mr. Vien).
Hon. Mr. VIEN: With opportu-nity to make
ýchanges as occasion arises, I1 would agree to
the motion for concurrence.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honouirable sen.ators, rnay I say, with the permission of my
friend on my right (Hon. Mr. Capp), that I
had originally thought it desirable that the
cammittees should be formed as quickly as
possible; but under the circumstances, and
with the consent of the Chairman of the Coinmittee of Selection, I arn quite willing to have
the matter stand for another day.
As the honourable leader opposite has said,
and as honourable senators will remember,
because too few of our junior members were
on committees, we last year very materially
inereased the membership of certain of the
newer commnittees.
The respective leaders and their whîps,
guided by their own judgment and by individual requests, went over the situation very
carefully. It was apparent that on some of
the committees certain sections of Canada
had nat been adequately represented. The
situation was further complicated by the
existence of fivie vacancies ini the Senate,
which in due course will be filled, and the
fact that it is always awkward to make
changes once committees are set up. Sa for
two reasons we left vacancies: first, ta satisfy
63268-3i

as far as ressonably possible the desires of
individual senators, and second, to make
provision against the time when aur ranks
will be augmented.
Éon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, may I say a word about the question of
adjournment. You will recaîl that last session, the Senate, after having sat a week,
adjourned for two weeks, largely because
there was no pressing business ta be deait
with.
For 'two or 'three resons I now believe that
such an adjournment is entirely undesirable.
In the first place, acting on representations,
and I believe the almost universal feeling of
this house, I urged the government ta intraduce as much legisiation ss possible in this
branch of parliament. Already I have introduced two gavernment bills, two more are
ready ta be introduced, and at least six more
will be presented witbin the next two or three
days. Some of them are of minor importance, but one is a very'substantial measure on
which a great deal of time will have ta be
spent. Hlaving these matters in mind, and in
view of the fact that the Special Committee
on ýthe Incarne War Tax Act and~ tlhe Excees
Profits Tax Act will want ta get on with its
work, 1 arn going ta suggest that the Senate
continue ta ait until at least the llth or 12th
of April. I think it is the wish of every
honourable member that when we have business ta do we should apply ourselves ta it
with the utmost dispatch.
Some Hon. SENAPORs: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I imagine that
in addition ta aur standing committees and
the special committee just mentioned there
will be a special comrnittee on the national
fiag, and possibly onc or two other special
committees. The prospect is that we shal
*have a lot of 'business before us in the next
two or three wceks.
It is hoped that before the date rnentioned,
the llth or l2th of April, the new Governor
Gencral will have arrived. Honourable senators will of course desire ta be present at the
swearing-in cerernony, which will taire place in
this chamber. We shall then be very close to
Easter wcek. At the moment I am not able
ta projeet myself so far ahead and say what
aur plans will be then, but I hope that before
tliat time it will be possible for me ta intimate
ta honourable senators -privatcly-espccially
ta those whose homes are far distant fromn
Ottawa-how long aur Easter recess is likely
ta be.
In view of what I have said, honourable
senators will appreciate that there is no urgent

SENATE

need to have the committees appointed this
afternoon, With the consent of the honourable gentleman to my right (Hon. Mr. Copp)
I am quite willing that this matter should
stand over until tomorrow.
I may add that it is my intention to move,
before we adjourn tomorrow afternoon, that
we re-assemble on Tuesday evening next at
8 o'clock.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Copp stands.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
consideration of His Excelleney the Governor
General's speech at the opening of the session,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. Hurtubise for
an address in reply thereto.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I have read the Speech from the Throne
and noted a fe* of the subjects it deals with,
such as food, employment, markets, loans, conversion, controls, housing, veterans' rehabilitation, and so on, and I propose to deal with
these without attemýpting to discuss the speech
seriatim.
This is really the first peacetime session.
True, last fall when parliament opened all
our enemies had surrendered, but the war
spirit was still prevalenit 'in our country. Now
that the war is over we realize that as an
aftermath we have all the problems that go
with a peaceful world, some of them more
difficult to handle than those incident to a
warring world, because in wartime we know
wlo ou: enemies are but in peacetime we
do not.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: We are trying to find
out.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, we are trying to find
out. To quote words used in another place,
the peace is going to be harder to win than the
war. This is partly our own fault. It is not
easy to carry over into peacetime the enthusiasm with .which we waged war. When our
boys and girls were at the front we believed
that nothing was too good for them. With
the return of peace we realize that the carrying out of our post-war plans depends on the
amount of money that can be raised either by
taxation or by loans. So I repeat, the winning
of the peace is going to be harder- than the
winning of the war.
I intend to discuss national affairs as though
I were addressing a board of directors; in
short, I shall try to bo businesslike. The
first thing that comes to my attention is the
Dominion-Provincial Conference. There have
been several meetings, and the next is to take
place in a few weeks. We of the smalier
and not-so-wealthy provinces are most anxious
that some agreement be worked out that will
make for a fairer distribution of the good
I quite
things of life of this Dominion.
realize that the two central provinces have
their own peculiar problems. I can understand that the premiers of those provinces, and
in fact their people, are afraid to surrender too
many of their rights to the dominion. Canada

MARCH 20, 1946
is a federation of provinces. In the strict
legal sense it may not be, but in reality it is.
At Confederation the then provinces of Canada, Upper and Lower Canada-now Ontario
and Quebec-and the two maritime provinces,
Scotia, came toNew Brunswick and Nova%
gether to form a union. We must always keep
that in mind. I am persuaded that the people
of Ontario and Quebec are reasonable, and that
as Canadians they want their brother Canadians in the other provinces to have at least
a fair chance to share in Canada's economic
life. In one respect Ontario and Quebec are
in the same position: each of them produces
a greater proportion of our national wealth
than does any other province. Yet it is
diflcult to say exactly how much of that
wealth is produced in Quebec or in Ontario
and how much is produced in Manitoba,
in New Brunswick, in Nova Scotia, or in any
one of the smaller provinces. I would urge
Ontario and Quebec-and British Columbia is
in very much the same position as those
provinces-to remember that they are part
of Canada, and should not regard the three
maritime . provinces and the three western
provinces as poor relations, but rather as part
of the Dominion.' We love our Canada, we
appreciate and admire the greatness of Ontario
and Quebec, but we say that their greatness
carries with it a responsibility to the other
provinces.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The next question I want
to deal with is a labour code applicable to all
Canada. I know I am now on dangerous
ground, because the provinces hate to give up
their constitutional rights. In what I am
about to say I would ask honourable senators
to bear in mind that I am declaring my individual views. In my opinion labour is entitled
to a code which will apply all over Canada.
The only body that can enact such a code is
the Parliament of Canada. I believe it will
be in the best interests of the provinces to
surrender to the dominion their control over
labour legislation, so that there shall be a
dominion-wide labour code. I say this not as
a supporter of labour or of capital, of employee
or employer, but because I think it would be
in the interests of all that such a situation
should prevail. During the war there was
more or less federal control of labour matters.
Maybe such control was not exercised as
wisely as it might have been, but on the
whole it worked s4tisfactorily. I am making
this suggestion to the provinces because, as
I have said before, we in this bouse represent
the provinces. We represent not local but
provincial interests. Representation in the

19

Senate is based on four districts-thé Maritime
Provinces, Quebec, Ontario, and the western
provinces. As representatives from those districts we must always be careful to protect
provincial rights. Yet with that responsibility
on my shoulders I feel that a labour code, a
rule of law applying to all of Canada, would
be in the best interests not only of labour but
of capital and industry throughout the whole
dominion.
The next point with which I wish to deal,
and I spoke of this last session, is the single
transferable' vote. It is my desire that this
bouse appoint a special committee for the
purpose of studying this question. I do not
intend to move such a resolution myself, but
I want some brave soul to come forward
and do so.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: He would have to be
brave.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have had the single
transfçrable vote in Manitoba f-r twenty-five
years, and not a single miurmur is to be heard
in opposition to it. We have it not only in
our provincial elections, but in our municipal
elections as well.
I am persuaded that the Senate rather than
the House of Commons should study this
problem. True, it may be said that the single
transferable vote is the means by which
members of the House of Commons are
elected. But the members of that bouse are
prejudiced against such a move. They say
that with three candidates running, all a man
bas to do to be elected is to get forty per
cent of the vote. That is true, but next
time somebody else may get forty per cent
of the vote. As I pointed out last year, 117
members sitting in the House of Commons
were elected by a minority vote. The most
outstanding example of this is the Prime
Minister of this country. There is no doubt
that he would have been the member for
Prince Albert had the single transferable vote
been operative. I am sure that anyone from
Manitoba, Saskatchewan or Alberta will confirm that statement. I am strongly of opinion
that a committee of this bouse should be
appointed to study the question. As I say,
if members of the House of Commons consider it, they immediately start to worry
about their own seats and what may happen
if the system goes into effect.
The leader of the opposition in another
place said the other day that around early
May of last year the Minister of Reconstruction announced that reconversion was fifty
per cent accomplished, and that in February

q

20

SENA'rE

of this year hie declared it was fifty per cent
completed. This would indicate that at least
we are nlot losing gvound.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is my opinion thse
minister's staternent was pretty accurate. Personaily, I arn disappointed with the lack of
success in the matter of reconversion ini this
cou.ntry. I ar n ot sure that 'the minister is
responsible. To speak quîte candidly, I should
like ýto be ablebo say âhat the is responsible, but
I arn doubtful that this is so. I do not believe
that we wilI have reconversion in this country
as long as we have controis and taxes. 1 tbink
as long as the laws reiating to these two things
rernain on our statute books we will have
difficulty with reconversion.
Today we are facing a very grave problern
of unemployment. The most recent report
imdicates that there are 250,000 un-employed
people in Canada, of whorn 145,000 have made
application for unemployrnent insurance relief.
In addition, some 37,000 veterans are receiving
unempioyed veterans' relief, and this number
does nlot include ail the veterans in Canadian
universities. These figures show that today
there are haîf as many people unempioyed as
there were between 1930 and 1935. This is a
very serious state of affairs.
In mv own province of Manitoba we have
a great number of veterans taking university
courses. They are, said to be rod ~ir
better than average. I noticed in the pres
recent3y that President Smnith of the University of Toronto-and I mnust say that we
trained him weil in our provinceHon. Mr. ]ROBERTSON: After we got
throughi wi-th hirn in ours.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He said that the veteran
students studied too liard and rnissed some of
the other features that go with university
training. It is understandabie that in studying
hard after being overseas for two or three
years they should fali into this difficulty. The
fact remains that in two, three or four years
these young men wili be thrown on the labour
mnarket. and wiil further complicate the veteran
ernpioyment problern. Many wartime industrial workers as weil as voteranýs, fixai themseives unemployed. I understand that in
British Columbia some new contracts have
been made which resulted in the re-ernployment of somne people.
It is understandable that the veteran
who bas been away for two, three or four
years does flot always wish to corne back
and settie down at the sarne nid job lie
had before lie went away. Whule in sorne cases
there rnay have been compulsion, tise rnajority
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

of these young mefi were impelied to enlist
by something quite different, and went overseas of their own free wiiI. They feel, after
the struggles 'they have been through, now
that they have had time to think about thern,
that they should be able to hold down jobs
at a littie better pay than they received
before the war. We rnay criticize a man when
lie does not want to go t0 the bush or take
a rough job in the city, but we must recognize the problern and try f0 improve the
situation.
Honourable members, when I refer to the
spy problern I realize that I arn on dangerous
ground. Yet I want f0 be honest with rnyself, if not with you, and say that I think
thse goveranent bas done a pretty good job.
A member from one of our western cities has
recently criticized flie gnvern ment for holding
people for three or four weeks without the
laying of a charge, and denying tlier the
advice of a solicitor. While as a iawyer I
mnust say that I do nlot like this practice, and
while 1 presumne that habeas corpus proceedings couid have been invoked only with
difficixlty under the circumstances, to me
spying on Canada is unforgivabie.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is an absolutely unforgivable sin. It is beyond my under standing wliy anybody sliouid want f0 spy on
Canada. I arn not blaming Russia; it is bier
philosopliy; and if she wants to pay men to do
sucli work tha t is non1e of my business. I do
not think mucli of a country that wiil do it.
Why people would give away secrets of the
country for which our boys and girls have
died is beyond my compreliension. For that
reason I arn not going to criticize the goverament for wliat it bas done. As I said before
I do not like the idea of people being lield
withouf tlie benefif of a legal adviser. But
I happen t0 know the leading counsel for the
goverrent, one of the ablest, men in Canada,
and I arn confident that hie would not for one
moment strike at the freedom of the citizen.
He wouid rather resign than do such a thing.
As long as hie is chief counsel for the government I cannýot imagine that we would do sucli
things uniess tbey were absolutely necessary.
Some -Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Now I corne to the boan
of one and a, quarter billion dollars f0 Great
Britain. It is evident that, for one reason or
another, Canadians as a whole are in favour
of this lan, In addition f0 the boan itself,
we are writing off $425,000,000 owed t0 us by
the U~nited kingdom and extending an interest-free boan of $500,000,000 for a period of

MARCH 20, 1946
five or six years. That amounts to a large
sum of money, but we Canadians recognize
that if we want ta seil goods on world markets
we have got ta lielp Great Britain ta get back
on lier feet. 1 ar n ot defending the loan, on
the ground that Britain is part of the empire
of which we also are a part. I do flot believe
the loan is being made for any sucli reason as
that. On tliý contrary, I think we are making
tihe loan for selfiali reasons; or to put it
an-otfher way, we are mak-ing àl for absolutely
good business reasons.
It is for those reasons that I arn supporting
the loan. 1 may be very kindly disposed
towards the United Kingdom. I may remember that in 1940 Britain alane staod between
us and damntion. I may remember rÉhat
she alone bore 'the brunt of -the Germain air
attack. I understanid tilat enly tihree of tilie
airmen who fouglit in the Battie of Britaix at
that time are naw living. I may remember al
these things and be moved by them, but I
repeat that I arn supporting the loan because
I think it is good business for Canada ta heip
its best customer to get back on lier feet.
The larger the quantity of goods that Britain
is able to buy in Canada, the more will aur
employment be stimulated. In the United
States oonsiderable debate is taking place over
a proposai ta lend Great Britain four billion dollars. It may flot be in thie beet taste
for me ta mention this, but with ail respect
ta aur great neighboiur I want ta point out that
if the American loan bore the same relation
ta, population that aur loan does, it would
be fifteen billion dollars. And it would be
just as good business for the United States ta
make a oain ýto Britaisi as iit is for ug ibo do so.
Tlie next matter I want ta deal with is food,
ta which the Speech from the Throne makes
a lengtliy reference. Undoubtedly there is a
grave shortage of food in many European
cauntries; and the food for which. there is
the greatest demand of ail is wheat. ,An honourable member of another place said that
an acre of wheat, producing fifteen bushels,
will furnisli a million calories of nutrition in
faod for human beings, but if that quantity
of wheat is fed ta hogs the resulting bacon
and ather liard liog produets will have a value
of anly 250,000 calories. The lionourable
gentleman wlio gave those figures knows what
lie is talking about, for lie is the author of a
work whicli is used in universities as a textbook on the subject.
The three prairie provinces are of course
aur largest producers of wheat. and if I mav
presumne ta speak briefiy about agriculture, I
will give a littie background of facto. Last
year the area, in wh*eat was about 23 million
acres, and we liad some 19 million acres in
summerfallow. This was in addition ta tlie

21

acreage in aats, barley, fiax, rye, corn, sugar
beets and other craps. Prior ta the war tlie
acreage in fallow was about 15 or 16 million,
and the lionourable member of the other
bouse suggested tliat it would be wise ta
reduce it ta tliat again until tlie food crisis
in Europe is aver. By so doîng we would
put about four million -additional acres into
tlie production of wlieat. It seems ta me
tliat the world will need tlie largest quantity
of wlieat tliat we can praduce for the next
two, three, or passibly four years. Certainly
Europe will not be able ta get back ta its
maximum production of food this year,
because at least a year or two will have ta
be spent on fertilizing and cultivating before
the land is restored ta praper condition. Sa
1 think that the government, instead of doing
as the Prime Minister îndicated in lis radia
address last Sunday evening, would be well
advised ta encourage western farmers ta
increase tlieir wheat acreage this year ta tlie
extent I liave suggested. Then tliey would
in ail probability produce a far larger quantity of wlieat for shipment abroad.
I knaw some people will say that we sliould
not charge $1.55 for aur wlieat. But in camparisan witli tlie price obtained for otlier
grains having less food value, wlieat is wortli
mucli more tlian this.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Wliat about rye?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Rye is about $2.10, and
is not ta lie compared with wlieat frorn tlie
standpoint of food value. Tlie price depends
not upon Wlint tlie farmer wants ta get for
it, but upan tlie warld market.
I want ta quote from a speech that was
delivered in this chamber by an honourable
member wliose name I will mention wlien I
finish reading. I will state riglit now that
the speech was nat made as recently as this
week or last week. Here is wliat lie said:

until the counbries that have been overrun have
had 'an opportunity to recover, and we maight
help them in that way.
That speech was delivered in this chamber
on the 27th of March, 1942, nearly four years
ago, by the honourable member from South
Bruce (Hon. Mr. Donnelly). How prophetic
were those words!
I am in entire accord with those who urge
that there should be greater production of
food, but, as I said before, the greatest production can take place in wheat. Probably
other honourable members are more qualified
to speak on this question than I am, although
I have been familiar with the growing of
wheat almost since I was a baby. I recall
the time when the highest compliment you
could pay a man was to say of him, "He is
as good as the wheat."
The next problem I wish to deal with is
housing. I think I can hear someone across
the way muttering, "That man is always
talking about housing". Let me say at once
that housing is a desperate problem in our
country. I believe the government's housing
policy has been wrong from the start. You
can never have a piecemeal policy in regard
to housing and hope to get by with it. There
is an innate desire in every man and woman
to own a home. So strong is that desire that
in the war-ravaged areas of Europe people will
go back to the cellars of their wrecked homes
rather than move into otier accommodation
offered to them. When the Rentals Board
issued its first order freezing rents as of October, 1941, they in effect shut down on all
building. I may be told that house building
ceased because lumber and other materials
were needed for war purposes. All right, if
that was so, there would of course be no
further building. But that order discouraged
house building just as effectively as if building
supplies had been shut off dead. Let me ask
honourable members, would any contractor
want to build a house for sale or rent as long
as that order lasted? Certainly not, because
he would not know how far the order was likely
to go. Without conceit, may I be permitted
to relate this personal incident? The order,
I believe, came into effect on October 11.
Property owners in my city were scared stiff.
To those who consulted me I said, "I will give
you the price you wanted for your house on
October 10 plus $500. But don't sell. If you
hold on you will get $1,000 more." As a
matter of fact each of them got $1,500 more
for his house, because when the order went
into effect no new houses or apartments were
built, and there was a scramble to buy houses.
What was the next move of the Rentals
Board? It issued an order declaring that a
Hlon. Mr. HAIG.

landlord could not give his tenant notice to
quit at any time between October and April.
Immediately there was a still greater demand
for houses. I know what I am talking about.
A company of which I am a direotor had
$584,000 worth of houses in Winnipeg, and
was in a bad way. Most of the directors lived
in Ontario and were panic stricken. They had
no need to be, for on every one of its houses
the company realized $1,000 more than the
price current on the ist of October. Similar
conditions prevailed all over Canada, and
today we hear complaints that there has been
profiteering, and that houses are bringing
$2,000 or $3,000 more than they are worth
if the owners can guarantee immediate possession. This state of affairs was inevitable.
First, the Rentals Board froze rents; that
stopped building. Second, it declared that a
tenant could not be displaced between October
and April, and during the other months only
on six months notice; again this jumped the
price payable to any owner who could deliver
possession. Finally the Rentals Board deprived
the owner of any control over his property;
be could not put his tenant out at all. As a
result we have this condition in Winnipegand I presume it is similar in Montreal,
Toronto and other of our cities-that people
are living in houses rented for less than they
are worth and the owners cannot get the
tenants out even if they require possession for
themselves. The only exception is in favour
of a veteran: he can regain possession of his
home.
Then we find the government trying to
build houses. I spoke of this last session.
I notice in the press that no more houses
are to be proceeded with until those now
under construction by private builders are
completed. Last fail the government froze
building materials in order to further its own
building programme. As I have said on former
occasions,
nany of the government-built
houses in the city of Winnipeg are without
basement and other conveniences, and so
lightly constructed that in another five years
they will become dilapidated and fit only
for slum areas. The city authorities agree
to a very low rate of taxation, the cost of
the houses is three or four times what was
estimated, and the city, the federal government and the people generally are losing
money on the venture. The housing situation is in a bad state, and the difficulty is
how to rectify it. In my opinion the first
step would be to pass an order in council
effective, say, on the 2nd of April, declaring
that a person who owned a house before that

MARCH 20, 1946
date and dcsired to occupy it should be at
liberty to resume possession frorn lis tenant
wit.hin three months thereafter.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That order might run
for six months, and then it should be replaced
by another order empowering the purchaser
or owner of a house to obtain possession at
any tirne frorn the lst of April to the lst
of October. The only people who would be
opposed to sucli owner-relief are those now
occupying houses at greatly reduced rentais.
Why would they not be? It is very pleasant
to live in a house worth $6,000 at a rent
appropriate to a $3,000 house. The house
owners hardest hjt are those who five years
prior to 1941 rented their houses for only
$25 a rnontli when they should have brought
$40 or more. I may be told that there are
no such cases. 1 say there are lots of thcm.
I repent, we shall not be able to relieve the
present housing pressure unless we take off
the present rent controls. I can understand
why an officiai of the Rentais Board will
argue that rent controls should not be discontinued. Some people may say it is because
lie wants 'to hold bis job. I do flot think
that is the reason. Rather, I believe hie is
impressed by the 'urgent cases that corne
before him of tenants who want to hold on.
But we lawyers are impressed by the people
who want to get back into their own houses.
Undoubtedly this is a difficuit problem. I
believe it is acute also in the United States.
I understand that in another place the leader
of the government said that Canada was
better off than any other country in regard
to housing. That is no answer to the man
who wants to occupy his own bouse, especially if lie is a returned soldier and his wife
and children 'are living with bis or hier people.
He cornes back and wants to set up lis own
establishiment, but unless lie owned the bouse
and lived in it before the war, lie is out of,
luck.
Now a word, about incorne taxation. I know
it is very easy to say that exemptions sbould
be increaised and taxes reduced, but immediately you are confronted witb the question:
How is the governrnent. to get the rnoney to
carry on the business of the country? I think
we bave reacbed another stage in this discussion, aîid 1 say so not as an expert but as
one wbo considers the subi ect as lie meets it
in bis everyday busineks
Our icorne tax
generally is sucb a burdensomne levy on enterprise and industry that our people can.not accurnulate enougli money to extend present industries or finance new undertakings. I do
not think there is -any doubt about that.
Some Homn. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
ti326"-

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Wbhy should anybody invest bis money ia an enterprise with the expectation of making 7 or 8 per cent when be
is told that the governrnent will take 6 per
cent, and, if lie loses, wilI not assume auy of
bis loss? He puts bis rnoney in govern.ment
bonds. It is done not only here but in tbe
United States, to tbe prejudice of industrial
and commrercial u.ndertakings. The, incorne tax
also diseourages our farrners--at least those. of
the western provinces, of wbor li can speak
with authority. They bave gone out of hog
and, rnilk and butter production because 37
per cent of their ýreturns went to the, government. Wben they confined their operations to
raising grain they found that after paying expenses their' net return just about equalled
their exemption. Therefore, tliey said, "We
won't produce milk and butter, or maise bogs,
and pay that rate of income tax." Make no
mîstake, if you want the Farmer to produce
more butter -and liogs you have got to do two
thîngs: first, you must increase the basic price
to him, and, second, you mnust give hirn a
higlier exemption frorn incorne tax. Otberwise
lie wiIl flot produce, and I do not blarne.hirn.
Any senator wbo was brouglit up on a farm
knows that milking cows and feeding pigs is
a rnuch harder job than sittinez on a binder
cutting grain and then drawing it to tbe
elevator. The one is a nice dlean job, but the
other is bard work 365 days of tbe year, and
those who do it ouglit to get incorne tax relief. True, the farrner's ineome tax now is
based on a five-year average income, but that
does not relieve the situation. Wben tbe
farmer makes up bis tax return lie knows, thaý
if lie shows receipts of $500 from the sale of
hogs, the govermrent will take 37 per cent,
leaving bim only $315 for ah bhis trouble. So
hie says, "Nothing d'oing, I arn quitting that
job.,>
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: What percentage of
farmers pay any incorne tax?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A lot of thern in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. MOLLOY: They do not.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A lot of them in Manitoba.
Saskatchewan and Alberta pay income tax. i
rnay tell rny honourable friend that in Manitoba more farmers pay income tax than any
other ciass of people, and it is the sarne in
Saskatchewan and Alberta. That rnay not be
true of Ontario or Quebec, because there the

I think 1 have oovemed the qustion of taxation, but 1 miglit add that the sarne argumnent

EKISEl E9DITION

SENATE
applies to the excess profits tax. The C.C.F.
follo-wers are saying this is a test of free
enterprise. Honourable senators, there is no
such thing as free enterprise today. When the
tax is paid it is government entierprise.
I may be asked why a man who makes
$10,000 a year should flot pay income tax.
No doubt hie should. During the years fromn
1930 to 1938 a large retail store in the city of
*Winnipeg made a profit every year. It was
the only branch of the company in Canada
whiceh did so. The reason for its successful
operations wau that it had the best manager in
Canada. Hie was probably drawing a salary of
$75,000 a year, and after taxation would have
about $20,000 lef t. Why sbould hie continue
to work? Why should hie not take life easy?
Naturally, that is exactly wbat hie did do. I
suggest that the problem of incorne tax should
be decided with a view to putting people
back into ernployrnent, and enabling private
enterprise to succeed, not on the basis of
whetber we can get enough money to balance
the budget or flot.
On tbe train coming down from Regina
the otber day there was a gentleman wearing
a shirt of a hrownish-beige tone; another
gentleman sitting in tbe pullman had on the
saine kind of shirt. The flrst gentleman said
to tbe other: "Stranger, where did you get my
sbirt?" The reply was: "I bought it in
Minneapolis." "Wby," said tbe flrst fellow,
"I botight. mine in tbe city of Winnipeg."
These two gentlemen got to comparing notes,
and it was disclosed tbat tbe shirt bought in
Minneapolis bad cost $7.50, and tbe one bought
in Winnipeg only $3.75. We may say that is
very well for Canada from the price standpoint, but the fact is that tbe company making
those sbirts could not make and selI tbem in
Canada for $3.75 unless it was allo-wed to seli
tbema in the United States for 87.50. The
company whi'cb made t.hose'shirts operates in
tbe city of Montreal. We may have to let
up on taxation in order to remedy sucb a
condition, and in order to permit free enterprise and industry to get going.
Hon. Mr. EULER: And increase the
national debt?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We may bave to increase
tbe deht.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I arn not objecting to it,
but tbat will be the natural result.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We are going through a
time when ordinary metbods do not app]y.*
We are dealing with a world in chaos. When
the boys wbo were overseas tell us about a
group of nine hundred planes flying over a
city, eacb dropping six and a baîf tons of
Hon. Mr. HAIG0.

bombs, we cannot imagine much of that city
being lef t. That happened night after night,
day after day, until everything was destroyed.
To get things going again a wealthy country
like ours, which suffered none of the ravages
of war, rnust hear its share of the burden, and
probably increase its debt. Why are we
lending Britain $1,250,000,000 except to get
that country going? Why is the United
States lending hier so much rnoney? Wby are
we lending $710,000,000 to the other countries of the world when tbey rnay even be
coming back for more? It is to get these
countries started in business agamn My argument is that we may have to lend money to
ourselves in order to get things going.
Honourable senators, I have deait with all
my topies except the question of foreign
policy. No goveranental body in tbe world
bas a better opportunity for taking a really
active interest in foreign policy tban has
this house. This is one field in wbich we
can make a real contribution. We should
study foreign affairs and give tbemn our best
consideration frorn time to tirne. The city
of Winnipeg stands on the higbway between
two of the greatest nations of the world today
-the United States and Russia; and if a
stîruggle sbould ever arise between tbern, I
bope I may be able to move from Winnipeg
to Mon treal or some other place where there
will be less excitement. Our salvation, in my
.iudgrnent. lies flrst in the British Commonwealth of Nations. 1 tbink the best hope for
Canada is to stick with the British Empire.
Our next strongest hope is a wbole-hearted and
friendly relationsbip with our neighbours to
tbe soutb. Our third hope is in the United
Nations Organization, which 1 believe will
be a great instrument for peace.
As a Canadian, and as leader of my party in
tbis bouse. 1 can say that flrst of aIl we sbould

take our stand as a loyal supporter and coinponent part of the British Empire; next we
should join hands in good will witb the people
of the United States; thirdly we should
support the United Nations Organization to

the limit of our ability, in the hope that it
will ho an instrument for peace in the years
to corne.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators. witb the indulgence of

as government leader to follow tbe precedent
established last year. and to confine myself

possible, thus permitting you to enjoy sucli
excellent speeches as we have had the pleasure
-of listening to, including -thoïse of the mover
and the seconder of the Address in reply to
the Speech frora the Throne.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I wish tVo
compliment the mover of tihe Address on the excellence of -the materiai whiob he placed, before
us, and -the splendid diction wit-h which he presented it. May I extend tihe sanie compliment
teo the seconder. While it has flot been my good
fortune to have lis Vened before to a speech by
the mciver, the seconder is an old and personal
friend, and the excellence of bis address did
not corne to me as a surprise. I have seen
him in action on many occasions, and I know
that bis talent la by no means exbausted.
During this debate I trust that more of the
junior members will avail themselves of the
opportunity to discuss public affairs, for I arn
confident that their experience bas qualified
them. Vo do se in an entertaining and instructive manner.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I join witb
the leader opposite in welcoming Vo Canada
bhe new Governor Generai, who soon will be
sworn into office in this chamber. He already
bas a connection witb this country. As the
honourable leader opposite bas stated, many
Canadians had the proud privilege of serving
under bis distinguished command. I also
should like to express my pleasure at the
possibility that the Royal Princesses will- visit
Canada, an event to wbich reference was made
in the Address passed by thig bouse.
H-onourable senators, I do noV wish Vo say
much on the Speech froin the Throne because
there is another speaker Vo follow, *and I
deaire Vo give him ample time. I do wisb, however, -to refer to -the espionage inquiùy w-hiôh
bas had such a profound effeot upon Canada.
'Phe serions concern expressed by the people of
Canada regarding tbe strict measuýres taken
in connection with this inquiry was very heartening. Altbough the public as a wh'ile did not
-in the early stages have -the knowiedge wbicb
they now possess, there was notable opposition
to the taking of any steps whicb wou'ld interfere with the liberty of the individual. That
is a healthy condition. One thing tühat we
have fought for is the liberty of the individual,
and if the time should ever corne when the
people are net exercised about such a matter,
it will be a sad day for Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do net believe
that by reason. of wbat bas taken place any
saored righV bas been jeopardized. I do not
believe that this government, or indeed, any
future government, dare trifle wit-h sny such
right unless it is prepared Vo assume the
responsibility of provning in the court of public
opinion th-at its action was entirely justified.
Any government which could flot justify its
action, both ini parLiament and out, would be
ruthlessly deaIt with by public opinion. On the
other hand, honourable senators, if the governmnen , faced witbh the great responsibility
of getting Vo the bottom of such an aif air,
undertook Vo srnootb it over, or took any
but the most drastic action, public opinion
would deal with it just as ruthlessly. We are
going through what I believe -to be a great
experience. I persone.lly welcome the public
agitation and conoern. I arn hoping that wlhen
aIl the facts are known there will be complete
justification for the measures taken, extrerne
as they may bave been.
May I say a word iregarding international
complications. Whatever interpretation may
be placed on such matters as I have referred
to, I think that there is no disposition lin tbis
country to, be *otherwise than frîendly with
every other country in. the world.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Whalever May
flow from this, we have no designs of any
kind againet any other nation, for the people
of Canada desire nothing more than to live
and let live. If there la any country on the
face of the globe that wishes to live on
friendly terras with every other country, no
matter how widely it may differ in race,
religion or colour, it is this Canada of ours.
Horwe ver necessary it may become to put our
own bouse in order, I arn sure that the people
of this Dominion are anxious not to impair
their good relations with other freedom-loving
and peaceful peoples in every part of the
world.
I feel that this is one of the most important
matters that bas ever corne before Parliament,
and, I arn glad that public men have exercised
sucb restraint. in referring to it. IV bodes well'
for our future that tbough we are concerned
with the implications of this affair we are able
to consider it ca'lrly in aIl its aspects.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN:
Honourable
senators, in accordance witb the kindly parliamentary custom, I wish first of ail to congratulate the mover and the seconder of the
Address. I have been a member of this
chamber now fer nine years, and I want to
say iii aIl frankness that 1 do not rernember
any speeches te which I bave listened here

SENATE
with greater pleasure than I did to those
delivered yesterday afternoon by the honourable gentleman from Nipissing (Hon. Mr.
Hurtubise) and the honourable gentleman
from Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill).
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

This is the first
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
opportunity I have had! to meet and address
my colleagues in this house since my return
at the end of December last from the conference of the Preparatory Commission of the
United Nations Organization in London, at
which, as honourable senators are aware, I
was one of the delegates representing the
Parliament of Canada. and, in particular, the
Senate. It seems to me that on this occasion
it is my duty to offer to honourable members
a few observations, firstly, on the work of the
Preparatory Commission in London and the
general international situation as it was when
the conference was held, and secondly, on
the international situation as it bas since
developed. I feel it is all the more necessary
to do this because of the sombre and forbidding scene which now faces us when we
look at what appear to be the developing
relationships of the different countries of the
world today.
There is a further reason, if indeed there
need ie one, for my offering a few remarks
on international inatters this afternoon, and
that is to bc found in the Speech from the
Throne. In what is perhaps its most pregnant
paragraph the Speech says:
It is only i.i the light of the word situation
that al our probleme can be seen in true perspective. The future of our own and of every
codn'try depends upon success in the task of
world 'reconstruct'ion, and the establishment of
an. enduring peace. Many of the measures you
will be called upon to consider at the present
session wil1 be concerned with this wider aspect
of 'himan affairs.
If there be one further reason why I need
make no apology for trenching on these matters, it is to be found in the latter part of the
eloquent speech to which we have just listened
from the honourable leader on the other side
(Hon. Mr. Haig), wherein lie referred to the
duties and opportunities of this house in the
field of international affairs.
Now, first, I should like to offer a few observations with regard to the Preparatory
Commission itself. As honourable senators are
aware, its work was more or less of an organizational nature. The Commission was charged
with the duty of preparing a lot of material
for the meetings of the General Assembly and
the Security Council which were held in London during the next month, January. Perhaps
the best way of indicating the work that the
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

Preparatory Commission had to do would be
by comparing the United Nations Organization
to a commercial company. The Organization
had its charter, which was approved at San
Francisco, but before operations could be commenced it was necessary for the incorporators
ta meet, enact bylaws and generally ta settle
upon the way in which business should be
carried on. To put it another way, the conference of the Preparatory Commission was
the organization meeting of the United Nations.
Here I should like ta make some reference
to the Canadian delegation ta the Commission. As honourable members know, it consisted of represenlatives of our three major
parties, and a non-political chairman, in the
person of our able Ambassador to Russia, Mr.
Wilgress. But in spite of the fact that the
delegation comprised Liberals. Conservatives
and a member of the C.C.F., we were never
divided by any political differences. All our
discussions ended in unanimous decisions as
to the attitude that should be taken by us as
a group at meetings of the Commission or as
individual members of any oammittee. In that
way, I submit, we did, in fact represent the
people of Canada as a whole, for I think it
will be admitted that whatever differences of
opinion Canadians may have as to internal
matters, on questions of international policy
they are in substantial agreement. Perhaps
in this respect I shouild make one exception.
There is a negligible minority of "pinks" and
fellow travellers, whose ideas on international
affairs are subject to the strangest variations
from time to time. You never can tell at any
given moment what the position of thcse
gentlemen will be: al you can say is that it
will net be governed in the first instance by
the interests of Canada, since these gentlemen
look elsewhere for their inspiration and spiritual refreshment.
I should like to refer also to the technical
advisers who accompanied our delegation to
London. In the main they were permanent
officers of the Department of External Affairs.
I do not think it will do any harm if I say
here, as I have already had occasion to say
elsewhere, that I greatly admire the calibre of
the members of the Department of External
Affairs who served as our technical advisers at
the conference. In this particular period, when
international affairs are becoming so very
important to Canada, I think we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the
Department of External Affairs is so ably
staffed.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Hear, hear.
lon. Mr. HUGESSEN: There is another
observation that comes ta my mind. At the
conference one could not help observing the

MARCH 20, 1lm
high position that Canada has attained among
the nations of the world. Fifty-one nations
were represented there, and in looking over
the list you could see that by any method of
calculation Canada stood at least sjxth. Canada's high status was fuily recognized by the
representatives of other countries with whom
we were brought into contact. 1 might perhaps add without boasting that, we, the delegates from Canada, tried to live up to the
reputation of our country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: We took an active
part in ail the deliberations, we attended ail
the committees of which Canada was a member, we submitted many papers and suggestions, and quite a number of those were
adopted ei'ther in whole or in part in tihe comnmission's final report.
In the fourth place, I should like to make
an observation of perh'aps a more general
character about the value of international
conferences of this kind. They have a technique of their own which to one familiar
with parliamentary procedure is very interesting, 'and rather different from parliamentary technique. They are rather slow in
getting going, and you can appreciate that
when you have representatives of many peoples
speaking many different languages, and having
different ideas, different backgrounds, different
interests, it takes time for ail of them to reach
common ground, to find a 'Place where their
minds will meet and where fruitful progress
can be made. Another factor of course is
the language difficulty. In the Preparatory
Commission the officiai languages were.
English and French, but, as you can readily
realize. there were a very large number of
representatives from other countries to whom
neither English for French was a mother
tongue and who had a good deal of difficulty
at tirnes in adapting themselves to the proceedings carried on in those two languages.
That too is one of the limitations which an
international conference inevitahly- runs into.
Ail I can say is tha-t those obstacles wère
eventually surmounted in the Preparatory
Commission.
Again dealing with the general question of
the value of international conferences, there
are considerations >on the other side which
tend to help, because after ail, honourable
senators, any body of fifty men of reasonable intelligence and average good will carinot sit around a table day after day and
week after week without reaching some kind
of mutual understànding or even evoking a
certain degree of what I may' eal esprit de
corps. There is a common interest in the
success of wliat by degrees you have corne to

.27

regard as a common enterprise. That is onie
reason-and you could see it working in the
Preparatory Commission-why international
conferences have a value in themselves, and
for that reason I am glad to know that the
present era is an era of international confer-,
ences. I amn disposed to ask myself whether
the most substantial value we shahl get out of
the United Nations Organization is not exactly
bhatý-.that it, d1oes make provisio3n for international conferences of aill kinds and on ail
levels of human interest. There are the
periodic conferences of the General Assembly,
continuous discussions in the Security Council, meetings of the Social and Economic
Council, and of course international meetings
of the various specialized bodies, such 'as the
International Bank, the International Civil
Aviation Organization, the Food and Agrîcultural Organization, and so forth. Perhaps
one of 'the principal values of th-is U.nited
Nations Organization will be in developing a
technique of international discussion, leading,
as one will always hope, to international understanding over, far wider fields of human activity than has ever been the case before.
Finaliy, I should add,-again without any
particular pride-that the work of the Preparatory Commission was in fact crowned with
success, and, that after four arduous weeks it
terminated its labours just before Christmas
and presented a unanim'ous repo rt of some 150
pages to the General, Assembly, which was to
meet in London in the following January.
Honourable senators will, I know, be interested in my observations as to the attitude
of the Russian delegates to the Preparatory
Commission. and there are, I think, a few
things which shoulct be said on that point.
Generafly speaking, it seemed to us that the
Russian delegates were just as anxJous as anybody else to make a success of the conference.
Next, it was perfectly clear that they were
very 9trictly bound by their instruction-?,from
Moscow, and that they had very little leeway
or latitude as to what they could agre toz
On occasion we would notice in a co.mmittee
meeting that either the meeting would be
adýjourned or somebody would talk rather unnecessarily and without very much point, sole1y
for the purpose of having the meeting continued until the next day or the day after, in
order that the Russian delegates might get
further instruptions from their headquarters.
The next point that struck us very forcibly
was that as to the functions 'of the United
Nations Organization thé Russian 'delegates
took a slightly different'vieWpoint from the
viewpoint which is, I think, generally taken b'
the western demnocratic nations'. The Rusgians
Wnélined te place the emphasis almost enti eily

28

SENATE

on power, on the United Nations Organization
beia.g an organization d*ominateL by the Great
Powers and having the capacity to prevent
aggressjon in the future. One can und.erstand
that viewpoint in the light of the history of
the Iast twenty-five years.
Twice in that
period Russia has been invaded and brutally
attacked by German armies from the west.
The resuit of that attitude was that the
Russians put emphasis almost entirely upon
the Security Council.
They rather played
down the other organizations, the Economic
and Social Council and the General Assembly,
and at one time they even went so far as to
suggest that the Security Counicil should ha
served bv an entirely separate and distinct
secretariat of its own. It is true to say that
generally speaking there were a number of
differences of opinion between the representatives of the western democracies and the representatives of the Soviet Union and the states
which think as it does. Those differences were
solved cither by some reasonable compromise
or, in one or two cases, by a straight vote in
committee.
Usually that vote resulted in
defeat for the Russian point of view, but they
took no umbrage at that and seemed to be
perfectly willing to go ahead. On the whole
1 took away the impression from the commission that the western democracies can work
with the Soviet Union, although sometimes it
is going to be a difficuit and delicate job and
we shall need infinite patience and a firm
adherence to principles.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That, it is only fair
to say, was at the end of December. It is
quite useless to, deny that in the interval our
relations with the Soviet Union have grown
steadily worse. I want to be completely
moderate and unprovocative in everthing I
say, but I do flot hesitate to make the statement that the main responsibility for this
unhappy development lies with the present
rulers of Russia who are in charge of ber
foreign policy.
Let me recail to you the story of the hast
three inonths as reflected by the inspired
Soviet radio, by the inspired Soviet press
and by the equalhy inspired actions of *Mr.
Vishinsky at the- Security Council in London.
What is that record but a succession of
bitter attacks against Great Britain and
British policy in various parts of the worhd,
a war of nerves against two small countries
on the southern borders of Russia-Turkey
and Iran-coupled now with apparent refusai
to carry out ber solemn word to evacuate ber
troops froîn the latter country by the first of
March? It is significant that in the last two
Hoz.

Mr. HUGWSEN.

days this war of nerves has been extended to
the next little country south of Iran, that is
to say Iraq.
Apologists for Soviet policy say that its one
great aim is not foreign aggression but security
of Russia's borders, so that she can turn lier

attention to ber internai development which
is so badly needed. Týhat may ha so. I sincerely hope it is so. I arn willing to go a very
long way with the Soviet Union in its policy
of assuring its own security and guaranteeing
its own borders. Any honourable senator who
remembers my remarks in thc course of a
speech I made hast October will bear me out
in that. But if security, and security alone,
is the present

Soviet

policy, one

may be

pcrmitted to ask: Why these attacks against
Great Britain? If seourity, and security atone,
is their policy, I refuse to believe that smalh
countries like Turkey or Iran or Iraq are
threatening the mighty Soviet- Union. To

pretend -that they are doing so is to me arrant
nonsense. These and other recent actions of

the Russian government in various parts of
the world have led the rest of the world to
ask the question so pertinently put by Senator Vandenberg in the United States Senate
a few days ago, "What is Russia up to?" The
fear lias been openly expressed that these
proeceding-s are the first step in a program of
aggression, of trampling on the rights of small
nations and of a bid for world domination
along the lines made onhy too familiar to us
by Hitler's Reich in the years before the last
war.
.There may be some element of truth in
that,
but I arn inchined to believe, and in any event
I most sincerely hope, that -thýat is by no means
the whole explanation. After all, it mýay be
that the present Russian pýol-icy is compounided
3fa number of elements, including one very
human desire, having seen your hereditary
enemies swept off the face of the earth-to
get what you can while the going is good.
But I amn inclined to believe that a good
deal of the recent provocative display may
have been due to discontent or war weariness
of the Soviet Union's population.
An Hon. SENATOR: Th-at is right.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Bear this in mind,
honourable senators: Russia lias suffered far
worse injury and devastation from the recent
war th-an any other of the United Nations.
Her industries were completely destroyed west
of a lina running all the way from Leningrad
to the Black Sea, and she suffered an immense
losa of population, a loss which some persons
have estimated as high as 20,000.000 peophe.
If anybody is suffering from war weariness at
the poeesent time. su.raiy it is the people of
Russia. Their standards of living are not very

MARCH 20, 19469
high, and they have a long way -to go yet
before they rittain the level attained by the
western democracies.
We muet bear in mirai that Russia has an
authoritarian government, and that it has
not got the safety valves to which we are
accustomed for a situation of this kind.
There is no parliamentary opposition, nor is
there a free press. An authoritarian govemment cannot afford te admit that anything ie internally wrang. It must affi.rm, and
continue to affirm. çbhat ail is well. In spite of
al thýat, if something does go wrong and the
people are discontented and suffering from
war weariness, then it -muet immediately find
some internai or external enemy on which
te blame its troubles. The most striking
example of that was Hitler and the Jewish
race, on whomn le succeeded in saddling the
responsibiiity for everything th-at went wrong
in *Zie German Reich, and whom he made
the -apegoat for &Il of bis own mistakes.
During the war it was easy for us ta find
scapegoats, and it was equally easy for Soviet
Russia to find them in the persans of Messrs.
Those individuwls.
Hitler and Mussolini.
however, no longer exis,. It is necessary to
find other scapegoats as best you cari with
whatever substitutes you have at hand. Now,
therefore, Soviet publications and Soviet radio
are attacking Great Britain, accueing her of
imperialistie conspiracy, -and att*ackinag Iran
and Turkecy and aocueing tbem of plots againet
the safety of the U.S.S.R.; and every now and
again, by way of variety, they take a wailop
at the Catholie Churcli.
Countries and .religious institutions are impersonal things. IV is much more satisfact'ory
Vo attack an :individual whoma you can hold
up as an arch-type of infamy. If sucb an
individual does net exist, lie bas to be created.
Sa it was, honourable senators, that as soon
as our own Prime Minister -made hie first
public.statement on the epy investigation, the
people of Canada woke up one morning ta
the astonishing fact that Mr. King was a
Fascist and an anti-labour reactionary of the
deepest dye. The Soviet press said so; the
Soviet radio said so, and se, of course, it muet
be true. Worse than that, .they charged that
Mr. King had inspired the newspapers cf
Canada ta indulge in a bitter anti-Soviet pres
campaign.
Now, let us dwell on that for a moment:
our Prime Minister inspired the newspapers of
Canada te undertake an anti-Soviet pres
campaign. Does that not hring a fascinating
and rather fanciful picture to the miniWs eye?
I can see aur Prime Minister summoning, ta
hie office the editors of, let us say, the Toronto
Globe and Mail-

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: -the Ottawa Journal and the Montreal Gazette, and ordering
them-to conduet ail anti-Soviet campaign. I
just wish to point out the sort of absurdity
to which Soviet propaganda was reduced in its
search for foreign scàpegoats. Surely even the
dullest of dull wits among the Labour Progressive people muet have begun, to realize in
time that the picture furnishecl by the Soviet
propaganda of the Fascist, anti-Labour Mr.
King was somewhat out of focus.
By a happy chance at this particular junctaire Winston Churchill made hie Fuleicm speech.
I do not propose ta comment on that speech,
heoause opinions will d.iffer botb as to its
contents and as to wbether or not it shoud
have been made at that particular time. On
those subjects I offer no comment, but I do
say it was a fortunate circumstance for the
It enabled them to
Soviet propagandise.
escape trom the ridiculous muddle into which
they had got by their attitude toward Mr.
King, and to turn their undivided attention
to Mr. Churchill. Mr. King was forgotten,
but within a few days every school child in
the Soviet union had been told that Mr.
Churchill, with his race-creed of Anglo-Saxon
domination of the world, was the Hitler of
tomorrow.
I venture to repeat that it is quite conceivable. indeed I think it quite probable,
that a good deal of the huffing and puffing
that we have heard from Moscow during the
past three months has been for internai
consumption.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: At least it has been
the only substitute that the Soviet systemn bas
to offer for a firet class internai, row in the
parliament or congress of a democratic country.
On the other hand there have been certain
ominous-symptoms in the proceedings of these
three menthe which it would be folly to ignore.
I refer again to the failure te carry out solemn
treaties and agreements, as in the case of
Iran and possibly also Manchuria; to, the
tendency te ignore the rights of amal peoples,
and to -the war of nerves which is apparenLly
being conducted against Turkey and Iraq.
These things are taking place at distances far
remnoved. froma Canada, but we should nlot
make the mistake of thinking that they do
not concern us. We must remember that the
murder of an Austrian archduke in a remote
Bosmian tewn in June, 1914, cost the lives of
50,000 young Canadiens within the next four
years. The csases of the second Great War

SENATE
were equally remote from us, but nevertheless
we became involved with the consequences,
of which you are aware.
What then shouid be the attitude of this
country at the present time in facing up to
the as yet unanswered question: "What is
Russia up to?" I have three suggestions to
offer. The first is that we should keep our
heads. Particularly let us keep a sharp lookout for propaganda masquerading as news, and
regard sensational stories with suspicion. The
press today is full of remarkable tales. Of
course one must admit that all the special
correspondents have to earn their living. But
some of these stories are in themselves selfcontradictory. I remember only last week
reading in two parallel columns of a local
newspaper, first, a report that Russian forces
in Iran were moving toward the Turkish
bordeî, and secondly, a positive statement that
all the roads between Iran and the Turkish
border were fifteen feet deep in snow and
completely impassable. So we should be very
careful about believing every word of these
reports that we bear from time to time.
My second suggestion is that when considering the Soviet Union we should avoid
the tendency to go to extremes either of
praise or of blame. We all meet people today
who seem to be inclined. to blame the Soviet
Union for all of our present troubles. I
think they might be reminded that without
the bravery and self-sacrifice of the Russian
armies and the Russian people the war would
not have been won, and that Hitler would
still be dominant in Europe. At the opposite
extreme some people tend to treat everythmg
which comes from Soviet Russia with uneritical
admiration. To those people one might suggest this thought: leave that sort of thing to
the fellow travellers-to the Bucks and the
Ryersons. and the Roses-whose business it
is, and who no d'oubt receive their reward in
due season. I suggest that the proper mental
attitude for us to take towards the Soviet
is one of friendly but critical reat-ism. I think
we should willingly and freely admit their
position as a great nation, but make quite
clear to them that we are neither taken in
by their propaganda nor intimidated by their
threats.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My third and last
suggestion is in line with that of my friend
the leader opposite, that we should pin our
faith te the United Nations Organization and
loyaily stand by our obligations under the
Hton. Mr. HUGESSEN.

the bouse two of the obligations which 'appear
in the preamble te the charter.
To «'eaffi'nn faith in. fundamentail mighte, in the

eqal rights of men and women and of nations
lerge and smali, and

To establish conditions under which justice
and -respect for the obligations arising from
treaties and other sources of international law

can be maintained.
At this particular juncture I should be inrlined to be a little more specific. I should
like to sec Canada's official spokesman make
it abundantly clear to the Soviet Union, and
indeed to all the world, that this country
stands for the respect of treaties and the
rights of small nations, as we are bound to
do under the preamble of the charter of the
United Nations, whether those small nations
happen to be Turkey, Iran or any others. We
need net repeat what has been said by Mr.
Ernest Bevin, or by Secretary Byrnes on that
subject; but we should leave no doubt in the
minds of anyone anywhere that those are the
sentiments of the Canadian people, and that
on them they are prepared to take their
stand.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, with leave, I desire ta move:
That the senators menbioned in 'the report
of 4he Committee of Selection ais having heen

Senate, to coneider any niatter -affecting the
internail econoiny of -the -Senate, -andi suoh oomibitee shal1l report the resuit of such canvideration ta the Senate for action.
This is the customary motion with respect
to standing committees.
At this time I should like to repeat what
was said by the Chairman of the Committee
of Selection (Hon. Mr. Copp) when lie presented the report. It is impossible for that
committee to anticipate with absolute accuracy the preferences of every honourable senator as to committee membership. Therefore,
if any honourable senators who do not desire
to sit on certain committees for which they
have been named, or who would like to be
members of committees in which they are noV
included, will notify me within a reasonable
time, I will undertake to meet their wishes as
far as possible, and ta make a specific motion
to authorize the changes desired.
Honý. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators
there is just one suggestion that I wish ta
make. It is not offered in any spirit of
criticismn at aIl, for the honourable leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) hs
acted with the utmost kindness and courtesy
in this whole matter. But on lookiing over
the list I notice that from one committee
there have been .omitted the naines of two
senators who,. I think, should be members
of it. I am noV sure whether this is an appropriate ime Vo mention their names.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should be quite
willing ta have the names mentioned now, but
it occurs ta me -that othe changes may be
proposed after the report of the Committe6

31

of Selection has been studied for a day or
two, and I think it would be wiser ta deal
with themn ail at the same turne. There probably will be requests for additions ta and
withdrawals from some committees.,
Hon. Mr. HA'IG: Then I will not press my
suggestion at the moment. My reason for
bringing it up is that the two honourable
senators I have in mind are intensely interested in and well qualified ta deal with the
matters that corne before a certain committee.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Would it not be well
for the two leaders to discuss this privately,
so as ta avoid mentioning the names of the
two senators concerned unless 'there is a
motion for their appointment?
Hon. Mr. HLAIG: I have no intention of
mentinng their names at present.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Robertson was
agreed ta.
JOINT'COMMIITEE ON THE
RESTAURANT
MESSAGE TO THE flOUSE 0F COMMONS

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that a
message be sent ta the House of Commons by
one of the Clerks at the Table, ta in'form
that Huse that honourable senators, as
named in the report of the Committee of
Selection, have been appointed a committee
ta assist the Honourable the Speaker in, the
direction of the Restaurant of Parliament, s0
far as the interests of the Senate are concerned, and ta act on behaîf of the Senate as
members of a Joint Committee of bath
houses on the said Restaurant.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, I
would respectfully suggest that as soon as
the House of Commons section of this joint
committee is appointed his honour the
Speaker should request an eàrly meeting, so
that the committee may exercise a real inluence on the policy of the restaurant.
Usually there is considerable delay in calling
the committee members tiogether. If there
is a lapse of two or three months, the session
is haîýf over before they meet, and we lose
much of the benefit of any proposais that they
may make. I have a suggestion, Vo place before
the joint committee. I shall not diaclose its
nature, but I may say 'it is not about.sugar.
An Hon. SEN-ATOR: WhaV about butter?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do noV say it is not
about butter.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: There is none.
As a member of the joint committee for a
good many years, I- would ask that adequate
notice be given of its meetings. The comn-

SENATE
mittee is eonvened only once a session, and
usually the members are notified only a day
or so in advance.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable members,
there are seventeen senators on the Joint
Committee on the Library, and twenty-one
on the Joint Committee on Printing; but
when it cornes to the Joint Comm-ittee on the
Restaurant, we have only seven m-embers.
This is an anomaly which could be corrected
by an amendment to our Standing Orders,
whereby the num!ber of senators to sit on
joint committees with members of the flouse
of Commons would be based, -on the relative
memberships of the two houises--that la on
the basis 96 to 245.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I shall be glad
to note the suggestions made, with a view to
acting on them.
The motion was agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN

REPLY

The Senate resumed froin yesterday the
(onsideration of H-is Excellency the Governor
General's Speech at the opening of the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Hurtubise
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. JOHN ALEXANDER McDONALD:
Honourable senators, 1 wish first, to associate
myseif with the previnus speakers in their
compiimentary references concerning the able
speeches of the mover and the seconder of
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. 1 wish also to take this opportunity
of congratulating our leaders on both sides
of the house, and as well, the chairman and
the many members of committees, on the
gond work they did last session. Particular
reference should be made to the Special
Committee appointed to inquire into the
workings and the provisions of the Income
War T-ax Act and the Excess Profits Týax Act
of 1940. Ail honourable members, I amn sure,
are pleased that this cnrnmittee has been reappointed. We hope that it may complete ite
labours this session, and that its recommandations, approved by the Senate, will be of considerable assistance to the governrnent in
improving and simplifying the methods of
assessment and collection of taxes.
Ail honourable senators will join with me,
I am sure, in expressing thanks to kind
Providence for the very many blessings enjoyed by the people of our nation since we
met here lqst session. We in this country
were indeed a high.ly favoured people during
the war yea.rs. It must not be forgotten that
it was our young men and young women in
Hdn.

Mr. HARDY.

the active service forces who bore the brunt
of battie. In this critical period of reconstruction we must flot fait .them.
During these troubled yaars our people at
home also gave of their best, but, comparad
to the people of the -allied nations of Europe
and Asia, they worked under most favourabla
conditions.
I arn sure we are ail very much plaased
that Canada has bean able to make such a
notable contribution to, the fond supply of
these war-ravaged people. I believe I express
the sentiments of aill hýonourable mambers
when I say that, we, as a people, are willing
to do even more, even though this furthar
contribution may nacassitate a reduction of
aur own fond supplies.
Our Prime Minister and the members of
his governmant deserve the thanks of ail of us
for their outstanding war service and for
the large bo.dy of progressive and helpfîll
legislation which already lias been passed and
made effective for the reconstruction period.

I

would

express the hope

common to

ail members of this ehamber that the
Senate may be of avar-increasing service
to aur country in these critical times of rehabilitation and reconstruction. To this end
I trust that the govarnment mýay place greaýter
responsihilities on the members of this house.
While 1 shall defer furthar discussion of this
question until I have had a greater opportunity of studying if, perhaps I may say now
that in my opinion the Senate is composed
of as capable men as can be found-men with
stuccessful business and political experiance,
and a high standard of intelligence which
should enable them ta be of greater service
ta their country.
May I join with honourable mambers who
have pnid their respects ta the belovad
niemory of those of aur number who have
passed on since the close of last session?
The Honourable C. E. Tanner, native of
Pictou, Nova Scotia, was a leader i -municipal
and provincial government affairs ln his native
province before heing summoned f0 the
Sonate. In Nova Scotia and in other parts
of the dominion there are a great many
people who feel that ln his passing there has
heen lost ta them a true friand and an outstanding parliamentarian.
The Honourable
Duncan Marshall was hest known ta me

when he was Minister of Agriculture for the
province of Ontario. He was an outstanding
agriculturalist, journalist and publisher, and
will he greatly missed by a very large circle
of friands.
On this occasion, the first on which I have
had an oppnrtunity of speaklng in this
chamber. may I express my sincere apprecia-

MARCH 21, 1"46
tion of the kind reception accçorded me by
s0 many honourable senators on both sides
of the house. The honour is deeply appreciated, and I hope that I may be of some
service, to the people of this dominion.
The Speech from the Throne contains a
reference to the history-making international
conferences held in recent months. I trust
that honourable senators will'be given an
opportunity to hear first-hand reports from
Canada's representatives at the United Nations Assembly, and that time will permit of
a free and frank discussion of the subjectmatter of its deliberations. Honourable senators, I arn sure, eni oyed and profited by the
speech delivered by the honourable member
f rom Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) yesterday afternoon. We have gone far enough i
an honest attempt to establish an organisation for the keeping of peace to know that
the task ahead is gomng to be most difficult,
and one which will require the whole-hearted
co-operation of allied peoples. We pray that
the officers of and delegates to the Assembly
may possess the wisdom, patience and tolerance necessary to make it a success. Another
body that, 'during this and future sessions,
should command much of our time and
thought-especially that of members of the
Natural Resources Committee-is the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation.
It is important thàt every effort should be
made, through publicity, to educate the people
of the United Nations with regard to the
constitutions and. aims of these international
organisations and the progress which they
are making.
Very important national-provincial meetings
-have been held during recent months. I 1,efer
particularly to, the conferences seeking an
agreement between the federal and provincial
authorities on financial relations. Upon such
an agreement depend to a large degree the
taxation structure and other factors essential
to stability and general economie welfare.
Future fiscal needs must enter very largely
into the discussions at these meetings. The
problems that arise are not easy to solve. It
is encouraging to hear that progrees is being
made, for this conference muet not fail.
I should like to speak briefiy about the
industries with which 1 am most familiarindustries which engage the attention of aur
primary producers, who comprise about onethird of our people.
The primary producers of Canada have a
proud war record, both as ta enlistments in
the active service forces and as producers. In
the last full year of active warfare the grose
value of ail agricultural production reached
a record of $2,256,000,000. Increased food pro-

33

duction has filled ail available shipping space
to the United Kingdom, and has made possible
an 8 per cent step-up in domestic consumption. Canada has led the world granaries in
wheat exports since 1939. Feed grain production was stepped up to allow a 37 per
cent increase in live stock feed. Owing to
curtailnent in hog production and unfavourable weather conditions, farm production in
1945 was about 15 per cent less in volume and
8 per cent less in value than in 1944. The
wonderful increase in wartime agricultural
production-40 per cent over that of prewar times-was accomplished with 23 per cent
fewer men available for farm work.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: This great record
shows that farmers will produce in needed
quantities and will earn sufficient to improve
their standard of living, provided prices are
high enough to give them the stimulus for
an all-out effort.
And may I say that the production record
of lumbermen and fishermen is equally good.
We must neyer again permit the existence of
those môst unfortunate conditions of pre-war
times, when in too many instances farmers
and fishermen were producing and marketing
their goods at less than cost. We can ail
remember when butter for instance was selling at ýfroin 22 to 24 cents a pound, a price
quite a bit below the cost of production, and
when eggs were a few cents a dozen, and fish
brought from 75 cents to $1.50 a hundredweight. 1 should point out that at the time
when fish was selling at those prices in opr
ports, the price paid to fishermen in New
England ports was a-bout 3.50).
Hon. Mr. DUFF: There is a lot of duty on
our fish going over there.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Yes, the duty is
heavy.
Now, honourable senators, I amn going to
deal for a few moments with some of the
probleme of Canada's primary producers to
which I have given considerable thought over
a comparatively long time. I was born on a
farm; I have worked on ferms of my own.
For twelve years 1 had a fairly wide experience in the Department of Agriculture at
Halifax.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: It is because af
my experience that I am going to mention st
few things which I think would heip ta
correct somne of the problems af primary
prodbcers. I amn also going ta suggest what
I thin-k would be at ieast a partial solution
of our housing and unemployment problerna.

SENATE

During the war years it was not difficult
to predict the course of agriculture, as there
was an almost certain market for all the
primary products that we coulid produce.
This w-as true of the products of the farm,
the sea, the forest and the mines. Now that
the war bas ended, it is very difficult to predict
what is ahead. Unfortunately for the welfare
of all other classes in the dominion, as well
as of the primary producers, the uncertainty
of the future is a most unhealthy state of
affairs. I cont.cnd, and I think honourable
senators will agree, that it is our responsibility
-and it is a heavy one-to render every help
possible to the government in working out
such a prima.ry producers' price policy for
properly standardized products as would give
our people, as far as humanly possible, their
rightful place in a properly balanced national
economy.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: In endeavouring
to work out such a policy we sbould keep in
mind the fact that we cannot have a prosperous people and a progressive country unless
our primary producers are placed in a position
to earn fair wages, through fair prices for
their graded products. so that they can maintain a satisfactory standard of living. The
economie welfare of most of our cities and
towns, as well as of most of the industries
located within their bounds, is dependent on
our primary producers.
During 1919, after the close of World War I,
prices were good; but costs of production were
high, as inflation was rampant. By the fall of
1920 prices were declining, and the longer
agricultural products were kept, the less
farmers received for them. At the close of
World War II we find that some of the difficulties of primary producers have been lessened materially, if only te.mporarily, by government control, and, through payment of
federal subsidies. It sbould also be kept in
mind that the prices of most of the products
that primary producers had to sell were not
allowed to be increased, as were wages in some
instances.
We should remember too that
the dominion treasury bas been paying an
appreciable part of consumers' food bills. For
instance, the treasury is paying two cents on
every loaf of bread, three to three and a half
:ents on every quart of milk, and eight cents
an every pound of butter purchased by consumers. Farmers are naturally uneasy about
how the change-over to peacetime conditions is
going to be made. During the waýr they accepted
a subsidy programme because it seemed necessary to the success of price control, which, in
turn, was necessary to the making of an allHon. Mr. McDONALD.

out national effort. For instance, to help keep
the price index down, a direct consumers' subsidy of two cents per quart on milk was paid,
and is still being paid. Milk consumers in
Halifax, for example, are getting their milk
today for ten cents a quart, which is two cents
less than the price before the war, when, as 1
have already intimated, farmers were in too
many cases p-oducing at less than cost.
As I have suggested, success in farming
depends on the maintenance of fair prices for
graded agricultural products. Farmers are
most grateful to the government for the
recent assurance of a fair price for wheat for
a term of five years. I want to say here that
I think the government is to be commended
for its wheat policy. Some bonourable senators
probably will not agree with that statement,
but I know that many western farmers would
rather produce wheat than hogs, because,
although perhaps as much profit can be made
from one as from the other, there is less
drudgery connected with the growing of wheat.
The government bas heavy commitments in
pork products, and I feel sure that our farmers
will do everything possible to see that these
commitments are fulfilled. There was a good
deal of criticism last year of the price set for
wbeat, but I believe that there again the
government was right. Honourable senators
will realize what would have happened in other
countries if the Canadian price had been set
tou high. A determined effort would have
been made in Britain, in Belgium, in France,
and possibly in other European countries, to
increase the production of wheat, and once
that programme was undertaken it would
have been maintained for years to come.
Canada must continue to be a large exporter
of wheat, for in the long view I think it
would bo a very unsound policy to put our
price so high as to encourage European countries to increase their wheat production when
it would be more economically sound for them
to produce other staple products.
Farmers ar" also thankful for the agricultural and fishery prices support acts passed
in 1944. We earnestly hope that some assurance can be given to the prodiucers of primary
produets other than wheat that they will
receive cost of production after the present
agreements with Britain are ended. We must
find a fairly remunerative market for our
exportable surpluses.
This being so, the
initiative and activity of the government as
a whole, and that, particularly, of the Minister
of Trade and Commerce, the Minister of
Agriculture, and the Minister of Finance, is
to be commended.
It is to be hoped that in the interests of
our people in Eastern Canada and British

MARCH 21, 1946
Columbia the government can continue to
equalize costs of production across Canada
by continuing live stock feed assistance. Our
farmers are deeply grateful to the government for this help, which enabled them so
materially in stepping up their live stock
production. The record production which I
have mentioned could not have been achieved
without this help. It will be remembered that
in pre-war years our competitors in Europe
were buying Canadian grain delivered to them
at less cost than our Maritime farmers had
to pay.
Besides fair prices and the equalizing of
production costs, I should like to mention
several more important matters to which we
should give increased attention, if we are to
have a satisfied and progressive rural Canada.
In some provinces, if not all, there should
be an improvement in our educational systems,
including the establishment of more rural high
schools, taught by more better-trained teachers
having the right perspective and background.
There should be more of our boys, and girls
too, taking regular and short courses at our
agricultural institutions. In this connection it is
indeed encouraging to learn of the increàsed
number attending this college-year session.
More civies and history should be taught in
our schools. Some of our 'Normal College
courses should be revised, giving two years for
training of teachers. Salaries of teachers
should be increased in many places, to encourage the right class of young men and women
to enter the teaching profession.
As bas been said, the soil is our greatest
asset. We must more generally adopt farm
practices which will put back into the -soil
as much plant food as we take out of it. If
this is not done, poor farmers will become
poorer, and in many cases consumers will not
get in their food the minerals essential to
health. You may, for instance, be getting
milk from a farm where the soil bas not been
kept in proper condition by rotation of crops,
the addition of stable manure, chemical fertilizer, and lime, in which case your milk will
probably lack the minerals necessary to sustain good health.
There should be an extension of the provisions of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act
to include all provinces. Much of our best
land in the provinces adjacent to tide waters
is waterlogged. To properly dyke and drain
these areas involves expenditures which without government assistance are far too heavy.
It is just as important to dyke and drain these
areas as it is to irrigate arid lands in Western
Canada. I am sure that those of us who do
not come from the prairie provinces are very
pleased that the government bas assisted irri-

gation projects there; and I feel that our
western friends would wish the farmere in other
areas to have comparable assistance. This
would be economically sound, as it would
result in greater production of live stock feed,
and so render unnecessary the continued importation of such large quantities. Many
farmers and their friends will be very appreciative if, during the session, the government
introduces legislation for this purpose.
A sound long-term policy for the organized marketing of graded products of primary
producers is a first essential to meet post-war
conditions. Since Canadian primary producers depend to a large extent on export markets, especially in Britain and in the country
of our neighbours to the south, this problem
is not only national but international in
scope. Members of local farmers', fishermen's,
and lumbermen's organizations, as well as of
their efficient national organization, the Canadian Federation, are all anxious to have a
sound marketing policy worked out in order
to assure an orderly flow of products to the
markets. Such a policy would also help
consumers, as it should assure a continuity of
supply of quality products. I believe that
dominion marketi g legislation, complementary to that whieh is now on the statute
books of seven of the nine provinces, is
needed if this nation is to provide producers
with an assured market for certain quantities
of their products at prices that would enable
them to plan their production without having
to take undue risks in the financing of their
operations after present controls and agreements are terminated.
Under marketing legislation, boards would
be set up to help in carrying out orderly
distribution. In all probability control of certain products will be found necessary to carry
on efficient marketing. Control in some
cases will also be necessary to enforce pricefloor regulations. Where such control is maintained there will have to be government marketing boards, such as the Canadian Wheat
Board. While the present government controls and marketing arrangements exist there
is not the same need for dominion marketing
legislation as there will be after these controls and agreements terminate; although I
believe that the provisions to be incorporated
in marketing legislation would be found
helpful under present controls and agreements.
I think that if these local boards were already
set up, it would be much easier for the Minister
of Agriculture to carry out the marketing
under agreements and controls.
I am quite certain that a large percentage
of our primary producers would support
dominion marketing legislation. I would suggest that such legislation should become

SENATE
effective in the marketing of any commodity
only after a substantial majority of the producers had voted in favour of trying out the
system of marketing under peacetime conditions for a term say of three or four years;
then another vote could be taken to decide
whether or not controlled marketing of their
commodity should be continued.
Prinlary producers without organization or
controlled marketing cannot prevent ruinous
cut-throat competition. That statement may
seem rather radical.
I firmly believe we
must have organization among our farmerssomething very difficult to secure, because
they are so widely dispersed throughout the
country. If such organization is not possible,
then I believe that control of marketing is
all the more necessary in order to raise the
standard of living of our people in rural
communities.
In the provincial field of organized marketing of graded agricultural products considerable experience bas been gained in handling
several commodities, particularly fruit. In
this matter the growers of British Columbia
tree fruits have given leadership. In Nova
Scotia, where the fruit industry is credited
with bringing about five million dollars of
new money into the province in the average
year, besides furnishing employment for many
persons both inside and outside the fruit
belt, fruit has been handled by the Nova
Scotia Apple Marketing Board under a centralized marketing policy.
Although mistakes have been made, I believe that even the opponents of centralized
control would say that during the war years
the marketing of fruit bas been a success. It
should be remembered that Canada was a
large exporter of apples in pre-war years.
Nova Scotia found a market for about eighty
per cent of her crops in Great Britain. After
war was declared, even if transportation had
been available, the people of Britain had not
the money to buy apples in large quantities.
To save this industry our government came
to the rescue, and under the War Measures
Act treated it as a war casualty. It was only
with considerable government assistance that
most fruit growers were able to make a living
during the war years. Last season unfavourable weather conditions caused a serious loss
to producers in eastern Canada. This loss
amounted to about $4,000,000 in Nova Scotia,
and many producers did not make their expenses. Unfortunately, in too many orchards
the fruit buds do not promise a good crop
this year. An announcement recently made
by the secretary of the Nova Scotia Fruit
Growers Association that the government
would favourably consider the giving of
Hon. Mr. McDONALD.

assistance in the producing and marketing of
this year's crop has given the producers fresh
encouragement; but I- am fearful for those
who, through no fault of their own, did not
have a crop last year, and who may not have
enough marketable fruit to meet last year's
deficit and this year's expenses.
In the years to come Canadian fruit growers
must cater more to the markets on this side
of the Atlantic. It is therefore sounder policy
than ever to continue the destruction of old
and unprofitable varieties of trees when it is
not practicable to graft them into good dessert varieties. Still more care will have to be
taken in the proper handling and the better
grading of fruit. Much more cold storage
space will have to be provided, especially in
Nova Scotia; and more of the fruit will have
to be packed in smaller packages. During
the next several years, when a fair share of
the money loaned by Canada may be used in
the purchase of our fruit, the growers should
make every effort te strengthen the market by
selling to Britain fruit of a kind and condition
that will be most attractive to buyers. At
this time, when it is generally thought wise to
remove trade barriers, or at least to lower
them as much as possible, it is more important
than ever that Canada, with her large surpluses, should give increased attention to
export marketing.
The Government of the United States has
invited the governments of other allied nations
te send representatives to a meeting this
Spring, for the purpose of considering an
arrangement for the relaxation of tariff and
trade barriers, preliminary to its consideration
by a general international trade conference
which it is proposed should be held later on.
Much careful thought should be given to the
representations to be made at this meeting.
It is hoped that when the long overdue
International Farm Organization meets in
London this Spring there will be sufficient
time for a thorough discussion of the representations of the primary producers.
M'any of the problems of agriculture are
also common to the fishing industry. It is
hoped that the recent merger of fishing interests in the provinces of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia may bring beneficial results. Such
an organization, working with co-operatives
and privately-owned fishery interests, should
make it possible to install modern coldý storage
equipment at production heads and in the
markets, and to provide artificial dryers and
proper transportation equipment for this most
perishable product, thus making it possible to
market a larger quantity of fish both at home
and abroad.

MARCH 21, 1M4
Living around the shores of the two larger
maritime provinces are some 30,000 people17,000 ini Nova Scotia and 13,000 in New
Brunswick-who are largely dependent on fieliing for their livelibood. 0f these 30,000 fishermen, 26,000 are termed in-shore fishermen, and
only 3,000, mostly from Nova Scotia, are offshore fishermen. The ternis "in-shore" and
"off-sho>re" do flot refer to the distance froni
shore at which the fishing is done, but rather
to the length of turne required to make a fishing trip. An off-shore fisherman usually remains at the fishing grounds for several days,
and operates a hoat which is -more expensive
than the in-shore fisherman can afford and
larger than he needË for much of bis fishing.
The in--shore boat returns with its catch every
day.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McD'ONALD: In 1930 78 per
cent of the total catch, and 79-8 per cent of
the total value, was made by in--shore fishermen. The off-shore hoats produced 22 per
par cent. It is worthy Df note that; of the total
production, 54-9 per cent in volume and 61-4
per cent in value is producible only by inshore fiahermen. It is obvious, therefore, that
from the standpoint of the people involved
and volume produced, the in-shore fieberies are
of surpassing importance to these two provinces, and that -upon «the saccess of this
branch of the industry dapends to a large
extent the welfare of the fisheranen of the
Maritime Provinces.
In the past, and especially during the
period froni 1923 to the beginning of the late
war, the fishîng industry of the Maritime
Provinces was in a state of chronic depression.
Ample evidence of this is to be found in the
fishery statistics. The figures indicate that in
1939, which was not one of the worst years,
30,000 fishiermhen in Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick received for their total landings
of fish the sum of 37,000,000 gross, an average
return to aach fisherman of $233. Out of
this smaîl suni had te corne bis operating
expenses. 1 think honourable senators will
agree that any industry which is so unremunerative is not in a healthy condition, and
that Maritime Canada cannot enjoy any degree of prosperity while the industry upon
which one-sixth of its populàtion depends for
a livelihood is, in normal tumes, in a condition of economic distress. In view of these
facts we sincerely hope that those connected
with the recent merger of the fishing interests
have well-prepared plans to put the industry
on a sounder basis. If this is done it will
mean close co-operation with the United
Marine Fishermen, which is an association of

37

fisharman of the Maritime Provinces and the
Magdalen Islands for the purpose of prometing the social, educational and economie welf are of those engaged in the fishing industry.
It is important that the governments concerned make sure that the fishermen operating
with larger boats and more expensive equipment do flot unduly interfere with the large
maj ority of fishermen who engage in in-shore
fishing.
Through co-operative organizations, first
started in our province 'by the Extension
Division of St. Francis Xavier University,
much has been done to assist this struggling
industry. The Department of Agriculture for
the province of Nova Scotia and the Dominion
Dapartment of Fisheries, working through
the U.M.F. co-operatives, have done a great
deal to educate fisharmen in the proper preparation cf their product for market, and to
belp theni te overcome certain market conditions. For instance, as te lobsters, we have
taught the fisherman te taka better care of
his product, and have shown hîim how in
sending it te the New England markets some
wrongs are corrected. Fishermen used te
ship their fish on consignment without know.
ing what tbey were te be paid. They now
know what they are te raceive days in
advance.
The provincial Departrnent of
Agriculture aIse co-operates with the fishermnen by helping theni te grow ail or part of
their vegetable requiremants.
The fishermen of our shores are an industrieus people, and will produce their conimodity in sufficient quantities if they can get
a price wbich will provide a decent living for
theniselves and their famulies. If this industry
is to prosper, the government must do everything possible te enlarge the export market.
The Canadian market cannot absorh more
than a small percentage of our total produe,tien. In negotiating future trade agreements
we must keep in ,mind the importance of
fisheries.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Co-operatives and
credit unions have done much te assist farmers
and fishermen in several of our provinces.
Froni past experience I feel that the goverfiment should encourage these non-polîtical and
non-sectarian organizations. Tbey bave given
hope and encouragement te many primary
producers in Nova Scotia; they bave helped
greatly te stimulate the production and marketing of graded products. By encouraging
these organizations our governments'can do
much te help primary producers help theni-

selves to a better standard of living; which in
turn will contribute to the maintenance of
sound government.
The aims of those who organize sound
co-operatives are the reverse of those ýwho
believe in state control. Members -of the
co-operatives hope through their organizations
to perfect their work, improve their economic
position and build up their homes. In passing
it should be said it is unfortunate that the
word "co-opdrative" forms part of the title of
a political organization.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: The two uses made
of the term do net stand for the same things
in any respect.
I would not wish anyone te think from what
I have said about co-operatives that I am
opposed to free enterprise-call it what you
will. There is room for both. Is it not true
that in this country living standards are higher
and that under our system freedom is more
general than under other systems in other
countries ?
Nevertheless, there are many
unorganized primary producers who can be
helped by cutting down .costs of production and marketing. If we can accomplish this by encouraging co-operatives where
they can be helpful, we should encourage
them, for in so doing we shall be building a
better and more prosperous Canada.
I wish it were possible for honourable senators te visit some of these co-operatives in
the more sparsely settled districts of Nova
Scotia, and learn at first-hand how they work.
Some honourable senators here will know
Larry's River, on the rock-bound shore of
Guysborough county. In the early thirties most
of the people in Larry's River were on direct
relief. It was not long, however, before a clergyman who lives there at the present time succeeded in getting the people of the district to
work together to establish a co-operative. They
studied, their problem for a long time, and
finally decided on a course of action. They
did not have much money to their credit, but
the clergyman used what little credit he had,
and tbey purchased a second-hand sawmill.
He took his men into the woods. First they
sawed the lumber for a canning factory, then
for a store, a schoolhouse, and finally for a
community hall. While the men were fishing
the women were at the canning factory, canning lobsters. After the lobster season was over
the men and boys were taken into the bush to
pick blueberries, which were to be canned
by the women when the foxberries were
picked and canned.
As a result, largely
through the leadership of the clergyman, the
people were taken off direct relief. I could
mention many cases in which co-operatives
Hon.

'Mr. McDONALD.

have been a great help, though probably none
of them is quite as outstanding as Larry's
River.
In closing I wish te thank honourable senators for the attention they have given me. I
hope that others will give us the benefit of
their ideas as to how the problems of the
primary producers can be solved.
I have not touched on other industries.
many of which are very important, but I
have thought we might well follow the example
set by Britain, and appoint a national industries commission whose duty it would be
to co-operate with firms in England and other
countries which find it advantageous to establish branch industries in Canada. Such a commission might be charged with the responsibility of seeing that these branch industries
were settled in the places where it was most
economically sound for them to operate. For
instance, in order to avoid excessive freight
costs, they should be not too far from the
source of their raw materials or the markets
for their finished products. Some industries
would be closer both to their raw materials
and to their markets if they were located on
the seaboard. Others would find it more convenient to operate a considerable distance
inland.
Unity in Canada would be strengthened by
a better distribution of industry. It would
also be strengthened if our people v.isited one
another more frequently-if more easterners
went out to see the West and more westerners
came down to have a look at the East. We
must have uniity if Canada is to be a progressive country.
I realize that many houses must be built
now to relieve the immediate shortage, but in
taking the long view, honourable senators, I
know of no more effective and sound economic
way of solving the nation's housing and unemployment problems than by assuring primary
producers a satisfactory living.
Hon. 1r. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Let us do what we
can to encourage them to make their homes
more attractive by the installation of electricity, running water and other modern conveniences. If, in addition, good highways and
better educational facilities can be provided,
and a fair price obtained for graded products,
our young men and women from the rural
districts will not be overcrowding our cities
and the industries within their bounds.
Hon. F. W. GERSHAW: Honourable senators, may I first of all congratulate the
mover and seconder of the Address (Hon. Mr.
Hurtubise and Hon. Mr. Burchill) upon their
eloquence and the subject-matter of their
speeches.

MARCH 21, 1946
I should like to take a little time this
afternoon to deal with a subject which is of
paramount importance to the people in a
large area of western Canada Last autumn I
had the honour of addressing this house and
pointing out that for three years the grass and
grain crops in southern Alberta have been so
light as to constitute complete and disastrous
failures. I reviewed the history of the crops
in that part of the country fromu the days of
185647, when Captain John Palliser examined
and reported on the situation for the British
Government. In the last thirty years since
settlers located thete the area has had only
about eight or nine paying crops. Honourable
members willi be able to picture the situation
that exists in several places when I mention
one as an illustration. In this district there are
7,300 people, spread over half a million acres.
They have no flowers and no gardens and take
no pride in their homes; they cannot get a
balanced diet; their buildings are in poor
shape; and since they have no neighbours
within a reasonable distance there is no social
life. These unfortunate conditions could be
remedied by irrigation. Even if the district
were only partially irrigated-and ample water
is available for this-its population would, I
am sure, soon increase from 7,000 to 37,000.
Then attractive homes would be built, surrounded by gardens and small, fruit trees;
cattle would be raised; the dairy products,
together with vegetables, fruits and other
home-grown foods would help to provide a
balanced diet; and there would be the schools,
churches, hospitals and roads necessary to a
thriving community.
Census figures show that in the non-irrigated
districts there are only 3-5 persons per square
mile; in the partly irrigated districts, 5-7,
and in the fully irrigated districts, 12-7. In
southern Alberta the area now under irrigation
is about half a million acres. This could be
increased to two million acres, with great
profit to the whole nation. We learn from the
pages of history that the Egyptians made
parched land fertile by irrigating it with water
baled out of the Nile. Sure'ly we can do as
good a job as the Egyptian4 diid four thousand years ago.
Some irrigation schemes have been partly
built at the expense of private capital, and it
would not take much time or money to complete them. Irrigation of the Redcliff-Ronelane
district, for instance, could be completed
quickly and water spread over some 150,000
additional acres at a cost of about $20 per
acre. The people of that district have endured
very hard times because of lack of water.
We need to bring the non-irrigated lands of
Alberta into production in order to increase

39

the supply of food for the starving people of
Europe, to whom we owe a great obligation.
And on these lands homes could be provided
for the returned veterans and other sons of
the pioneers who have suffered so much privation while contributing greatly to the wealth
of our country. The young people want to
settle down in the district where they were
born and where their friends and acquaintances
live. Railway service, roads, hospitals, city
markets, telephones and all other modern
conveniences are available there.
Great credit is due to the Department of
Agriculture which, even in the strenuous days
of the war, found time to make complete
surveys of those districts in southern Alberta.
At the last session half a million dollars was
voted for the St. Mary reservoir, which will
be the key structure in a scheme designed to
preserve for Canada ber share of the waters
flowing down the international streams.
It may be asked why private capital should
not be used for the development of irrigation projects. Millions of dollars have been
expended in this way by the Canadian Pacifie
Railway and by British investors, and most of
the money has been lost. One result of the
experiment has been the gaining of a good
deal of experience, which will be a guide for
the future. It is recognized now that the
capital cost of these irrigation schemes must
be borne by some Government body, which
will be repaid by increased production and
tax revenues.
In my hand I have a record of the annual
rainfall, snowfall and total precipitation at
Medicine Hat, Alberta, from 1887 to 1945.
The average rainfall here in the east is from
25 to 40 inches, but in southern Alberta the
average over the fifty-nine years was 9-40
inches. The average snowfall out there during
that period was 37-7 inches. If 10 inches of
snowfall are equal to 1 inch of rainfall, the
total precipitation was 13.7 inches.
At one time we imported a rainmaker into
Medicine Hat. If be had remained there and
produced the ,oped-for results, we might have
had a series of good crop years. Our chief
trouble out there arises from the fact that
much of our moisture bas come in other than
the growing season. Sometimes we have had
a deluge, and the water has run off the land;
and of course a great deal of snow is absorbed
by the chinook winds. So the land has not
had the full benefit of even that low average
precipitation of 13-7 inches.
From the beginning to the end of the growing season in southern Alberta the chief subject of interest, of hope, of fear and of anxiety
is moisture. From dawn till dark the sky is
watched for the appearance of a cloud, but

SENATE

40

all too often no moisture comes, so the crops
wither and the fields turn brown. No one
who has not lived through this experience can
fully realize the disa'ppointment it brings.
I mentioned before that many small lakes,
sloughs and running streams of twenty-five
years ago are now completely dried up. Since
the total precipitation has been fairly constant
there clearly is another factor at work. That
factor is the destruction of forests and vegetable cover on the eastern slope of the Rocky
mountains. As the trees have d'isappeared the
flow of water has dropped rapidly. In order
to protect not only Alberta, but Saskatchewan
and Manitoba, from disastrous drought, some
action must be taken to preserve the vegetable
cover upon the mountains.
I should like to read into the record a brief
statement that I received from the Department
of Mines and Resources:
There is no doubt but that forests have a
marked influence in controlling run-off and also
in increasing the ground water supplies. This
point has been amply demonstrated not only on
this continent but 'allso in severail Eîuropean
countries. In the spring of the year the snow
under forest conditions relts at -a -later date
than it does -in the open, and -consequently reduces the hazard of high flood levels in the
streamas and rivers. Perhaps an even more important influence is that with respect to ground
wa-ter supplies. Unider forest conditions the
litter of leaves and twigs iying on the forest floor
absorbs water and allows it ýto percollate into the
underlying soil.
This increases the amount of water stored in
the ground which griadually fllters out through
springs and fin.ally into the small streams which
feed the main rivers. It is a well established
fact that under favoura)ble forest conditions
there are many springs and that ýthe smal
streamas which they supply run throughout the
year. This condition is 'in marked contrast to
a non-forested are.a on which the surface conditions -are unfavourable for the penetration of
water, where there are very few springs and
wherýe 'the amail streams dry up during summer.
As to the trend of conditions on the eastern
slope of the Rockies, a conaparison ls given to
show the effeat of reduced fire protection. These
figures a-re applicable to the high-hazard portion
of .the alrea, namely, that covered by the Crowsnest, the Bow ýriver, and the Clearwater foreste.

These figures tel. their own story.
In addition to the destruction by fire, insect
pests and uncontrolled lumbering operations
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW,

have taken their toll. People who fly over
those areas are the first to note that they
are denuded of trees, and that the seed bed
having been destroyed by fire the snow
meits quickly. Consequently during middle
and late summer there is a drought where
formerly there was an ample sup.ply of water.
The United Farmers of Alberta have urged
that the forest and vegetable cover be conserved so that the waters of the streams from
the eastern slope of the Rocky mountains
may be available for'irrigation and for generating power for rural electrification.
There should be no delay in bringing this
matter before the Dominion-Provincial Conference, for if preventive measures are not
soon taken the present rapid destruction of
the forests- will have a disastrous effect not
only on Alberta but on Saskatchewan and
Manitoba.
I realize, honourable senators,
that there may be a taxpayers' strike in
Canada. Irrigation costs money, but I do
not believe that the taxpayers of this country
will object to an investment which will bring
returns, enrich the lives of so many of our
people, and preserve for future generations
the valuable assets of which we are the
custodians.
In closing I desire to mention briefly the
advantages of this proposed investment:
1. Ordinarily in that area it takes from
forty to fifty acres of land to provide pasture for one cow. If two million acres were
irrigated, the adjoining twelve million acres
would have a greater carrying capacity for
cattle, and with feed and water available there
would be no need ta sell cattle at sacrifice
Instead of having one animal on
prices.
forty acres probably three or four head could
be kept there.
2. During the last ten years there has been
a loss of $20,000,000 because of uncollectable
taxes.
3. Some relief would still be required, but
if that district was put under irrigation there
would be much less occasion for relief.
4. In the years 1936 to 1945 the beet sugar
crop alone produced $25,000,000 worth of new
money for the people there.
5. The average yield of wheat in ten dry
districts is 8-1 bushels per acre. In ten irrigated districts the average yield is 19-8 bushels
to the acre. So at a dollar a bushel we have
approximately an additional twelve dollars
annually from each acre of land. Wheat probably is the cheapest food that can be produced, but in itself it is not sufficient to
preserve good health; meats, eggs, poultry,
dairy products, fruits and vegetables are necessary for a balanced diet. Live stock, poultry,
fruits and vegetables do well on irrigated land.

MARCH 21, 1946
6. People are moving out of that district.
They are real Canadians and will be bard to
replace.
7. A prosperous West means prosperity for
the East, because there will be a great demand
for the manufactured goods of the eastern
cities. In American districts where they have
established cannerles and beet sugar factories,
the taxes collected annually amount to almost
5 per cent of the construction cost.
I helieve that if we are to make a smooth
shock-proof shift into peacetime economy the
improvements which I arn suggesting are of
vital importance. If we are to provide employment, and farming and business opportunities,
this irrigation must be proceeded with. As
Herbert Hoover has said, "Every drop of
water that runs to the sea without rendering
a commercial return is a public waste."

(Hon. Mr. Burchill1) Vo explain, it. When the

that it be referred Vo the Standing Commîttee
on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. G. P. BURCHILL: Honourable senators, the purpose of this bill is very simple.
IV concerna the export of deer and game. The
wildlife resources of Canada are largely administered by the provinces and territories,
which have enacted legisiation. Vo proteet these
resources. In the course of years it was found
possible for a inan Vo violate provincial game
and fur h'aws and Vo, avoid payment of royalties by shipping fur and game Vo another province, where it was noV subject Vo seizure. This
whole matter was discussed at the dominionprovincial wild life conferences, and, by resolution it was agreed that dominion l-egislation
was needed Vo. protect provincial revenues.
Accordigly the Game Export Act was passed
in 11041. That act enabhed the provinces Vo do
two things: first, Vo control the shipment of
gamce from one province. Vo another, and,
second, Vo adequately control the shipment of
game from Canada.
This measure, the purpose of which is Vo
eliminate sections 5 and 6 of the Export Act,
which overlap certain provisions of the Game
Export Act passed in 1941, was requestedi by
the ninth conference of dominion-provincial

CRIMINAL

CODE (RACE
BILL

MEETINGS)

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill D, an act to amend the
Criminal Code (race meetings).
He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator for Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) to explain this bill.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators, this bill contains three amendments.
Two of these give statutory effect to a provision passed by order in council. Under the
Criminal Code only one racing association
could carry on race meets on any one race
course. During the war some of these properties were required for war purposes; others
were abandoned because of transportation
problems and scarcity of gasoline; therefore,
by order in council it was made permissible
for more than one racing association to operate on the same track. As a result, there
were two operations on the same track in
Winnipeg, four on the same track in Vancouver, and four on each of two tracks in
Administratively, this bas proven
Toronto.
to be of great advantage to the Department
of Agriculture in looking after the operation
of the pari mutuel system of betting, from
which the government collects the revenue.
As I say, wvhat was formerly donc by order
in council is now made statutory. That applies
not only to running races, but also to trotting
and pacing races, for tiere was the same
prohibition with respect to both.
The other amendment is for the purpose of
making clear that the benefit of section 235
of the Code, which would permit the operatien of a pari mutuel system of betting, does
not extend to trotting and pacing races or to
a company possessing a charter entitling it
merely to operate a driving park. This amendment is just a clarifying one.
I understand that our Law Clerk wishes to
suggest a slight change to one of these amending sections, and that the department has
another amendment to propose. For that
reason I believe that at the appropriate time
a motion will be made to refer this bill to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before the motion is put,
I should like to ask the honourable member a
question. What he said applies only in places
where there is more than one race track. Two
charters could not be obtained, thereby making
it possible to operate a track two or three
times a year.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I should have added
that the effect of these amendments will not
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

be to increase the number of racing associations. As a matter of fact, the effect will be
the opposite, by reason of the restricted interpretation of charters. That is, charters which
provide for trotting and pacing races and for
operating a driving park will not cover running
races. A racing association will not be able
to use a track other than its own, unless it is
an association qualified under the Code to
run races. The net result will be, not an
increase in the number of racing days or the
number of racing associations, but a decrease
in the number of race courses in use.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.

ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday, March
21, the consideration of His Excellency The
Governor General's Speech at the opening of
the session, and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Hurtubise for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. JAMES P. McINTYRE: Honourable
senators, the Speech from the Throne is supposed to forecast the legislation of the session,
and the debate on the Address provides honouýrable members with an opportunity for a
general discussion of matters that they may
consider to be of public interest, especially to
the particular province which each speaker
has the honour to represent. I come from the
province of Prince Edward Island, in whose
legislature I had the privilege of sitting for
more than twenty years. I listened to all the
debates on the Address in reply to the
Speeches from the Throne during that period,
so I have had some experience in appraising
such debates. Let me say with all sincerity
that I congratulate the honourable senator
from Nipissing (Hon. Mr. Hurtubise) and the
honourable senator from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) upon the ,manner in which
they respectively moved and seconded the
Address in reply to the Speech delivered by
His Excellency at the opening of the present
parliament. These honourable gentlemen did
honour to themselves, to this chamber and to
the provinces to which they belong. I wish
also to congratulate the honourable leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Robertson) and

MARCH 26, 1946
the honourabie leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) upon their splendid contribution te this
debate.
My remarks wîli be directed c'hiefly te matters which concern Prince Edward Island.
Agriculture and fisheries are the principal in-

dustries cf the Island. Fox farming is also
carried on te some extent; in fact Prince
Edward Island is the world's headquarters for

silver fox farming. Lobster fishing is the most
profitable cf any of the fisheries in the Maritime Provinces. It is confined chielly to those
provinces and the Gaspé Coast. In 1943 New
Brunswick had 42 lobster cvanneries, Novu
Scotia had 3,5, the Gaspé Coast 9 and Prince
Edward Island 44, a total of 130.
The Maritime Provinces fisheries tripled in
value in the five years from 1938 te 1943. In
1938 the grosa value cf the flsheries of Prince
Edwacl Island was less than a million dollars
-in round figures, $930,000-and five years
later, in 1943, it was $2,860,000. The figures
fer Nova Scotia in the samne years were,
respectively, 88,800,000 and 821,600,000;. and
those for New Brunswick were $3,900,000 and
$11,20,000. These fluctuations fromn time te
time cause great hardahipa te those making
their livelihood eut of the industry. Let me
give a few instances. In 1926 the total value
cf the fisheries of the Maritime Provinces was
only $19,000,000; ten years later At had d'ropped
te $14,000,000. In 1926 there were 28,222 persons engaged in the industry, but in 1936
this number had increased to 35,659ý, although
there was a drop in valué of approximately
$5,000,000. These figures honourable senatora,
will give you some idea of the lean years
which the fishermen went through, and why it
became necessary for the provincial gevernments and the dominion government te corne
te their assistance.
I trust henourable members will bear with
me while 1 give a brief account cf the conditions in the lobster industry of the Maritâme
Provinces in the years 1940 and 1941. In 1940
the federal government took action te avert
the consequences cf an acute emergency
threatening the industry, and se saved the
lobster fishermen fromn disaster. The war
closed the door to the export markets which
in time ef peace had absorbed by far the
greater part of our lobster output. Trade with
Great Britaiin was still physically possible, notwithstanding Germany's bst that no shipping
would ever reach British ports. However, the
imperial government found it necessary to
impose import controls on certain commodities,
incluiing canned lobster. Having been barred
fromn the British market, our lobster fiahermen and cannera had to rely on Canada and
the United States te absorb their product.
These two markets had neyer taken more than

43

a relatively small part of our lobster catch.
Unless, therefore, something could be done to
increase, the North American deinand, many
of the canneries would have been compelled
to operate on a limited acale only, and this in
turn would have meant that the lobster fishermen wo>uld be without an outiet for a large
part of theïr catch. Such a state of affaira
would have been ruinous for 4pany of ourfishing communities on the Atlantic coast,
for normally the lobster fishery' is one of
the main sources of employment for over
40,000 persons. Fortunately the.government
.1eppecI in te meet the emergency. It appointed a contreller of canned lobster, with
authority te buy ail the 1940 catch at approximately 80 per cent of the average prioe
of 1936 te 1938; but hie was jnatructed te
buy only freim packers who paid the fishermen flot less than a minimum of $5.25. The
rigid standards which the controfler set for
his inspectera created dissatiafaction among
the packera, and in 1941 these standards were
modified. The price paid was satisfactory,
and brought about a better feeling between
packers and fishermen. As a resuit od the
government's action the cannera were enabled
to. find' an outiet in our domestic market and
in the United States for ail their 1940 pack.
In 1941 the pack of slightly less than 60,000
cases was smadler than the average of the
immediate pre-war period. Until this control
wprit into elffrt there h'ad neyer been a year
when the North American market absorbed
anything like 60,000 cases. For instance, as
compared with 1939, the sales in the dominion
and in the United States increased by 400
per cent. As I have said, the dominion government by ita prompt action saved the lobster
canning industry from. disaster. This was publicly recognized at a conference cf representatives of packers and fishermen who declared
that but 'fer the action then taken the future
of the industry would havé heen gravely
.ieopardized. I must say that the government
did a real job in handling the situation.
I hope honourable senatora will pardon me
if I appear te direct attention tee often te
the affaira of Prince Edward Island. An
honourable member may represent a division
in which agriculture, hydre electrie development, geld mining, f orestry, or fisheries may
he the main industry, and 1 believe it is
his duty te, bring te the notice of the gevernmnent and the country generally those

affecting the fishing industry. After a thorough discussion they may reach the conclusion that, for instance, some regulation which
the Department of Fisheries puts into effect
is detrimental to the industry. They forward
their conclusion to the Fisheries Council of
Canada, which in turn take it up with the
department. In this way many difficulties
are ironed out. As an example of what
effective work can be accomplished in this
way, I may say that last session the federation brought to the attention of a parliamentary committee a conflict between the
departmental regulations and the law in regard to lobster paste containers. Under the
regulations the content had to be four and a
half ounces, while the law called for only
three ounces. I am happy to report that as
a result the manufacturer is now allowed to
turn out a can holding three ounces net.
Another ground for dissatisfaction bas been
the export restriction on canned lobster. I
have always maintained that this policy was
altogether wrong. For instance, the assemblers are obliged to sell at a reduced price
25 per cent of the pack of the Maritime
Provinces in our domestic market. Canned
lobster is a luxury, not an item of family
food. If another country is willing to pay
more for our product, I submit there should
be no restriction on its export, because, as
I have said, canned lobster is a luxury and
we can do without it, just as the people of
Europe bad to for six years. Now I understand that England and France are in the
market for our canned lobster, but I am
afraid the United States will outbid them,
because when our neighbours want anything
they are willing to pay for it.
I am very much in accord with the regulations that the government passed in 1940 and
1941; they saved the situation. However,
certain regulations are coming into force from
year to year that in my opinion are not in
the best interests of the, industry, and the
industry is not consulted. One of these, with
which I do not agree, is coning into force
this year. I do not know where these regulations originate, whether in Halifax or in
Ottawa. At all events, they reach the government, an order in council is passed, and they
become law for the year. Here is one sueh
regulation:
Export permits will continue to be ýavailable
to packers only but they may assign their rights
to export to any assembler named and recognized by the Administrator of Fish and Fis-i
Products. Further information may be obtained from R. A. Harlow, lssuing Officer, Wartime Prices and Trade Board, P.O. Box 815.
Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE.

Now a lobster packer is not an exporter;
the business of assembler is a business by
itself. The packer supplies the fisherman with
his gear and. packs the lobsters. The assembler
bas connections in all principal towns in the
United States and Canada. In the days when
exports went to Great Britain and Europe, he
had brokers in the principal cities of Europe.
He bas machinery, and hundreds of thousands
of labels for years ahead, something which the
packer has not got. The packer bas no connections in the different cities of the United
States, as bas the assembler. We have three
assemblers in Charlottetown-the Windsor.
Fisheries, Fisher
Brothers, and DeBlois
Brothers. These firms buy lobsters from Nova
Scotia, New Brunswick, Gaspé coast, Prince
Edward island and the Magdalen islands.
Regardless of where they are bought, they are
taken to the assembler in Charlottetown. He
bas no export permit to ship the commodity,
If he buys the lobsters from a packer in Nova
Scotia, he bas to go to that packer and get
a transfer of the export permit; then he bas
to go to the Wartime Prices and Trade Board
in Halifax to confirm it before he can ship out
any of those lobsters. The same procedure
must be followed if the lobsters are purchased
in New Brunswick: he has to go to the Wartime Prices and Trade Board to get the
transfer confirmed.
If the lobsters are purchased on the Gaspé coast or in the Magdalen
islands, lie has to go to the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board at Quebec to get the sanction of the board. Why all that red tape?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE:
That procedure,
I say, is not in the interests of the industry.
I am pointing out these things in the hope
that they may be rectified. Last year in a
committee of the Senate, I pointed out the
discrepancy in the quarter can. This year that
difficulty bas been satisfactorily settled.
Honourable senators, much bas been said
both in this chamber and in the House of
Commons regarding transportation between
Prince Edward Island and the mainland. The
sinking of the icebreaker S.S. Charlottetown
a few years ago off the coast of Nova Scotia
was a severe shock to the people of Prince
Edward Island. Notwithstanding the great
loss, the service was maintained fairly well,
and this fall it was announced that a new
boat would soon be in use.
I should like to call to the attention of
those in authority the inconvenience experienced by the public travelling from Montreal
to Charlottetown. A pullman service is provided between Montreal and Moncton, where
it is taken off, much to the inconvenience of

MARCH 26, 1946
travellers, especially women and children.
Mothers with two or three small children, and
carrying their baggage, get off the train at
Moncton and wait for a train to take them
to Tormentine. At Tormentine the operation is repeated. At these places there are
no red caps, as in Montreal or Ottawa, and
the good-natured passengers have to 'assist
those with children and baggage. The same
inconvenience is suffered again at Borden.
While it is only approximately 115 miles from
Moncton to Charlottetown, it takes about nine
hours to cover the distance.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A shame.
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: Very few, if any,
complaints were heard during the war, but
now that the war is over the public is demanding better transportation and the return of
pullman service from Montreal straight
through to Charlottetown at least three times
a week, as it was before the war.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Why not every day?
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: Well, every day
would be much better. I was only getting in
the thin edge of the wedge.
Prince Edward Island has few resources
from which to collect provincial revenues.
The Fathers of Confederation expected the
public domain to be an important source of
revenue to the provinces, but in the 'Maritimes substantial natural resources are not
known and very little is collected in the form
of royalties. In Nova Scotia they amount to
from $500,000 to $900,000 a year, mostly from
coal; in New Brunswick, from $450,000 to
$1,200,000, mostly from forests.
Prince
Edward Island has no public domain such as
mines and forests; therefore no royalties are
collected. If the people of the Maritime
Provinces are to -enjoy the same social services as the people of the other provinces, the
governments of the Maritimes will be called
upon to spend large sums of money on such
services and on development projects of various kinds. The expenditures required for
these undertakings are too great to be borne
entirely by the provincial governments. It
was believed by the supporters of Confederation that the Maritime Provinces would
become the manufacturing and service industry centre for the new Dominion. For a few
years preceding 1890 this hope was in part
realized. In those days Prince Edward island
had such industries as carding, spinning, blacksmithing, tanning, leather working, and sawmilling. Now, owing to what we call mass
production in the central provinces of Canada, those industries have almost entirely
disappeared.

45

Prince Edward Island has the smallest
income per capita of any province in Canada.
British Columbia bas the highest income, and
is the richest province in the dominion.
Ontario comes next, followed by Quebec,
after which come the other provinceå, including Prince Edward Island, which is at the
foot of the list. When the Dominion-Provincial Conference sets up its financial arrangement, I claim that Prince Edward Island
should get special consideration. I am not
in any way advocating that the Maritime
Provinces break away from the union. We
have been as loyal to Canada as any of the
other provinces, and far be it from me to
suggest that we should take any other attitude than that; but I do want to say that, in
my opinion, the people of the 'Maritimes did
not benefit from confederation as they were
led to believe they would.
The idea of confederation was initiated in
Ontario and Quebec, and it was done for the
purpose of settling a long and outstanding
dispute between those provinces. The statesmen of Ontario and Quebec knew that confederation could not be complete without the
co-operation of the Maritime Provinces, so
they resolved themselves into a delegation
and proceeded to the Maritimes. Among the
delegates were Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir
George Cartier, George Brown, Sir Charles
Tupper and other notables. The convention
was held at Charlottetown in 1864. The delegates were well aware of the adverse conditions under which they were to meet. They
knew that the Maritime Provinces had established a satisfactory trade among themselves,
that their market was close at hand and easy
of access, and that traffic with that market was
mainly by sea. Our American neighbours
bought all the fish, lumber and agricultural
products that the Maritime Provinces had to
offer. In fact, before confederation the United
States was not only our nearest but our most
profitable market.
The delegates knew this; they also knew
more. They knew that the geographical difficulties of the Maritimes prevented trading
with the central provinces of Canada. They
knew that the State of Maine obtruded itself
across British territory and that a large tract
of unpeopled and uncultivated land lay to the
north of New Brunswick and prevented intercourse with Quebec and Montreal. To offset
this, certain inducements were held out to the
people of the Maritimes to consent to confederation. After confederation the New
England markets would of course be lost, but
a better and more profitable market, that of
the central provinces, might be substituted
therefor. The Maritime Provinces, lying at
the extremity of the Dominion, were to be

46

SENATE

brought into close contact with the central
provinces by the construction of the Intercolonial Railway, which was to be operated
exclusively for the benefit of the Maritimes.
The coal of Nova Scotia was to find a market
in Toronto; the fish, lumber and agricultural
products were to find a market in Quebec and
Montreal. These were some of the inducements held out to the people of the Maritimes if they would consent te union.
But as time went on it was found almost
impossible to fulfil those promises. It turned
out that the coal of Nova Scotia did not find
a market in Toronto; and the fish, lumber
and agricultural products did not find a
market in Montreal. In the meantime the
New England markets iad been lost. It is
truc that the Intercolonial Railway was constructed, but it was not operated exclusively
for the benefit of the people of the Maritimes. It was linked up with the Canadian
National Railways, and its freight and passenger ratcs were made as high as those on any
railwav in Canada.
It is a strange thing, and perhaps an unhappy circumstance, that we have not on
record a verbatim report of the speeches
made by the delegates to the conventions
which took place before confederation. But
in Lwo very rare documents-so rare that one
almost has to be under bond to secure a
loan of them from the Parliamentary Library
here at Ottawa-one may find, in more or
less narrative form, reports of what was said
by various delegates at these conventions.
According to one of these reports, Sir John
Macdonald, speaking at a banquet in Charlottetown on September 1, 1864, said that ie
iad every reason te believe that the result of
the convention which had held its sittings in
Charlottetown for the past week would lead
to the formation and establishment of such
a federation of all the British North American
provinces as would tend very materially to
enhance their individual and collective prosperity politically, commercially and socially,
and aise give them in their united manhood
that national prowess and strength which
would make this the fourti greatest nation
on the face of the globe.
At the adjourned meeting held at Quebec
in October, 1864, proposals were made te
Prince Edward Island to enter the union;
but these were rejected, mainly for two reasons: that they did net provide a satisfactory
and immediate solution of the land question,
and that the representation te be allowed to
the province in the federal parliament was
not satisfactory. In 1869 Canada held out
new inducements te Prince Edward Island,
but these also were rejected. Then in 1873
Hon. Mr. McJNTYtE.

the Haythorne administration conferred with
the Canadian government, and terms were
once more offered te the Island. At the
ensuing provincial election the Haythorne
government was defeated. The new government appealed te Ottawa and succeeded in
obtaining somewhat better terms, which were
accepted, and we entered the union on July 1,
1873. The main and practically the only
difference between the terms of Haythorne
and those received by his successor, Pope, was
an increase in the Island's debt allowance
from $45 to $50 per head of population. The
method of computing this debt allowance was
as follows. To the net debt of Canada in 1873
was added an estimate of anticipated expenditurc, which sum, divided by the population of
Canada, resulted in the round figure of $45.
Owing te the isolated position of Prince
Edward Island and the fact that a general
arrangement was about te be made in the debt
allowances of other provinces, this was increased to $50 by the terms of 1873.
Another authority who corroborates those
statements is J. H. Grey, who reported word
for word some of the utterances of Sir John
A. Macdonald and other delegates at certain
meetings prior to confederation. Sir John is
reported as having said at a banquet in
Halifax:
If we could only obtain that objeet-a general, vigorous government-we would not b
New Brunswickers, Nova Scotians or Canacdhans, but British Americans under the British
Sovereign.
And in discussing colonial union he is
reported to have spoken te this effect:
What is desirable and what is pract-ical? We
must consi.de-r local prejudices and aspirations.
It is our duty to do so. We are united as one
man. There w as no difference of feeling, and
no sectional prejudices were exhiibted by any
one. Al. approached the subject feeling its im.portance, feeling that -in their hands lay the
destiny of the nation, and great would bo the
sin ýand shame if .any ýdifferent motive should
interfere to prevent us from carrying out that
noble object by becoming a great British
monarchy in connection with the British Empire
and under the British king.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? Prince Edward
Island was the first province to reach its quota
in the Ninth Victory Loan campaign. How
can that be reconciled with the statement that
it is the poorest province in Canada?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It is net.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: I can tell my
honourable friend that the per capita income
of Prince Edward Island last year was $385,
and that of British Columbia was $836.

47

MARCH 26, 1946
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Can he explain
why the government should pass an order in
council which is a handicap to the lobster
fishery, when the present minister in charge
of fisheries is a Maritimer?
Hon. Mr. McINTYRE: These orders in
council are all arranged before being presented
to the cabinet. They may be arranged in
Halifax, or partly there and partly in Ottawa
or somewhere else. Then they come to the
deputy minister, who goes through them.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I also call a matter
to the attention of the honourable gentleman? He spoke about the Intercolonial Railway, saying that it had been absorbed into the
Canadian National Railways and that its rates
were made as high as those on any other railroad. I think that is the effect of what my
hdnourable friend said,; I am trying not to
misquote him. Is it not true that for a good
many years now the freight rates to the Maritimes have been tremendously reduced, and
that the railways have been reimbursed out
of the federal treasury to the extent of many
millions of dollars?
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: That is true, but
the same thing can be said with respect to
the freight rates all over Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

No.

Hon.- Mr. McINTYRE: The: railways have
been reimbursed frorn the federal treasury,
but that was to cover reductions in freight
rates throughout Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No. There have been
special rates for the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: But since the concessions were made to the Maritimes the rates
for other parts of Canada have been lowered.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pirie, the debate was
adjourned.

Hon. Mr. EULER presented Bill G, an
Act to amend the Dairy Industry Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourIs that to
able gentleman a question?
increase the price of butter?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: A more important
question is whether it is to increase the
supply of butter.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No. Butter may come
into the discussion, but in brief I may say
the intention of the bill is to repeal a portion
of the act which prohibits the manufacture,
importation and sale of oleomargarine and
similar products.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They are better than
what we have now, which is nothing.
The bill was read the first time.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. McL. ROBERTSON: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
called I wish to make a statement for the
information of honourable senators, particularly those whose homes are at a considerable
distance from Ottawa. It is my intention to
ask the Senate to approve of our adjourning
on Thursday, April 11, until Tuesday, April
30, unless sornething arises-and I think this
is hardly likely-to make such an adjournment undesirable or impractical.
As to our immediate plans, I intend to
move tomorrow that we adjourn until Tuesday evening next. My reason for suggesting
Tuesday ex:ening rather than _the afternoon
is that the Committee on Banking and Commerce and the Committee on Public Health
and Welfare are to meet that afternoon to
consider bills which probably will be ready
for them by that time. On Tuesday morning
there is to be a meeting of the Special Committee on the Income War Tax Act and the
Excess Profits Tax 'Act. Of course, if an
interim supply bill is brought down in another
place and passed toinorrow, and the Government desires to have it assented to without
delay, we might have to sit on Friday. But
I think that is most unlilsely.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Is the honourable
gentleman referring to next Friday?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No; Friday of
this week. As I say, I think it is most
unlikely that an interim supply bill will be
ready for us by then, so in all probability we
shall be adjourning tomorrow afternoon.

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, with leave of the Senate,
I move:
That in the opinion of the Senate it is expedient that Canada possess a distinctive
national flag. That the Senate do unite with
the House of Commons in the appointment of
a joint committee of both flouses to, ceonsider
and report upon a suitable design for such a
flag. That the honourable Senators David,
Davies, Gershaw, Gouin, Howden, Johnston,
Lambert, Léger, MeRae, Quinn, Robinson and
White be appointed to act on behalf of the
Senate as members of the joint comnittee.
That the said committee have power to send
for persons, papers ;and records.
That a message be sent to the House of Couimens to inform that House accordlingly.
You will recall the message received from
the House of Commons yesterday in relation
to this subject. I may say that this resolution is similar to the one which we passed
last session. Its purpose, of course, is to reappoint the committee then set up, but which
naturally went out of existence with the prorogation of parliament.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, I
would ask the honourable leader of the government to let the resolution stand until
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Very well.
The motion stands.
OPIUM AND

NARCOTIC DRUG BILL

SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill B, an Act to amend The
Opium and Narcotic Drug Act. 1929.
He said: Honourable senators, I would ask
the honourable senator from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) to explain this bill.
Hon. JOHN J. KINLEY: Honourable senators, it will be observed that this is an
amending bill. I may say that I have received
from the department the following information
in regard to the proposed amendments:
Upon the outbrealk of war the supply situation
mu relation to naircoties presented many difficulties, and it became necessary to place everything with a narcotie content upon a prescription basis. This was effected by nieans of resgulations issued under the W-ar Measures Act.
Upon the cessation of hostilities and the
gradual improvement of the supply situation, it
was desirable to decide upon an appropriate
peacetime standard for exemption from the prescription requirement. The Departicnt of National flealth and Welfare therefore consulted
the advisory committee of the Canadian Medical
Association, as also the Dominion Co.uncil of
Health. The standard embodied in the amendHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

ments now submitted is that recommended by
both bodies, -and the appropriate iedical and
narcotie control, officers of the department.
Effective January 1, 19-4,6, the War Measures
Act regulations were relaxed to precisely that
standard, so that if same is now included in
the Narcotic Act, there would be no difference
whatever in the present prescription requirements as affecting the public, -and would permit
of cancellation of the War Measures Act
regulations.
The remainder of the proposed amendnments
are of comparative unimportance, and include
the changing of definitions of "Minister" and
"Department" to conforma to the new Departnient of National Health and Welfare.
The Narcotic Schedule is re-arranged in accordance with the new standard above referred
ta, and is no longer divided into two parts.
The only change affecting the enforcement of
crimiinal clauses is in Section 4 (1) (e), where
the word "administers" is substituted for
"distributes".
In a word, honourable senators, this bill
embodies in statutory form- what is now
covered, by order-in-council. I have been informed that certain societies interested in this
measure are anxious to present their views,
and it seems to me that at the appropriate
stage the bill should be referred to one of our
standing committees, where representations
can be received.
The motion was agreed to, and
was read the second time.

EXPLOSIVES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill E, an Act respecting the manufacture, testing, sale, storage and importation
of explosives.
He said. Honourable senators, I would ask
the honourable senator from King's (Hon.
Mr. McDonald) to explain the bill.
Hon. JOHN ALEXANDER McDONALD:
Honourable senators, this is a bill for the revision of the Explosives Act of 1914, which
lias not been changed since it was proclaimed
in 1920. The act is based on the British act
of 1875, which also forms the general basis
for the explosives acts of Australia, New Zealand, Afric,
Belgium, and some other
countries. The proposed amendments are
mostly minor in nature, and result from experience in the administration of the act and
certain administrative changes in the depart,
ment.

MARCH 27, 1946
As honourable senators well know, I am not
an explosive expert; however, since the honourable leader of the government has asked
me to explain the bill, I have tried to learn
from the Chief Inspector of the Explosives
Division of the Department of Mines and
Resources what I could about the original
act and the amendments. My only personal
experience with explosives has been gained
while breaking the land and trying to round
out the back part of my farm.
In common with many honourable senators,
I do know something of the ill effects resulting
from explosives getting out of control. At
least two explosions of this nature have'taken
place in Halifax. The first of these occurred
during the first Great War, when two ships
collided in the Narrows leading from the
Harbour into Bedford Basin. One of the ships
was loaded with heavy explosives, and the
blast destroyed a large section of the north
end of the city with much loss of life and
property. The second such incident happened
last summer, when the south end of the magazine on the east side of Bedford Basin caught
fire and a number of explosions occurred. On
this occasion the residents in the north end
of the cities of Halifax and Dartmouth had
to vacate their homes, many of them in
expectation that they would never go back to
them again.
I recall another incident in Halifax when
a ship loaded with over a million dollar cargo
of high explosives caught fire. In an attempt
to prevent a severe explosion a large naval
vessel was brought up, and the burning ship
was sunk by heavy gun-fire. When the people
of Halifax heard the heavy guns thousands of
them went to their windows. Had there been
an explosion at that time, it would have
resulted in great loss of life.
I thought honourable members might find
it interesting to hear a review of this subject,
and that I might also express the hope that
the explosives of the Department of National
Defence, which do not come within the scope
of this bill, would be as carefully taken care
of as those of the Department of Mines and
Resources have been during the years the act
has been in effect.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: And as provided for
in this bill.,
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Yes, and as provided for in the amendments contained in this
bill.
I should like to digress long enough to say
that while I am not a Haligonian I have my
head office in Halifax, and for the last twelve
or thirteen years I have hived in that city.
From what I have seen, I should say the
63268-5j

49

people of Halifax have suffered more from the
effects of the war than have the people of
any. other city in Canada. Despite this, a
very large percentage of them have opened
their homes to the men and women of our
services. As I said in this house last Thursday,
I should like to have honourable senators
come to Halifax to learn at first-hand of the
hospitality of our people.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: The future development of explosives has not been forgotten
in this bill. The bill is entitled "An Act
respecting the manufacture, testing, sale, storage and importation of explosives." Recent
developments have shown that explosives are
now made not only from chemical compounds
and chemical mixtures, as was previously the
case, but may be made from elements or even
less than elements. As an instance, I cite the
atomic bomb. For this- reason the words
"whether chemical compound or mechanical
mixture" have been deleted from paragraph
(c) of section 2 of the act.
I asked the Chief Inspector of the Explosives
Division why gasoline was not included. His
answer was that it was not practical to include
gasoline, as it would involve the inclusion of
every internal combustion engine and every
motorcar.
Section 3 provides that the servants of the
Crown, both dominion and provincial, except
for those under the direction of the Department
of National Defence, are to be brought within
the application of the act. This change was
necessitated by a decision of Chief Justice
Hazen of the Supreme Court of New Brun-.
wick, in an appeal from a magistrate by an
official of the Department of Highways who
was charged with improperly keeping blasting
powder and detonators or caps. Following that
decision it was thought wise to inkclude the
Crown in both dominion and provincial fields.
A second major change is found in section
4, which authorizes the Governor-in-Council
to make regulations controlling the sale of
explosives.
Another important change is to be found in
section 18, subsections 5 and 6. Here it is
provided that an inspector may seize and
detain an explosive which he believes is not
authorized. Further, section 27, subsection 1,
provides for the forfeiture to the Crown of
any explosive which is not declared an
authorized explosive after a conviction has
been obtained.
Subsection 2 of that section authorizes the
minister to seize and destroy abandoned or
deteriorated explosives which may become a
danger to the public. In some instances it has
been found that an industry has moved away

SENATE
from a location leaving behind a quantity of
explosives, thus endangering those who afferwards occupy the property.
There is also provision for certificates for
registered premises. This takes the place of
an order-in-council, passed as a war measure,
ýo control the sale and use of explosives during the war. Before the war hardware stores
could keep blasting powder in unlicensed
premises, if it was for the use of farmers and
highway foremen. It was deemned desirable
that such premises should be registered,' s
that the inspector of the Explosives Division
could exercise some control and thus help to
reduce the number of accidents from explosions. Notwithstanding the fact that in recent
years explosives have been manufactured in
much greater quantities than previously, the
number of accidents bas been reduced. Last
year about 84,000,000 pounds of explosives
were produeed as compared to approximately
21,000,000 pounds twenty years ago.
I find a number of mistakes in the printing
of the bill, both in spelling and punctuation.
This means that the bill will have to be
amended, and I would suggest that it he sent
to committee, where it can be examined in
detail.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 1 slîould like
to ask the honourable senator whether the
proposed amendments have been submittcd
to the manuifacturera of explosiv es in this
country-and one firma in particular wbichi
operates on a large scale-and if their advice
bas been sought in the motter. I would think
it flot only wise but cery neccssary to do this.

I arn sorry that I have flot the answcr to

officiai of the dcpartmcent, would have dis

cussed the matter with Canadian Industries
Limited and other leading monufacturers.
They probably know about it. From my
talk with the Chief Inspector of the Explosives Division, I should say that hie was a
very efficient officer and would flot 'be making
these recoinmendations unless they were for
the good of the industry and of the country.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I do flot doubt
that for a moment. It may be that dcpartmental officiais have been in contact with
Canadian Industries, but if not I think it
xvould be well to notify Canadian Industries
to liCve o representative present at our
committcc.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Section 4 of the
bill, on page 3, under the heading "Regulotions," says:
The 0-overnor-in-Council may make regulatiens for any por-pose for which-i regulations rnay
be ma-de uoder tlîis act..
It would appear tliat the Governor-inCouincil could moke only such regulations as
are authorized bv the statute.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
gentleman from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald)
spoke of controlling the sale of explosives.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Section 4 goca on
to specify the kind of regulations that may be
mode.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I would like to ask a
question. Tlîe odministration of the Explosives Act, as the honQurable senator from
King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) stated, rests
with the Departmcnt of Mines and Resources.
In a general way I lîad some familiarity witlî
the administrotion of the old oct during the
pcriod whien I wos at the head of the department. I notice that in the interpretation section the definition of "factory" ia broadened
to include:
aonx bui1diiig or place witlîiii a factory site iii
whieli a fiiiishicd explosiv e is stored.
I would suggest that that definition be
scrutinized when the bill goca to committec.
If a small merchant in some outlying region
wos kecping in stock a hundrcd shot-gun or
rifle cartridges--which I think are regarded
as explosives, under the act-would he require
o licence, and if so on whiat terras could he
secure it? Perbaps my honourable friend can
givc us some information.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: On page 2 of the
bill sub-section (h) of section 2 defines "magazine," and tlien gues on to say that this does
not inohide various kinds of places set out in
six following paragraphs. The places mentioned in the fourth paragraph are "registcred

51

MARCH 27, 1946
premises," which would cover premises where
the proprietor of a country store would be
allowed to keep a small quantity of explosives,
say up to 175 pounds, for the use of farmers,
men on highway work, and so on. The fifth
paragraph goes on to exclude from the definition of "magazine":
any store or warehouse in which are stored for
sale authorized explosives to an amount not
exceeding that authorized by regulation.
Proprietors of stores and warehouses are not
obliged to have a magazine for storing such
things as fire-crackers, Christmas crackers and
Cther explosives of that kind. I remember
the Chief Inpector saying that it would cost
the merchants a considerable sum of money
to build a magazine, and it was not practical
to require them to do so.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, I have studied this bill and I find it is
substantially the same as the original act. The
only material difference is in section 3, which,
with a certain exception, makes the law applicable to the Crown in the right of Canada
and the Crown in the right of any province.
The explanato'y note opposite this seétion
suggests that the Crown was unintentionally
excluded from the provisions of the original
act. I do not agree with that. I believe, and
I think I may be able to show, that the Crown
in the right of Canada and the Crown in the
right of the provinces were purposely omitted.
The proof of this is in section 26, which is
exactly the same as section.27 of the original
act. It says:
Nothing in this act shall relieve any person of
the obligation to comply with the requirements
of any license law, or other law or by-law of
any province....
This shows definitely, to my mind, that the
provinces were not intended to be brought
within the purview of the act. Yet section 3
would bring them under the act and deprive
them of power te legislate with regard to
explosives. If we pass Section 3 we certainly
should have te delete section 26, because
there is a material discrepancy between them.
A provincial by-law or regulation might conflict with one made by the federal department,
so that a person conforming to the provincial
law might commit an offence under the federal
law. That would be an undesirable state of
affairs. I am familiar with the caqe of The
King v. LeBlane, which is cited in the explanatory note opposite section 3. In that vase
Chief Justice Hazen besed his decision on an
old principle of law. He said:
It has been determined time and time again
bey'ond question that a statute would not -apply
to the Crown unless special mention is made in
it to the Crown.

Since, therefore, the original act did not
mention the Crown in the right of the province, Chief Justice Hazen simply based hs
decision on the old principle of law that the
Crown as such would not be liable. The purpose of this bill is to make the Crown liable
in the right of the province. I am not now
expressing any opinion on wliether or not that
is desirable, but I certainly wish to point out
that the omission from the original act was
intentional.
Hon. Mr. McDON'ALD: If honourable members will refer to page 2 of the bill. they will
see that places where explosives are kept for
mining purposes -are excepted from the definition of "magazine" if the provinces have
regulations for efficient inspection. I wonder
if that exception meets my honourable friend's
objection?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: No. The section will
certainly have to be amended.
The motion was agreed, to, and the bill was
read the second time.

PRECIOUS METALS MARKING BILL,
1946
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill F, an Act respecting the marking of articles containing gold, silver or
platinum.
He said: Honourable members, I would ask
the honourable senator from Central Saskatchqwan to explain this bill.
Hon. J. FREDERICK JOHNSTON: Honourable senators will observe that the purpose
of this bill is to amend the act respecting the
manufacture, import, quality marking, sale and
advertising of articles made of gold, silver, or
platinum, and also of 'articles plated with any
of those metals. It is safe' to say that the
ultimate consumer knows less about such
articles than about any others he buys, and
therefore has to rely on the honesty and integrity of the dealer. In these circumstances
government standards are set up for articles
made of precious metals in order to protect
the interests of the public.
On July 13, 1907, there came into force what
was known as the Gold and Silver Marking
Act, which established standards for gold and
silver articles as well as for gold and silver

52

SENATE

plated articles. The increasing use of platinum
in the manufacture of jewellery necessitated
its being brought under the provisions of the
act, which accordingly was amended in 1928,
the title being changed to the Precious Metals
Marking Act. I might add that' this change
was made by the Senate, which also made a
number of other amendments. The minister
in charge in the other house stated that these
were a real improvement on the original
irafting.
The act defines certain standards of quality,
provides for the application of registered
trade-marks, and sets forth regulations for
their control.
Subsection 3 of section 6 of the bill will
permit the use of a trade-mark once application has been filed, and without waiting for
official registration. In some cases the Unfair
Competition Act of 1932 does not permit of
official registration before the expiration of a
period of six months from the date of application. Commercial Standard CS67-38 promulgated by the National Bureau of Standards of
the United States Department of Commerce
reads, in part, "shall have applied a trademark duly applied for or registered under the
laws of the United States".
Subsection 2 of section 8 reduces the leeway
on assay of silver articles. It is considered that
a leeway of twenty-five thousandths on assay is
too high. This has been reduced to ten
thousandths, thus reducing the quality of sterling silver to nine hundred and three
thousandths-a fineness which should not
rightly be described or sold as sterling silver.
I may say that under title 15, chapter 8, section 296, the United States Code provides for
the same leeway.
Subsection 7 of section 9 permits the application of a fractional quality mark to articles
1/10-12K. The use of the quality mark "gold
filled" is restricted to articles 1/20-10K or
better. The difference in quality is readily
seen.
Section 15 is amended to except precious and
semi-precious stones and watch movements
from forfeiture. It seems only fair that, where
there is a conviction under the act, diamonds
and other precious stones and watch movements should not be forfeited to the Crown but
should be returned to the defendant. This is
the purpose of the amendment. I think honourable senators will agree that, for instance,
an expensive diamond ring worth probably
several hundred dollars should be returned to
the person or firm from whom it was originally
taken.
The other suggested amendments do not
make any material changes in the act.
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from
consideration of His Excellency
General's Speech at the opening
and the motion of Hon. Mr.
an Adidress in reply thereto.

yesterday the
The Governor
of the session,
Hurtubise for

Hon. JOHN J. KINLEY:
Honourable
senators, before speaking to the motion I desire
to take this opportunity of paying my tribute
to the late Senator Charles E. Tanner, a fellow
Nova Sceotian. Mrs. Tanner's brother was a
physician in the town of Lunenburg, and
through hin I became quite well acquainted
with Senator Tanner and his family. He was
then very active in public life, being leader of
the Conservative party in the province. For
years he carried its banner against the strong
forces of Liberalism. He never succeeded in
leading his party into office, but he was always
elected in his own riding-convincing testimony of the confidence and respect which he
inspired in those among whom lie lived. He
was a ready and forceful speaker. In those
days the daily press printed his speeches
verbatim, and as a young man I always read
them with great interest. Politically we were
opposed, but personally we were always close
friends. He had great length of days and
did his duty in his day and generation. I was
grieved to hear of his death. I feel that in his
passing we have lost an able and, loyal Nova
Scotian and a great Canadian, and I should
like to join my colleagues in their message
of sympathy to Mrs. Tanner and the family.
I should like also to join in the tributes to
the late Senator Duncan, Marshall. I did not
know him as well as I knew Senator Tanner.
As I recall, I first saw Duncan Marshall at
the convention which nominated Mr. Mackenzie King as the leader of the Liberal party.
The late senator was then a delegate from
Alberta, and made what 'I-then a young man
-thought was a good speech. I still think it
was. One passage stands out in my memory.
He was criticizing the educational system,
and said he had noticed in our school primers
such sentences as "This is a cat," "This is a fat
cat", and he contrasted them with the sentences in the school books of Belgium, "This is

MARCH ý7, 1946
a horse," "This is a good horse". These appealed
to him strongly as being more appropriate, and
he urged that our farm boys should be tod
something about horses rather than cats. He
felt that from the very first day of their
school life the young farmers of the west
should be made conversant with horses and
live stock, so that they might be better
equipped to play their part on the farm. He
gained eminence in two political fieldsAlberta and Ontario-in each of which he
became Minister of Agriculture. On his
appointment to the Senate he took an active
part on the floor of the house and in committees, and I am sure that the service he
rendered was appreciated by all his colleagues.
1 regret his passing, and would like to join
in the message of sympathy to his relatives.
May I add my compliments to those
already extended to the mover (Hon. Mr.
Hurtubise) and the seconder of the address
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) on their fine speeches,
which gave every evidence of careful and
painstaking preparation. I should also like
to congratulate the other honourable senators
who have preceded me in this debate, for I
think we should in this chamber encourage
more and more discussion of the issues facing
our country. In this body there is supposed
to be wisdom and experience, but if we do
not talk, how will anyone know the important
part we are taking in the affairs of our country? The great difference between this louse
and the other is that more talking is done
over there. Yet it is clearly indicated that
in performing our duties of assisting and
advising the government we should discuss
matters vigorously. Therefore every member should take part in and contribute to
our debates.
Honourable senators, we are assembled here
for a session of parliament which may well be
the most momentous in the history of Canada.
Many of the problems confronting us are the
aftermatlh of the war. We cannot escape the
fact that we are living in wonderful and turbulent times. Five years of anxiety and sacrifice
during the war have left their mark on the
mentality of people everywhere. Now that
the war is over we stand in awe and amazement at what bas been achieved by science
and industry. The splitting of the atom'has
made possible the use of atomie energy, with
all its complications;'the speed of the airplane
has almost eliminated distance, and the· development of electrical appliances las made
the world an open forum. All these new
devices can be used for good or for evil, to
produce or to destroy. It is the will and mind
of man that must decide which it shall be.
With all our advanoement there is abroad
today a feeling of fear, confusion and feverish

53

impatience. This is a hazard which is the duty
of everyone to control. It is especially important that those in public office and public
life should think clearly and act justly, so that
we may attain and preserve our way of life as
a free people.
People of good will think the time has corne
when nations should settle their differences
without armed conflict. A few years ago,
when we were in the midst of perhaps the most
threatening phase of the war, the President of
the United States and the Prime Minister of
Great Britain met on the ocean to create the
Atlantic Charter. That charter was the enunciation cf the ideal for which we fought. Today there seems to be a healthy determination
on the part of the peoples of the earth to do
something practical in the *ay of bringing
about a better world.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: This determination
has culminated in the creation of the United
Nations Organization-a great and timely
achievement. It is the abiding hope of the
world. It is .the only real over-all protection
for the peace and happiness of the world at
large. It must not fail.
The creation of the U.N.O. does not permit
us to neglect our own security; our first duty
is to our own country. To protect ourselves
we must have at least two virtues, strength
and'good will. To be strong in her own right,
so that she can assert her dignity and influence,
Canada must keep step with the progress of
events and be ready to assume the obligations
placed upon her. To promote harmony among
the nations- she needs good will.
The other day we bade farewell to the Earl
of Athlone, who is leaving us, and, as was
most appropriate, we passed a resolution of
appreciation of duty well done. His successor
is to be no less a personage than Field Marshal
Viscount Harold Alexander; who distinguished
himself as a great soldier during the recent
war. The choice of Viscount Alexander by His
Majesty's advisers is indicative of their desire
that in these critical times we should be
strong from the top down. I am confident that
our new Governor General will be a good
adviser and will contribute much to the
efficiency and safety of Canada in the future.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
I now wish to say a few words about our loan
of 31,250,000,000 to Great Britain. It is not so
long ago that for her own development Canada
was borrowing money both from Great Britain
and the United States of America. But that
time has passed. Since then Canada bas borne

SENATE
alone the financial burden of ber war effort
and bas lent billions of dollars and made
substantial material contributions in order to
assist ber allies. After all this it should be
highly gratifying to ber people that Canada
is still strong enough to be able to make such
a substantial loan to the mother country.
The lending of money is nothing new. People
and nations have lent and borrowed through
all generations.
We recall the family of
Rothschilds, the great money lenders of
Europe, who becane extrenely rich and powerful. Great Britain became strong industrially,
as she lent money to Canada, the United
States and other countries. In earlier days
she financed projects in the Far East; her
money was spread all over the world. While
she always had an unbalanced budget it was
the unseen revenue flowing in from ber money
abroad that made ber prosperous.
So that everybody will understand the subject, let us bring it down to the experiences
of an individual. What could be better for a
successful country merchant than to lend his
money to bis neighbours, that they in turn
might trade with him to the benefit of all
concerned? This system of circulation is the
very foundation of financing. Our loan to
great Britain is based on the same principle,
but goes a little farther afield.
Before lending money one should be reasonably sure of its return. Where could Canada
place her money with greater security than
with the government of Britain-a security
that is enhanced now that we have an international bank dealing with loans of this kind,?
Also, since the money is to be spent in Canada
to buy our products, we shall soon have it
back, and we shall still have the security.
From an economic and business standpoint, is
there anything that could be more beneficial
to Canada's future than to be a lender nation?
There is also the humane side of the question
to be considered.
Who will say that after
Britain las spent much of ber life and substance in battle we shouild not come to her
aid and try to restore her so that later she
may be a help not only to us but to the
world?
I recall a story that was told to the young
members of a class some years ago. Two
young men in the -United States did not have
sufficient funds to enable them to complete
their college courses. They heard that the
great pianist, Paderewski, was coming to town,
and since they had a flare for musie they conceived the idea of hiring a hall and having
him play. For this they undertook to pay
him $1,000.
Tnfortunately the night was
storrny, and they collected only $600. They
went to the great musician and explained their
Hon. Mr. XINLEY.

predicament: they said they would give him
$600 and a note for the remaining $400. When
Paderewski had heard the story be said,
"Boys, I commend you for your. zeal and
ambition." Then Le tore up their note, gave
them back the $600 they had paid him, saying,
"Go on with your education." Later, during
World War I Paderewski became president of
Poland; and as you will recall, the United
States sent great quantities of grain to feed
the people of that country. While the men
in charge of the project were visiting Paris,
Paderewski sent a telegram saying that Le
would like to come and sec thern; Le wished
to thank the representatives of the people
who had saved Lis countrymen from starvation. He came to Paris, where Le met these
representatives and expressed his appreciation
of what had been done. Then one of them
asked, "Do you recall, when visiting America,
once helping two boys?" Paderewski said that
le did, whereupon Le was astonished to hear
the response: "Well, I am one of the boys,
and I have already been repaid for anything
that I have done." Then we all remember the
biblical injunction: "Cast thy bread upon the
waters: for thou shalt find it after many
days."

doctrine.

DUFF:

Good

Presbyterian

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: We believe, even in
the light of cold econonmic reasoning, that the
loan is justified-it is justifiable that we
siould help our best friend and also be of
service to humanity.
Honourable senators, I think we have all
been interested in 'the events of the last few
weeks, and the leakage of information through
the public service. Naturally it las caused
great concern. Personally I am glad the
government is dealing with the matter in a
strong and, I hope, effective way. A great
deal Las been said about the method of
handiing the case, and some legal minds seem
to be very much perturbed by the fear that
there has been infringement upon the liberty
of the subject. In Canada we have always
been careful to preserve the liberty of the
subject, and as a layman I think in this case
it las net been greatly impaired. I recall an
incident of some years ago, when I was a
member of the legislature of Nova Sceotia.
The liquor.laws were under consideration, and
there was a provision that a man charged
with committing certain offences must prove
his innocence. I said to my seat-mate, who
was an eminent lawyer, and is now a judge
of the province of Nova Sceotia: "I do not
like this legislation because it interferes with
the liberty of the subject. I thought a man

55

MARCH 27, 1M4
was supposed to be innocent until proven
guilty." H1e said: "That is true, but we are
dealing here with organized crime, so we
must take drastic measures." I do flot think
it was ever intended that the laws safeguarding
the liberty of the subject should protect organized criminal gangs. Some years ago Peter
Verigin, a Dukhobor, was being deported from
Canada, presumably by the Government. At
Halifax his counsel got an order for the issue of
a writ of habeas corpus. Verigmn was then
brought before Judge Mellish, a prominent
mnember of the Nova Scotia Bench, who would
flot permit him te be deported under the circumstances. That was an instance where the
liberty of the subject was protected.
I take it that the liberty of the subjeet
has to do with individuals. When you are
dealing with a fifth column'it might be disastrous to the state if technicalities were allowed
to interfere with the course of justice. During
the war we were supposed to lay our liberties
aside so that the state miglit carry on as
bcst it could. Now the storma is over, but the
seas are stili running high and much care is
nccessary to maintain the safety of the ship.
We must not forget that those arrested were
pro tected to the extent of flot being prematurely advertiscd throughout Canada as traitors
to the state. We must not forget either that
in association there is great power, both for
right and wrong. A man by himself can do
very littie. I am free to make proposais in
this chamber, but 1 can do nothing more
unless other members agrec with me. Evidence
can be .made and evidence can be destroyed
by people in dssociation, so the wisdom of
keeping these accused people apart is clear
to every thinking person. Fiurther, honourable
senators, it must be borne in mmnd that, after
months of investigation, they were apprehended just before parliament reassembled,
and that since then the whole matter has been
discussed at some length, particularly in the
other

house.

Did

any

honourable

member

propose a resolution of want of confidence

in the government because it had done its
duty in this serious situation?

What has happened should teach us one or
two lessons. One is the need for more care
in selecting those * members of our public
service te whom important secrets are to be
entrusted.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I do not think -that
scholastic attainments should he the controlling
qualification. The ability to speak a number of
languages is no guaranteé of a person's loyalty.

For their own preservation many Europeans
arc obligcd te become proficient in more -than
one language. Recent happenings should be
63268-fl

an incentive to Canadians to learn at least
the two languages of this country, so as te
fit themselves to take a more active part in
public affairs.
Something has been said about unemploy-

ment. I was sorry to note that tihe leader
opposite (Ifon. Mr. HKig), in mildly criticizing
the government with regard to unemployment,
included in the aggregate of unemployed those
who are attending educational institutions in
Canada.

I beg the honourable

Hon. Mr. HAIG:
gentlemnan's pardon.

I said there were 250,000

unemployed people, but that this number did
net include some veterans attending universities.

Hon. Mr.

KINLEY:

I will -read the

Hansard report of the honourable gentleman's remarks:
Toýday we are f a.cing :a very grave problem of
unempioyment. The nost recent -repor.t indicatee
,that there are 250,000 unemplayed people in
Can-ada, of whom 145,000 have made ýappli-cation for unemployinent 'insuranc.e relief. In
addition, soe 37,000 veterans are recelving unenploýyed veterans' relief, anýd this numaber dioes
flot include ail the veterans in Canadian uýniver'Sities.

If the implication is not that these people
are unemployed, I'do not know what it is.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If yeu check at the
unemployment insurancè office you will flnd
that there are 250,000 people unemployed, in
addition to those others I mentioned.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY:

I do not dispute the

honourable gentleman's figures, but I do say
that any implication that men attending universities are unemployed ie unfair.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: The inference is simply
that if .they were not attending universities
they would be unemployed, because there
would be no work for them.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I quite agree that
that is the inference, but I do not like that
inference.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: le it truc?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: They are attending
universities, yes, but I do not know how the
youth of the land could bo better employed.
At -our universities just now the number of
students is larger than usual because many
young people are completing the education
which they interrupted in order to go overseas.
In this age of edienoe anid machines it is vital
te the safety and welfare of our nation that as
many as possible of our young people be
given a good education.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Nobody disputes that.

56
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
though.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
unemployed.

SENATE
Don't carry it too far,
Talk about the 250,000

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I am concerned about
those who are unemploved. Most of them are
unskilled people who have not qualifications
to fit them for employment. I do not think
that any skilled men are unemployed at
present. I know that industry is tuning up.
There is a buoyant economy in this country,
and I believe that when industry gets into
its full stride it will make an effort comparable to that made during the war.
The honourable gentleman aiso mildly
criticized the government's agricultural policy,
and in particular he questioned the value of
summer-fallow. I cannot speak with authority
on that subject, for I am not well versed in
western farming conditions; but after having
heard it debated often in another place I
came to the conclusion that it is a good thing.
We were told recently that the government's
policy in this regard is unassailable, and that
annual production is increasing.
Now I come to taxation. That is sonething
which can very well be left until the Budget
is brought down. Of course, taxes are never
popular, and we should aN like to see them
reduced. But our country is strong and we
have a more abundant life than is to be
found in almost any other country of the
world. Those are the tests of taxation. It
is the over-all picture of the condition of our
people that must be accepted by those of us
who have to do with the affairs of Canada.
Our system is the subject of envy and admiration of people abroad. The Minister of
Finance has been made a member of the
Imperial Privy Council and created a Right
Honourable for his efforts, skill and achievements in the field of finance in Canada during
the war. While we hope for lower taxation,
we must be willing to assume our obligations
and pay our bills, realizing as we do that our
people are living better than Canadians ever
lived before.
Now I want te say a word about the
Dominion-Provincial. Conference. I think we
all agree that owing to the great burdens
imposed upon us by the war, our financial
affairs are abnormal. In this century Canada
has taken part in two wars and assumed
obligations that never before were thought
possible for the people of this country.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Durin the last war
the burden on the dominion was very heavy.
On the other hand, the obligations of the
provinces were in reality lightened, and they
profited by the wartime economy. Anyone
Hon. Mr. LEGER.

who reads their financial statements will see
that the provinces are in better condition
than they have been at any time in the past.
Their treasuries are overflowing. That is particularly true of Ontario. The Siroir report,
made prior to the last war, represented a
splendid attempt to adjust matters between the
dominion and the provinces for the benefit of
all concerned. But since the war the situation
lias changed and the federal government is
bearing the burd'en of a great wartime expenditure. The people who provide taxes for
the provinces are also the source of the
dominion's taxes, and surely some arrangement can be made for simplifying and reducing
the over-all taxation. If an agreement between
the provinces and the dominion had to be
irrevocable, I should say that no one could
be blamed for being very cautious before
entering into it; but the suggestion is that an
agreement be made for only three years. By
tîat time the provinces may be in a position
to present an even better case than they can
now. Who will say that in these days it
would net be beneficial to Canada to have
some co-ordinated and less complex system
whereby the necessary federal revenues could
be raised without subjecting the people to
excessive taxation?
I want now to say a word on foreign trade,
a very important subject. People are thinking
more liberally about this matter. We talk
about "free trade," but I think what we
mean is "freer trade." Trade is a two-way
road. How can Canada be a free trade country in a high tariff world? It seems to me
that a better thing te advocate is reciprocal
trade, that is trade with those who trade
with us. In any case, tariffs should no longer
be governed by political slogans, but rather
should be adjusted on a economic basis for
the mutual benefit of the countries concerned.
The producers of coal in Alberta and Nova
Scotia would be in a difficult position if the
home market was net protected by tariffs and
subsidies against importations from other
countries. On the other hand, the primary
industries of agriculture and fishing are looking
for world markets.
Coming, as I do, from Queen's-Lunenburg,
honourable members would naturally expect
me to say something about our fisheries. Last
night it was my privilege as a guest to attend
the banquet given by the Fisheries Council of
Canada. I was very happy because it was
the first time for me to see in this part of
the country evidence of prosperity among
those connected with the fishing industry.
That is as it should be in any self-respecting
industry. As long as that prosperity extends
to the humblest fisherman on the coast of
Nova Scotia I am quite content. I may

MARCH 27, 1946
tell honourable members that our fishermen
were neyer doing better than they are at
present. For the flrst time in their lives they
are beginning to get worried about thé income
ta,x, because they are reaching the point of
earning sufficient to support their wives and
families.
The Fisheries Coundil of Canada is a strong
organization. It is composed of fourteen
regional bodies representing various parts of
the dominion, and they. were assembled here
for the purpose of improving the industry.
The meeting was attended by the executive
officers of a kindred organization in the
United States, and the discussion centred
around subjects pertinent to the industry.
I arn confident that such meetings will bring
substantial benefits to, our fishermen. I was
glad to see that Lunenburg was well represented by Mr. C. J. Morrow, the president,
and Mr. Homer Zwicker, a member of the
executive. Both gentlemen are big producers.
and exporters of Nova Scotia flsh. I felt my
county was in the forefront of the fisheries
business, and that this strong organization
could do much for the benefit of the industry.
Our fisheries are successful at the moment
because, in the first place, fish are abundantthe result probably of enforced conservation
during the war. There was a: great wartime
demand for flsh and there are plenty of
markets today. We have better organization,
and the co-operation that always cornes witjh
prosperity, because we are in a position to
spend money to, improve our organization.
Fish being a higbly perishable product, quality
is aIl important. Marketing may ha one of our
problems of the future, for there will be keen
competition. Certain countries of Europe with
low standards of living will ba our compatitors. Even now they are sending flsb to the
United States in order to get dollars to purchase the things they need.- So you can see
that as to our American market, the most
sought after in the world, we shall have to put
forth our best efforts to hold it.
I think our lobster fisheries will stand up
against almost any adverse conditions imaginable-and certainly they were bad enough durin@ the war. But arising out of wartirne conditions, we, have found the North Arnerican
market able to absorb every lobster we can
catch.
The other day the honourable senator froma
King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald) spoke about
our shoýe fishermen. As individuals they have
not rnuch bargaining power, and they are a
long way from the market with a perishable
product. They need more co-operation, and
more stimulation to improve their rnethods,
to enable themn to succeed. I arn glad tio see
63268-61

57

that the coun.try is conscious of the fact that
a arnali holding is a great advantage to a
f armer in carrying on part-time fishing, for it
helps hini out and gives him a background,
whîch is very important.
When a year or two ago the bill to, provide
family -allowances was enacted I was enthusiastic, for I believed then as I do stili that it
would abolish poverty in the midst of plenty.
It has been a great encouragement to. the shore
fishermen, of the province of N.ova Scotia.
Such an excellent measure should commend
it-self to everybody in this country.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is that the speech
we heard from Prince Edward Island?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Our economnic system
was attacked and the question was asked:
Why should we have this poverty in the
midst of plenty? We are trying to abolish
that distressful, condition.
Honjourable senators will recaîl the legislaton dealing with floor prices. When the
price of fish drops tfb an unprofitable level
the fishermen need assistance. Thereupon
the government can fix a floor price and proteet the dealers by a subsidy. These measures
were taken in <rder to, stabilize our economy.
1 may be told. I arn painting a rosy picture
and there should be no roomn for any complaints. I would say in reply: Yes, there are
some complaints. We are tolcL that the export
restrictions are too, stringentHon. Mr. DUFE: Hea-r, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: -and that the margin
to the dealers is too high. Well, I think it is
too soon to appraise the situation. The attitude of our publie men should be one of
constant vigilance. I believe that in time the
expansion of present markcts and thc opening
of new ones for our flsh will be of great
concern to this country and a problem d-ifficult
of solution. So we must encourage efficiency
a'nd be ready to take advantage of every
opportunity to promote trade. With strong
organization and proper leadership the fisheries of this country should not be a Cinderella
but. should be a great industry for the benefit
of the whole of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DU FF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I have corne to the
conclusion, honourable senators, that in the
national interest and also in the interest of
Our fisheries we should try to induce the
domiinion of Newfoundland to corne into
Confederation.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: In the Maritimes there
is a feeling that Newfoundiland is a competitor

58

SENATE

in the fishing business, and that we should be
rnviting trouble by bringing ber into Confederation. 1 do flot think thore shouid be mnuch
fear of that, because bier fishing vessels have
equal *priviloges with our own. Truc, the
fishermen of Newfoundland have a littie advantage in that they have no income and
corporation taxes to pay. But 1 do tbink the
very fact that they are producors of the same
kind of goods as we produce, and cempetitors
with us i11 world markets, should encourage
us to ýwork toge-ther as one groat country.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: They are our best eustomers for manufacturod goods.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: 1 will corne to that.
The sanie sentiment is now becoming provalent
in Nowfoundland: the people there feel they
shouid be part of the Canadian nation. The
union would entail surue cost tu Canada, but
let us not forget that Newfoundland includes
aise a considorable part of Labrador. Newfoindisnd, now a market for mucli of the goods
of central Canada, wouid, I arn sure, become
a better market as an integrai part, of a wealthy
and virile country that now lends financial aid
to the Mothor Country. We in the Maritimes
would have a stronger influence in the Parliament of Canada hecause we would have
an other dominion added, te, the provinces of
Confederation. Frin the national standpoint
we cannot afferd to, do witbout this frontier
doiniion. The resuit of the union would bie
a stronger Canada, and Newfoundland would
ho raised te the social and economnic standards
we on.Îoy se ahuindantly in this country.
1 think, honourable senators, it is apparent
that 1 arn supjortingý the resolution before
the bouse.

Oh, oh.

conditions, net only as regards economnie
matters, but above ail among mon. Tbe task
will net ho an easy one, hecause for years we
have heen training men for war and instilling

Suceh a mnentality cannot be changed overnight. In order te roturn te normal conditiens and restere or eccnomy, each oneocf

country. Therefore, let us rid ourselves cf
niggardliness, and work witheut respite for the
moral, eonomic and social restoration cf each
individual greup that makes tîp our ccuntry.
At the prescrnt time the world is in a nervous state. Lot us look back te the years of
1937. 1938 and l939ý and sec if we are nct
again living in a condition similar te that
which existed when Hitler was waging bis war

'Fich is tory cf the sxorld teaches us that

MARCH 27, 1946
nation. Every mighty armed confiict bas
lowered moral standards. We must therefore,
meet the moral crisis, which is an even more
disastrous evil than the social or econamic
ills which beset us. To cope with this crisis
men must retrace their steps towards God.
When a nation no longer bélieves in divinity
nothing can restrain its passion for domination, since it has replaced the worship. due jto
God with the passion of pride, which. attempts
to subjugate everything to its power' Pride
stands for hatred; God is the symbol of love
and charity. If the ilis of the human race are
to be cured, man must realîze and remember
that above him reigns a supreme and ailpowerful Being who has created and bestowed
ail things in existence. Man must recognize
that he is altogether insignificant, and that
he is helpless without God's assistance.
How can man suceeed in his undertakings
if he refuses to co-operate with Him who , in
a flash, can create and annihilate the universe?
Why do we begin aur meetings with prayer,
if flot to implore light and wisdom from the
All-powerful? The Creator, if forgotten by
man, will no longer lean towards His creature,
and men will be left to live like the beasts
and to devour one another like wolves.
This moral and ail-important restoration
must be supplemented by social and political
re-establishment. In the economie sphere we
must attempt tb develap among men a greater
çlegree of kindliness, and make if e easier for
them by providing a more thorough education
and a wider knowledge, as well as by promoting
more agreeable and more cordial relations.
Finally, we must organize the life of nations
as we do that of the family. This social
economy must be supplemented by a sound
political economy which plans production,
distribution and consumption in such a way
that not only our own people and country, but
the peoples and countries of the whole world,
wîll enjoy in reasonable measure the good
things this earth has in store for all of us.
It is unthinkable, for instance,, that we in
Canada should have -so much wheat that we
would not know what to do with it. while in
certain countries in Europe people were starving. If we were ta keep for ourselves all that
wheat and other surplus goods we should not
be happy, because we would have toQ much
gaods and not enough money ta trade with.
That very idea is probably expressed in the
following excerpt from the Throne Speech:
The maintenance of « high level of -employment and nation-al income is a fundanental adni
of goveroment pcdicy.
Further on it adds:
The .government has steadily pursued ýitýs
efforts tO restore former markets, ta secure new
ma'rkets andi ta expand peace-time exports. lu

59

pursuit cf this W-liey, export eredit&, 'for which
additonai provision was made at the last session,
have bee-n extended ta several of or wartinie
allies.
And RLther stil:
At this session you will be asked to approve
an agreement, recently concluded, for a doan ta
the United Kingdom which wii'l help maintain
the British market for Canadian food psroducts
and other exports. The agreement wil1 vlso contribute ta the steady development of ýtrade hetween thq two countries, the removal of brade
barriers and the free use of currencies for international trade.
(Translation) May I be permitted ta discuss
briefly this matter of a boan to the United
Kingdom? In some circles the boan has seandalized people who believe that we have
already been over-generous with the United
Kingdom, and that the rate of interest is
lower than that paid on aur own Dominion
of Canada bonds. We already gave two billions, it is true, but we gave it in goods whiph
aur people were paid ta produce. Our farmers,
were paid for their produets and aur workingmen were remunerated. If that effort on aur
part has cantributed ta victory the gift will
not have been made in vain.
Now, let us suppose that through abstention on aur part, and consequently on the
part of other countries--because an example,
goad or bad, is always contagiaus--Hitler had
won the war. What would have becomne of
us? Let us not deceive ourselves! The Germ ans would have seized something else besides
money in aur country, as they did in ail the
countries which they eonquered. Hitler would
have donc here what he did everywhere else;
he would have taken ahl the food ta feed
Germany. Was it not Goering or anc of, his
ilk who said: "Before the Germans suifer
from hunger. all the other countries of the
world will starve."
But you might say that we are flot sure
that Hitler wouid have won the war, even if
we had not helped ta defeat him. Stalin and
his Russians might have beaten him. Would
Stalin and the Russian domination be preferable ta the German domination? For my. part,
I do not hesitate ta say that I prefer the way
of life which I now enjoy.
Let us consider that boan of $1,250,000,000,
and let us suppose that it might not be granted.
England and the sterling b-loek (which includes Belgium, Italy, Greece, Iraq, Egypt,
etc.) could not buy anything from us. What
would we do with aur production? Would
we sel! it ta the Americans? Perhaps wc couid
do so for a ycar or two, but what would happen then? Have we forgotten the lessons oif
the past? The Americans, being in a position
ta produce in their own country everything

SENATE
they need, have set up barriers and have
placed embargoes on our livestock, our butter,
our wheat and many other items.
Prior to the outbreak of the war our
imports from the United States exceeded the
amount of our experts to that country by
300 millions. Tomorrow, the same situation
will obtain. On the othor hand, before the
war, in 19D36, our experts to the United Kingdom amounted to 3M5 millions, compared with
imports worth 122 millions. In 1940, the last
yaar during which the operations were not too
niuch affected by the war, our sales to the
United Kingdomn amounted to 508 millions,
compared with purchases aggregating 161 millions. If we no longer sali our goods to the
sterling block, we shall be compolled to keep
them and curtail proportionately our economîic
activity, which will resuit in future unemployment.
Is it not preferable to lend even for a fiftyyear period a billion and a quarter to the
United Kingdomn and, as stated by the Minister of Justice, take an insurance policy against
unemployment, rather than rej oct that insurance policy, and having tomorrow hundreds of
thousands of unemployed, whom we will
have to save from starvation without being
able to give themn some constructive work and
then losing, not only for a few years but
most likeiy foroe r, a market which lias aiways bcen profitable?
Some might say, "Let us find other markets".
A market cannot bo deveioped ovornighit. For
instance, xvili South Amorica buy our livestock and our wheat? They are, like us,
exporters of such products. In regard to manufactured products we must, in the markets
of South America, face stiff compotition from
the Americans. Sometimes a business firm, in
order to retain a trade whjch it expects to he
profitable in the future, makes sacrifices and
even selîs at a reduced price, because it is
convineed that in a few years it will rccoup
those losses; and, it knows that that trade
which it strives to maintain and devalop during those difficult years will increase two-fold
or more. Why should not our country do
likewise?
Othars say, "With that money wa could, for
instance, build houses, which give, employment to thousands of workmen and, thus raduce unampioymont." By proceeding thuis, wa
would assist a certain portion of the population; we would help quite, a number of skilled
workers, but what of the others. Everybody
cannot ba a skil-led worker; everyone cannot
work in, factorias. We must aiso, think of the
farmers. If the farmers do not an'joy prosperity, neither will the country. What about
those, houses built with the utmost spead?
Lot us not proceed too hastily. Thora were a
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT.

few years ago similar financial and building
booms. Soon, thoso houses built hastiiy can
hardly be sold for haîf their cost, because when
they are, re-sold the housing shortage has
ended. It is said, "Not only would the construction of those houses require lumber and
would provide work for our people, but they
would aiso re-quiro cast-iron and iron materiais
which would have to be purchased?" If such
materials are to be found, it is necessary that
strikos should comne to an end. It is claimed
that in steel plants it takes a month to make
,up for the 'production lost by a week's strike.
As the strike lasted six weeks, this means a
six-month delay. The govornment is not solaly
rasponsibie, for the shortage of goods. Thora
are many other ralated, causes, and we must
admit it.
Finally, thora is something elsa whir-h appears illogical in this loan: The govarniment
borrows at 3 par cent interest and bonds to the
United Ringdom at 2 par cent. As 1 stated
at the beginning, it is no longer possible today
for a country to live in isolation. 'We ara
inter-dependent, and we are specially dependcnt on our neighbours. No one can imagine
that Canada may, alune, save the commonwealth and the whole sterling block. Such a
dlaim wouid ha praposterous. Therefore, we
must have tha co-oparation of our American
neighbours.
The 'United States is prepared -to iend
S4,400.000,000 to the United Kingdom, and
Canada $1,250,000.000. It is to ho hoped that
with this sumn of five and a haîf billion dollars
it wili ho possible tu reorganize the ecunomy
of the Commronwealth and of the couintries
belonging to the sterling block. Our noighbours, the Americans, have made t'heir loan at
2 per cent intercst, or rather, we hope that
thcy will do su no final decision bas been
arrived at-and the agreement with England
provides specifically that the latter ýcannot
borrow from. any other eountry at a higher
rate of intel-est than that agreed upun by the
American peuple. If xve demand 3 per cent
interest we wîll ho unable to make theo ban,
for the United States would object. Alune,
ive cannot restore the whoie economy of the
Commonwealth, but, in co-oporation with the
United States, we -can do su. This is the reason
why we are furced to acccpt 2 par cent interest.
As the Minister of Justice said, by way of
illustration, in granting this loan wo are taking
out an insurane policy against unemployment; and, as in ail casas where a poiicy is
issued, a premium must ba paid. Without this
loan we would have to consume a large proportion of our products, which are su abundant
that it is impossible for us to absorb themn ail,
and our national revenue would daclinýe pro-

MARCH 27, 1946
portionately. It stands now at 9 billion dollars,
and if redluced to, one-haîf of this amount
unemployment would prevail ovex the whole
of Canada. It would -be in.finitoly preferable
that the situation be the same as prevailed
before the war, that is such that it would
suffice to maintain our trade and increase our
exporta to a large extont. Howover, we have
to choose hetween unemployment, destitution.
etc., and the boan.
A third argument advanced by certain
people against the boan is that we are lending
proportiona;tely much more to, the United
States. At first, I was impresod by this.
However, 'before arriving at a conclusion, I
The
procured the following information.
United States exports from 9 to 10 per cent
of its total production, while Canada sela on
foreign markets more than 40 per cent of its
products. Once this comparison is established
the conclusion becomes evident.
Let us rc'vert once more to this smart idea
of an insurance policy that we intend to take
against unernployment, and let uis consider
what happened in the whole world during the
depression of 1930 to 1938. The United States
was exporting but 9 -to 10 per cent of its
national production. As soon as this production was reduced by haîf, the country suffered
a fearful depression when millions upon
millions of workers became unemployed.
As for us, our exports represent 40 per cent
of our total production. You can imagine
what the consequences *would be if this proportion declined by one-haîf. On the other
hand, were our national production to total
only 3 or 4 billion dollars instoad of 9 or 10
billion, you would have no trouble to realize
what the results would be on our economic
set-up. Our leaders are just as devoted to
Canada as we are ourselves, and in taking
their decision they have thought first and foremost çf Canada. If they have reachod such a
conclusion, it is because they have realized
that such a solution was the best. I do not say
that is the most advantageous, but, in the
circumstanoes, it has the least dra'wbacks.
Honourable senators, such is the problem as
I understand it. I have endeavoured to show
you a feature which fow people have seen.
The Speech from the Throne also refers to
housing and the building of houses. On all
sides we hear complaints. Flouses are scarce,
building materials are unavailable, and there is
a shortage of this and that. Lot us at least
be logical. We should realize that building
bas been more active than evor. Thereforo,
it is not surprising that materials should be
lacking somewhere, since the demand is greater
than the supply. Statisties concerning certain
cities show us that for the last four yýears more

61

houses have been buil-t in seventeen cities
than during the twenty years which .preceded
the war. According to figures recently quoted
in the other house, 44,000 dwellings were buit
in 1945, of whieh 39,000 were new houses.
Out of that number 36 per cent of the new
dwellings are in twelve cities only, while 27
per cent were built in rural municipalities.
Now, in 1929, which was the pre-war record
year, only 34,000 dwellings were erected.
In the Iight of those figures it is neot surprising that materials, especially lumber,
should be in short supply. The men in Iogging
camps are not appreciably more numerous
than before, and it is impossible to use more
lumber than can be obtained. According to
statistics. from 1934 to 1944 there were used
in Canada on the average 2 billion feet of
lumber, and during that period 48 per cent of
Canada's eut was exported; whereas in 1M4,
41-5 per cent of the Canadian production
was exported and the domestie consumption.
reached 2 billion 860 million feet. We are told
that in 1946 the lumber cut will amount-to
5 billion 200 million feet-a peak that has
never been reached before-and that more than
3 billion feet- of lumber, board measure, will
romain in Canada.
Moreover, the same situation can be seen
overywhere. Merchants are complaining that
they have no goode for sale. When asked
whether their trade is as considera:ble as it
was in 1941 they invariably answer: "Ycs, it
has become two, three, and oven five times
greater than in 1941." Therefore, it is not
surprising that some goode, should be scarce.
If a housing shortage has developed, it is
chiefly because of a shift in the population.
If a census were to be taken in our rural
areas, the result would be alarming. I wonder
whether much more than a quarter of the
population lives in rural sections, whereas
the opposite was true forty years ago. One
quarter of the population thon lived in cities.
The exodus from the land is the evil that must
be deplored. Young people beave the land to
invade the cities where they imagine they will
find pleasure, satisfaction and prosperity. Yet.
in the rural aroas, on the land, a quiet and
peaceful life is possible. With aIl the conveniences that can be enjoyed today, thanks to
electricity, how much happier, to -my mind,
could young people bo if they lived on the
landt
It is imperative that our leaders should
launch a widespread "Back to the land" campaign. Lot all mon of good will pool theiT
efforts with a view to stopping that exodus
from the land. If it is not soon checked, we
can ask oui-selves whether mankind will in the
future find enough food for proper nourishiment.

SENATE

(Text) : Last Thursday two of our honourable colleagues spoke of the land and of life
in the country. The honourable gentleman
from King's (Hon. Mr. McDona]d) concluded
bis fine speech with a piea in favour of cooperation. If we wish to organize without
delay a better world to live in, I believe
that our salvation lies in going back to the
land and relyipg upon co-operation as our
support and bulwark. In certain quarters
every possible means of opposing co-operation
is used. Some say it is a means of destroying
eapitalism, wbile others contend that it is a
movernent to annihilate private enterprise.
Some even say that co-operation is a formn of
socialism. if flot communismn. Co-operation is
nothing of the sort. It is flot a means of
destruction working against anyone. On the
contrary, it tries to ensure peace and
prosperity for aIl. The co-operatives' motto
or slogan is flot "Compete to live", but "Unite
to live". In co-operation we have good,
realistic and creative achievemrents; each member of the movement helps his neighbour and
prompts him to do good. Everyone tries to taise
to bis own level the neighbour who, yesterday,
was smaller and weaker. In a word, everyone
tries to help) bis neiglibour without ever doing
him any wrong. As our colcague from King's
said, private enterprise, maiy get alonz pertectly weil and prosper side by side with Cooperative enterprise, provided eacb works in
a so)irit of juistice and charity.
Co-operation is flot equalitarian socialism
nor dictatorial ronmnnism. On the contrary,
co-operation tends to dex elop in each individual a sense of responsibility and initiative,
because in co-operation each individual is
rewarded in proportion to bis effort. But cooperation does more than that: it develops
in its members a benevolent, productive and
educational spirit. In fact, in order to succeed
n co-operation each member muet be an
honest man. Finally, co-operation brings together the ricb and the poor, the weak and
the strong; and it devedopa among ail a spirit
of charity and mutual assistance, whichi may
help to render man better.
I, therefore, ask everyone f0 do bis utmost
to hielp the development of this beneficial
movement. lIn order to achieve a better world,
let us pray God, Creator of ail things, asking
Him f0 guide our intelligence so that we may
devote our encrgy to help our neighbours in
a spirit of charity, co-operation 'and mutual
assistance. If ea*ch one of us is better, the
world of tomorrow will be better.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine, the debate
was adjourned.

world as fortun-ately situlated as Canada is,
with hier great variety and extent of natural
wealth.
Mining is a comparatively new developmnent
in Canada. For many years at the tura of
the century the nýatural produet that was most
widely discussed botýh in eastern Canada and
in the West was our wheat.
The eastern
manufacturer and wbolesaler was deeply interested in the annual wheat crop of the prairie
provinces. because if it turned out well it
meant, that several h-imndred millions ýof dollars
would be spent on goods and services provided
by people in other parts of the country. Now,
the public imagination .has -noýt bee-n seized in
the same way with the valu.e of our minerai
produets. One of the henefits to corne from
a comrnittee -of bhe kindthat hias been proposed
woîîld be thec bringing home to the minds of
the Canadian people the fact that in our
metaýlliferoýus mines we have a very valuable
resource.
Practically all the -development of metalliferous mines lias taken place in the riorthern
parts of the provinces. Immense potentialities
in netal iining have been shown in the northcmn parts of all flic provinces except tîme
miaritimes and Alberta. As a gencral rule,
ia Canada we need a larger Klomestic ma:rket
for our agricultural produce. At the moment,
because of the heavy credits which the goverfiment is giving to Europcan countries-wisely,
I think-we are assured of markets for our
agricultmmal products over the next few years;
beyond that the future is a closed book.
But in th(, northern parts of Quebec, Ontario,
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, and in the North
M-est Territories, the demiand for agricultural
produce of aIl kinds will inerease with the
developinent of mining, since few of the
mining districts are capable of producing even
the simplest 'of food produets.
So 1 think the importance of mining developmnents to the farmer is clearly indicated. It is
of importance to others as well-to subsidiary
mî1anufacturing industries of all kinds, and to

SENATE

Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, when I left the West to attend here
it was not my intention to take part in this
debate, but since my arrival several matters
have come to my notice and I have decided
to make a few observations in reference to
them. I intend to deal briefly with divorce,
more briefly with butter, at a little greater
length with wheat, and very briefly with air
mail service.
Before proceeding further I wish to add
my congratulations to those whicli have been
already extended to the mover (Hon. Mr.
Hurtubise) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Burchill) of the Address, and also to the
other members who have taken part in this
debate. I do net recall any similar occasion
when we have had more informative and
strictly non-political speeches.
With regard to divorce, honourable senators
will have noticed that on Tuesday of this
week I presented 202 petitions for bills of
divorce. As this is the beginning of the session
there are likely to be further petitions, and the
total will probably reach from 250 to 275.
The cases based, on these petitions will have
to be heard and dealt with by our Committee
on Divorce. I was rather disappointed when
I found that the Speech from the Throne contained no reference to drivorce. Honourable
senators will recall that last session I advocated the setting up of a royal commission te
investigate the whole question of divorce in
Canada. I then stated that our divorce law
was out of date and needed to be re-vamped
and remodelled, and that I hoped some
method would be suggested whereby parliament would be relieved of this recurring
burden. I reiterate those remarks, and I hope
that in the near future a royal commission
will be set up to study and bring in a report
on the subject of divorce. If this course is not
taken, I would suggest that a joint committee
of both houses be appointed for the purpose,
and failing a joint committee, that a committee
of this house be instructed to take action. The
province of Saskatchewan has.a population of
less than one million people, and last year the
courts of that province heard 33·7 actions for
divorce. If honourable members wilI compare
the population of Saskatchewan with that of
Quebec-one million as against between three
and four million people-I do net think they
will be astounded by the fact tha-t parliament
at this session will have to ideal with upwards of
200 divorce cases from one central province.
In the other provinces the courts are busy
with a large number of divorce cases. I am
told that in the -city of Toronto there were
at one time more than 500 divorce actions
set down for trial. I am informed that the
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

list has been built up gradually and that it
will be some considerable time before the
cases have all been disposed of. I mention
these facts to show honourable senators that
the question of divorce in Canada presents a
very vital problem, and that the whole situation is one that should be discussed and dealt
with at the earliest possible date. I know
gentlemen, both from the East and West,
who are anxious to corne to Ottawa to give
evidence as to what they think should be
done.
May I speak for a moment about the
question of butter. When I left western
Canada there seemed to be plenty of butter,
and one had only to take his coupons to
the store to get butter to the full value of
whatever coupons were valid. On coming to
Ottawa I found the situation was not so
good. At the present time we have butter
in the parliamentary restaurant only on Tuesdays and Fridays, and very little on those
days. However, I find that the public restaurants in Ottawa serve it almost every day.
I wonder why the management of our own
restaurant is unable to secure butter.
I was under the impression, along with
some other senators, that our export butter
was being sent to England and Europe, where
fats for food are very scarce. Yesterday I
discovered an article in a newspaper which
said that in January and February of this
year 500,000 pounds of Canadian butter had
been shipped to the West Indies. Now, I
want to know why that butter was sent to
the West Indies. Was it because the people
who sent it there obtained a higher price
than could be obtained in Canada? If this
food is scarce in England and in Europe,
wihy is it not sent there? When we need
butter so badly ourselves I am not in favour
of sending it to the West Indies unless there
is some valid reason for doing so.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
The honourable
leader of the goernment in this house should
inquire into -the matter, and at some early date
give us an explanation of what is taking
place.
Honourable senators, my main reason for
addressing the house today is, that I want to
deal briefly with the question of wheat. As
you know, for many centuries wheat has been
the principal food of all nations. We read
about it in the Bible, and it was grown on
the banks of the Nile River and in the valley
of the Euphrates for many centuries. Wheat
is a peculiar cereal. If it is kept in a dry
place it will be preserved for years, and will
lose nothing of its qualities of germination,
or of its value as a food. I am told that

MARCH 28, 1046
*heu the tomb of King Tut was opened,
wheat was found which had been in the
tomb for several, thousand years. This may
or may flot be true, but a few years ago
I had occasion ýto visit an area a hundred
miles north of the city of Edmonton. Before
I went I was aked to caîl on a man there
who had won w'orld prizes for the production
of wheat. I visited this man and found that
he had a very interesting fàrm. He showed
me fields on which, without the benefit, of
summer-fallowing, he had grown crops of
~wheat for twenty years in succession, with an
average yield of over twenty bushels per
acre. He also showed. me certain plots of
wheat.
The grain in one of these plots, he hold me,
had corne fromn King Tut's tomb. I had
reason to believe that lie was more or less
blufflng me, aithougli the wheat certainly
looked as if the seed might have corne from
the tomb. The heads were about three or
four indhes long, two to three inches in circumference, and they had long dark beardHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Like King Tut?
S'ome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: -and they looked
very mucli like pictures I had seen in the
old family Bible.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: It was not a
spy was it?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I make these remarks to illustrate that wheat, if stored properly, can be preserved almost indefinitely and
can be used for seed or food many years
after it is produced. For that reason wheat
can be transported to' ail parts of the world
under almost any conditions, and if kept in a
dry.place will arrive safely at its destination.
XVe are told that in England, on the continent and in parts of Asia, the food situation
nt the present time is very grave. The Speech
from the Throne draws attention to this fact
in no uncertain termns. We are now being
asked to tigliten our belts and to produce
more food for export.
I was quite pleased to hear Mr. Pearson
and Mr. Lehmann say over the radio the
other day that during the last three years

Canada had exported. 1,000,000,000 bushels of
whcat. We only have to consider that figure
carefully for a moment to discover that for
thrce years wheat was shippedl at the rate of
1,000,000 bushels per day. I was proud when
I heard of that record; and I believe we can
keep it up if we s0w enough of our wheat
lands in the prairie provinces.
I shouid like to deal briefly with the question of surplus wheat on the farms in western
Canada. In sorne districts there is not much

67

wheat on hand, but in other areas millions
of bushels are held in the farmers' granaries.
This is the resuit of educating the farmer
over many years to build up a reserve-two
years' seed and two years' feed. You have to
have to have sufficient wheat on hand to meet
your obligations for a couple of years. If a
farmer selîs bis wheat and gets the money,
it will not be long before a higli-pressure
salesman takes it from him; but if the wheat
is in the granary on the farm, it is comparatively safe. The question is: Should we
market these rescrves of wheat?
The Minister of Agriculture for the Province
of Saskatchewan was quoted in the press
recently as follows:
Farmers should not ecomletely dean ontý .thei-r
'bins iintil týhey are certain they have new grain
to, put in themn. This is sounýd agricultural
policy, and we earnestly hope ahl farmaers will
face their individual problemas of feed and seed
needs shoýuld drouth ocour in the c&rming year.
The Minister gocs on to stress the world
demand for wbeat, and states that we should
do everything possible to provide food by
growing ahl the wheat we can. I agrea generally with that staternent, and think that the
grain in districts where there are large surpluses should be marketed.
The day before I left home to corne to
Ottawa I met a farmer who had several
thousand bushels of wheat on hand. The
reason he had not marketed it was that to do
so would put him in the excess profits tex
brecket, and he would be required to pay a
good deal in income tax. He said: "When
you get to Ottawa will you find out if the government will let us market this grain and
cancel ail income tax on it? If they do, we
will market it irnmediately." I told him that
was rather an impossible task for me; but he
seemcd to have a great deal of confidence in
my ability to persuade the government on the
point. Since my arrival in Ottawa the gove-rnment bas announced a policy which will
help out the farmer in this respect. The effect
of the new policy is this: if the present stock
of wheat is marketcd the farmer, for income
tax purposes, can spread the procceds over a
period of three years. I think the government
should have offered a further incentive by
increasing the price. If that had been done
a great deal more wheat would be ma.rketed.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Like rnany other
farmers I arn not satisfied with the present
price of wheat.
I wish to deal next with the question, of the
number of acres to lie sown in wheat this
year. Perhaps some honourable senators do
not understand that in meny parts of western

SENATE
Canada it is necessary to practice what is
known as "dry farming." It is true that around
the city of Winnipeg, in that famous province
of Manitoba about which we hear so muchSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: -and in some parts
of northern Saskatchewan and Alberta, a good
deal of spring and fall ploughing is donc, but
there is not much land in summer-fallow. In
other parts of western Canada one cannot be
certain of a good crop unless one-third to onehalf of the wheat-producing land is summerfallowed each year. In Rosetown district we
summer-fallow almost half the land. The
farmers find that this practice conserves moisture, keeps down weeds and in a dry year
gives reasonable assurance of a crop.
Some honourable senators may not know
what summer-fallowing means, but I think it
is generally understood that it is the ploughing
or surface cultivation of land in the spring,
after the crops -have been planted on the other
lands. Summer-fallowed land is kept cultivated during the summer. The weeds are
kept down, and where rain falls it soaks into
the soil, and in the fall it freezes. When
spring comes the winter's snow melts, and a
good deal of moisture is stored up to supply
the growing plants, even though the season
may be dry.
A few years ago when more wheat had
accumulated in our granaries than we knew
what to do with we were encouraged to do
more summer-fallowing and grow less wheat.
Honourable senators will remember what was
called "wheat acreage reduction"-that a bonus
was paid to farmers to summer-fallow more
and sow less. As a consequence there is a great
deal of summer-fallowed land on the prairies
at the presont time. Let me give some figures.
In 1931 the prairie provinces had 26-5 million
acres in wheat and 12.5 million acres in
summer-fallow. The summer-fallow that year
was 48-5 per cent of the acreage in wheat.
In 1939 there were 25-8 million acres in
wheat and 14.7 million acres in summer-fallow.
For that year the summer-fallow was 57 per
cent of the wheat acreage.
Now I will pass over some years when the
wheat acreage reduction was in effect and
come to 1945. That year there were 22-6
million acres in wheat and 19.4 million acres
in summer-fallow. The acreage in summerfallow was then 86 per cent of that in wheat.
The point I am trying to make is that there
seems to be a desperate need for food, and we
can produce a great deal more wheat in western Canada this summer by reducing our
summer-fallow. For instance, to go back to
the 1939 level and summer-fallow only 14-7
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

million acres, would give us 5 million acres
more in wheat this year than in 1945. If it
happens to be a comparatively good year and
the yield is 20 bushels to the acre, that would
mean an additional 100 million bushels. If we
have a comparatively poor year, with a yield.
of only 10 bushels, we still would have an additional 50 million bushels by reason of reducing
the summer-fallow.
But I think we can do better than that, by
going back to the level of 1931, when we had
12.4 million acres in summer-fallow.
That
would give us seven million acres in wheat
more than we had last year.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: May I ask the honourable senator a question? These seven million
acres would be on spring ploughing, would
they?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No; we do not
spring-plough in the west. I will explain the
process. Yeu sow your wheat on black land,
which is summer-fallowed. The height of the
stubble on the land after the wheat is cut in
the fall may be two feet or more, if you eut
with a combine, or about one foot, if you eut
with a binder. The snow stays on the ground
all winter and in the spring it melts into the
soil. Now if we fall-plough we do net get
the full benefit of the snow; and if we springplough we dry out the land too much. Therefore we use what is called a tiller-combine or
a dise or a cultivator te work up the stubble
land on which the crop grew the year before,
and we prepare the seed bed. Most of the
stubble is on top of the ground in a loose form
and prevents the evapora'tion of moisture from
the soil. That type of land will ordinarily
yield a crop half as large and sometimes fully
as large as a crop grown on summer-fallow.
In 1946 we can sow seven million acres of
stubble land, and if that happens to produce
20 bsiels to the acre we shall have an additional 140 million busiels for expert to Europe.
Even if we got no more than 10 bushels, there
would be an additional 70 million bushels.
I corme now to the question of income tax.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before the honourable
gentleman goes on to talk about income tax,
rnay I ask how he knows so much about farming? I thought he was a lawyer, and I was
net aware that lawyers farmed.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I cannot see in the
chamber at present anyone who has grown as
much wheat as I have. I should like to inform
the honourable gentleman that I have been
very much interested in dry farming since 1919.
Net only have I given close attention to the
farming done on the land that I own, but in
my law practice I am constantly dealing with
ratters affecting farniers. Nine-tenths of the

MARCH 28, 1946
business in my law office has to do with farm
contracts, leases, agreements for sale on a cash
basis and on a bushel basis, the making up of
farmers' income tax returns, which show the
number of bushels they grew and the expense
of carrying on business, and all that kind of
thing. So I think I can safely say I know
something about the subject.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Do you grow much
wheat yourself?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is what I want to
know.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What do you mean
by that? Do you want to know if I go out
and do the ploughing?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: iNo. How much wheat
do you produce on your farm?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In 1940 we grew,
on the land which I own, 80,000 bushels of
wheat.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: That is enoueh.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: In 1942 we grew
more than that.
When I was interrupted I was coming to
the point that the big problem facing the
farmer when he is considering an increase in
his , wheat acreage is not the possible harm
that would be done to his stubble land by
sowing it to wheat, but the amount of increased
income tax he would be obliged to pay by
reason of his gi'eater production. I do not
think there is any area in Canada that pays
more income taxes than our district -does.
Many of our farmers pay an annual income
tax of anywhere from $5,000 to $10,000, and
some of them pay excess profits taxes in
addition.
Hon. Mr: HORNER: You are in the
Palliser triangle, where farming is said to be
unprofitable.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Since 1939 more
wheat has been grown in the Palliser triangle
than in all the rest of Canada. That may
sound strange, but it is a fact.
Hon. Mr. VIEN:
Will the honourable
senator tell us how individual farmers become
subject Vo excess profits taxes?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: If, after deductions
have been made for expenses and so on, a
farmer's net income is more than $5,000, he has
to pay the excess profits tax on the amount
above $5,000.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: That does not apply to
an individual?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Oh, yes. Hundreds
of farmers pay excess profits taxes.

69

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Are you speaking of the
graduated income taxes?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No. Anyhody who
has a business of any kind that makes a net
profit of more than $5,000 a year fias to pay
the excess profits tax on the excess over $5,000.
This applies to everybody in business, but not
to people in professions, such as lawyers,
doctors and so on. It applies to farmers and
all other individuals who run businesses.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Individual farmers?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Oh, yes. It does
not matter whether a business is run by a
corporation or by an individual.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: In the determination
of what are excess profits the standard years
are 1936 to 1939, are they not?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: My honourable
friend is torrect; but in those years we had
very poor crops and $5,000 is the standard
applicable to us. Now, if our farmers produce
more wheat this year they will get into the
excess profits brgcket; and most of the extra
money they get will go in income taxes.
Farmers w11 therefore hesitate before sowing
more acres. My suggestion is that the extra incorne tax levied against the farmer be spread
over a ten-year period. He could make an
affidavit as to the extra area of land sowed
and the crop grown on it, and he should be
allowed to spread his income from that extra
crop over the next ten years.
Now I want to say a few words about the
price of wheat.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Regardless
of whether we advocate more or less summerfaldow, or more or less wheat acreage, will not
the average farmer in western Canada sow the
land which according to his own best judgment
is fit to be sown?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No. I think the
farmer will be influenced quite a bit by the
information he gets over the radio and in
the newspapers. I am quite satisfied that a
lot of farmers in our district who have been
summer-fallowing half of their land may put
all of it in wheat this year.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: What would induce
the farmers to sow a greater acreage than they
did last year?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The need for wheat,
the market.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The market is the
same as it was last year $1.55. What would
induce thern to increase their production this
year?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: They are desirous
of producing all the food they can to help
out the people in England and on the European
continent and in India. Besides, the price
is not so low that farmers cannot make a
profit on wheat. The need for more food
has been publicized so extensively in the press
and over the radio-we hear appeals every
day-that farmers will naturally want to increase their wheat acreage, unless the government tells them not to do so.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I ask the honourable senator a question about the income
tax? He states that the excess profits tax
is ýlevied against the net profits in excess of
$5,000 made by a farmer or a man in any other
business. My understanding is that the excess
profits tax is levied only on the net profit
in excess of a certain base sum, which is
arrived at by 'averaging the net profits for
a certain three years. If that average is, say,
$20,000, the excess profits tax applies only
to the net profit in excess of that sum. If a
fariner's average for the. bhree years in question was $10,000, et us say, then he would
pay the excess profits tax only on his net
profits above $10.000, not on the amount
above $5,000. Is that not correct?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: There is a standard
period.
During the standard period from
1936 to 1939 the crops were so poor that no
farmer had a net annual income of $5,000.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is the answer to
my question.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes. I am not
satisfied with the price of wheat at the
present time. The initial price of $1.25 is
paid to the farmer when he gets his certificate
from the Wheat Board. Later he will receive
a further sum after all the expenses of the
Wheat Board, with its thousands of employees,
have been deducted. The export price is $1.55
per bushel: The world market price is $2.02
per bushel. The farmers of the west are
selling wheat at $1.55 per bushel for humanitarian reasons. That is a very high-minded
gesture on the part of Canada, as I think all
honourable senators will agree. I submit that
if Canada wants to sell her western wheat to
Europe at $1.55 per bushel the farmers should
not be expected to bear the whole burden.
Either they should be paid the market price
or Canada as a whole, rather than the farmers
of the west, should make up the difference.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:

Hear, hear.

An Hon. SENATOR: What do the American farmers get?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: They get $2.02 a
bushel. Since 1914 the price of wheat has
increased by 60-5 per cent. In 1944 hourly
wages to industrial labour had increased 161-9
per cent; the percentage is considerably
higher today. If the price of wheat paid to
the farmers had gone up at the same rate
as industrial wages, it would now be $1.93
per bushel, or very close to the open market
price of $2.02. The difference between $1.55
and $2 is what the wheat farmers are losing,
and this loss should be borne by the whole
dominion and not by the wheat farmers
alone.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: What about industrial
prices?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
mean
friend
honourable

What does my
by "industrial

prices"?

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: My honourable friend
said that if the price of farm products had
increased by the same percentage as industrial wages, wheat would be at a certain
price. The fact is that industrial prices have
been under a ceiling since 1941.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I am not an industrialist and therefore I fear I cannot
answer my honourable friend's question.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The very same thing
applies to industry. The condition is general.
If the price of
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
wheat had been raised to $2 a bushel-and
I am in favour of its being raised that highquite a large sum would have been collected
in income tax, and Canada as a whole would
not have been prejudiced by the higher price.
That is all I have to say on wheat unless
honourable senators have any further questions.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
The honourable
gentleman is talking about the price of
western wheat?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: Ontario wheat is
quoted at from $1.12 to $1.14 a bushel, and
our farmers do not get any further payment
later on. It looks as if the western farmer
bas always to be considered in fixing the
price of wheat.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I believe the honourable gentleman told me that the farmers
of Ontario get the same price for wheat as
we in the west do.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

MARCH 28, 1946
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The price of western
wheat is f.o.b. Fort William.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: My honourable
friend from Saskatchewan North gives the
explanation. The price of $1.25 per bushel
is f.o.b. Fort William. When you market
your wheat you have to take off 18 cents a
bushel for handling, elevator charges and
freight. So that brings the net down to the
price in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: My point is that
the price fixed for Ontario wheat is based on

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The Ontario farmer

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:

No.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: At any rate there
is not very much difference.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: May I ask the honourable member a question? He has told us
that more and more land has been put into
summer-ffllow. Has he any figures on the
comparative yield in the years when the
acreage summer-fallowed was increased?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: As a matter of fact
we had larger crops in 1939, 1940 and 1942
than in any of the other years, because we
had more rain; but generally speaking summer-fallow will give a heavier yield than
stubble.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I have heard it stated
that by leaving land in summer-fallow the
yield would be largely increased.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: On summer-fallowed land in our district the average yield
of wheat from 1911 to 1930 was 33 bushels
to the acre. , Naturally the yield varies,
depending on the rainfall.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Summer-fallowing is
most valuable in dry years.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: For thirty years I
have heard the Rosetown district referred to
as the garden of the west. May I ask the
honourable gentleman whether there has ever
been a crop failure in that district?

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes. In 1937 we
could not grow anything. In that year virtually nothing was grown anywhere in the
west-unless it was around Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. A. L. BEAU'BIEN: There has
never been a crop failure in the Red River
Valley.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

Never.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I can give you the
poor crop years.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Do not hurt us with
that.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I know them all.
They were 1914, 1917, 1919, 1924, 1933, 1937;
1941 was average, 1944 light. In only tw*o
or three of those years were there what you
would call crop failures.
Honourable senators will recollect that last
session I referred to the unsatisfactory air
mail service in the west. I am glad to say
that since then the service has been somewhat improved. But several persons who read
newspaper reports of my remarks have written informing me of instances of slow service. For example, a letter sent by air from
Barrie,. Ontario, was not delivered at Kamloops, British Columbia, until six days later.
According to the writer, the delay could not
have been due to the planes being grounded,
for delay frequently happens irrespective of
weather conditions. The air mail service
between Toronto and Vancouver, Montreal
and Vancouver. or from coast to coast is
more or less satisfactory; but I do know that
if I post an air mail letter in the Senate
post office between 4 and 6 o'clock in the
afternoon, it is very seldom despatched from
Ottawa until the next day, notwithstanding
the fact that the plane leaves at 9.30 p.m. The
Senate Postmaster advises me that the mail is
picked up in good time and taken to the main
post office behind the depot. It is there that
the delay occurs. It appears that the air
mail, being mixed with the other mail, is not
sorted in time to be taken out to the air
field and put aboard the plane. As a result my
correspondence with my office is one day,
and sometimes two days late. I would suggest
that the trouble might be overcome in the
Senate post office by keeping the air mail
separate from the other mail. All air mail
should be taken to the main post office and
sorted immediately. I appreciate what the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Robertson) did to improve conditions after I
directed his attention to the delay last session. The service is improving, but it is still
not satisfactory. I believe many of my fellow members have had reason to complain of
delay in air mail service. The general experi-

SENATE
ence seems to be that air mail does not arrive
on time, except when it is sentý from one
large centre to another quite a distance away.
The time lag is in between somewhere. I
think the reasons, for such delay should be
investigated at the earliest possible moment,
so that the necessary measures may be taken
to expedite air mail.
Hon. JEAN MARIE DESSUREAULT
(Translation): Honourable senators, in addressing this honourable house for the first
time, I think it proper, that J, as the representative of a division that includes the city
of Quebec, the chief French centre in Canada,
should first make use of my mother tongue,
Which is spoken by an immense majority of
the Quebec people.
In my own name and on behalf of my
fellow-citizens, I must first convey to the
Prime Minister my sincere gratitude for having raised me to the d-ignity of a member of
the Senate. I aJso desire, since this is the
first opportunity I have had of doing so, to
offer Ris Honour the Speaker, the leader of
the government, and the leader of the opposition, my compiments on their courtesy, dignity and efficiency in discharging their respective duties. May I be permitted also to join
with honourable senators who have spoken
before me in congratulating the mover and
the seconder of the Address; they have fulfilled their task in a dignified, and admirable
manner.
Finally, with all Canadians, I should like to
say that I have hailed with joy the honour
which was conferred on the Minister of Justice
and the Minister of Finance when they were
recen>tly appointed to His Majesty's Imperial
Privy Council.
(Tex.t): I wish to thank all the honourable
members of -this house for their kind welcome
when I first had the honour to share with them
in the work and duties of this bouse. I must
say tha-t I shall always do my best to e equal
to the task abead, and to uphold the great
traditions of this honourable house. I have
been greatly impressed by the evident spiri.t of
understanding and co-operation displayed by
members on both sides.
The events which have occurred in this
country since last session could very well
disrupt the unity of our country if they were
net considered from a truly Canadian viewpoint. On the other hand, we all have an
opportunity to work for a stronger and more
prosperous nation. The Speech from the
Throne seems to me to outline a vast and
comprehensive program for the future of
Canada. When the war ended we were all
looking forward to a long era of peace; but
when the present session opened, all sorts of
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

news reports and rumours were in the minds
of Canadian citizens everywhere. We heard
fantastic tales of spying, which we hoped were
much exaggerated. We must now come to
the conclusion that there was much bitter
truth in these rumeurs. However, it seems
evident that the government was, and is,
taking good care of the security of the
country; and we are all convinced, I am sure,
that law and order will prevail and that no
harm will befall our good relations with our
wartime ally, Russia. Everyone must remain
calm and trust the government, which already
is emerging from the whole affair with even
more prestige than before.
May I now say a few words about the projected loan of $1,250,000,000 to Great Britain.
It can be said that at first the news of this
loan was looked upon by some Canadians
as a mere gift to a country which many regard
-erroneously, perhaps-as being imperialistic.
But such feelings are rapidly changing. In
the province and in the city of Quebec people
think before taking sides on any question,
whatever their first reactions may have been,
and I believe this loan is now being considered in its true perspective. I have no
doubt whatever that if there is a continuation
of the good educational work already started,
public opinion will favour the loan.
I live among workers. I have spent all
my life with them, and I know the tremendous efforts and sacrifices they made to the
winning of the war. They have every right
now te a good standard of living; and on
their behalf I would surely object te a loan
that would seem to be a pure gift to Great
Britain, although I am well aware of the
splendid behaviour of the British people both
during and since the war.
If I study the proposed loan from the
viewpoint of a realistie and business-like
Canadian, I cannot but favour it. I think it
is truly imperative if we are to have continuous and wholesale employment in Canada.
I believe the loan to be in the interests of
Canadian farmers and other workers in general. In Quebec a few days ago I had the
pleasure of listening to the Minister of Justice; who endeavoured to explain the reasons
for this loan. While I listened to him it
seemed to me obvious that in order to maintain in Canada a bigh level of employment,
to improve and increase our industries, trade,
commerce and finances, we must lend this
tiemendous amount of money te Britain.
No one among us, I am sure, wishes to
return to the unhappy thirties, when so many
Canadians were iout of work and we were
forced to put all sorts of restrictions on our
trade-restrictions which could only worsen

MARCH 28, 1946
the situation. In my division as much as
anywhere, and perhaps more than elsewhere,
people do not want charity; they want to
earn the good things of life that they wish to
enjoy. They understand that a loan ean be
an investment, especially if it guaranteesas it does in this instance-jobs for most if
not for all Canadians.
With my feet on the ground and without
looking at facts from too lofty a pinnacle,
may I venture to suggest another viewpoint
from which we might consider this projected
loan? We all know that the masses in many
countries are moving more and more to the
left. The Canadian and the English peoples
must not be driven to despair, for this would
only throw them into the arms of agitators
and, perhaps, eventually lead them to communism. A great Canadian from Quebec used
to say "The best way to fight communism is
to make a success of our way of life and of
our economic and political institutions." I
think I have said enough on the subject. I
feel certain we all agree that we must support
the government in this matter.
The Speech from the Throne announces the
government's intention of centralizing all the
housing agencies under a single administration. We can come to the conclusion, I
believe, that the housing bill will be one of
the most important pieces of legislation to
come before us this session. The shortage of
lumber is a direct cause of the housing shortage. I believe that we must export as much
lumber as possible and must try to find new
outlets for our raw materials; we must also
use all means possible in order to fight unemployment. At the same time, I believe it
would be wise to export only our surplus
lumber, a't least until such time as Canadians are comfortably housed. During the
war we could understand the action of the
government in taking over most of the lumber
production; but now that the war is happily
ended, it seems to me that we must give our
own citizens every facility for proper housing.
That means they must get all the lumber and
building materials -they need. Surely a country
as rich as Canada can afford to give them
that.
This brings me to the question of government controls. Many of them already have
been lifted, and properly so. The government
is patiently doing its best in this matter. Like
my honourable friend from Northumberland
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) and many other businessmen, I have at times disapproved of
several controls that I deemed uncalled for.
Yet I know that there are good reasons for
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, and I
believe that for some time to come we must

73

put up with price ceilings on building materials.
But controls must be real, they must be put
into effect and must be respected. Otherwise
they are useless-worse than useless--they
hinder the lumber and building trades and
harm the whole country. I am sure I voice
the opinion of all retail lumber dealers when
I say ceilings are too often ignored and that
there is a tremendous amount of black market
dealing, especially with small producers. If
prices are not high enough to meet increased
wages and costs of production, let them be
raised. In the meantime, ceilings should be
respected or abolished.
(Translation): Honourable senators, I hope
you will not object if I conclude my remarks
in my mother tongue. I wish to keep them
within certain limits, but-I do not want to
resume my. seát without pointing out to the
government some projects which are of special
interest to Quebec. I believe that particular
attention should be given to our problems,
and for a good reason. We had no heavy
industries in our district during the war; therefore we cannot, like others, derive any benefit
from the government's reconstruction and reestablishment projects. That is why unemployment affects Quebec perhaps more than
other parts of the country. We already have
an alarming number of unemployed. The
Quebec authorities naturally feel some concern about the problem and are endeavouring
to solve it. In co-operation with the district
committee on reconstruction, and with its
approval, they have submitted to the government comprehensive plans for important and
urgent public works. In the best interests of
Quebec, such works could be undertaken to
relieve unemployment. Among others I shall
mention particularly the construction of a
canal and locks on the St. Charles river. These
projects were approved and work had been
started in 1914, but it was interrupted by the
first World War. It is imperative that work
on these projects be resumed. This development is part of a plan that involves the
enlarging of the Quebec harbour, and it would
facilitate the operation of small and medium
sized vessels.
Let me again express my thanks to you,
Mr. Speaker, and to my colleagues. I feel
that in my remarks I have only stated the
views of a great majority of the worthy
citizens that I have the privilege of representing in this honourable house.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Sinclair, the debate

FIRST READING

A message w as received from the buse of
Commons withi Bill 11, an Act for granting
to lis Mai esty certain sums of money for
the public serv ice of the financial year ending
the 3lst March, 1947.
The bill was read the flrst time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, whien shahl this bill be read the
second time?
Hon. W]SHART
McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, with leave, I would
move second reading nowv.
This bill grants interima supply of $273,197,945.7ô.
This is one-sixtb of the total
estimates of $2,769,349,815.66, less statutory
expenditures.
These estimates,
compared
with those of the previous fiscal year, show
i decrease of almost two billion dollars.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, the total of $2,769,000,000 is, I tbink,
much higher than was generally expected. If
the budget is to be balanced tihere is absolutely no hope of holding the hune on taxaHon. Mr. DESýSUREAULT.

tien, and probably the rate of income tax
will have to be increased at least 50 per cent.
I know I shaîl be told that a substantial part
of this total is made up of demobilization
and similar expenses; but we must remember
that the war in Europe bas been over now
for about eleven months, and we took very
little, if any, part in the war in the Pacific.
I presumne this is not the pro-par time to
discu.ss financial arrangements, because we do
flot yet know wbat the budget has in store for
us . Undoubtedly we shahl not get the estimates
for the current fiscal year untiýl near the end of
the session, when, the budget debate having
been concluded in the other place, there will
be no further public interest in any similar
debate here. Many people appear to think that
wve in this chamber have no knowledge of
finance or taxation. I have always fait that
orne arrangement should be made se that
simultaneously with the presentation of the
budget by tbe Minister of Finance, the govcrument leader here should presant it to us,
mnd we coul(h proceed to discuss it just as
they do in the other place.
No matter 'how yýou look at it, w-e are
spending a tremendous amount of money. It
is ahl righit to say we are lending $250,000,000
to Euiropean counitries, and so forth, but the
cold bard fact is that that money bas to be
raised by 12,000,000 people. You may tell me
tbat the government cao sell bonds hcaring
two and haîf per cent intercat. Maybe so,
but in my .iudgment that is bad financing.
Money is not going into indiistry or buisiness
because people are afraid; many today are
ready to invest in bonds because they do not
know where cIsc to -puit thair meney. Unemphoyment is staring us in the face, and cbeap
money presents one of the probhems that is
challenging us.
This year we are spcnding $2,769,000,000. At
the present rate of our national incoma I do
not sec how, without a change in taxation, it
will bc possible to raise over $2,0W0,000,000 in
the coming fiscal year. That means that we
wihl have a deficit of at lcast $769ý,000,000.
Prier to, the w-ar the total expenditure of this
country was $600,000,0W0.
It is sbocking te
think that this year we will go behind mýore
than we spent in a w-holc year prier te the war.
I admit that we have te pay interest on our
debt, wvhicb now is close to $20,000,000ý,000. It
is also truc that wc are doing a great deal to
rc-establisb the members of our armed forces.
We also have other expenditures that we must
assume; we have not yet reached any
settlement witb the provinces. We onhy have
to observe w-bat British Columbia is doing to
realize the difficulties that lie in the way of

APRIL 2, 1946
settlement. That province wants the same
proportion of money as she would have got
had the old system of taxation remained in
effect. The rich provinces will want similar
treatment and the poor provinces will want a
more. favourable arrangement, and there will
be no settlement at aIl.
I have said before, and now repeat, I do
not believe the Minister of Finance knows
the challenge that is being thrown out in this
country today to his system of high taxation.
It is easy for him to say that he can raise
money by floating a loan this fall; but just
as sure as he does, he will be piling debt on us
for years to come.
Unemployment is rampant! Quite apart
from the boys who are going to colleges and
those who are receiving unemployment benefits that will soon die out, there are still
hundreds out of work.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Two hundred
and fifty-thousand of them.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No solution is offered to
help unemployed men and women today.
Only last night the Minister of Reconstruction surrendered, put up the white flag, and
said in effect, "I give up the housing business
and turn it over to the municipalities."
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He turned it over to the
municipalities. I was in the gallery of the
House of Commons and listened very carefully to the reading of the order-in-council.
I do not like this heavy budget. I thought
it could have been kept down to $2,000,000,000.
But apparently that is not to be done.
Obvuiously we are not going to have any reduction in taxes; in fact, it is my belief that
without increased taxation the budget will not
be balanced.
I am quite willing to vote two months
supply. That is all we can do. But I 'want
to say again for the benefit of the Minister of
Finance that I do not believe he is aware of
the feeling there is in Canada today against
the high expenditures of this government.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am very sure that unless
the budget can be balanced and taxes .reduced
we are riding into the storm. It is all right
to justify the lending of $2,250,000,000 to
Great Britain by saying that we are going to
sell her goods. Of course we can sell goods to
people as long as we lend them the money to
buy those goods. But some day we will reach
the end of the road, and will have so many
unemployed that we can né longer continue
to carry on under the present system.

75

In conclusion, I emphasize again that the
budget ought to have been kept within the
$2,000,000,000 mark. Perhaps I should repeat
what I said to the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)-that in order ,to
get industry and enterprise going in this
country, and to encourage people to go into
business, we should reduce taxes. Such a
policy would cause a deficit; but I did not
anticipate that without a reduction there
would still be $760,000,000 to be made up, and
I feel that we in this chamber ought to draw
thé government's attention to the seriousness
of the situation confronting us.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, for some time the estimates have been
available and we have had an opportunity
of going through them, so we all know why
such a large amount as 273 million dollars is
necessary to defray the expenses of the public
service at this time. A look at page 3 of
the estimates suffices to show that the sum
required for demobilization and reconversion,
as detailed on pages 65 to 78, is 1,515 million
dollars. So the budget appropriation for all
other purposes is only 1,253 million dollars.
This is a very substantial sum, it is true,
but in the light of all the circumstances
through which we have lived in the last six
years, I think ,the sum is small enough to
indicate a sincere desire on the part of the
government to follow the course that has
been ùrged by the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig), namely, to reduce expenditures as rapidly as possible.
The honourable leader opposite is taking
a fundamentally strong position in urging
that we should have full opportunity for
studying and discussing the financial aippropriations for the coming year instead of being
called upon to vote such a large sum of
money as this is in the very opening days
of the session. To give us that opportunity
it would be necessary either to open the session of parliament much earlier or to postpone the end of the fiscal year. If parliament
is to begin its work as late as it did this year,
then it would seem that the end of the fiscal
year should be postponed. There is no reason
why the fiscal year should not end as late
as the 31st of May, for example. If that
change were made we could meet in February
or March and have an opportunity to study
the budget properly without having recourse
to a provisional or interim supply bill such
as we now have before us. However, I think
we will all.admit that the practice of bringing
down an interim supply bill has been followed by governments of all political shades
ever since Confederation. Of course, it does
not follow that the practice is right. I agree

SENATE
with the honourable gentleman that we
should devise some method that would enable
us to study estimates thoroughly before being
called upon to pass an interim supply bill
for two months, because one of the fundamental functions of parliament is the careful
study of the budget and the estimates. We
are dealing with the people's money, and we
should not be asked to vote such a large sum
witbout our having an opportunity to serutinize the bill.
This bill contains one feature which is not
altogether common. Section 3 empowers the
Governor in Council to raise sums required
for redeeming maturing loans or obligations
I find no fault with this, except that I
should like to have attached to the bill a
statement of the loans that are to mature
before the 31st of March, 1947. At it is, we
are asked to give the government blank
authorization to borrow whatever sums may
be required for the payment of maturing
bonds, or the conversion of maturing bonds
which cannot be paid. I suggest that bills
of this kind should have attached a statement
indicating the maturities that are covered.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Does my bonourable friend mean a statement in addition
to the one given on page 3 of the estimates?
Hon. Mr. VIEN:
refers to?

Is that what the bill

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

I am not sure,

but I assume it is.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: If section 3 refers only
to the maturing debt as indicated on page 3
of the estimates, that is good enough for me;
but as I read it there is nothing in that section
which links it up with the estimates. Parliament should be given some detailed information, either by way of an explanatory
note or by a statement in the bill itself, as
to the maturities which the section is intended
to cover.
In view of the long parliamentary practice
of introducing interim supply bills, I am in
favour of the passage of this one. But in
support of what was said by the honourable
leader opposite, I would like to urge that
some *change be made in our parliamentary
practice so as to give us an opportunity for
thorough study and discussion of the estimates
before we are called upon to vote an interim
supply bill. Of course, we shall have the right
to go into all the details later on, but that
does not obviate the need for our careful
scrutiny of the estimates before we vote such
a large sum as is asked for here.
The motion was agreed te, and the bill
was read the second time.
Hon. Mr. VIEN.

THIRD READING

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 2
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House
of Commons with Bill 12, an act for granting
to His Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
the 31st March, 1946.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
bill be reaýd the second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With the leave
of the Senate, I move the second reading
now.
Honourable senators, this bill covers expenditures of $4,938,873.32 over and above those
granted by the Appropriation Act of last
session. The items are contained in the
further supplementary estimates, copies of
which are before honourable m-embers. I will
refer to the details briefly, and should any
honourable senator require further information on any item I will try to supply it
tomorrow.
These are the details: Department of
Finance, $365,000; Fisheries, $100,361; Justice, $5,000; Legislation, House of Commons,
general, $35,000; Mines and Resources, $163.009;
National Defence,
$800; National
Revenue, $65,000; Post Office, $1,234.720;
Public Printing and Stationery, $45,000; Public works, $549,000; Secretary of State, $1,490;
Trade and Commerce, $6,463.33; Transport,
$99,128.84; Veterans Affairs, $722,000.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Can the honourable
leader obtain for us information with respect
to the $100,361.34 for expenses under the
provisional fur seal agreement?
Canada's
share of the revenue under the agreement
bas for a number of years been very small.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will endeavour
to get the information.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: It was the subject of
discussion in the other bouse some years ago.
This item seems quite a large additional
appropriation.

APRIL 2, 1946.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators, in
this bill we have a schedule of the various
items, based on further supplemnentary eatimates. If you refer to the main estimates for,
say, item 648, "Agriculture, departmental
administration - further amount required,
$14,795," you will find full details; but no
such details are given ini the supplementary
estimates.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: They will be given
next year.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: But this bill covers supplementary estimates for the fiscal year ending
3lst of Mardi, 1946. These are expenditures
incurred over. and above the main estimates
of the fiscal year, and I would suggest that
when the government brings down the supplementary estimates it should furnish details,
as in the niAin estimates, so that we may be
aile to discuss the various items intelligently.
As I have already said, by reason of long
parliamentary practice, the estimates are
brought down in this way; but that does not
alter the fact that we are voting large
amounts without knowing the details of the
items in question.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. I shaîl endeavour
to seoure the informatiorn required by the
honourable gentleman.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.
MOTION FOR THIRD READING POSTPONED

The Hon. SPEAKER: When shall the bill
be read the third time?

Hon. Mr. ROBE RTSON: With permission
of lionourable senators, I will move third
reading tomorrow. I may say tha't if this bill
and Bill il are passed, they will receive the
.Royal Assent at 5.50 to>morrow afternoon.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

The Senate resumed from Thursday, Mardh
28, the consideration of Ris Excellency the
Governor-General's Speech at the opening of
the session and the motion of Hon. Mr.
Rurtubise for an Address in repiy thereto.
Hon. DONALD MacLENNAN: Honourable
senators, at the outset I wish to foilow the
usual rule and congratulate the mover (Hon.
Mr. Huirtubise) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Burchill) of the Address. I do this not because it is a custom but because I reaiiy think
they deserve to be congratulateci both upon
wbat tbey said and upon the way in whicb
-they said ît. And to ail the other bonourable
senators -who have taken part in this debate
îîuay I extend îny sincere congratulations upon
the excellence of their speeches, which in my
mini were not only interesting but informative.
I think that possibly senators, like wîne, împrove witb age.
I desire to say a few words on a matter that
is of considerable importance directly te the
Maritime provinces, and indirectly te the rest
of the dominion. I amn net going te bore you
by talking about confederation, nor do I
intenil te give utterance te the hackneyed
.zaying thuat the Fathers of Confederation built
better than tbey knew. On the contrary I
wiil say that in se far as the Maritime Provinces are concerneil I think they unintentionalv buîiilt a littie wvorse than they knew, and I
leave it at that. In the Maritime provinces,
particuîlarly in Nova Scotia, there is a notion
that the central provinces leg-islate for tbemselves andl for ail other provinces as well.
Il is said that tbey go on the principie cf
.. the gooh 01(1 rule . .. the simple plan,
Tha-t they should take. who have the power,
Andi they should keep wlîo can.
To dissipate tbat notion I bespeak the
s3 mpathy and support of honourable senators from ail sections cf the dominion when
I ask for a remcdy for a condition that
obtains in the strait of Canso. in Nova
Scotia. As everybody knows, the isianil of
Cape Breton is separated from the mainland
cf Nova Scotia by that strait. Passenger and
freight service across the strait, wbich is about
a mile wide. is furnislied by two buge scows
or ferries, the replacement cost of wbicb, I
arn told, wouid be about $4,000,000 eacb.
These are v ery cumbersome craf t, and in
winter whîen ice is in the strait it is nothing
unusual for them te ho detained on one
shore or in mid-streama for eiglit or ten
heurs. The railway cars are taken on board
flue ferries, but the locomotives are not; consequently, while the cars are being trans-

79

APRIL 2, 1946
ported in this way they are unheated.

I distjnctly remember that some years ago a lady
from. North Sydney, who was suffering from
tuberculosis and on her way to the sanatorium,
spent about eight hours in one of these cars
out in mid-stream.
The poor lady died
shortly afterwards, but I do nlot say this was
as a consequence of ber experience on the
ferry. I know that while she was there other
passengers shed their coats and wrapped them
around ber. Only this winter-and it was a
comparatively mild winter-one of the ferries
was taken down stream by the current and
ice for a distance of about four or five miles,
and was in imminent danger of being piled
upon the rocks around the coast of the Gulf
of St. Lawrence.
I venture to say, honourable senators, that
if the condition which obtains in the'strait
of Canso had obtained in either Quebec or
Ontario, let us say, a bridge or a causeway
would have been built fifty years ago. 1 feel
pretty sure about that. It is strange to me
that notwithstanding the very able men the
Maritime provinces have sent to parliamentpresent company always excepted-they have
not insisted'on having this condition remedied.
I cannot give an explanation of that. Down
in the Maritime provinces we know that in
a material way we cannot etompete with the
provinces of Quebec and Ontario, but we
always have felt that spiritually and intellectually we equal them, if we do not surPass them.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I have given a
slight indication of the ridiculous bottle-neck
that obtains at the strait. Two years ago a
mnan holding a pretty high office with the
Canadian National Railways told me that so
long as that condition existed it would prevent the establishment of any other industry.
in Cape Breton. His statement was borne
out by what happened in Inveýness c#rnnty
just a year or so ago. An American company
went down there and did some boring for oul.
After they bored some feet it appeared that
they needed heavier machinery; in any event
the manager or one of the men in charge said
that on account of the condition existing at
the strait of Canso they were net keen to
reach oil.
In testifying before the Reconstruction
Committee of the House of Commons last
session, Mr. Fairweather, Vice-President of
the Canadian National Railways, said, as
reported at page 401 of the committee's proceedings:
We distribute a payroll downo there that has
been estimated M, haîf a million dollars a year.
63268--7

Figures for costs other than wages were not
placed before the committee, but it may be
rcasonably assumed that replacements and
repairs of the boats, maintenance of the
docks and piers, materials and necessary supplies at the roundhouse machine shops, and
general servicing would bring the total expenditure to at least a million dollars a year.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will the honourable
gentleman pardon me? I o'nly vish to make
sure that I understand him. The annual payroll of haîf a million dollars is expended in
connection with the operation of the boats,
which are needed because there is no bridge
across the Strait?
Hon. Mr.- MacLENNAN:

Yes.

Mr. D. W. McLachlan, Chief Engineer of
Design and Construction for the federal
,Department of Transport, gave the committee an estimate of what it would cost to build
a causeway or a steel and concrete bridge. He
proved conclusively that the capital expenditure on even a bridge would cost less to
finance than the operation of the present ferry
system.
At page 391 he said:
For the ca.ugeway, $8,O00,000, -and for the lock
$4,000,OO0, 'but remember if yon hýuild a smalIler
iock it would cost less. There are many relasoos
which wold inditate it would -be uhlwise to
build -a big lock there. I think a 'small lýock,
one- adequa-te to take ca-re 'uf the hulk of the
bolats Wouid be sufficient. I *do flot think ;any
.big lock, will he called for there, but riather a
smali1 'onýe would be ýpreferable.
With this smaller but quite adequate lock,
therefore, the cost of the whole causeway by
Mr. McLachlan's showing would be less than
$9,500,000. The interest on that sum at 3 per
cent would be $2&5,000 a year as against the
$1,000,000 a year now spent on the Canso
ferry. Mark you, at that cost we would have
the bridge. Even after allowing another 2
per cent, or $190,000 for a sinking fund, the
total annual outlay would be only $475,000
-less than haîf the present annual cost of
the ferry. On the same page will be found
this further statement by Mr. MeLachlan:
I would say 'a bridge would eertainily cost
around $20,000,000 for 'a bridge like you have 'at
Qoebe. 'I do not think pou would have to build
a double4tack bridge, just the railway and two
narrow lance on either side of the bridge. That
would save 'a iitble on -the width of it.
This' is obviously an outside figure, but even
so a capital outlay of $20,000,000 at 3 per
cent would amount to only $600,000 as compared with the ferry operation costs of
approximately $1,000,000 a year. A sinking
fund provision of 2 per cent would mean
another $M0,000, or a total of $1,000,000 a

year for the bridge. This would be about
the equivalent of the annual cost of the ferry
that every transportation expert condemns.
At page 403 Mr. Fairweather was asked
this question:
You would say thait the developments being
asked for are quite advisable if the money
could be found?
Mr. Fairweather: Oh, yes.
In addition to this million dollars expended
by the federal government, the government
of Nova Scotia contributes an additional
860,000 a year. Transportation is very badly
needed in the wintertime, but there are weeks
when the car ferry cannot operate. Therefore I would ask some honourable members
to speak on behalf of the people of the Maritime provinces in support of the Causeway
Bill, for I fear there are not too many of
us to impress upon the people of Canada the
necessity for this bridge. There would not
be very much difference between the cost of
the proposed bridge and that of bridges built
The Maritime provin other provinces.
inces are asking for only one bridge of this
kind, and I really think the government or
the powers that be should be urged to build
it at the earliest possible opportunity.
While a member of the local legislature
I used to get letters complaining about the
neglect to repair little highway bridges here
and there, and I recall that the writers
invariably wound up their letters with these
words, "The condition of this little bridge is
a disgrace." Evidently they thought the
stronger the language they used the sooner
would their complaint be attended to. But,
honestly, I submit that this long-standing
lack of adequate transportation is a national
disgrace.
Honourable
Hon, FELIX P. QUINN:
senators, I should like to endorse everything
that the honourable member from Margaree
Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan) bas advanced
in favour of the building of a bridge across
the strait of Canso. For many years this
project bas been advocated by members from
the Maritime provinces and by the provincial
press, and it lias been and is still looked upon
as a necessity for the advancement of transportation, particularly with regard to the
island of Cape Breton.
The honourable gentleman bas told of the
cost of operating the present unsatisfactory
ferry-unsatisfactory, only, may I be permitted to say, as to irregularity of service in
the wintertime because of ice conditions in
the strait. In view of the fact, as he bas
stated, tiat this causeway or bridge could
be built at a capital expenditure, the finanHon. Mr. MacLENNAN.

cing of which would cost less than the operation of the present inadequate ferry, I cannot
understand why the Canadian National Railways or the government, or whoever is
responsible, does not take action, unless they
prefer to ignore the people of the Maritimes.
I hope that is not so; but since similar
arguments in favour of the bridge have been
advanced so many times by public men in
the Maritime provinces, I cannot see why
the government or the railway system should
hesitate to proceed with the building of this
bridge.
Hon. Mir. EULER:
ferry now?

Who is operating the

Hon. Mr. QUINN: The Canadian National
Railways. It is a railway ferry.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
before the debate closes I wish to avail myself of the opportunity to make a few remarks,
since this is an occasion when a member cân
talk on m!any subjects of interest to various
parts of Canada. At the outset I would congratulate the mover and the seconder of
the Address on their excellent speeches.
Honourable members may recall some remarks I made last session in connection with
the price of hogs. I advocated that the price
be raised. That was in December, when there
was time to take action. Now I understand
that at last the price has been increased too
little and too late. Everyone engaged in
farming in Canada is well aware that about
95 per cent of the hogs produced are what
we call spring litters. It takes an expert
with proper equipment to raise winter hogs.
So if we desired to increase our bacon supply,
last December was the pýroper time to raise
the price. I did say something then about
the men who in a general way were finding
the excess profits tax running them into
debt. A great m.any hogs are raised by men
who pay no income tax at all. But the
price at that time was not sufficient to encourage them. to continue in the liog business,
nor is it sufficient today, and we are losing
net only millions of dollars but also, probably, a future market for our bacon.
I do not take any pleasure in criticizing
the government, but I firmly believe that in
a democracy the only protection the man in
the street bas, and the only thing that really
makes cour political system work successfully,
is criticisn by the opposition. That is the
only hope for the ordinary man. I enjoy my
associations with honourable members on both
sides of the house, and while I wish to be as
pleasant as possible, I think I have a duty
to perform in representing the people of
Canada who cannot be here themselves.

APRIL 2, 1946
The Minister of Agriculture, who comes from
my province, profeses a great knowledge of
farming in general, and of hog-raising in particular. But looking back over the years of
his public life I do not know of a time when
he was forced to live on the proceeds from bis
agricultural pursuits. I must admit that he
was right on the question of summerfallowing; in fact, I will say tha-t he has been
right about one--third or one-half of the timelet us say forty per cent.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is a pretty good
record.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The great fault I sec
in him is that he is just as stubborn when lie
is wrong as when lie is right. For instance,
he was entirely wrong as to the handling of
bacon prices, and also in solving the butter
problem.
There is an interesting story in this evening's paper of the long trek of my honourable
friend from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) through Ontario in search of a
pound of butter. I can tell honourable
senators why Canada is short of butter today.
I do not know that this government is to
blame for it, but through the years Canada
has never had a large surplus of butter, and
the amall percentage that was produced for
export controlled, the price. In most years
the people who made the butter never received
enough for it. One reason for our difficulty
today is the bonus system which provides
number one butter to the consumer at 32
cents a pound. The man who ordinarily would
raise young cattle and go into the dairy business says, "If the government is going to let
the price fall back to 32 cents I am not going
to make butter for that." So the young dairy
cows go to market. The government should
say that butter will never sell in Canada under
present conditions at less than 50 cents a
pound.
Hon. Mr. HAI: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Perhaps I have been
particularly fortunate in- having a wife and a
mother who could make good butter.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable senator
might distribute a little of it to the rest of the
members.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I will be glad to bring
some down here. What a speotacle ilt is that
Canada, with all its produce should be without butter. and what a disgrace that we must
sit down to a meal in the parliamentary
restaurant without butter.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

81

Hon. Mr. HORNER: It is a situation that
every public man should take note of. For
my part, I would not graduate a student,
boy or girl, from our universities or colleges
unless lie or she could milk a cow.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Every university
should have a farm in connection with it, so
it would not be necessary to run down the
street for butter. I think a bill has been
presented here concerning margarine.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Order!
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Anyway, this is the
way to prepare fried potatoes.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Take good western
potatoes and float them in a pan with half
a pound of butter-or maybe a pound.
Hon. Mr. COPP: You must have lots of it.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Then you take a
slice of whole-wheat bread, baked in a clay
oven, and put it with the potatoes fried in
butter. When I get up in the morning I
like to prepare my own breakfast. I put in
the pan about an eighth of a pound of butter
and three eggs.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: If anyone tells you
that any type of pork fat or grease is equal
to good butter, do not believe him. Gentlemen, it is a national disgrace that we should
find ourselves with such food problems today.
Let me quote my famous text-perhaps I
should have it copyrighted-"This is a land
flowing with milk and honey; let us go out
and possess it." We are told that there is
nothing new, so I imagine that in biblical
times there were a great many communists
and other people who wanted to work only
six or eight hours a day. Probably they
would not milk the cows or attend to the
bees. So we have the parable of the men
who were sent up to view the new land and
who came back to report that it was a land
flowing with milk and honey, and that al] the
men were giants. There were no giants, but
the people were too lazy to milk the cows
and attend the bees, and everybody wanted
an eight-hour day. I believe that old parable
has a practical application today. It is a
national calamity that we in this country do
not enjoy an abundance of good food. I
blame the Minister of Agriculture for many
of our difficulties. During the last session of
parliament I raised the question of farmers
killing their own pigs. Every honourable
senator who has raised any hogs knows that

;2

-SENATE

sometimes it is impossible to get them in
condition to bring the best price. The packer
may cut you as much as $8 on a hog because
of over-weight; but the meat is just as good
as if it had been killed at five months. No
one has ever heard of a packer selling pork
cheap; but he docks the farmer.
The farmers around Saskatoon were going to
be arrested for killing their own meat. I wonder why Saskatoon was chosen, because you
can go out to the first concession from Kingsmere, at the end of the Ottawa glorification
schemeSome Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. HORNER: -the Ottawa beautification scheme, or anywhere else between
Prince Edward Island -and Victoria, and find
95 per cent of the farmers killing their own
meat. My only suggestion to the remaining
5 per cent is that they get off the farm,
because they will be off it sooner or later.
There was one man who tried to make the
farmer account for every pig he killed. But
now he is dead, and I hope his friend Eva is
also gone.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh.

Hon. M.r. HORNER: It is because of regulations that we are in difficulties with our
farm produce. The farmer is expected to get
up at 5 o'clock in the morning, milk his cows
and feed bis hogs, and yet go without butter
May I quote another biblical
and meat.
passage to prove my point. "Thou shalt not
muzzle the ox when he treadebh out the corn."
It is not possible to muzzle the mouth of the
man who produces the food.
During this past winter I had a trip up the
P.G.E. Railway to Squamish. It is a remarkable railway, and has the cleanest trains I
have ever travelled on in Canada. The coaches
are old and quaint; the dining cars are a foot
wider than the ordinary railway cars, but the
sleepers are narrower. They are all painted
red like a circus train. The upper berths have
windows, so that one can lie in his berth and
look out at the countryside. The trains are
on time at every station; they make 15 miles
an hour in spite of many stops.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: They should be on time.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: It is a very beautiful
country, and the people are interested in
'having the road extended.
I also visited the Abitibi lumber camp and
had my first experience of watching German
prisoners of war at work. As a matter of
fact, they were driving some of my horses.
I do not know what the government proposes
to do about returning these men to Germany,
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

but many of them are anxious to stay in
Canada. I should like to place myself on
record as being strongly in favour of allowing
them to remain here. Many of them would
make first-class Canadian citizens. I said to
the superintendent of the Abitibi company,
"If these men return to Germany this summer
you will miss them." He replied, "We certainly will. A lot of them have become very
useful." One of the prisoners was a former
banker, and be is now taking full charge of
a huge warehouse. Another man is in charge
of the yard. They are a fine type of men.
and I think it would be to the benefit of
Canada to permit some of them te stay here.
Before the
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
honourable senator resumes his seat, I should
like to bear what be thinks about the government's advance of four cents on creamery
butter, but no increase on dairy butter.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I am very glad the
honourable senator has raised that point. Of
course I do not approve of such discrimination. Dairy butter is so much better than
creamery butter that the premium should
go the other way. There is a lot of butter
made in the home because it is not always
possible for people to take their cream to
creameries. The farmer who sells his cream
gets 80 per cent of the value of the butter,
but be oses the buttermilk. Any honourable
senator who bas tasted good home-made
buttermilk will appreciate this loss. Under
the bonus system there are some people who
ship their cream, get a bonus and then buy the
butter back. At my bouse I said: "We are
making our own butter and we will have our
buttermilk." To have a lower price for dairy
butter than for creamery butter is a discrimination against people who are not near
a ready market. They may be living in a
district where it is not possible to get to a
creamery.
At the market in Winnipeg recently I was
talking to a commission man who was explaining why I could not get more for my cattle.
He said: "You know the packers bought all
kinds of good steers for six and seven cents."
I replied: "I don't see why they would do
that; it would put them in a high-income tax
bracket. But I suppose they have to contribute to party funds, and that costs a lot of
money." He said that one packing house was

Han. W. D. EULER moved the second readinýg of Bill G, an Act ta amend the Dairy

He said: Honaurable senatars, in, rising ta
ask for the second reading of this bill, which
proposes to repeal th-at. section ofthe Dairy
Inihistry Act prohibiting the manufacture, sale
and importation of oleomnargarine and ather
proditcts af the kind, I realize that I shall
probably revive a controversy that agitated
the b-luse of Commons almost a generation
ago. In the sessions of 1922 and 1923 the
discussions that followed upon the submission
of certain resolutions in that chamber were,
I might say, rather warm and at times almost
bitter, bath propanients of and opponents ta
the resalutions holding strong opinions with
regard ta themn. At that time I was a member
of the Commans and participated in the
debates of those twa sessions. I feit strongly
that the prohibition of the sale of aieamargarine was entirely wrang in principle;
that in a general way and quite apart fro'm
any other consideration, it was wrong that a
Canadian citizený should nat have a free choice
as ta whether hie would buy butter or aieamargarine. The vote taken in the other
chamnber in 1922 was favourable to, aieamargarine, but that situation was reversed
at the next session. As a matter of fact,
prior ta 1918, it had been ilegal ta manufacture, import or sellF aleomargarine; but
with the coming of the war and the scarcity
and high price of butter, the production of

S4

SENATE

oleomargarine was made legal from vear to
year and by virtue of the suspension of a
clause in the act continued to be legai until
1923.
A moment ago I said that te me it seemed
wrong that a Canadian citizen sbould flot
have frcedom of choice as between butter and
oleomargarine. and in a sense that will be the
hurden ef the observations 1 arn going to
mnake this afternoon. I was reminded today
of a parallel situation. We ail remember that
a year or se before the late war a certain
emineot Nazi teid the German people they
biad ne choice as between paying for guns
or for butter. It was te be glîns. and guns
it was. The Canadian peeple aise have been

There is not another civilized country in
the world today that does not permit the use
of oleomargarine. Canada is the only exception. Dr. Tolmie goes on:
We have also had the argument put forward
that if the manufacture of oleomargarine is
once made permanent in this country, oleomargarine will greatly increase in quantity.
I think that is the main contention today
by those who oppose the use of oleomargarine; they are afraid that later on, even if
not now, it may seriously compete with butter. That contention was combated by Dr.
Tolmie. He said:
I think that argument is net borne out by our
experience since 1918 when it was first introduced. We find that we have had free access te
the American market, and net only the ingredients which are made up into oleomargarine in
this country, but the manufactured article eau
be imported from the United States absolutely
free of duty. Se, if there liad been a greater
demand in this country for oleomargarine, we
would have had it entering Canada in very much
greater quantities. The truth is that since
1918, when oleomargarine was first introduced
into Canada, there has been a steady falling off
in the quantity consumed in this .country; but
it has been very clearly shown that when butter
gets cheaper in price, the consumption of oleomargarine lessens te a very considerable extent.
Then lie gives some figures which I will not
quote here.
In the meantime creamery butter has shown
a steady increase, and only last year it increased something over 15,000,000 pounds.
That was during the period when oleomargarine was being made and sold in
Canada.
At the present time the consumption of oleomargarine amounts te only about 2 per cent for
the spreads used for bread in this country.
That is, 98 per cent of the spreads consista of
dairy products as compared with 2 per cent of
oleomargarine. This shows that the situation
is net at all a dangerous one. The dairyman
of this country, therefore, might very well look
at this question in a broad, liberal way.
Liberal is spelt with a small- "l'. I am
dwelling on this particularly because the only
argument that I think will be advanced will
not be with regard te the wholesomeness of
oleomargarine. This is no longer questioned.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:

What about the price?

Hon. Mr. EULER: I will ome to that a
Here is another extract from
little later.
Mr. Tolmie's speech:
Let us glance for a moment at the question
as te how oleomargarine has affected other
countries where dairying has been carried on te
any great extent.
That is, countries that produced both butter
and oleomargarine.
These figures are exceedingly interesting. In
1880 Denmark, one of the greatest dairy coun-

85

tries in the world, exported 27,057,726 pounds
of butter. In 1882, the first co-operative creamery was introduced into Denmark, and in the
same year oleomargarine factories were established in that country: and the increase in the
manufacture of oleomargarine has steadily continued at a rapid rate. Now, judging by the
argument advanced by those people in Canada
who are opposed to the manufacture and consumption of oleomargarine in this country, we
ought naturally to expect that Denmark's dairy
industry would be absolutely ruined by this time
through the influence of the manufacture of
oleomargarine in that country. Well, let us
look into that question just for one moment.
Denmark in 1921 had increased lier exports of
butter to 19,584,863 pounds, or nearly 800 per
cent. That is an indication of the way in which
oleomargarine has "ruined" that country. On
the other hand, Canada in 1880,This is the corresponding year.
-exported 18,535,362 pounds of butter, while in
1921 the same country, carefully protected
against oleomargarine up to 1918, not a pound
of that substitute having been sold here up to
that time, had suffered a reduction in its exports of butter which then amounted to just
9,739,414 pounds, or a reduction of nearly 47
per cent.
That is, Denmark a country in which both
commodities were being manufactured increased its exports of butter 800 per cent;
while Canada, in which there was no so-called
competition from oleomargarine, because its
manufacture and sale was not being permitted
here, lost nearly 47 per cent of her butter
export. Mr. Tolmie continued:
Did oleomargarine interfere with prices in
Denmark? We shall see. In 1880,These are old figures, but I think they are
valiable.
In 1880 the average price for Danish butter
was 24-12 cents per pound and in 1921 it had
risen to 57-25 cents.

. . . Denmark has a popu-

lation of only 3,000,000-against Canada's
9,000,000.
Of course, those figures are not correct now.
Canada can grow the finest foods for dairy
cattle of any country in the world, and our
people should be able te produce, on that
account, cheaper dairy products than any other
country. But the figures I have quoted show
that while Denmark increased lier dairy exports nearly 800 per cent, ours declined 47 per
cent. If Denmark has been ruined by oleomargarine, then for goodness' sake let uà be
ruined in the same way.
Another reason, or a contributing factor at
least, for the scarcity of butter is that while
we produced more milk last year than we
did four or five years ago, we made less
butter. The explanation is that the farmers'
view is that it is to their advantage to sell
the milk. Perhaps more fluid milk is consumed, and probably the farmers are going
into the manufacture of cheese and other
products. Mr. Tolmie goes on to say:
I think we should encourage our dairymen in
every posýible way, and if I for one moment

SENATE
thought that this oleomargarine manufactured
in Canada would interfere with the dairy industry-last year there was the miserably small
quantity of less than 4,000,000 pounds of oleomargarine manufactured compared with 240,000,000 pounds of butter-I would certainly
oppose its continued manufacture.
Dealing with tlhe safeguards and protection
of the dairyman, be has this to say:
To indicate how carefully the dairyman is protected in this country with regard to the manufacture of oleomargarine, I will quote the regulations. I do not say that this protection is
ample, and I have already intimated that there
may be further restrictions we can apply so
as to prevent the sale of oleomargarine for
anything otlier than wat it actually is. Before
oleomargarine can either be manufactured or
imported the dealer or manufacturer must have
a licence from the Minister of Agriculture. The
minister may cancel this licence at any time for
cause. All packages must be clearly marked
"Oleomargarine."
I have a package here on
which will be noticed the word "Oleomargarine"
is clearly marked. We also have the word
"Oleo" stamped directly into the material itself
in letters one and a half inches high. Oleomargarine must be maufactured in an inspected
establishment and, as I pointed out, the inspeetors are highly qualified men who in addition
to being skilled veterinarians have also passed
a further examination before being taken into
the employ of the Departnient of Agriculture.
The sanitary arrangements must be first-class in
every respect. The manufacture of oleomargarine in butter establishments is strictly prohibited. All materials must be inspected and
analyzed if thought necessary. Oleo oil and
neutral lards used for this purpose must be
from inspected establishments. Importations of
any of these materials must be accompanied by
certificates from recognized authorities in the
country fromn which they come.
I quote at length to show that in Mr.
Tolmie's opinion butter was well-protected
from any danger that might come through
the sale of oleomargarine. The speaker is
then interrupted by Mr. Carroll who was the
mover of the resolution under discussion, and
who said:
Is the honourable gentleman himself engaged
n dairying?
Mr. Tolmie replied:
Oh, yes, I am engaged in the dairy business,
and I also have two pure-bred herds of very
valuable dairy cattle. My principal customers
are dairymen. However, I feel that when I
come down here as the representative of Victoria
City I would not be justified in allowing my
private interests to interfere with my public
duty.
In his concluding remarks Mr. Tolmie said:
At the last session of the Alberta legislature
a resolution was brought up to wipe out oleomargarine, that is, to recommend that the manufacture, sale and importation of oleomargarine
in this country be made to cease. This resolution was put to a vote and that farmers' legislature voted it down by a majoriey of 30 to 12.
I want to congratulate those farmers on the
broad-minded view they took of the situation.
Hon. Mr. EULER.

Honourable senators, I come now to my
final quotation from Mr. Tolmi's remarks.
He said:
I know it would do me more good to take
the other side of the question, as I said before
in reply to an inquiry by an bon. member-to
take the side of the dairyman. But I do not
feel justified in doing so; I feel that this House
bas no right to tell the people of Canada that
they have not the same intelligence as the people
of other countries and that they cannot be
allowed to buy oleomargarine if they wish to
do su. The whole thing hinges on that one
point; in my opinion we have to leave a little
to the people.
This next reference I do not quite understand. He continues:
We told them a while ago what they should
do with their money when they went to a
certain place of entertainment; now we are
going to tell them what to put in their mouths,
and in doing so I think we are going a little
too far. Last year the hon. Minister of Agriculture (Mr. Motherwell) expressed great astonishment at my stand in this connection. I studied
this question very thoroughly, both when Minister of Agriculture-when I was able to get
information more easilv than now-and subsequently; I have examined it carefully froum al]
points of view. and I have come to the conclusion that the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine in this country is not hurtful to our
dairy industry at the present timse and will inot
hurt it in the future.
May I read an extract from the speech
of Hon. Mr. Fielding, where he says:
No, the real question is not as between oleomargarine and butter. The people who want
oleomargarine only want it when they cannot
get butter at a reasonable price. If they cannot
afford to use butter they will use oleomargarine;
they want a substitute which is wholesome. Do
not let anybody be deluded by the cry that oleomargarine is not wholesome.
The highest
medical authorities tell us that it is wholesome.
I cannot for the life of me see why the intelligent Canadian people cannot be trusted to decide for themselves what they want. If we are
as intelligent as any other people in the world
give us the right to exercise our intelligence.
The only real objection that is left is that
oleomargarine might compete with butter to
the detriment of butter.. I believe Dr. Tolmie
has very well met that objection. I can
understand the demand for protection against
foreign commodities, but the matter of protection against other countries is pretty much
a dead issue today. Yet the question can again
be revived, as I expect it will be some day,
and I can understand the people believing
they should be protected against a foreign
country. But I cannot see any justice in
trying to protect one industry within the
country against another in the same country.
If we ever try to adopt that principle we will
get into the most absurd situations.
For instance, in my own town, there are
said to be the largest tanneries of leather in

APRIL 3, 1946
the British Empire. Some years ago an
enterprising chap started the manufacture of
what he called "leatherette." It was a good
product and served a purpose, but it was not
as good as leather. Yet I have never heard
of the tanneries in my city or anywhere else
in Canada trying to stop the manufacture
of "leatherette" because it was ,interfering
with their business. Nor does one hear of
the builders with wood and stone attempting
to stop the manufacture of concrete blocks.
I should like to see the man who, when the
ladies cannot get silk or wool, would attempt
to stop the manufacture of nylon stockings
because they were interfering with his
business.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My advocacy of the
manufacture of oleomargarine is concentrated
on three points. May I briefly review them
again.
In the first place, no government or parliament-and they are not always the samehas the moral right to interfere with the
inherent right of the individual to buy any
legitimate article of commerce. That seems to
me to be a fundamental right of a democratic people.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: The
senator means in peacetime.

honourable

Hon. Mr. EULER: The war is over.
Some people seem to think that if the law
were amended to permit the manufacture and
importation of oleomargarine, everybody would
have to buy it. Needless to say, that would
not be so. Every person would be free to
buy butter to his heart's content, if he had the
price and if he could 'get the butter. My
second point is that no government should
interfere to prevent any citizen from purchasing a less expensive but satisfactory article
when he cannot afford to buy a more costly
and better article. That seems to me so fundamental as to require no argument, and in any
event the point was well made in the portion of
Dr. Tolmie's speech that I read. In the third
place, we have not enough butter. Then, why
should we prevent people from buying a
wholesome substitute?
In this debate it will probably be contended
that if we legalize oleomargarine now, when
there is a temporary need for it, later on it
may injure the dairyman of this country.
That argument reminds me of an incident
that occurred when I was the head of the
Department of National Revenue. While in
British Columbia, in the course of a trip of
inspection through western Canada, a deputation of fruit growers came to see me to ask
that an embargo be placed upon the importa63268-8

87

tion of strawberries from the United States.
It was then the off season in Canada, and I
said to them: "I could understand a request
for a bar on the importation of American
berries when our own are on the market, but
since ours are not ready for the market, why
deprive the people of the opportunity to buy
imported ones?" What do you suppose their
reply was? They said: "If you allow American
strawberries to come in now the appetites of
the people will be jaded by the time our
berries come on the market, and we will not
be able to make any sales." Well, to me that
seemed to be protection gone mad.
May I read extracts from a few newspaper
clippings that I have here. One, under the
heading "Butter shortage prospect for April,"
quotes the National Dairy Council of Canada
as having said:
That butter supplies now were so short in
Canada that stocks would be "almost nonexistent" by the end of March.
On Monday I read in one paper that our
butter reserve- is now less than two pounds
per capita.
Another clipping, headed "Butter stocks
fading iù 9 principal cities," says:
Seriousness of Canada's butter situation was
reflected in figures released by the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics, showing holdings of
creamery butter in nine principal cities. on
April 1 as 1,894,659 pounds compared with 5,569,156 the previous month. Stocks totalled 6,280,256 pounds on April 1, 1945.
In view of these facts-I suppose they are
facts-I cannot understand what ground there
was for the recent announcement that the
butter ration would shortly be increased.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Would the honourable
senator permit a question?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Certainly.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: When I first heard of
this bill I thought it was intended as a temporary measure to take care of the present
shortage of butter, but from what the honourable senator has said so far I am afraid that
I was wrong and that the intention is to have
a permanent amendment to the act. Is that
correct?
Hon. Mr. EULER: So far as I am concerned, yes. On principle I do not think there
ever should be any prohibition of the manufacture of oleomargarine. Some people may
be willing to have the temporary measure;
that would be better than nothing; but for
my part I should like to see the manufacture
of oleomargarine made permanently legal.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me a question? He has

EvIsD EDITION

SS

SENATE

stated that a montii ago the creamery butter
in stock amounted te something more than
five million pounds, but that now it is down
to only about one and a half million pounds.
My observation is that very little butter has
been consumed in Canada lately, particularly
here in Ottawa, and also in Halifax, where
my home is. My wife tells me that during
the whole month of March she was able to
buy only one pound. Can the honourable
gentleman tell us where that stock of five
million pounds has gone?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I cannot answer that
question.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: To the West Indies.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not know what
quantity was shipped to the West Indies. The
last paragraph of the newspaper article quoting National Dairy Council of Canada says:
The only hope of enough butter to honour
April (ration) coupons at the reduced rate lies
in the weather. The early spring mav help.
Honourable senators may take what satisfaction they can from that.
I contend that the absence of butter or of
a good substitute for it is detrimental to
every person. Surely there is net the same
enjoyment, to say nothing at all of nutrition, in a meal without butter, oleomargarine
or something of the kind. For some months
the larger hotels of this country have had
butterless days, and so perhaps the smaller
ones, unless some of them patronized the
black market. And lately, even when butter
has been available, you have been served a.
sliver so small that it was just an insult to
your appetite.
Recently I spent about a month in the
United States, and I noticed that on the
menus of some of the hotels over there a
notice to this effect:
In the absence of butter we may be obliged to
serve oleomargarine.
My honourable friend to my right (Hon. Mr.
Hardy) was with me. We felt quite certain
that we sometimes must have eaten oleomargarine, but we never knew when it was. The
product is palatable, and the best authorities
say it is about as nourishing as butter itself.
Nevertheless, I believe that the people of
Canada still have a bit of a prejudice against
oleomargarine, if only because of the nameI myself will admit to having a little prejudice-and I am convinced that if butter is
available at a price that is not too high, our
people prefer it to any substitute.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Would you give
oleomargarine another name?
Hon. Mr. QUINN.

Hon. Mr. EULER: You might give it
another name. "A rose by any other name
would smell as sweet." An honourable mentber of this chamber who was in one of the
services overseas, told me that our soldiers
in England had been complaining about the
quality of the butter served to them. Then
without anything having been said about it,
oleomargarine was substituted, and all the
complaints promptly ceased.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Before. the honourable gentleman sits down, I should like to
ask him a queston. Has he any idea what
the price of oleomargarine would be if it
were manufactured and sold in Canada?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am not an authority
on that, but I would expect the price to be
15 or 20 cents a pound less than good butter.
After I introduced this bill in the Senate
I received a good many letters and telegrams,
all favouring the manufacture and importation of olceomargarine.
When the bill was
introduced the National Dairy Council of
Canada was in session in Ottawa, and next
morning a deputation from that body came to
meet me to protest against the bill. With that
one exception, I have had nothing but expressions of approval of the bill. With permission of the house I will read a telegram that
came froin St. Catharines addressed to me:
Heartily endorse proposed bill to legalize
sale of oleomargarine in Canada. Sponsored

urging Government

action in best interest of Canadian people. Good
luck.
Alderman W. R. Bald.
Here is a letter from St. Thomas:
I wish to at this time take this opportunity
to voice my personal appreciation to you with
regard to your effort to re-introduce the sale of
margarine in Canada. I have wondered for
some time during this butter shortage why this
product has not been made available to us as
it is to the people of the United States. The
dairy interests are evidently against it, but I
do not believe if it were made available to the
consumer even in normal times it would greatly
affect the sale of butter.
Wishing you

success in this endeavour

and

adding my thank you . . .
One letter is from a former member of parliament, who in 1922 was opposed to oleomargarine. He says the situation has changed
and he is in favour of the bill.
And the last one which perhaps impressed
me as much as any; it comes from Port
Stanley and is written in lead pencil in these
words:
Here's hoping you get the ban on margarine
lifted. I live alone and am tired of eating bread
without butter as half a pound don't last me
two weeks.
To sum up, it is my opinion that in a free
country there should be no interference with

APRIL 3, 1946
the individual citizen in his choice of what
he desires to buy with his own money. My
honourable friend from Quebec has interjected "except perhaps in wartime". I am
quite willing to agree with him on that point.
But the war is over, and we cannot say now,
"Don't you know there is a war on?"
Second, the man who cannot afford to buy
an expensive article should not be denied the
right to buy a less costly substitute.
Third, when the superior article can be
purchased only in inadequate quantities, or
not at all, the people should not be prevented from buying a good substitute.
In conclusion, I should like to suggest to
the honourable leader of the government that
this bill, if given second reading, should be
referred, not to any standing committee but
to Committee of the Whole, where it can
be more fully discussed and intelligently considered than in any other committee.
I have pleasure, honourable senators, in
moving the second reading of this bill.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators I take the earliest
opportunity to speak on this bill in order that
I may clear up any misapprehension as to
the government's attitude with respect to it.
So far as I am aware, the manufacture and
importation of oleomargarine were first prohibited by legislation passed in 1903, and
only became legal on December 1, 1917. This
state of affairs continued until August 31,
1923, when manufacture and importation were
again prohibited by the government under the
leadership of the present Prime Minister. On
February 29, 1924, sale also was prohibited.
Since that time the government has not, to
my knowledge, considered taking any further
action, and in no way is it directly or
indirectly concerned with this bill, which is
introduced. by a private member acting in
that capacity.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Surely.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The Prime Minister, speaking to a delegation from the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, stated that
the subject never had been discussed by the
government, and that the introduction of this
bill in the Senate had nothing to do with
government policy.
I do not think I need to deal with this as
a matter of normal peacetime policy, but I
believe it is relevant to point out that even if
the present prohibition were suspended it is
not likely that any appreciable amount of
oleomargarine would become available in the
immediate future. Various countries have for
some time been trying to assure as far as
63268-8

89

possible an equitable distribution of food
supplies. Canada, perhaps to a greater extent
than any other country, has secured her share
of edible fats in the form of butter.
I think honourable senators will be interested in the figures I am about to give. The
civilian- per capita consumption of butter in
Canada during 1945 was 27.6 pounds; in the
United States, 10-6 pounds; in the United
Kingdom, 7-6 pounds. As to oleomargarine,
during the same year Canada's per capita consumption was nil; that of the United States,
4-2 pounds; and that of the Unite4 Kingdom,
16-7 pounds. With respect to the per capita
consumption of lard and shortening in 1945, the
figures were, Canada, 14 pounds; the United
States, 27 pounds, and the United Kingdom,
15 pounds. The total per capita consumption
figures for these three categories of edible
fats and oils for 1945 were: Canada, 36-5;
United States, 38-9; United Kingdom, 35-6.
In other words, the average consumption of
edible fats and oils from one source or
another is to all intents and purposes the
same.
I am informed that oleomargarine is now
made of oils extracted from coco-nut, cottonseed, soya bean, peanut, sunflower and the
w'hale, the chief source of supply being outside of Canada. I am advised by the Oils
and Fats Administrator of the Wartime Prices
and Trade Board that the world's supply of
oil is only 60 per cent of screened requirements. Previous to the outbreak of war
Europe produced approximately 50 per cent
of its edible oil, but at present production
is nil, and every effort is being made to try
to meet at least a portion of the amount
required in these items. It is the opinion of
the administrator that for the next two years
Canada's chance of obtaining an increased
supply of edible oils is practically nil, and
that even if we did get a supply it would be
at the expense of some other consumers.
It seems to me that this bill, if passed, would
provoke a considerable controversy and might
have a detrimental effect on our 'butter production, a situation which from a:Il points of
view would be most undesirable. At the same
time, it would not be likely to bring about any
marked increase of edible fats.
I cannot see that any useful purpose would
be served at the present time by passing such
a measure; therefore it is my intention to vote
against the bill.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Do Iunderstand
that the honourable leader has statistical information to prove that, shouId this bill pass,
Canada could not import oleomargarine?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MeRAE: In any appreciable
quantity.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I did not say so.
The information I have indicates that the
amount of food available for various countries
is the subject of negotiation between their
respective governments, which are endeavouring to maintain a reasonably balanced distribution. Canada secures a much larger share
of her fats from butter than do the United
States and the United Kingdom. Should
either the ingredients of margarine or margarine
itself be imported and added to our existing
supply of fats, to that extent the result would
be detritnental to some other country. I did
not say ,that importation would be prohibited;
I have no such authority.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I understood
the honourable leader perfectly in regard to
fats pertaining to Canada. But if this bill
were passed and a sizable order were placed in
the United States, has my honourable friend
any reason to say we would not get the oleomargarine ?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not in a
position to say that the United States would
either permit or prohibit export.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If this bill passes it will
simply repeal the prohibition on the importation and manufacture of oleomargarine. If
there is no supply available the enactment of
this measure wilýl do no harm. I am, informed,
however, that in the United States you can get
all the oleomargarine you want to consume.
Hon. Mr. COPP: If you are there.

Hon. JOHN ALEXANDER McDONALD:
Honourable senators, since the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) is
much my senior in public affairs as well as
in membership of this chamber, it is with some
diffidence that I rise to oppose this bill, which
would legalize the sale of oleomargarine made
from oleo and other animal fats. But should
I do otherwise, I woulrd be shirking my
responsibility.
The great dairy industry of this country his
been built up over many years at a cost of
millions of dollars. Besides, from the information supplied, by the honourable leader
of the government it does not appear that very
much in the way of fats and oil will be available for the making of oleomargarine for
some time to come. Further, if this bill were
to pass it would go on our statute books and
be a threat to the dairy industry of Canada.
I feel very keenly that this is a time when
we should lend as much encouragement as
possible to all branches of farming in this
country.
In a recent speech before this
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE.

honourable house I pointed out that prior to
the late war our primary producers were in a
very unfortunate position so far as prices were
I mentioned that the farmers
concerned.
and dairymen were called upon to sell their
butter-fat for as little as 22 to 24 cents a
pound. Today butter-fat is being, marketed
at 44 cents a pound, from which one can
readily see that previous to the war it was
being sold well below cost.
We are hoping to encourage more men and
women to leave our overcrowded cities and
towns and, return to the land; but this bill,
if passed, will tend to discourage such a
movement. They are afraid that if they go
back to the farms they will find themselves
in circumstances similar to those that existed
before the war.
We have heard a good deal during recent
months about the consumption of butterfats. In order to get a true picture of the situation I telephoned the Co-ordinator of, the
Foods Administration Branch of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board and asked him if he
would give me the latest information on the
subject of butter.

What he bas to say is this:

You will observe that production bas been
running about 2,000.000 pounds a month below
normal. This has been a somiewhbat unexpected
development because up until the end of September, 1945, production had been running equal
to or ahead of production for the comparable
Adverse
montlis of the preceding years.
autumn
conditions which affected total milk
flow, added to sharp increases in demands for
fluid milk in tie towns and cities, seem to have
been the principal factors causing the sharp
downward trend in butter production since last
October.
The increase of about 1,500.000 pounds in
monthly butter consumption is a reflection of
our increased population, due in part to natural
increase but more largely to returning servicemen and their families. We estimate that the
increase in population as compared with twelve
months ago is more than 600.000 persons.
Attached to the letter from which I have
just read is a table of butter statistics. This

information may be of interest to honourable
senators. It is as follows:

I further consulted this representative »of
the Wartime Prices and Trade Board regarding the supply of oils and fats for the making
of oleomargarine and margarine. On this
phase of the subject he sent me a copy of a
letter that he had previously sent to the city
clerk at Port of New Westminster, BC. It
says:
The production, importation and sale of margarine bas been prohibited in Canada for about
fortyyears, with the exception of a short period
of time about 1917 to 1922. Into the justification of this, as a normal peace-time policy, I do
not need to go at this time but it is relevant to
point out that even if this prohibition were
suspended, it is not likely that any appreciable
quantities of -margarine could be made available
for the following reasons:
(1) The civilian per capita consumption of
butter in Canada under rationing is very much
greater than that of any other country in the
world, with the possible exception of Australia
and New Zealand.
(2) Canadian civilian per capita consumption
of all edible fats and oils throughout the war
period and at present, bas been practically as
large or larger than any other country in the
world, again excepting Australia and New
Zealand.
(3) Of the three countries, for which we have
detailed figures, Canada has taken the smallest
cut below pre-war consumption (the United
Kingdom per capita consumption has been eut
10 pounds; the United States, 6 pounds; and
Canada, about 5 pounds).
(4) With these figures in mind, we can hardly
ask through the Combined Food Board for a
larger allocation of edible oils, which are the
bases of margarine, for additional supplies
could only come by diverting fa's and oils from
other countries which are worse off than we are.
To divert existing Canadian supplies of edible
cils to margarine would only aggravate the
already difficult situation that both housewives
and industrial users are experiencing in getting
the lard and shortening they want.
(5) You will also note from the attached table
of figures that Canadian butter consumption exceeds by a wide margin the combined butter and
margarine consumption in both the United
States and the United Kingdom.
Honourable senators, to the reasons already
given for the shortage of butter may I add
that the government has entered into heavy
contracts for the supplying of cheese, and a
good deal of the milk that otherwise would
have gone into the manufacture of butter
has been absorbed in that way. Also our
home consumption of fluid milk has greatly
increased. I am sure the farmers of this
country want to meet the demands made upon
them to increase the food supply of the warravaged countries of Europe. It is my belief
that they will Ineet those demands. From correspondence I have received I know that the
farmers greatly appreciate the recent increase
allowed them on pork and butter products.
Dairying is a basic component of agriculture, and the general welfare, of the industry is

.

essen'tial to Canada. I trust therefore that
the sponsor of this bill will not press it,
because it certainly will bring discouragement
to a very important seétion of our population,
which includes many of the finest and best
people in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, I would hesitate as much as any other
member of the Senate to support a measure
which I thought would permanently injure our
dairy producers. But we are dealing at the
present time with a very extreme situation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: We who go to the
parliamentary restaurant for our meals know
that we do not get much butter there.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We get none.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: I have not much
sympathy for mature men, like members of
the Senate, who can get along without butter,
but there are in this country many poor
families of working people, with a half a
dozen children who require a certain amount
of fats if they are to maintain their normal
growth and become useful citizens. For that
reason I am in favour of at least a part of
the bill introduced by the honourable member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler).
It bas been acknowledged that if the rule
against the importation of oleomargarine were
suspended there would be olenty of it available from the United States. I do not believ'e
we need be very much concerned about the
manufacture of this product, for by the time
.we got into production it would not do much
to relieve the present situation. I should be
pleased to support the second reading of the
bill if somebody will move that it be referred
to the appropriate committee-always provided that the rule against the importation of
oleomargarine be suspended only until we
have a sufficient quantity of butter in this
country to do away with present restrictions.
Hon. FELIX P. QUINN: Honourable
senators, I feel much like the honourable
senator who has just taken his seat (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly), because I too would be one
of the last in this country to support legislation which would do the slightest injury
to the interests of the farmers, particularly
those in the dairy industry.
The honourable senator who introduced the
bill informed us that the only objection to
the proposed measure- came from the dairymen's association. I would point out that
since the dairymen of Canada are not supplying our needs we would be doing them no

gentleman who is sponsoring this bill (Hon.
Mr. Euler) quoted figures purporting to show
that the manufacture of oleomargarine had
nlot in.iured the dairy industry of Denmark.
Well, in 1922, 1928 and 1932, when I was connected with the Department of Agriculture in
Quebec, I visited Denmark, Holland and
Belgiurn, and discussed agricultural conditions
,there. The fact is that as a resuit of the
the dairy
oleomargarine
manufacture of
industry in those countries was absolutely
ruined after the last World War. Thon, in
an endeavour to help the industry get back
on its foot, laws wore passod restricting the
to certain
manufacture of oleomargarine
speciflod quantities.
lion. Mr. EULER: 'May I ask the hionourWill ho nlot
able gentleman a question?
admit that thie mallec production of butter
in Denrnark and certain other ceuntrios that
were occupiod by the Germnans is attributable
to tie fact that largo numbers of people were
transportod te' Germany?
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT: I arn spoaking of conditions after the first world war, in
1922. 1923, 1924, 1928, and se on. And we had
one experionco with oloomargarino in this
counitry, from 1918 to 1923.
It would ho a dangorous thing to permit the
manufacture of eleomarg-arine and thoreby
injure our dairy industry now, wvhen already
too rnany people have l'f t theî farms to live in
the cities. Look at conditions as they are
fo-day!
As I said at the outset, the prosont situation is an abnormal one. ln normal times the
production of butter is sufficient to supply Ulic
needs of ail our pCoP"lo. Thîe'reason for the
rcducod production of butter is to ho found
in the comparatively higher prico of cheose.
Cheese production more than doiibled during
the war, whereas butter production incroased
by only ono-third. Now that the goverument
has authorizod an increase of four cents a
pound in the price of butter, the supply will
hecome largor. An abîominsituation eannot be remedied by the substitution of another aheormal- situation. In order to huild.
our agricultural economy on a sound basis it
is necossary to take a long view and proceed in the light of normal conditions.
If the manufacture of oleomargarine were
permitted, it would ho necessary to import

Hon. A. D. M.cRAE: ilonourable senators-Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Another consumer?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: 1 have been rather
surprised te note from the debate how well
honourable members are taking the recent
shortage of butter. Hav-ing regard to conditions ail over the world, I arn sure we are
entitied te sympathy for this latest deprivation
that we have had te endure. The butter shortage we are experiencing is undoubtedly accounted. for in large part by the shipment to
Brimain 'of a large quantity of cheese--600
million peun-ds, if my memory serves me.
That of course bas resulted in a decreased
production of butter.
Thon wo sbipped overseas some 128 million
pounda of evaporateci milk. We can ho preud
of the great effort our dairy fermera bave mad.

lion. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, he:ar.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Fer sorne time the price
of butter bas been tee low, and it has been
more profitable te produce cheese. I say advised.ly te the bouse that I think a priceo f 50
cents a pound is necessary in erder te encourage farmers te preduce butter. But that
was net the programme during the war; nec
would such a programme today meet with
the approval -of my frienda je the urban
contres. There seema te bc on the part of
my friends in the cities an almest entire disregard for the welfare of the agricultucal
population of Canada. I find thern cemplaining about prices, but neot in tho sliglhtest
clegree concerned whether the man who produces the commodity is making ends moot or
net. In this respect the dairy industry partieularly bas had a very bard rew te hoe,
hecause labeur costs- bave advanced at least
150 per cent, and in some cases even more.
In my province we are paying a dairy band
$100, a menth plus board, which is worth another $25 a menth, and with the erdinary
daicy herd you are lucky if you bave anything

I do net think tbe public appreciate tbe

Hon. Mr. McRAE:
Not for my business,

Then
coco-nut cil came on the market. I predict
now that when transportation returns to anything like normal, and Manchuria is again
on a peacetime basis, its soya bean production
will be even greater than it was before the
war. With the opening up of the East Indies,
which the war bias accelerated, coco-nuts and
soya beans will ho exported to this continent
in such quantities as we would not have
drýamed of a few years ago. Then we shall,
if you wish, have a cheaper commodity to
take the place of butter, the oils from these
sources forming the man constitýuents of oleomargarine. It has been said, and I have no
reason to doubt tlhe correctness of the statement. that the commodity will seil at about
twenty cents a pound helow the price of butter.
Well, if that ever happens 1 can tell honourable
senators that the dairy industry of Canada will
be through.
Now, t.o show the' magnitude and importance
of our dairy industry, Jet mie give you a few
figures furnished by the Dairy Counicil. It is
estimated that we have in Canada 3,900,000
cows. or one cow for every three head of
population. These cows represent a value of
S397,000.000-so the Dairy Couincil says, but
in my opinion that is below the presenit-day
value. The value of equipment on the farms
and in the distributing centres amounts to
S350,000,000. A lot of people who today are
complaining about not being able to buy
butter get their wages from supplying that
equipment. Five hundred thousand of our
farmers are dependent, either in whole or in
part, on the dairy business. The value of
their farms, implemnents and live stock is estimated at three and one-third billion dollars.
These are gigantie figures. It is said that 17
per cent of our population depend on the
dairy business, and this does not include those
engaged in some 4,500 milk processing plants.
In miy opinion, hono-ural)le senators, this
bill is introduerd at an inopportune time, for
if it rmises any doubts i0 the' minds of our
dairymen as to what t'he future may hold in
store for them., the decrease in the number of
dairy cows will proceed at a more rapid rate
than it has in the past year or two. This is
not the time to arouse uncertainty and so
tndermine the foundation of one of the great
industries of Canada.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, my remarks on this bill can be
put into very small compass. It is rather
curious that the attitude adopted by those
discussing the bill is reminiscent of the great
clash between the Prot.ectionists and the Manchester Sehool.
lion. Mr. EULER.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Oh, ch!

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I congratulate the
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) on
introducing this bill, and partieularly on the
three points which lie made in support oft it.
is first point is conclusive so far as I arn
concerned. I'think the mýost valuable thing
we have in Canada is freedýom, and I amn for
the right of the individual to use his own
good judgment when it comes to choosing

An Hon. SEN-ATOR:

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: -interfering with

must protect the individual when protection is
necessary, but in connection with this measure
there lias been no necessity shown either for
the protection of the dairy industry or of
the individual bimself.
An lion. SENATOR:
Zealand butter?

What about New

Hon. Mr. ROEB *UCK: We heard something
about New Zealand butter on one occasion.
1 have evervy sympathy for the dairv industry,
and 1 assure you I wotîld do it no harm. But
w~hat is the proposition before us? It is
stated that at the present moment our dairy
industry cannot supply the Canadian demand
for butter, but that at seime time in the
future it may be able to do so. This implies
that the bill sho.uld be rejeeted for the purpose of eontinuing to force the individual to
bte something which perhaps he does flot
want. I repeat, 1 have every sympathy for
the dairv industry, but I am not prepared to
starve the people of my district in order to
for-ce theri to buy butter.
Hon. Mir. DUFF:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:
The purpose of
production is consumption, and consumption
should beý the dominant consideration. If thîe
dairy industry doos not serve the best interests
of the consumer, it should hc so much the
werse for the dairy industry. But that is nlot
so; the clairy industry can stand on its own
feet, and bias for many years, and 1 am inelined to believe that it would be very much
better off if it relied on a free mark-et instead
of resorting to statutory powers in order to
drive the individual to buy its produet. This
compulsion on the individual is not necessary

APRIL 3, 1946
to protect the dairy industry, and it is inadvisable. I arn for freedom of the individual,
I am for freedorn of tradeSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: -I arn for freedom
of conscience, and I arn for free enterprise.
Free enterprise means just what it says. If
there is a caîl for this cornrodity, let it be
made unless it can be shown that its manufacture and sale is inimical to the best intercsts
of the people, particularly of those whe will
eat it. I intend to support the bill.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, rny ggod friend the honourable member from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.,McRae) bas
expressed hirnself--as 'lie usually does-with
great clarity and eloquence in bebaîf of the
dairy interests. No one in this chamber
wîslhes to do the dairy industry any barra,
but since it is unable to supply the necessary
butter requirernents of the consuming public,
1 for one can see no reason i the world why
this bill should not pass.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, bear.
My good
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
friend frorn Vancouver bas spoken, as hie has
cvery rigbt to do, in bebaîf of the dairy
interests. Only on rare occasions is it rny
privilege to speak for the masses of the people.
As you know, I live in the commercial
metropolis of Canada. Day by day I bear
from taxi-drivers and others that butter is
unobtainable. Why sbould this bouse refuse
the poor man and il wife and cbildren the
opportunity of obtaining oleornargarine as a
substitute, providing we can get supplies from
our neighbours to the south? None of us
suifer personally from the lack of butter. We
can go to our club and get a small pieceHon. Mr. DUFE: Small?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: -and we can
get sufficient in our bornes. But honourable
senators will please bear in mind that wheii
the poor man's wife goes to the store with
ber butter coupons, since sbe bas not the same
prestige as those wbo buy on a large scale,
she rnay find there is no butter to be bad.
From a bumanitarian point of view it is the
imperative duty of tbis bouse to pass tbe bill
in order that the poor and their cbildren may
be able to get a substitute wbile butter
continues so, scarce as to be well-nigb unobtainable.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I arn only too glad to j oin witb the bonourable senator frorn Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) and the bonourable senator from

9

Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) in saying a few
words from this side of the house in favour
of the bill.
Wben butter rationing first came in two or
three years ago I cornritted the rash act of
writing "a letter to the editor"-sumething
that no prudent man should ever do, of
course-advocating the sale of oleomargarine
in Canada. 1 was rather surprised at the
comments that followed. 1 thought perhaps
someone might pay a littie attention to rny
letter, but I found press comments critical
frorn one end of the country to the other.
The principal criticisrn of my suggestion,
especially in the editorials in the Ottawa
papers, was that certain fats and other ingredients of oleomargarine would not be available because they were in great dernand for
the manufacture of explosives and ammunition. Well, judging by the enormous output
of these war supplies, the volume of oils and
fats so used must have been something gigantic. Where are those fats and oils going
today? Surely some portion of them can be
put back into edible commodities.
My honourable friend from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McRae) said that a difference of
twenty cents a pound between the price of
butter and ojeomargarine would mean the
death knell of the dairy industry. During
the first Great War and irnrediately after
there was a very rnuch wider spread; oleomargarine was selling at 33 cents a pound
and butter at frorn 55 cents to 60 cents a
pound. It did not take very long for butter
to come back on the market; in fact the
sale of oleomargarine had not the slightest
eifect on the dairy industry. Neither do I
think it would have today, according to what
rny honourable friend from Waterloo has
said, for his staternent is borne out by facts.
I can speak as a dairy farmer. 1 run a
fairly large farrn in the great dairy farming
county of Leeds. 1 have a Jersey herd of
about 160 head. The Jersey is essentially a
butter-producing cow. I know frorn what I
see about my own district that it would not
make the slightest difference if over a certain
period of years we sold a few million or even
ten million pounds of oleomargarine in
Canada. Some years ago when oleomargarine
was on the market we had in rny district the
alrnost incredible situation of farmers selling
their butter at 50 to 60 cents a ýpound, and
buying oleomargarine for their own consumption at 30 to 35 cents a pound. If I
made butter on my farm, whicb I do not,
and needed the money, I would do the same
thing.
The honourable senator from Alma (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) said that the consumer

SENATE

sbould be considered. The farmer today docs
flot constitute the mai oritv of the total population.
About 47 per cent of our people
holong to rural communities, and perhais
half of those are directly engaged in the
dairy indu7try.
I do not. uîdeî'esitirate thei
great value of the dairy indnstry, but wlheu
the suggestion is mifdo in this bouse that it i

roentt.
There are cimes tvlîen I tbiuk perhaps the

APRIL 3, 1946
whip and even the government may be wrong,
and as private member I.reserve the right to
differ if I choose.
May I say that I am not very much impressed by the arguments so far presented
against this measure; I am least impressed by
those put forward by the honourable member
from Vancouver. (Hon. Mr. McRae).
. Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: There was a shadowy
argument that this measure should not be
proceeded with because, forsooth, the raw
materials that enter into the production of
oleomargarine would not be available. If the
raw materials are not available, then we will
not have oleomairgarine.
The honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
painted a rather grim picture of tremendous
amounts of soya beans produced in Manchuria,
and considerable quantities of coco-nut and
other oils from the West Indies, flooding into
Canada and destroying an industry in which,
according to his figures, millions of dollars are
invested. Now, really, is that a very sound
argument?
lion. Mr. EULER:

No.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If we import vegetable
oils from the West Indies and soya beans
from Manchuria, are we not in step with the
loud professions we bear from all governments, including our own, that if this poor
old world is to survive there must be a great
increa-e in multi-lateral trade.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is good Liberalism.
Hon. Mr., CRERAR: I am delighted to
have the approval of the grand old veteran
and freetrader, the honourable senator from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff).
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If we import these
raw materials from the West Indies and Manchuria, we will send them ansoething in
exchange.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Why not send them
butter?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I am rather surprised
to hear any voice raised in this chamber
against the great humanitarian movement
among the nations of the world towards
greater freedom of trade.
The only real argument that could possibly
be advanced against this bill is that oleomargarine is not a healthful food, and the
weight of evidence from every source is all

97

to the contrary. Even since the debates of
some twenty years ago, to which the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) referred important advances have been
made in the science of nutrition and the
proper balancing of foods. It is quite possible
now to produce an oleomargarine that is just
about as healthful and nutritious as butter.
Hon. Mr. EULER: And just as palatable:•
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If that is true. then
why deny me, an ordinary citizen of this
country, the right to buy that kind of food?
Soma Hon. SENATORS:

Ilear, hear.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Surelv that is an
interference with my rights as a private
citizen, and should not be tolerated. From
that angle I strongly support tbe bill.
There are one or two other reasons why I
support this bill. The honourable senator
froum Kings (Hon. Mr. McDonald) presented a
very clear argument, but it was based wholly
on the principle of protection-that is, some
people in this country might b hurt if we
permitted the manufacture or importation of
oleomargarine even under -proper regulation.
I have been too long on the other side of
the fence, opposing restrictions on trade, te
be told where I must buy my shoes, niy farm
implements, or my food; and I am too old
now to change my point of view, even in the
face of the cloquent plea made by the honourable gentleman.
The present need for something to supplement butter is great. I am of the opinion,
rightly or wrongly, that that need will continue.
To get a proper estimate of the
position of the dairy industry we 'must
first look at the total amount of fluid milk
produced in the country, because that is the
great reservoir from which is drawn not only
all the milk that is sold ta consumers, but
all that is used in the production of butter
and 'cheese and ice cream. The work carried
on by health agencies and other organizations
has tremendously stimulated the consumption
of fluid milk everywhere. In some of our
cities the school boards are providing a daily
ration of milk for the pupils. The consumptien of fluid milk in homes all over the country
has increased and will continue to increase. It
is desirable that it should be so.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No food is more
beneficial to school children than milk.
Recognizing this fact, some school boards in
the Old Country also make a daily distribution of milk to pupils. I think we can take
it for granted that in the years ahead there

98

SENATE

is going to be an expanding consumption of
fluid milk. So unless the dairy industry is
able to step up production much more rapidly
than it has done in the past, there will continue to be a deficiency of certain milk
products.
There is another point to be considered.
As those who are familiar with the dairy
industry know, the most profitable form in
which dairy products can be sold today is
whole milk. If you equated the financial
return from butter to the return from whole
milk today, you would have to make a substantial increase in the price of butter. That
being so, why should there be in the law a
prohibition depriving people of the low income
groups of the right to buy a nutritious and
health-build.ing substitute for butter?
I am wholly in accord with the view put
forward by the honourable senator from Alma
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) who was my colleague
in former days also. The vigour and logic
with which he argued his point this afternoon
encouraged me to hazard the hope that he
will see the light on other matters of international trade as well.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:
For the reasons
stated, honourable senators, I feel it is my
duty to support the bill introduced by my
bonourable friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler).
Hon. J. A. LESAGE: Honourable senators,
I had not intended to take part in this debate,
but desire te do so now, as I feel that this
question involves a principle.
Ho.

Mr. DUFF:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. LESAGE: We are faced with
the question whether passage of the bill
would make it impossible for our farmers to
dispose of their products at a reasonable profit.
Well, I believe it has been proved that industry and science can cope with every situation
that arises.
As I said. I feel there is a principle involved.
Are we going te prohibit the manufacture and
sale of one product in order to protect the
production and sale of another? The honourable senator who just preceded me is better
qualified te discuss this situation than I am,
for he is informed as to farming conditions in
the whole country. But as a farmer's son,
who now lives in the city of Quebec, I think
I am able to analyse the situation fairly well.
Should we try to keep pace with science or
te stop its development? I believe in the
ability of the scientists and other officers of
the federal and provincial departments of
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

agriculture to devise methods whereby our
farmers will be able to produce more cheaply
and meet competition that may arise from
manufactured products.
Probably peanut butter has at times been on
the table in the homes of some honourable
senators, and their children may have looked
upon it as a treat and preferred it to ordinary
butter. If the sale of this substitute for
butter is legal, why should the sale of another
substitute be prohibited? A substitute whidh
can be placed on the market at about half
the price of butter may be preferred by many
young people and others. If that is so, then
why should they not be able to get it? Sometimes our young people like things that we
dislike. We may be inclined to think they
are wrong, but they may be right.
Why grow old, honourable senators? Why
net keep abreast of the times? Why not go
out to meet progress? We must have freedom of trade-freedom to buy butter, if we
like it, or a butter substitute, if we prefer that.
Though I had made no preparation to take
part in this debate, I felt that as a Liberal
I should express my belief in freedom of
trade.
Hon. JACOB NICOL: Honourable senators, I have listened with a great deal of
interest to the debate this afternoon. When
the bill was placed on the order paper for
second reading I expected that the discussion
would be more or less academic. The bill
proposes that the law be amended to permit
the manufacture of oleomargarine in Canada.
Almost every honourable senator who has
spoken so far bas admitted that certain fats
and other ingredients necessary to the manufacture of oleomargarine are net available in
this country at present. I read in a magazine
or somewhere else that during the awful
war just ended the people of Canada were
better fed than those in any other part of
the world. We all know that the supply of
fats has been distributed among various
nations. and that if we start to make oleomargarine here it will be necessary to deprive
some countries of a portion of the fats which
they need te provide their people with a
nourishing diet.
If we pass this bill we shall not improve
existing conditions, and we may do a great
deal of harm. I agree with the honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
that industry and the whole world are perturbed. The last few years have been years
in which the industrialists had their say. The
farmer bas had to take a back seat, so te speak;
he bas been made to obey all kinds of restrictions. I was surprised to hear how harmful

99

APRIL 3, 1946
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) considers certain rebtrictions to
be. During the war the government imposed
some restrictions that we did not altogether
like, but we submitted to them because we
felt they were in the best interests of the
country.
Honourable senators, I do not think that at
this time our farmers should be disturbed
by a proposal to amend the Dairy Industry
Act. I share the honour with the whip on
this side of representing what I think is the
finest dairy district in Canada.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: As has been said, there
is à reason for the shortage of butter. In my
own district a firm from Wisconsin bas established a powdered milk plant. The proprietors looked over certain sections of
Ontario, the Western provinces and the Maritimes, and they decided to locate their plant
in Sherbrooke. To their great surprise this
is now their largest producing plant in Canada, and I believe it even surpasses their
parent plant in Wisconsin.
They never
expected to receive so much milk for processing. This means milk withdrawn from
the production of butter. During the war
tons of powdered milk were sent from the
Eastern Townships to Italy, North Africa,
Greece, and other countries. Apparently we
shall have to feed Europe for a few more
months, and then the farmers of this country
will find the situation back to normal. The
first effect of legalizing the production and sale
of oleomargarine will be to kill the home market-the only market our farmers may have
for their butter.
Some of my colleagues have referred to
the price of milk. At the outset the proprietors of the factory at Sherbrooke paid
$1.80 a hundred pounds for milk, later the
price went to $2. I happen to be a farmer
in the Eastern Townships. I sent my milk to
Montreal. There I received 82 plus a bonus
of 25 cents per hundred pounds, but of course
I had to pay express or freight to Montreal.
My honourHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
able friend would get a little more for his
milk if its butter fat content was increased,
would he not?
Hon. Mr. NICOL: I think my honourable
friend wants to cast a slur on my breed of
cattle.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Now, what is the situation within thirty miles of Sherbrooke? In

Vermont the dairy farmers get froam $3.50 to
$4 a hundred for similar milk, as against my
return of only $2.25.
Reference has been made to the number
of dairy cattle exported to the United States.
I happen to have sold some myself. The
man who came to buy mine admitted that
he was selling his milk at Concord, Massachusetts, for $5 a hundred pounds. Of course,
it was a specially high grade of milk.
A great deal of milk from our cattle has
gone across the line, some of it legally, and
some, I am afraid, through the black market.
But how can you expect our farmers to refrain
from selling their cows when purchasers
on the other side can offer a price that we
cannot meet here on account of the lower
pries that we receive for our milk. The
farmers of the Eastern Townships have responded, to the request of the government
that they produce milk, butter and pork. In
my country it takes m-ilk ta produce pork,
and a lot of milk was fed to hogs. Speaking
for the Eastern Townships, I submit that we
should not disturb the farmers at this time,
when they are uneasy, not knowing what tomorrow will bring forth. A few years hence
when present difficulties have disappeared
will be time enough to decide whether a
measure of this kind should be put on the
statute books.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Lambert the debate
was adijourned.
The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

19 are struck out and the word "for" is substituted therefor. As I heard the amendments
read, I do not think those words were struck
out. They make a great deal of difference.
The Hon. SPEAKER: Is it the pleasure of
the Senate to concur in these amendments?

,IMMIGRATION ACT
MOTION

Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK moved:
That the Standing Committee on Immigration
and Labour be authorized and directed to examme into the Immigration Act (R.S.C. Chapter
93 and Amendments) its operation and administration and the circumstances and conditions
relating thereto including (a) the desirability
of admitting immigrants to Canada; (b) the
type of immigrant which should be preferred,
including origin, training and other characteristics; (c) the availabilitv of such immigrants
for admission; (d) the facilities, resources and
capacity of Canada to absorb, employ and maintain such immigrants, and (e) the appropriate
terms and conditions of such admission;
And that the said committee report its find-

ings to this house;
And that the said committee have power to
send for persons, papers and records.
He said: The motion which I make this
afternoon, honourable senators, is for a committee of inquiry into a subject of the utmost
importance, for upon the solution of the

103

APRIL 4, 1946
problem of immigration depends the future
of Canada; whether we are to remain for an
indefinite period a third-rate power, wielding
at most a secondary influence in world councils
and depending for our existence as a nation
upon the favour and forbearance of more
populous states, or, by breaking open the
vast treasure-trove of our resources-laden
wilderness, are to become one of the most
pregnant and powerful of nations. That is
the issue. The prophecy of Sir Wilfrid Laurier
that the twentieth century belongs to Canada
still remains to be ful-filled. We have not, in
tny judgment, taken advantage of the twentieth century as Laurier had expected.
Some figures would probably be of interest
to honourable members in considering the
great problem involved in my resolution.
According to the 1941 census, Canada has a
population of 11,506,655. This is about a oneforty-fourth part of the population of the
British Empire, which is estimated at 500,774,000-or roughly half a billion-in a world
population of more than two billions. But
although Canada has only one-forty-fourth
of the population of the British Empire, she
occupies one-quarter of its area. Canada's
areas is given as 3,466,882 square miles-so
that our population averages roughly 3-32
persons to the square mile. How much of
Canada's great area is habitable is, of course,
another question. But who, honourable
senators, will say that any of it is potentially
uninhabitable?
There are a number of classifications into
which our territory should be divided. To
commence with, let us take the farming area.
Mr. J. F. Booth, an Associate Director of the
federal Department of Agriculture, bas
recently estimated that an area of 549,660
square miles, or 16 per cent of our vast territory, is at present occupied as agricultural
land or is land having agricultural possibilities.
Roughly, one-half of this area, he says, or
175 million acres, is now in farms. The other
one-half awaits a marked increase in population or greatly expanded export markets. Mr.
Booth quotes W. Burton Hurd as authority
for the estimate that, outside the Yukon and
the North West Territories, the extent of
unused and reasonably accessible land suitable for agriculture is from 25 to 27 million
acres. This is enough for approximately
158,000 to 168,000 additional farms. There
must necessarily be considerable differences
of opinion on the question of potential agricultural land, but it is apparent that a large
number of farms could be established on land
not now occupied.
It must be realized that these estimates are
based upon current ideas as to availability,

and one should bear in mind that the margin
of cultivation has for years been shifting
steadily northward. A great deal of land
which some years ago was considered unsuitable for agriculture is today regarded as good
farming land. Most honourable members, I
am sure, will be able to support that statement from their own experience. Moreover,
one has but to look about him to observe
how incomplete is the use made of the
greater portion of the territory now classified
as occupied. This is not a plèasant subject
and I need not dwell upon it. In the province of Ontario, which those of us who live
there consider to be the banner province,
farms are standing idle and abandoned, which
under favourable economic and labour conditions could be brought again under cultivation.
According to the 1941 census, the rural
population of Canada was 5,254,239, an
increase of only 449,551 over that of the
preceding decade. I should like to have some
inquiry into the question as to whether it is
altogether impossible that during the next
ten years the increase might be twice as large.
Is that beyond the range of possibility?
But I would point out that agricultural land
is only one of Canada's vast resources.
Canada's forests cover 1,220,400 square miles,
or more than one-third of the total land area
of this country. The productive portion of this
great forest area is 430,000 square miles, of
which about 340,000 square miles are not
presently accessible, and form a reserve for

the future, to be brought into use when increased

manpower

development

makes

possible.
Speaking in this chamber only last week,
the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) stated that according to the

latest figures available, those of 1940, our
total mineral output aggregated $529,000,000;
and he added, as is accepted by all of us, that
the mineral resources of our country are as yet
far from fully developed. In my judgment
this is an understatement. I would 'say that
as yet the mineral resources of Canada have
hardly been scratched. None of us will know
how great they are until, for instance, we
pierce the great pre-Cambrian shield covering
northern Ontario.

But, even so, the mining industry in 1940
afforded employment to 108,886 men, and provided a livelihood for 1,300,000

Canadians.

The honourable senator did not think it unreasonable to speak of doubling that number.
I need say no more as to the possibilities of
mining development in this country. As every

honourable senator well knows, vast areas
privately owned, are still to be prospected.

SENATE
The potentialities of the basic industries of
farming, forestry, mining and fishing are most
readily visualized; but even more important
to Canada are the possibilities for urban expansion.
Of Canada's total population of
11,506,655 in 1941 more than one-half, or
6,252,416 persons were urban dwellers. This
represents an increase of 680,358 during the
previous decade. As the standard of living
rises there is an ever-decreasing proportion
of the population devoting itself to the production of food. That is in the nature of
things.
As science and invention become
more effective and our demands grow more
complex, there is an inevitable increase in
urban population. What Canada requires for
her industrial, financial and social security
in a turbulent world, is a better balanced
economy.
l
my judgment, this may be
achieved by an expansion of our towns and
cities, and by the exchange of products of both
farm and factory in local markets. We are
too dependent on markets abroad.
More
could be achieved by a greater exchange of
farm products in adjoining towns and cities.
Who in this honourable chamber has not
visualized the industrial growth of Canada
upon the completion of the St. Lawrence deep
waterway, and the attendant hydro-electric
development? What must be the result of the
union of these two tremendous potentialities?
-ocean
shipping and an additional million
horsepower of electrical energy. Honourable
senators, can we not see in our mind's eye
a vast population of happy, prosperous and
industrious artisans, supplying human direction to a billion turning wheels in as many
urban centres as there are port facilities on
the Great Lakes and their connecting rivers
-processing
the raw materials of the mines,
forests, and farms, and exchanging Canada's
finished products via the cargo shipping of the
seven seas? That is my vision of the Canada
that will result from increased hydro power
and an industrious population led by enterprising -management-trading freely abroad.
That picture puts to shame the little Canadians who fear that this great land of ours
with ail its potentialities, developed and
undeveloped, is already overcrowded, and
who would hide trembling behind their
Chinese walls. "Oh ye of little faithl" Seldom
in the history of the world has so small a
group of people been presented with so great
an opportunity.
No argument is necessary te convince the
young in mind-and that is common to all
honourable
senators-of
Canada's
future
greatness. I have visualized, as have ail lionourable senators, a prosperous and powerful
Canada in the future, happy in ber domestie
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

economy and powerful in her foreign relations. To tbose who lack the vision, may I
sound a warning? To them I say that we
cannot hope to retain our 3,500,000 square
miles indefinitely in the exclusive possession
of a mere 12,000,000 people.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I am net posing as
a prophet when I say that if we continuously
and fatuously refuse te develop our material
resources others will develop them for us.
History has proven the truth of this statement. We cannot continue forever te bury
our talents in the sand.
May I give this honourable house some
comparative figures?
Our 3,500,000 square
miles of territory with'its 12,000,000 people,
exceeds by fifty per cent the area of continental Europe, which supports a population
of 400,000,000 people. Before the war, the
Netherlands had a population of 720 persons
per square mile; the United Kingdom, 507
persons; Japan, 495; Germany, 381; India,
245; China, 104; the United States, 45; the
U.S.S.R.. 21; and Canada 3-32. The fraction
assumes some importance when the figure is
so small. Excluding the North West Territories, wbich are a very large part of our
country, Canada has a population of only
5-47 persons te the square mile.
Some honourable senators may remind me
that all this land is not suitable for agriculture; some of it may not produce forests, and
much of It may have no mineral wealth. But
in even the settled regions of our country
our resources are much more effectively monopolized than they are used, while in the great
northern territories, excluding perhaps northern Ontario, they are practically untouched.
In Russia there are industrial centres bordering on the Arctic Circle.
In populous
Leningrad one can sec the midnight sun.
Russia is turning her attention to far-northern
development. A word to the wise should be
sufficient. The Alaskan straits are not difficult to cross, and economically it might be
easier to pioncer southward in an empty
Canada than northward in an ice-bound
Russia. I am not forecasting an unfriendliness on the part of Russia. I am speaking
of the inevitable shifting of population as
years and even centuries go by. Nature
rather than politics will see to it that, if we
leave our own acres untilled, in due season
they will be tilled for us. We cannot hold
vast areas uninhabited, neither using them
ourselves nor opening them up for the benefit
of others. The dog-in-the-manger has been
despised since Aesop wrote his fables.
No one will dispute that the finest immigration Canada can have comes by way of

APRIL 4, 1946
the stork; our best immigrants are our own
children. But this alone does not solve the
problem. Had North America followed such
a policy from the beginning, this great
country would still be in the hands of the
Indians. If the United States had waited
for the natural growth of its population it
would not today be the most powerful nation
on earth, with a population according to
latest figures, of 140,000,000 souls-a great
country with a tremendous population.
In America we are all "immigrants," but
when in Canada we speak of immigrants we

usually think of the people who came to this
country from central Europe during the regime
of Sir Wilfrid Laurier-people whom we now
call "new Canadians." One is indeed ignorant
of modern Canada who is not aware of the
contribution made by these people to our
present social and industrial life. They did
much of the heavy pioneering work against
which our own native sons rebelled. They
built our roads and railroads; they dug our
mines and piled the bricks of our homes and
factories; they contributed no small share of
the effort which made the prairies blossom and
bear crops. They did still more for Canada
when they brought with them to our shores the
culture of their own countries, their literature,
art and music. In time they will enrich our
blood and language. Let no one spurn the
humble immigrant, or seek for him a place in
Canad-ian life in any way inferior to our own.
In spite of all that we have gained from
immigration from central Europe, for the past
fifteen years general immigration to this
country has beeji steadily declining, and against
the particular class of people about whom I
have been speaking we have all but closed our
doors. One would have expected the war to
have opened our doors, but it seems to have
had the opposite effect. In this country we
have always had space for all and natural resources for the employment of all; but unfortunately, because of artificial limitations and
restrictions on enterprise, we have not always
had work for all. War economy swept away
those artificial obstructions to industry, so
that instead of unemployment we had a shortage of manpower. During the war some 3,500
refugees were admitted to Canada on a temporary basis, which was made permanent in
October last, but, except for this, immigration
into this country during the last five years has
been the merest trickle-and this, honourable
senators, despite the desperate conditions prevailing in Europe. When Hitler commenced
his dastardly policy of extermination, there
were nine and a half million Jewish people in

105

territories which he later dominated, both in

and out of Germany.

When he finally com-

mitted suicide, there were only four million

remaining, and more than one million of
those were impoverished, homeless and workless-a pitiable condition of affairs.

It is interesting to observe what Canada
did in face of that terrible crisis. In 1942
she admitted via ocean ports Hebrew immigrants to the number of 111. In 1943, when
the murder camps were operating on an overtime basis, she admitted 31. In 1944 the
number of overseas immigrants rose to 56;
and in this last year, 1945, the latest year
for which figures are obtainable, the number
had grown to the magnificent figure of 95.
Somebody asked the other day whether
Canada would not at some time in the future
pay the price of that heartless policy, and I
answered, "She is already paying the price".
One has only to read the history of the
refugee in centuries gone by to realize how
much he has done for the countries to which
he migrated. No better illustration can be
cited than England, whose silk trade and wool
trade and many other skilled trades have been
based on the knowledge and industry brought
to ber shores by people who fled their home
lands because of religious and 'other persecution. But Canada has closed ber doors against
the blessings that such people could have
brought to us. The average number of immigrants of all kinds into Canada from overseas during the last five years has been 4.900
per year, of which 4,677 have been of British
nationality. That is to say, the average annual
number of non-British immigrants into Canada
from overseas in that period was only 233 per
year.
Now I ask you by way of contrast to note
the policy that Great Britain has adopted
with regard to refugees. Some little time ago
an announcement was made that she would
admit immediately the survivors of the Nazi
camps who have close relatives in Britain
able and willing to look after them.
Honourable senators, there are in Canada
simply thousands of people ready to bring
European -relatives and friends to this freedom-loving country and to take care of them
until they are employed and able to stand on
their own feet. There is practically not one
of our municipalities but has some citizens
anxiously looking to this parliament to give
them such an opportunity. Who can doubt
that the people who could come to us in this
way would contribute to the future development of Canada?
England admits not only survivors of the
nazi camps, but distressed persons, such as
those who have been hiding from the Gestapo,

106

SENATE

SENATE

and others who for one reason or another are
specially in need of care. As I have already
pointed out, England is a thickly populated
country, without the vast resources and open
spaces which we have here, but her traditional
policy bas been to provide sanctuary to the
oppressed. The number of refugees which she
had accepted up to April 1943 was no fewer
than 150,000, and in June 1944 she was still
receiving an average of 800 refugees a month.
In other words, more non-British people were
allowed into Britain in one month than we
permitted to enter Canada during the last
five years. We pride ourselves on being a
Christian Country.
In addition to this stream of refugees into
England, ýmany others entered the country
under various schemes designed to meet special
circumstances.

For

example,

after

D-Day,

accommodation was extended to 10,000 French
refugees. In March of last year, 2,000 Dutch
children were brought over for a three months'
holiday which it was hoped would offset the
horrors of nazi occupation. The British government has spent $5,000,000 in subsidizing
private organizations caring for refugees. Honourable senators. what a striking contrast is
this to the cold neglect of the Canadian
people in this world crisis.
I realize that since the close of the war our
shipping space has been completely utilized
by our hoMe-coning troops. For that I have
not a word of criticism. It is only right that
returning members of our armed forces should
be given priority in shipping space. But we
were not bringing home an army during all
of the last five years.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE:
one abroad.

We were sending

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: True. And thousands of tons of materials were sent overseas
in ships which brought but small cargoes back
on their return journey. However that may
be, our soldiers will soon be home, and the
question that presents itself to us now is:
What about the future? That is why I have
thought it wise at this time. with the assistance
of my seconder, to bring this question to the
attention of the house.
I should like this committee, after examining the facts and considering the problems, to
answer a number of questions: 1. Do we want
immigrants?; 2. Can we get them?; 3. Can
we take care of them should they arrive?
As to whether or not we can get immigrants,
Cardinal McGuigan who has recently returned
from a notable trip to Europe, says that
Canada stands high in the estimation of the
world, and that very large numbers of people
in different countries are anxious to settle
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

here. The Honourable James Gardiner, 'Minister of Agriculture, says that wherever he
went in Europe the question most frequently•
asked him was, "May we come to Canada?"
The Honourable James MacKinnon, Minister
of Trade and Commerce, says that 25,000
Netherlanders have asked permission to come
to this country. On the other hand, the Right
Honourable Herbert Morrison has intimated
that there will not be a flow of immigrants
into Canada from Great Britain such as there
was after the first Great War-"Our blessed
birth rate is not what it should be", he says.
Nevertheless, Great Britain would assist exservice men who wish to migrate to the
dominions.
In attracting immigrants the quality or the
extent of the nation's resources do not count as
much as the completeness with which they
are monopolized by those already here, and
the price at which they are held. In this connection I would point out that, in Europe, land
values are depressed, and great estates are
being broken up into 121 acre holdings and
handed over to peasant workers. Unless we
can make our resources available to industry
at moderate rates, people will not come here,
and we would not know what to do with them
if they did.
If business and industry are to be crushed
with a load of taxation, and ownership and
speculation are to be specially favoured, as
they have been in the past, then perhaps it
might be just as well if we forget about immigration, rather than bring people here to join
in a national stagnation and to seek for work
where no work is to be found. If we lack the
wisdom to use the resources which nature has
given us, it would be just a's well perhaps.
not to gtut the labour market with additional unemployed. That is the problem-not
whether we have the resources and the space,
but whether we have the wisdom to use those
resources for the benefit of mankind. I submit that in the main our problem is to make
attractive and available the grand resources
which the Creator has given us.
There are many phases of an immigration
policy. They are partially covered in the
resolution, and I would urge that they are of
sufficient importance to the country, both
today and in future, to be studied by a committee of this bouse.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, what I am about to say
will be applicable not only to the motion now
before us but also to the motion which the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr.
MoRae) presented to the house last Thursday.
At that time I adjourned the debate because,
having been advised that the present motion

APRIL 4, 1W4
wouldi corne up, I fait that rny re«narks wo-uld
be applicable to botb. I arn sure the bonourable gentlemen from Vancouver and TorontoTrinity irnpressed us with the importance of
the subi ects whicb they have brought to our
attention. For my part, I cornmend them for
their initiative and industry in making available to us much valuable information.
In My officiai capacity, bowevcr, I would
request the lhonourable seTiators to defer final
action on their motions until after the Easter
recess. I do so because we have a very full
programme on our hands. Already we have a
special income tax committee at work; these
two motions mean two further inquiries, and
next weýek I hope to in-troduce a sorncwhat
voluminous bill for the revision of the Bankrnptcy Act. Fýurther, in due. course I shall
move for the appointment of another joint
committec and another spe-cial conmi'ttce for
the purpose of rcferring to them subi ects of
great interest and importance to this house. As
yuu are aware, we enlargcd the rnembership
of our standing committees Iast session, and
several honourable senators have asked me
when their committees are going to meet for
the purpose of organization as distinct from
the consideration of specific legisiation t)hat
may be referrcd to them.
I do flot tbink we should undertake more
work than we cýan bandle satisfactorily. I
know some senators are particularly interested
in the funictioning of certain committees. In
this connection I may say that when I spoke
to the Prime Minister in regard to more
legislation being introduced in the Senate lie
told me lie would welcome increased activity
on the part of our 'Committee on External
Relations. Doubtless the cliairnan of that
committee (Hon. Mr. McRae) eould initiate
an interesting programme; and I, am sure thle
chairman of the Committee on, Trade Relations, my bonourable friend to my Ieft (Hon.
Mr. Euler), will have a .busy time. I have' not
had any intimation from the chaîrman, of the
(Jommittee on Na'tural Resources (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly) as to what programme lie bas in
mind. Already the work of the Income Tax
Comnmittee lias won general approval.
As bonourab]e senators probably know, after
the Senate adj ourns tomorrow I shall be
absent from the city until the 12th instant,
wlien I shall return to this chamber for the
swearing in of the Governor General-elect.
So before we adjourn next week 1 should like
to ascertain from the cliairmen of tlic various
committees wliat demands, as far as they
can reasonably be anticipated, will lie made
upon our clerical and stenographie services,
in order that we may consider tlie timing of

107

all this work and make the necessary arrangements for handling it as cxpeditiously and
efficiently as poqsible.
If it rneets witb the wishes of bonourable
members I arn prepared, wben tlie Senate
resumes at the end of this monthý Vo sit every
week from Monday afternoon until Friday, if
necessary, in order Vo accommodate the activitics of lionourable senators. I do not wisb to
interfere witli tlieir work; indeed, I commend
their industry; but, as I say, I shall have to
consit with the chairmen of tlie committees
before we make a definite start 'on this cxpanded programme.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourahle senators, I agree witli tlie honourable leader of
the government that a little time should
elapse before this motion is finally considered
and deait with. The subi ect matter developcd
this afternoon by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity is of great magnitude,
and we are "very mucli indebted to him for the
masterly way in whici lie lias presented it
to us. It is one of the" major subjeets at
present cngaging public attention. The question of immigration is far-rcaching, and lias
'been considered both in this house and in the
other place. Sir Wilfrid Laurier said that
tbe twenticth century would lie Canada's
centurýi, and lic visualizcd considerable
increase in ber population witbin a short
terma of years. When Sir Wilfrid made this
pronouncement lie could flot foresce that two
world wars early in the century would turn
the tide of events and dclay the growth lie
contcmplatcd.
May I make a few furtber remarks on this
question before I move the adjournment of
the dehate? It is truc that the ever-increasing

burden of taxation weigbs lieavily on the
shoulders of Canadian taxpayers today. That
burden would lie ligbtened by spreading it

over a greater population.

That is well and

good; but is only one aspect of the problern.

If Canada nccds more people to develop ber
natural resources, increase lier wcaltb and
national revenue, it is important that the
immigrants admitted to lier shores be carefully selccted. Wliolesale immigration to the
United States during the last century was flot
an un.mixed blessing. Today that country is
confrontcd with scores of problcms whicb
spring directly from an indifferent selection
of immigrants.
Those of us wlio belong to the two major
stocks whicb go to make up the Canadian
nation have traditions and ancestral principles,
and new-comers must be sucli as- can lie

and become true Canadians. Carefully chosen
immigrants will help us build the country
visualized by Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
I concur in the very eloquent tribute paid
by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to the newcomers
who are now scattered across the country.
But in the selection of immigrants let us be
no less careful in the future than we have been
in the past. Because of gradual development,
Canada is more happy and prosperous than
she would have been had we thrown our doors
wide open to immigration irrespective of its
character or quality.
Our primary duty is to re-establish the
returned members of our overseas forces.
We also owe a duty to our war workers, who
for five or six years gave up their regular
vocations and must now be re-integrated in
their former employment. It has been said
that Canada has now 250,000 unemployed.
Surely we have a responsibility to provide
them with the opportunity to work.
Canada still bas to repatriate more than
50,000 members of ber armed forces. Only
recently I read that 28,000 wives and children
of our soldiers have yet to come to Canada.
Not long ago in the armouries of the city of
Hull there was a celebration in honour of
returned veterans. Whilst it was in progress
one could hear the noise of the kitchen utensils used by veterans' families who occupied
cubicles in the building as emergency shelter,
and at times it made the voice of the speaker
inaudible. That is another side of the immigration picture.
I do not intend to speak further to this
motion today, but will move the adjournment
of the debate.
Hon. MURDOCK: Mav I ask the honourable gentleman to look at the back page
of yesterday's report of the debate in another
place and say whether he agrees with the
statement appearing there, that there is no
room for immigration in Canada.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I do not agree with that
statement. In a country like Canada, whose
resources have been scarcely scratched, there is
room for fifteen or twenty million people-perhaps even twenty-five million-to live happily
and prosperously together. I am quite sure
that we can build up a great nation by opening our doors to a select class of immigrants.
I rather doubt the accuracy of some of the
figures submitted by the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
He said, if I mistake not, that Canada has
3,500,000 square miles of territory. He said
also that the 12,000,000 people of this country
constitute about one forty-fourth of the
Hon. Mr. VIEN.

500,000,000 who go to make up the population of the British Empire. I should like to
ask first, what proportion of the 3,500,000
square miles is habitable, arable and open to
industry and to new immigrants; and second,
how many of the 500,000,000 people in the
British Empire are white.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Will the honourable senator excuse me. I did not intend
that he should start on another speech.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: My honourable friend
need not excuse himself. I do not need bis
suggestion to continue my remarks, which are
exactly along the lines of my previous observations. If there is anything the honourable
gentleman should excuse himself for, it is
the interruption.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not know of
anyone who does more interrupting than the
honourable gentleman now speaking.
Hon: Mr. VIEN: I do not remember ever
having interrupted my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I do.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Be that as it may, I
simply wish to suggest that these figures must
be considered in the light of comparable
data. I do not believe that 3,500,000 square
miles is a proper basis in calculating the
habitable area of Canada.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Will the honourable
gentleman pardon me one moment? I should
like to ask him whether he is speaking to
the motion made by the honourable member
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
or to bis motion to adjourn the debate.
The Hon. SPEAKER: There is a motion
to adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I said that I was about
to move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable gentleman made the motion.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: If it is the desire of the
Senate, as it appears to be the wish of my
honourable friend, I shall move the adjournment of the debate, and when we resume I
shall satisfy the curiosity of honourable members with respect to points they have raised.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members, before the Orders of the Day are called, I have
a suggestion to make. I concur in what the
honourable leader of the government said a few

.

APRIL 4, 1946

moments a-go as to the resolutions now before
the bouse, but I think the debates on them
should be allowed to continue. I am sure the
house would consent to the honourable leader
taking part at a later date if he so desires. I
am sure that could be arranged.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The order will
stand in my name.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I had arranged
the matter with the honourable senator from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) and had no
intention of shutting off discussion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, if I
am repeating myself it is to lend emphasis to
my remarks.. I agree wholeheartedly with the
honourable leader of the government that when
bills are introduced in this house they should
be advanced as fast as possible.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: We did pretty well today.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: At the same time, for the
benefit of the senate and the people of Canada,
I think full and complete consideration should
be given not only to the resolution moved by
my friend from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae)
but also to the motion of the honourable
gentleman from Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
I agree with the honourable leader of the
government that the committee chairmen
should get together and discuss the work of
committees. The honourable gentleman did
not mention the committee on Tourist Traffic
under the chairmanship of the honourable
senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan).
With all due respect to my friend from Vancouver and my friend from Toronto-Trinity,
I really believe that the benefits to be derived
from tourist traffic outweigh almost everything
else. Our future tourist trade will be a source
of unlimited wealth. I should like to see the
discussion on the two resolutions before us
concluded April 30, so that the committees
can get down to work after the recess. I am
not suggesting that these committees should
push the income tax committee off the map.
One only needs to have heard the presentation of the Chartered Accountants' Association the other day to realize the opportunity
this house has, through this committee, to
make valuable suggestions as to the laws
affecting income tax and excess profits tax.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I am thoroughly in accord with what my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) says about
the importance of tourist traffic and the standing committee which deals with that matter.

101

The tourist business, if looked after, is a sure
crop with an annual value of 500 million
dollars.
Having in mind the remarks of the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), I want to say a word about the
Committee on External Relations., Lately I
have heard a number of references to it. I
do not know that it is up to the chairman
to devise ways and means of bringing business
before his committee. If any honourable member wishes to have a matter referred to it,
he should move in the Senate in the proper
way.
But after all, any such matter is likely to be
of an abstract nature, and I believe that this
bouse can do more useful work by dealing
with current matters affecting employment and
prosperity in our country. The tourist business is one of these, and immigration is
another. I make no apology for my motion
to have the Committee on Natural Resources
inquire into the economic value of metalliferous mines. Before a committee can begin
such an inquiry, there is about a month's
preparatory work in the making of arrangements for the appearance of witnesses and
that kind of thing.
I was pleased to hear the honourable leader
of the government say that our working week
in the Senate was going to be lengthened.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If the proposal
is approved by the Senate.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: I am sure that if this
proposal is adopted, the business done in
this house can be increased by 100 per cent.
May I suggest here that at any time when the
bouse is ad.journing until Tuesday, it would
be better to specify the afternoon rather than
the evening. Those of us who have been on
committees called for Tuesday morning know
it is almost impossible to get a quorum when
the house is not meeting until evening.
The Special Committee on the Income War
Tax Act has.done excellent work, and I judge
that before long a sub-committee will be appointed to draft a report. We are rapidly
nearing the end of the witnesses. The chairman (Hon. Mr. Euler) probably has a few
more in mind, but I would point out to him
that with our longer week we shall make
more progress.
Hon. Mr. EULER: There will be at least
five hearings after Easter.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Then the report will
probably be delayed too long to be useful
to the government.
After the Committee on Natural Resources
is authorized to get down to work, it will
probably be able to finish its -inquiry in five

SM~ATE,
or six sittings. These could no doubt be dovetailed in with those of other committees se
as flot to cause any congestion. It would
appear that the Senate and its committees are
going to handie a lot of business with dispatch-and that is a good thing. 1 arn rather
disappointed, though, that some committees
will flot be authorized to make arrangements
to proceed until after the East-er recess.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 1 think we shall be
bore ail summer.
DAJRY INDUJSTRY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINO DEBATE
CONTINtJED
The Senate resurned front yesterday the
ad.iourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler for the second reading of Bill G, an Act
to, amend the Dairy Industry Act.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, the motion for second reading of
this bill created se much interest yesterday
afternoon and made strange bed-fcllows arnong
s0 large and notable a section of our membership that I feit justified in adjourning the
debate; 'but now, in view of the lateness of the
hour and the probability that rnany other
hionourable members wish te speak on the bill,
-I arn coostrained to abridge and synopsize
nbat I had in mind te say.
1 have ne alternative but te support the
bill, ev en though in se doing I must differ
from my mu-ch respecte.d and thoro.ugbly
qualified agriculturist colleagues the lionour(Hon. Mr.
King's
senaters from
able
McDonald) and Kennebcc (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt). In the y'ears of the war it was my
privilege te ho associated with thern on a
committee investigating proposais for post-war
agricultural reconstruction, and I know that
their knowledige and experience are sucýh as te
command for their views the greatest respect
-which I arn sure they wili receive from
every member of tbtis bouse. Aise I feel impelied to ask once again the indulgence of my
honourable fricnd the leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) for seeming te usurp bis place in
this debate. In view of the observations he
made hiere a short time ago upon thbe state of
unemployment in our industrial centres, 1 was
disappointcd that bhe did net speak early in
this dehate. The subi et-matter of this bill is
nec unrelated te the question of unemployment in the industrial cities and towns of
Canada; nor, I subinit, is it unrelated te the
condition which, as pointed eut by my honourable friends wbo oppose the bill, exists in the
dairy industry. In a word,, I 'believe that the
real pro.blem facing the dairy industry in
Canada today is the difficulty of obtaining

successfuliy. I feel that if that one difficuity
could 'be ovei-come, the principal compiaints
expressed yesterdiay by those who oppose the
manufacture of oleomargarine would 'be met
effect.ively.
My support of this bill, however, is based
upon the ground of 'broad ecenemie policy
for this country rather than the practical
buman need of the moment in our closely
populated communities.
I feel that the point of view of my lionourable friend frern King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald)
on titis matter has been influenced iargely by
negative rather tban positive factors in the
cas.e. H1e, and I tbink aise the honourable
senator frern Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae),
have discevered that the 'presênt over-ali
supply cf those edible fats nnd oils whicb
enter into the manufacture of oicomargarine
is ranch srnallcr titan it was a year ago, and
that the worid-wide demand for those fats
and oils is se insistent that the manufacture
of oleomnargirine in Canada could be carried
on only by curtailing the production of such
cemmodities as shortcning and salad dressing,

consequently tlie bill should net he passed.
I submit that this is ne ground upon which

leader- of this side has given point te the
whole matter. It is frornt the point of view
of ecenornie policy that 1 arn supporting this
bill.
In the first pince, aithougha 1 am net stressmng the argument at the moment fer the
meeting of ernergent human needs, it mnust
lie said that if the amendment w'hich thtis bill
proposes is adopted n certain amount of
immedinte relief could be nfforded te the
consuming public of this country by importations from the Unitcd States, where more
than 300,000 tons of oleomargarine are conSitmed annually. Io time, 1 think it reasenahie te assume, the countries wbich can
supply peanut, cottonseed, coconut and soya
bean, oiîs wili corne hack inte production and
make it possible for our ewn manufacturers
te produce oleernargarine.
Refe~rring te the hroad grond of national
policy upon which I support this bill, I think
it is essential te remember that dairying is

APRIL 4, 1946
only one branch of our agrîcultural industry.
While it is an important and valuable branch,
it is înseparably linked up with agriculture as
a whole. One might go even further and
say it is only a,truism. that the welfare of our
agriculture is basically dependent upon that
great common economie denominator-the
consuming public. To illustrate what I meaný
by the interlocking and inter-dependent
character of the agricultural industry as a
whole, and to bear particularly upon the interests of the dairy industry in thé eastern
part of Canada, I should like to quote figures
,relating to the shipments of feed grains from
western Canada to the eastern provinces from
October, 1941, to February 28, 1946, covering almoat completely the war years i which
the great growth of output of aIl dairy products t.ook place. These are the, figures:
Tons
Province
5,158,587
Ontario.....................
4,251,068
Quebee .....................
528,396
New Brunswick ...............
631,404
Nova Scotia..................
174,525
Prince Edward Island ...........
A total of some 10,650,0060 tons of feed grains
at a total cost in prepaid freight charges of
$56,500,000, borne by the people of Canada as a
whole, went to support the dairy and livestoek
industry of these eastern provinces.
I believe it would have been absolutely
impossible for the dairy industry to have done
the great job of production that it did do if
it bad flot been for thei interdependent factors represented in the shipment of feed
grains from the middle west to these eastern
provinces. That is why I was so interested
the other day in reading the report of the
presentation of the Canadian Federation of
Agriculture to the government. As behooved
the spokesmen of an organization with the
national scope of that body, tbey made refero
ence not only to the increase .. f four cents
per pound for butter, but to the critical farm
labour shortage, to the tax on gasoline for
farmers, to the inequalities of the income tax,
to wheat marketing and to other cereal feed
grains -and m'Ill feeds for cattie, to rural electrification and prairie farm rehabilitation.
If I may be permitted a personal reference,
I should like to say that I have alwaYs
thought that I owed a great deal to an
experience of four years as Secretary of the
Canadian Council of Agriculture at a time
when organized agriculture exercised a considerable influence i this country. It was a
body similar in its set-up to the federation
which waa represented before the government
last week. I can well remember the approach
that was made by the dairy interesta to the
council of agriculture at the time of the discussion on oleomargarine in the other bouse,
to which the senator from Waterloo (Hon.
63268-9

1

Mr. Euler) has referred, and I can remember
too the refusai of that body to support the
dlaims of the dairy industry at that time, on
the ground that its policy in the interest of
ail agriculture in Canada was unalterably
opposed to special privilege of any kind. The
policy of organized agriculture 'then was expressed briefly in the words: "No fears, no
favours." Apropos of that, I was pleased to
hear the remarks of the honourable senator
fromi Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) ycsterday,
because they showed that he had flot f orgotten the distinguished position he occupied
twenty-five years ago as the leader of organized agriculture and broad liberal thought in
this country.
I do not believe that the manufacture of
oleomargarine would do harm to the dairy
industry of Canada. As a mnatter of fact,
indirectly I think it would do gond.
As was pointed out yesterday, fluid milk is
the basic prôduet of dairying. Butter does not
by'any means represent the fruitful source
of profit to the farmer that some people may
imaginé. We have very large manufacturing*
and distributing concerns intervening 'between
the producer and the consumer of butter. The
place of the creamery butter factory in the
daîrying industry is a very important factor
in this whole question. The demanda of
expanding urban industry in the manufacturing centres of Canada will influence greatly
the character of the output from the dairy
industry and the profit for the dairy farmer.
If the working man's family in a factory town
can effect an economy at a time like this
by buying oleomargarine, an economic benefit
wiil resuit from the consumption of dairy
products in other forms, such as pure milk and,
ice cream. I think the important thing is to
see to it that every reasonable chance is
given to that local industrial community to
survive and expand, and thereby stimulate
ail branches of our economy.
"Expanding economy" is a phrase that
many of us have hecome accustomed to in
recent years. We have been told that the
only. way in which Canada and the other
great producîng countries of the world can
maintain the economie and financial position
into which the war bas placed them is by
maintaining an "expanding economy". This
bas heen expressed in terms of full production,
full empinyment, and maintenance of a sufficient national income to provide a proper
standard of living for every person willing to
work. I tbink-and if I am mistaken I am
sure the honourable leader in this aide ývil
correct me-that the last general election was
fought and won on that sort of polîcy.

SENATE

There are many other aspects of this question which I should like to discuss, but time
will not permit me to do so. I will conclude
by naking this appeal: If the reasoning is
sound and these facts are as stated, let us adopt
a positive and constructive attitude of mind
towards our problems of production and trade,
and not a negative and isolationist point of
view.
Hon. JOHN P. HOWDEN: Honourable
senators, I would crave your indulgence for a
moment or two while I clear my conscience in
regard to this motion. As a matter of fact, I
am very happy indeed to be able to support it,
ind as a medical doctor and a legislator I
would feel that I was failing in a moral obligation if I did not give my reasons for taking
his stand.
As to the desirability of and the objections
to adopting this motion, I would consider the
subject from two standpoints. First, what harm
'ould oleomargarine possibly do to tfie people
of this country? Second, what harm could it
do to the dairv industry? There seems to be
an idea abroad that oleomargarine is almost
entirely a vegetable product. Actually, the
basis of oleomargarine is oleo oil, which is made
from beef fat after the undesirable and insoluble fats and other fats of low melting temperature have been removed. Oleo oil is mixed
with a portion of lard, and then perhaps,
though not necessarily, with fats from coco-nut,
cottonseed, peanut and soya bean oils. But
tons of oleomargarine have been made, distributed and sold without any of this vegetable
content at all, and if it were not for the basis
of these beef fats on which the product is built,
it could not be built at all. As a matter of
fact, oleomargarine is beef fat, and butter is
beef fat. There is no doubt about the superiority of a pound of butter and its greater acceptability from the standpoint of health, but
the two fats as presented to the public are
identical. I have tasted oleomargarine and believe it to be as palatable as butter. Honourable
senators probably know that the early pioncer
settlers were in the habit of using a mitture
of beef and pork drippings instead of butter.
Oleomargarine must have originated from that
very composition. There is no question that
it is a healthful food; no harm can come from
its use, and there is no shortage of the basic
products. It is not even necessary to use
vegetable oils as a base, because oleomargarine
can be made from beef and pork lard.
At the present time, whether one has
coupons or not, butter is unobtainable. There
is no good reason in the world why the peotple
of this country should be deprived of oleoHan. Mr. LAMBERT.

margine. The consumption of oleomargarine
by the people of the United States is equal
to one-fifth of their consumption of butter.
Surely this is proof that it is a healthful and
desirable product, and harmful to no one.
I cannot speak for the dairy farmers of
eastern or of western Canada, but. I know
something about conditions in central Canada.
Whole milk is in great demand, but it must
corne fron premises that are inspected and
passed upon by the Board of Health. They
must be thirty-six feet wide, with hard floors
and proper gutters, and must be properly
ventilated, and lighted. It is only from such
buildings that milk can be distributed to the
public. Hundreds of farmers throughout the
country without such buildings can ship cream.
I have a small milking herd myself, and in
view of the demand for milk I believe
there is no more likelihood of this bill endangering the dairy industry than there is of
the water in our rivers flowing upstream. Since
oleomargarine is badly needed and can do the
people no harm, and as the dairymen will not
suffer, we as Canadians demand our freedom
to purchase it.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. HOWDEN:
It seems to me
tlhere is no question in the minds of the
majority of the Canadian people as to the
desirability of removing the ban from oleomargarine.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Aseltine the debate
was adjourned.
DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL AFFAIRS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 6, an Act to amend the
Department of External Affairs Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to repeal section 3 of the
Department of External Affairs Act, which
was passed in 1912 by the administration of
Sir Robert Borden. Section 3 provides that:
The member of the King's Privy Couneil for
Canada holding the recoanized position of First

Minister shall be the Secretary of State for
External Affairs-

As it stands, this section constitutes a
statutory requirement that no one but the
Prime Minister shall be Secretary of State for
External Affairs. The present bill would remove this limitation and make it possible for
some other person to occupy the position, The
effect of the present bill will be to place the
Department of External Affairs in precisely

APRIL 4, 1946
the samne position as the other departmnents of
the government in respect of which there
is no requirement that any particular person
must occupy the position of minister. That
is ail there is to the bill.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Ma.y I ask the honourable senàtor a question? We know, for instance,
that the 'Department of Transport is presided
over by the Minister of Transport,, and the
Departmnent of Fisheries by the Minister of
Fisheries; but we do flot know 'who will preside over the Department of External Affairs.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The explanation
seems 'to be a simple one. The Secretary, of
State presides over the Department of Extentlai Affairs as dûes the Mînister of Fisheries
in the case of the Department of M.isheries.
The act provided that the Secretary of State
must be the First Minister. Under this bill
the Secretary of State may be the First
Minister or any other person.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I understand it now,
and I beg the honourabie leader's pardon.
The motion was agreed to and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON : With leave of the
Senate I move the third readiing now.

and report to the House its findings, and to that
end have power to call and examine witnesses
and keep a record of its proceedings.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I think the subject
matter of this motion is very important, but
I would again ask the house to give consideration to the suggestion I made yesterday that before the motion is adopted we
should take into account the timing of the
work ahead of us. I would repeat what I
then said, that as soon as the Senate reassembles after the Easter recess I should like to
confer with the chairmen of the various'committees on their respective programmes, so
that we may lay out our work in such a way
as to cause as little inconvenience as possible.
Of course, this is a matter for the Senate
itself to decide.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: In view of what the
honourable leader has said, 1 move adjournment of the debate.

SPEECH FROM THE THRRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY

ÀDOPTED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, April 2,
the consideration. of Mis Excellency the Governor General's Speech at the opening of the
session, and the motion of Hon. Mr. Hurtubise
for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
,Honourable senators in closing the debate on
the Address in reply ta the Speech from the
Throne, I desire to compliment the members
who have spoen in the interval since I followed the honourable leader opposite, for the
high calibre of their speeches, reflected an
extensive knowledge of the aif airs of this
country. 1 hope that ta an increasing degree
the Senate 'will have the benefit of the long
experience of these honourable gentlemen in
matters which are of great importance ta
Canada.
First, may I refer ta two specific questions
brought up during the debate, and which 1
think are of considerable public importance.
The honourable gentleman from West Central
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine'), asked for
information concerning air mail services.
Honourable senators wîll recaîl that hie referred ta the lapse of time between the posting of mail in Barrie, Ontario, and its delivery
in Kamloops, British Columbia.
In replying to the honourable senator, 1
may say that in the absence of more specifie
information as to date, place, and time of
mailing, a complete inquiry into the incident
is of course impossible. However, generally
speaking, provided ail plane and train connections are made, it should ho possible for
air mail ]eavîng Barrie on the 4.19 p.m. train
ta, be delivered in Kamloops the second day
after mailing. If the honourable senator will
be kind enough ta submit the caver of the
item in question, which hoe says took six days
in transit, the delay will be thoroughly investigated.
The second point raised concerned air mail
separat ion. Generally speaking, air mail is
given prior handling throughout the service,
and for this reason specially identified bundles
of air mail are made up. I arn assured that
air mail for T.C.A. Flight No. 7, -leaving
Ottawa Airport at 10.10 p.m., closes in the
Senate Post Office at 7.40 p.m. Therefore
anything mailed between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m.,

115

as stated, would invariably be dispatched on
Flight No. 7 that evening. Such air mail is
tied out under an air mail label on top of the
surface mail, and is taken to the air mail
section immediately the bags are opened ini
the Ottawa Post Office, thus removing any
possibiity of air mail entering the surface
mail stream. Here again the absence of covers is a handicap ini determining responsibility for delay.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I may say that I
have supplied the Postmaster General with
envelopes to prove 'part of my case. I have
flot heard from him yet.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn speaking
only in the general sense. In connectian with
the air mail service between cities, which is
superior to the service ta. off-line points, I
may say that the slightest delay of either
plane or train--due usually to weather conditions--could result in the missing of close
éonnections, and thus cause one day's delay,
especially when infrequent train service is
involved.
The*honourable senator from West Central
Saskatchewan also asked me to, secure what
information I could concerming the export of
butter from Canada to the British West
Indies. I may say that for many years Canada has exported relatively small quantities
of butter ta the British West Indies, but has
always had a small outlet ia that market. In
1940 and 1941, at the request of the British
Ministry o'f Food, Canada, undertook ta meet
the essential requirements of the British West
Indies in order to allow the entire exportable
surpluses of Australia and New Zealand ta be
shipped ta the United Kingdom. This
arrangement was in the mutual interest of
ail concerned, and also effected an appreciable saving in shipping space.
Between that time and the present, the
exports of butter ta the British West Indies
have been as fallaws:
.pounds
670.100
In 1941....... .............
262.500
1942 ......................
1,212.700
1943.....................
3,766.000
1944.....................
4,471.500
1945.....................
The total allocations to the British West
Indies for the first six months of 1946 are
2,404,640 pounds, but I arn advised that during the first three months of this year shipments of Canadian butter have been eut back
by 40,per cent. The total January and February shipments, ta which I presumne my honourable friend referred, were 514,800 pounds.
Apparently the reason for exporting this
butter is that Canada was thereby fulfilling
an agreement that she made with the goveru-

116

SENATE

ments of Great Britain and the West Indies.
The details of every such arrangement are
regularly reported to the Combined Food
Board.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: One reason is that there
have been a number of our troops in the
West Indies.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: They are ail back now.
Hlon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In addition to
these shipments to the British West Indies
there have been axports to the United Kingdom. In 1943 we sent that country 7 million
pounds to meet an emergency; but other
than that, the shipments have been relatively
small, about one million pounds a year, I
think.
I should like to make some reference now to
two matters that have been discussed in the
debate on the Address, namely, the wheat
acreaga and the effect of controls on reconversion and unemployment. I do flot need to
say to bonourable senators that I have a very
limited knowledge on the subject of wbeat
acreage.
Nevertbaless, I tbink it is my
duty to make a few comments, hased on such
information as I have been able to, obtain.
I sbould .iudge that the total area of land in
western Canada that is the sub.ject of controversy is 60 to 65 million acres. For several years now an annual Dominion-Provincial
Conference on Agriculture has mapped out a
programme for the year ahead. That programme, of course, is not a compulsory one; I
take it to be merely an indication to those concerned of what, in the combinad judgment
of the members of the confarence, is the best
tbing to do. Last December, I understand,
the conference racommended that approximately 24 million acres of land should be
planted in wheat this year-that is, about
1,500,000 acres more than last year. As there
would likely be about 20 million acres in grass
and coarse grains, the area left in summerfallow would be about 19 million acres. The
recommendation of the conference was concurred in by the federal government, which
in turn bas made recommandations accordingly.
My bonourable friend from West Central
Saskatchewan pointed out tbat for oe reason or another tbere bas bean in recent yaars
9, marked increase in tbe ratio of summerfallow land to wheat acreage. As to the
actual percentage and the desirability of it,
opinions vary. Apparently the conference
felt that this year there sbould ha from 70 to
80 per cent as much land in summer-fallow
as in wheat. I noticed that the Ministar of
Agriculture, expressing bis parsonal viaw, said
hae felt a desirable year-in-and-year-out plan
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

would be to sow one-third of the total of 60
to 65 million acres in wbeat and one-third in
coarse grass and coarse grains, and to summer-fallow the remaining third. -I taka tbe
viawpoint of the Leader of the -Opposition,
the Honourable Mr. Brackan, to ha that mnasmucb 'as othar countries, notahly the United
States, are definitaly increasing their wbeat
acreage in order to meat the prasant
amergancy, we sbould reduce our proposed
summer-fallow area, by 3 million aces, so
as to bave a total of about 27 million acres
in wheat. On the other band, I understand
the bonourable sanator from West Central
Saskatchewan feels it migbt ha possible to
take 7 million acres out of summer-fallow and
sow 30 million acres to wheat. I mention
these figures only by way of illustrating tbe
differences of opinion on the subjeet.
0f course I amn not in n position to discuss
the technical question of the proper ratio of
summer-fallow te, whent acreage. .There is.
however, one thing I want to point out. The
Minister of Agriculture is criticized bv bonourable members opposite, and in anotber place.
not because hie does not order a decreasc of
summer-fallow area-for of course ho bas no
power to do that-but because lie does net
recommcnd it. As I sec itý~and if I arn
wrong bonourable senators will correct methe question of bow much or bow little land
should bo sown to wbeat and how muchi or
how little sb'-rld ho summer-fallowed is, after
ail, a matter for tbe judgment of the individual faiýmer.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Hear. hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think, hionourable senators, that those who are criticizing
the Minister of Agriculture for not making

a recommendation

are

unwittingly

paving

bim a bigh compliment, for surely no western
farmer would be guided hy other than bis
own judgment as to bow mucb of bis land
should be in summer-fnllow unless lie felt
that the .iudgment of someone else was better.
I can imagine that some producers, knowing
of Mr. Brncken's long experience in agriculture, would take bis advice. And I arn
confident that those living in tlie saine district
as thle bonourable senator from West Central
Sa-skatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), wlho know
him as well ns or bettet' than we do and are
familiar with the siza and success of- his
operations, would certainly attacb a great
deal of weigbt to wbat hae said. I also feel
sure that wvhen the time cornes for my
honourable friend te make a decision witb
respect to bis own land he will exercise and

rely upon bis personal .iudgment, despite whiat

the Minister of Agriculture, the Leader of the

117

APRIL 5, 1946
Opposition or anyone else may Bay. I emphasize that point, honourable senators, because
some people seem to, be under the misapprehension that the government can make .an
order specifying the proportion of a farmer's
land that shaHl be planted in wheat.
I think that over a period of time the policy
of the Dominion-Provincial Conference on
Agriculture has ini the main commended itself
to the great mass of our farmers, and has indeed been almost always along the limes
retommended by the Minister of Agriculture.
Speaking as a layman in regard to agriculture,
I must say that the growing tendency in
western Canada to increase the amnount of
summer-fallow in relation to the acreage sown
to wheat seems to have brought very satisýfactory returus. -How much or how little that
policy should be departed from in this
emergency I arn not in a position to, say, but
I do know that the Minister of Agriculture
takes the view that the present dema.nd for
wheat was not entirely unexpected. It may
have been -accelerated by this or that circumstance, but since 1939 or 1940 there has been a
balanced programme which, I submit, appears to have 'brought very successful results.
This policy is concisely laid down in two
telegrams whieh passed recently between the
,Minister of Agriculture for Saskatchewan and
the federal minister. Mr. I. C. Nollett, the
provincial Minister of Agriculture, sent this
message to Mr. Gardiner on March 13, 1946:
Note meeting Combined Food B3oard Washington 14th.
-perhaps 1lebruaryGrowing pressure here for alI-out food production to, meet world needs. We suggest each
farmer produce to maximum consistent with
good f arm practice. Your reacion to above
suogestion appreciated.
This is Mr. Gardiner's reply of the same
date:
Re telegram. Dominion Department of Agriculture acting on advice f roui the DominionProvincial Conference has been advising f armers
across Canada each December since 1939 how
to produce to, maximum consistent with good
farmn practice. Following this plan we encouraged increase livestock production until 1944.
In September, 1943, vwe began encouraging wheat
production by increasing advance of 90 cents to
$1.25 a bushel. This was doue in anticipation
of the present situa~tion and was so stated at
the time. We have continued in this policy 'n
spite of criticism of reduced ho g production until
wheat acreage bas increased by seven million
acres. We are nowi considering three and five
year agreements with Brtiain which necessitate
production of other f armu commodities as well
as wheat. We consider that following the recoinmendations of last December will resuit in mîaximumi production consistent with good farm
practice.

1 submit, honourable senators, that whatever
differences of opinion there rnsy he at the
moment as to how much or how little wheat
acreage should be withdrawn for the purpose

of sumnier-fallow,

the Dominion-Pro>vin-cial

policy, presurnably concurred in by the Fed,
eral Minister of Agriculture, has bro.ught about
very beneficial resulte. -Iu support of this let
me quote the figures of average production in
Western Canada for two five-year periode,
1935-1939 and 1940-1944. These later years
cover the perîod when, to a greater or less
extent, ouir farmers were guided by the adwice
of the Dominion-Provincial Conference on
Agriculture. These figures represent the average
yearly production of the commrodities set out
in the statement:
1940-1944
1935-1939
426,000,000
312,000,000
Wheat (bushels)
464,000,000

Cheese (pounds) .

254,000,000
119,922,000

289,000,000
168,650,000

When it is borne in mind that the yea.rs
from 1940 to 1944 cover a period when our
agricul-tural communities were handicapped by
a great shortage of labour and modern equipment, these figures reflect great crediit on the
farmers of this eoun.try, and indicate that the
general policy was eminently satisfactory' in.
stimulating farmi production in Western
Canada.
But let me deal with another angle. How
bas that policy affeeted the fortunes of t$he
individual farmer? I desire to put on record
an article which 1 read in the Financial Post of
March 30th 'this year. I think it is significant
if we compare the position we are in today
with the position we were in af ter World War I.
This is the article:
Farm Debt of Prairies Cut Over Quarter in 1945
One of the most significant; sets of figures to
reacli the investor this week came from Dominion Mortgage and Investments Association.
It shows a striking improvement lu the finances
of western farmers. Not only does this presage
a healthier condition for western mortgages, but
it reveals a stroug basis for good sales of f arm
equipment and other goods to the f armer.
In 1945 f armers lu the three prairie provinces reduced their mortgages and agreement for
sale dehts by $23-3 millions or 26-1 per cent
based on experience of thirty if e insurance,
trust and boan companies which have such iuvestments.
Payments of mortgage principal and interest
in this area, were lower in 1945 tlian in 1944
when payments totalled $40-6 millions. This
was expected because of the lower faim cash
income and hecause the amount owing lu 1945
was substantially less than lu 1944..

118

SENATE

The total amount owing to these thirty companies is as follows:
($ millions)
1945 1944 1937
Manitoba...................9-7
13-0 29-6
Saskatchewan.............. 42-6 57-3 99-4
Alberta ................... 13-7 19-1 39-7
66-0 89-4 168-7
This table reveals that the total amiount
owing lias been cut 60 per cent since the end
of 1937. In Manitoba the decrcase since the
end of 1937 is 67 per cent; in Saskatchewan
57 per cent; and in Alberta 65 per cent.
During the past ciglit years the number of
farmers in the prairie provinces who own their
f arms entirely free of deht lias increased very
materially, the report states. At 'the end of
1945 there were 26,751 farmers in debt to these
thirty companies-a reduction of 6,339 f3ince
1944 and over 50 per cent less than at the end
of 1937.
The report also reveals that these coînpanles
sold 2,552 parcels of farm real estate in 1945
reducing their holdings to the lowest point in
many years. Aggregate sale price was .$8,680,370. Ail cash was received for 943 properties
and, on the remaining $3-8 millions was stili
owing at December 31, 1945.
Honourable senators, I suggest Ihat whatever
difference of opinion there may be as to the
amount of land to be converted from summerfallow to wheat, there can be nu doubt that
the recominendations of the Dominion-Provincial ýConference; have operated lu the benefit
of the country as a whole and have produced
eîninently successful financial returns. While
there are still questions to be decided, I
believe that the industry'and intelligence displayed by our western farmers during the last
five years wvill continue. f believe also that
',ie decision as to whether they will plant
more wheat or less wheat will depend-as it
wvill in the outstanding case of the honourable
senalor from W/est Central Saskatchewanupon individual judgmenl.
An Hon. SENATOR:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I wishi now to,
say a few words regarding the question of
reconversion and the effect upon il of controls.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig), lias taken the general attitude that contî'ols, especially rent controls snd certain others,
have had a very det.rimental effect on reconversion. Tlîat is a view slînred by many
but its accuracy une way or the other is
difficult of proof.
At a meeting recently held outside of
parliament, the leader of the ProgressiveConservative party advocated the immediate
and entirc. removal of controls on prices of
agricultural products and the rapid removal
of certain other controls.
The implication
is, lionourable sens tors, that reconversion canIlon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

not be sffected until controls are remnoved.
In my official capacity I believe I should say
something on tbis very important subject.
The guvernment's statements emphasized
the fact that the price control administration,
undcr government policy, is determined to
reeugnize the need for adjusting prices upwards
wherever establishcd ceiling prices are prejudicial lu production.
In a number of cases itlihas been found
necess;ary lu admit that, with the end of the
wvar, ceiling prices established in 1941-sud in
some instances adj usled upwards since Ihal
date-may be inappropriale today in view of
the accumulation of cost increases during the
war years. There were compensations in terras
of war production which made it possible for
firms tu continue selling aI basic period prices
in war lime. Now Ihat Iliese compensations
have dinmished, tlie Wartime Prices and
Trade Board is engaged in a review of applications for price increases, and price increases
have been authorized in lumber, in iron and
steel, and in pulp and paper producîs other
Ilian newsprint, lu give tliree examples, in
order to avoid any marked deterioration in
the position of these industries under price
ceilings and lu ensure tlîal price ceilings will
not retard production. In the recent Past
lirice increcases have been granted on various
building materials. particularly cast iron soil
p)ipe and bricks, so as lu, stimulate acîditional
prloduction in these areas. Obviuly the
hoard must take aIl precautions lu see that
prices do nul get ouI of lîand, because the
increase in, say, the cost of construction, is
already giving rise lu complaint on the part
of prospective lîomc-owners.
The problem is to steer a course betwcen
undue rigidity on the une Lîand and virtually
nu control at aIl on the other. An indîvidual
manufacturer ean lruly say Ihat lie could
incresse his output if the price ceiling on
lus produet wvas substanlially raiscd or entirely
removed. To increase his output lie would
pny mure for labour and materials, therehy
obtnining tlîem aI the expense of ollier industries. The increase of supply teu une industry
would be achieved at tlie cost of a decline
of supply lu olliers. Tlîe restilt wouîld be Ihat
Ihese other industries would Ihen have difficulty in production, and Iliere would be
further requests for price increases. This is
the course Ihat inflation always lakes.
Evidence Ihal production is increasing eau
be fouud ahl around us. In 1945 the number
uf dwelliugs built was about 45,009-almost
an ahl-lime record. Relail sales, which are
an indication of recent levels of production,
are higher loday tban ever before. For
example, total relail sales in January, 1946,

APRIL 5, 1946
were 12 per cent higlier than in January,
1945. Furniture sales are 50 per cent aboie
the sales of a year ago; hardware sales are
up 33 per cent; radio and electrical store sales,
48 per cent; and clotliing sales, from 10 to
15 per cent. These seem to indicÈte that
reconversion is proceeding rapidly and that
production is not being impeded by price
ceilings.
While Canada's wartîme production of steel
was double lier peacetime output, she is producing today more steel tlian at any time
during the war-this in spite of tlie price
ceiling. It is true that there lias been a
recent upward adjustment of the price; but
1 would point out that the production increase
took place before the price ceiling was raised.
Lumber production lias been subject to very
heavy controls, as my honourable friend from
Northumberland (Hon. Mr. Burchill) knows.
Yet it is estimated tliat tlie production of
lumber this year will reacli the ail-time high
of over 5,000,000,000 feet. Surery there is no
foundation for the suggestion-of the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) that
because under the price ceiling someone did
flot get as mucli for lis lumber as lie otherwise would have received, production lias
heen adversely affected. It is inevitable that
in certain cases tliere sliould lie some liardshîp. In sucli instances tlie board contemplates adjustment; but this is far removed
from. tlirowîng tlie control. doors wide open.
If Canada can survive the present period
witliout suffering the,. terrific consequences
whicli followed tlie first Great War, price
control will have been one of lier greatest
accomplisliments.
The lionourable leader opposite said a day
or two ago that the action of tlie Department
of Reconstruction in autliorizing municipalities to refuse building permits was a sign tliat
tlie department liad liung out the white flag.
Sucli a deduction, I suggest, is far from being
nccurate. There is an unparalleled back-log
of requests for buildings of every conceivable
nature. Despite the fact that steel production
is greater than it was in wartime, and that
more lumber is being produced tlian at any
otlier time in our liistory, it will lie iabsolutely
impossible to even begin to meet tlie demand
for these materials for building purposes.
It cornes then to a question of priority.
There are two ways in wliicli this problem.
can be handled., Eitlier the autliority to deal
witli individual cases can be left witli the
department in Ottawa, or it can lie given
to the municipalities. The job of the department will lie to allocate existing building
materials to the respective communities as
fairly as possible, and to stimulate additional
63268-10

production. Then it will be for the municipality-whetlier it be Winnipeg, St. John,
Halifax or Rosetown-to consider the needs
of the community and decide between the
veteran and another person, orbetween the
churcli and the moving picture theatre. Honourable senators, such a plan, I suggest, is
only plain, common sense, and it lias the
virtue of facilitating decentralization, something whici lias been advocated 'by honourable senators on more than one occasion.
Now may I deal briefly with the problem
of unemployment? The statement made by
the honourable leader opposite that unemployment is rampant in this country is misleading and an exaggeration. The employment
situation is infinitely better than even the
most optimistic had dared to hope for. May
1 remind honourable senators th-at on June
lst, 1944, there were 784,000 Canadians in the
armed forces, and 1,055,000 directly engaged
in war industries. In other words, more than
1,800,000 Canadians were deriving their incorne from war expenditures-and their occupations would end with the war.
Between V-E and V-J day 800,000 men and
women were returned to private industry by
reason of cut-backs in war contracts. There
was a very common impression abroad that
the Japanese war would last for a year or two
at least after V-E day, and it was suggested
that it wôuld act as a sort of cushion while
we proceeded with an orderly reabsorption.
of the members of our armed forces into civil
111e. IJnexpectedly, but fortunately, that war
ended a few months after V-E Day, and the
repatriation prohlem that faced us was much
greater than had heen anticipated.
There is another thing that we sliould bear
in mind, honourable senators. Through a
icombination of special circumstances there
became availa(ble to us a great deal more
shipping space 'than we had expected to have,
and so the return of our 'boys aod girls from
overseas was expedited to a degree that even
the most optimistic of us had flot dared to
hope for. Their demobilization has' been
carried. out witli commendable rapidity and
efficiency.
In the relatively short time since the end
of the war in Europ~e almost two million people
have been returneL to civil if e and industry.
I suggest to you, honourable senators, if a year
ago anyone had forecast that by the end of
February, 1946, not only would the war with
Japan be over and, our repatriation programme
almost cornpleted, but that the number of
unplaced applicants registered at our employment offices would total only 263,000, most of
us would have felt that lie was indudlging in
hopes that could not be realizedý. This number

EMVBE»UDMTOI<

120

SENATE

of unplaced applicants is less than 6 per cent
of our civilian labour force of about 4,750,000.
And if must be remnembered that because of
the operation of the Unemployment Insurance
Acf, the iist of unplaced persoos contains many
namfies which wouid not have been included
under the standards prevaiiing a few years
ago. In, the United Kingdomn, whose experien-ce with unemployment insurance is far
greator than ours, and in the United States,
many authorities consider there is fuil employment when the numýber of unemiployed persoo.s
is betwen 4 and 8 per cent. Because of seasonal
conditons in this country there is aiways unemployment during January, Fobruary and
March. Even when wartime iodustry was at
its peak, there were always 75,000 people who
for one reason or another couid flot be empioyed during fhis period of the year. I say
to this honourabie houso tlhat far from ridiculing and criticiziog, we should- be grateful to,
our people and ta Canadian industry, under
the leadership of the Honourablo Mr. Howe,
for ha'ving accomplishied such a magnificent
job in reconversion and ernploymcnt.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

ilear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In another place,
Mr. Howe said he feared that reconversion
was procceding even ton rapidiy and that a
serious labour shortage in the near future was
flot at ail unlikeiv.
1 want. te say a word. .particuiarly froni the
point of viow of the Maritime Provinces. in
regard to t he Dominion-Provincial
Conference. As honourable senators are aware, one
of the proposais which the federal goveroment bas made ta the provinces is that the
Dominion sbould have the exclusive righit to
the whoie field of persanai and corporation
taxes and succession duties, and that in return

it would pay

f0

the provinces increased

amounts towards the cost of varinus social
security moasures. In some quarters of Nova
Sentis and the other Maritime Provinces there
bas been a disposition to attack this proposai
on the ground that it would'iead to increased
centralization. Now, for the henefit of honourable senators who are nt fortunate ennugh to
have thoir domicile in Nova Scotia, I may
say thaf in fhat province "1centralizat ion" is
regardedl as an ugiy word. By tradition and
instinct I arn as much opposed to centralizatien as is anynne cisc in the Maritimes, but
I refmze ta ]et my judgment be influenced b
the mere sound of a word.
I will try to make. clear what I mean. As
we in the Maritimes sec if, t here are two types
of central ization. The first, of which I arn
heartily in favour, is the collection hy a
central aiîthority of such taxes as I have
-eferred to. and their eqijitahie distribuîtion
Hon. Mr. ROBEETSON.

throughout ail parts of Canada. The other
type, to, which I arn j*ust as heartily opposed,
is the ceotralization of iodustry and commercial activif y.
It is my belief that equaiity in living
standards in ail sections of Canada is a goal
at which we should persistently aim; but in
this respect I draw a distinction between two

classes in the community-those who cannot
work and those who cao. In the first class I

would put the children, the nid people and

those who are disabied through sickness;
and in the second class, those who cao work.
I unreservedly support the poiicy that would
make the living standards of the first ciass ta a
large degrec a federal responsibility. If family
allnwances, old age pensions and health insurance benefits werc distrihuted fairly ail over
Canada, the oid, the ýsick and the young in
Nova Scntis would be able to maintain as
highi living standards as the same kind of
people in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Quebec or
any atiier province. I suggest that the logical
and fair thing is ta have these social secuirity
ineasuros adminîstorod by the fedorai authority. If they arc adrninistered by the provinces,
the inrn itabie result will ho higher stàodards
of living for t he beneficiaries in Ontario and
Quebec.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: They wouid get
more than their share, as thoy aiways have.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

I think an in-

creasing number of peuple ini tIiose provinces
are coming ta roalize the desirabiiity of having
the social services administered exciusivcly by
the federal authority.
Now the probiem of creating equal opportunity throughout Canada for all who aie
able to work, can, i0 my judgment, ba solved
in on-ly one way. Unioss wo are preparcd ta
subseribe ta the idea nf state operation of ail
industry-and wc are not-we must admit,
îîarticuiariy we in the Maritimes, that it
wouid ho absolutoly impossible for the federai
goveroment ta dictate in what part of the
country any indristry muîst cstablish itsclf.
0f cour:ýe, under the plan of our C.C.F.
friends, the goveroment wouid have full
(barge of everything and ho able ta arder
industry about frcely. But in a country of
private enterprise, what the goveroment cao
do is to croate conditions wheroby no one will
ho piacod at an ecanoînie disadvantage by
establishing an industry in anc section rather
than in another. That is a policy I feel most
honourabie sonators believe in. And lot me
say to my honourable friends from the Maritime Provinces, particuiariy ta those from
Nova Scotia, that I am ns strongiy canvinced
as it is possible to ho that eonamie progress

APRIL 5, 1946
in the future will depend, not so mucli on
positive or direct assistance from. any goverfiment as upon the -creation of an equality of
conditions favourable ta industry.
If you tell me that ini the years that lie
ahead Canada and ail other countries wiil
tend ta develop economie nationalism and
self--sufficiency, then I say that'the Maritimes
wilI continue ta, be on the circumference of
a circle, aur industries will be faced witb
increasing difficulties, and we shall fot make
much progress. We may resort ta ail kinds
of schemes, but the cards wiil be stacked
against us. If we trade as littie as possible
with the outside world, Nova Scotia's position will flot be a happy one. I suggest ta you,
honourable senators, that the great hope for
the Maritimes and the whale country is that
aur trading area shall become as much larger
than the Dominion of Canada as we can possibly make it. If within a reasonable period
of time Canada, the United States and Great
Britain, and the other countries intimately
associated with them, would remove aIl
idiotie obstacles ta, freer international commerce and become anc big trading area, the
province of Nova Scotia would fia longer be
on the circumference of a circle, but in the
very centre.
Some Hon. SENATOTIS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The general
movement towards that great objective may
be far more rapid than we realize. Public
opinion in favour of the removal of barriers
ta, international trade is perhaps stronger
today than it ever was before in tbe lifetime
of any member of this chamber. Why, only a
day or two ago, a couple of my honourabie
colleagues whom I had always regarded as
stauncb protectionists-the honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) and
the honourabie gentleman from Aima (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne)-pleaded the cause of the
consumer in a way that almost moved me ta
tears.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I neyer had any
doubt as ta where the honourable senator fromn
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) stood, and any
fears that the bonourabie gentleman from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) had departed
fromn tbe faitb were entirely allayed by a
speech which made it clear that hie is as
solid as ever. I submit that we ougbt ta take
advantage of the widely prevailing free trade
sentiment in this house and, by means of a
resolution place ourseives on record, for
there is fia country on the face of the earth
that bas more ta gain fromn free trade than
63268-IOJ

121

Canada, eknd fia part of Canada would benefit
more in turn than the good aid province of
Nova Scotia.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: To me 'it was
amazing that Mr. Bracken should advoeate
the entire removai of price contrais on agricultural products. 0f course, everyone is
entitied to hîs opinion, but, reluctant as I
am ta set up my opinion agaixist bis, I think
hie is wrong. I would point out that if you
removed these particular contrais immediateiy
you might as weli sweep tbem ail away.
My honourable friend from West Central
Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) said that
hie thought the wbeat-grower was entitled ta,
the worid price today of about $2 a bushçl.
I thought hie was putting the case very
niodestly. Upon my word, if I were growing
80,000 busheis of wbeat I do not think I
would bave shown sucb restraint. But I do
nat think that even the farmîng communities want tbe price contraIs on their products
swept away. The delegation fromn the Canadian Federation of Agriculturç that interviewed the government recentiy did not ask
for tbat. There is a great difference between
asking for the removai of contrais and the
rectification of onc price compared with
another. For exampie, the delegation thought
tbe price of butter was out of line. The
honourable senator froin Saskatchewan Nortb
(Hon. Mr. Hoamer) said that the increase of
four cents a pound was toa littie and tao
late. That is a legitimate argument. But
ta say that because the world prîce is higher
tbe contrai on the doxmestic price sbouid be
withdrawn is a very seriaus proposai. If it
were acted on I would expect that the lumber
industry-witb wbicb my honaurabie friend
(Hon. Mr. Burchill) is sa weil acquaîntedwould eall attention ta the difference of fromn
six ta nine dollars a thousand feet between
the export and the domestie price of lumber,
and would want a free hand in fixing tbe
domestic price. We would bave ta face a
similar situation in regard ta fisheries.
Following on that there would be an
avalancbe of requests from labour. Immediateiy tbe whole price structure wbich we
have struggled ta control-successfully sa far,
though we have had ta back up a littie
under the pressure of circumstances--would
be swept away. I read the other day in. a
Winnipeg paper the report of a debate in
the Manitoba legislature on this specifie
subjeet of price contrais. The members,
mostly farmers, tbought it probable that with
Ril price controis removed there would be a
terrifie demand for wheat and the price
mighit go up to $3 a bushel, bot they boped

122

SENATE

this would not happen. I can understand
their point of view. They realize that there
would follow what happened after World
War I-wild, unbridled speculation, with all
the economic troubles that follow in its train.
Compare that sombre picture with the
picture of agriculture in the west today. It
is now almost a year since the war ended.
Look at the financial position of the farmers
of the west. Not only have they their
mortgage obligations paid off, but they have
subscribed freely to Victory loans and have
increased their bank deposits. I do net say
that our public men should refrain from
criticizing the administration-criticism is an
excellent thing-but to call for the lifting of
all price controls might lead to disastrous
consequences, to a wild orgy of speculation
leaving us all with fingers crossed waiting for
the inevitable crash and dreading the chaos
to follow. The higher a public man's position the greater the attention paid to his
opinions, and the more people listen to him
and agree with him the more difficult it is
te hold the line against inflation.
Canada is in a marvelous position today
and, honourable senators, we should be very
careful lest we jeopardize the national economy. Constructive criticism, yes; but do not
let us do anything that may create such a
condition as may bring about a financial crash
and sweep away the very foundations of our
economic system.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: We have too
great a future before us to warrant our taking
such awful risks. We have come through the
war with undiminished strength, indeed, with
greater strength both financially and industrially, and I believe we have never had better
reason to face the years ahead with full copfidence in the destiny of this great country.
I compliment my honourable friends on the
tone of their speeches during this debate,
their criticism has in the main been fair and
restrained, and I say to them: Let us have
faith, let us have courage, and let us never
for a moment doubt that, more than any
other country on the face of the world, Canada
is certain of a great, prosperous and a glorious
future.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have no right, honourable members, to speak at all, but now that
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

the honourable leader has concluded his remarks I want to raise a point of order. Under
the rules ho had no right te speak agairi this
afternoon. Having followed me in the early
stages of this debate he exhausted his right
to speak. I did not raise the point of order
at the outset because I wanted to hear his
very able speech, but I do so now to guard
against a similar breach in future. In the
debate on the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne no member bas the right
to speak twice; only when a member introduces a bill or a resolution is he entitled to
close the debate.
I am not raising this point of order as a
mere technicality. If we allow the practice to
continue we shall get back to the condition
prevalent when the leader of the government
was the late Senator Dan'durand, and the leader
on this side Senator Meighen. In nearly every
debate they used to speak three or four times.
This was absolutely against the rules and resulted in there being nothing left for the rest
of us to discuss. In a word, the debate developed into a fight between the two honourable gentlemen. I do net pretend to be in
their class. I think the proceedings of any
chamber run along much better when the
leaders are not too good and some of the rank
and file are maybe a little better than their
leaders.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When the
honourable leader adjourned the debate he
intimated that he would speak at a later stage,
and the Senate gave consent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am net questioning that.
The minute he moved the adijournment I
could have objected. I was not misled, but I
do not want the practice repeated.
The Address was adopted.
THE GOVERNOR GENERAL ELECT
RECEPTION AT HALIFAX

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, with
the permission of the lieuse, I want to congratulate the honourable leader of the government on having been appointed to meet the
new Governor General on his arrival at
Halifax. I think it is a great honour to the
Senate, and I am sure we all appreciate it
very much indeed.

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, April
4, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. COPP.

Hon. Mr. Euler for the second reading of
Bill G, an Act to amend the Dairy Industry

Act.

Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable
senators, my remarks in this debate will
naturally be brief, because I do not pose as
a dairy expert. In fact, on the land in
Saskatchewan in which I am interested the
men have only enough cattle to supply the
butter and milk they need, and a few chickens
and hogs and that kind of thing. They are
more or less self-supporting on the farm, but
they do not go in for dairying on a large
scale.
I suppose the reason for the introduction
of this bill is the present great shortage of
butter in Canada, or at any rate in certain
parts of Canada. When I left the west for
Ottawa I did not realize there was such a
shortage, since in Saskatchewan we have
nearly always been able to buy all the butter
for which we had valid coupons. Occasionally
there might be a day when a store would
have no butter, but next day its stock would
be ample. That state of affairs is probably
due to the fact that in our province we have
few cheese factories and no great outlet for
raw milk. Any farmers who do a dairy
business separate the cream from the milk
and ship the cream to creameries, where it is
made into butter, which is then distributed
throughout the province. At all times we
have had plenty of butter and meat, and have
often wondered why it was necessary to ration
these products in the rest of Canada. However, upon my arrival in Ottawa I found the
situation here to be entirely different. In
the parliamentary restaurant, for several days
a week, there is no butter at all, and when
any is served we get only a very small
portion.
When this bill was introduced, I felt it
would be advisable to try to obtain a few
concrete facts with regard to the butter situation in Ontario, so a week ago last Saturday
I accepted the invitation of a friend to drive
with him in his car through one of the finest
dairy districts in eastern Ontario. We spent
the whole afternoon visiting in and around
Winchester, Morrisburg and Cornwall, stopping at farms, stores and other places to find
out the real cause of the shortage, and we
had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion
that the farmers in that part of the province
were not making butter any more.
One farmer told us that he was no longer
making butter because when he did make it
he could only sell it to the merchant in town.
That is, he had to sell it through the usual
avenues of trade. He gave as a further reason
the fact that whole milk gives him a return

SAPRIL 10, 1946
equal to 61 cents per pound of butterfat,
wliereas fromn butter at the going price,
which was then 40 cents a pound, lie could
flot get any such a return. He also stated
that even an increase in the price of four
cents a pound would flot resuit in any more
butter being produced, it being much more
profitable to seil the milk. The milk therefore
was sent to dainies and cheese factories instead
of being separated and made into butter on
the farm.
At the first store where we called,' the
manager informed us that during the last
month hie had had only one pound of butter
for sale, and lie showed us lis invoice to that
effect. The other stores had no butter at ail.
One big store in Morrisburg had flot had any
butter for sale for ten days. In this store we
met a woman who had flot had any butter for
herseif and lier chiîdren for six weeks. Since
that time a lady in Morrisburg lias written
me to say that if we liad gone to lier store
slie could liave supplied us with a pound of
butter. We did flot find tliat -particular store;
in fact we were sa discouraged by the negative results at so many other stores that we
did flot make any further calîs.
We were told tliat when the farmner takes
lis milk to the dheese factory or to the dairy
hie is paid about $3 a hundred pounds. We
were alsa told tliat tlie milk was being sliipped
ta the large centres, .particularly Montreal,
and tliat inuch more milk was being consumed
in tlie large centres in recent montîs than
previously because there was more money in
circulation and people were drinking mucli
more milk: for example, the ordinary family
tliat purchased a quart or two a day was now
purdliasing tliree or four quarts. Consequen-tly
the milk was not kbeing made into butter or
cheese.
Not being sâtisfied with our trip into tlie
Wincliester district, last Saturday we decided
to go across the Ottawa river into Quebec.
So we drove to Buckingham, and mucli to my
surprise we found plenty of butter. I do not
mean to say that we bought butter at every
store, but in only one were we turned down.
We also called at creameries and found people
buying butter riglit over the counter. We lad
a very interestîng talk with some farmers who
happened to be in ane creamery, and also witli
tlie manager. Fromn thema I obtained certain
facts that may be of interest ta honourable
members. For instance, butter madle in Buckingliam district is shipped ta Ottawa and Hull,
whereas milk is sliipped, froin Ottawa to be
used in Buckingham. We were told, whether
it is the explanation or not, that tliis situation
exists because the farmers ini tliat district~

125

being unable to erect large barns with cernent
floors, proper drainage and otlier sanitary
facilities, as do the big farmers in Ontaro~
cannot get licences to ssIi their wliols milk,
and tlierefore are obliged to separate it and
take the crsam to tlie creameries to be macle
into butter. Tliat is wliy there is so mucli
more butter available in that district than
elsewliere.
We were also told tliat tlie farmers wcre
going broke because for tlieir creai tliey
wsre flot getting as much in proportion as the
Ontario farmers wers getting for raw milk.
Furtlier, we learned that they received 39 cents
a pound for butterfat, plus a 10 cent bonus,
the equivalent of $1.96 per lundred pounds
for raw milk. To this figure should be added
75 cents per hundrsd-the value of the skim
milk fed on the farm ta calves and hogs whidh
would make the total price ta the farmner $2.71
per liundred pounds. The net result shows
that the Ontario farmner receives for lis milk
from 30 ta 33 cents per hundrsd pounds more
than does the Buckingham farmner. Wlien
we asked wliat tlie solution was, we were tald
that butter, ta make its production profitable,
would have ta sell at 50 cents per pound.
That would mean an increase of 32 cents per
hiundred pounds for raw milk, or a total
rsturn of $3.03 per hundred. This is tlie
price received in Ontario. The equivalent
price of butter fat ta the Buckingham fariner
would then be 61 cents.
We came away froin Buckingliam with aur
minds made up that tlie wliole butter situation should be completely surveyed and
changed considerahly hy the gavernment of
Canada. We were satisfied that an increase
of four cents per pound would not remedy tlie
situation. If more butter is ta be made the
fariner maust obtain more for lis creain.
'We learned that during the last year 250
dairy cows from the district liad been sold
for expert ta the United States of America.
If those cows lad nat been sold each one of
them would have produced 200 pounda of
butter.
Bon. Mr. BORNER: Ta wlat district are
yau referring?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It is a small district,
extending for ten or fifteen miles araund
Buckingham. During the ysar those cows
woul have praducsd 50,000 paunda of butter.
I have been told that tliroughout tlie province
of Quebec and in many districts in the province
of Ontario we are losing many of aur bsst
dairy cattîs tlrough export. As a result we
are suffcring froin a decrease in ths production of milk and creain and a cantinuing
shortage of butter.

126

SENATE

We were informed the butter situation
would not be normal for a matter of two
years, and that even then, because of the
reduction in the number of cows and the
scarcity of feed, there might not be as much
butter available as tbere was a few years ago.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
the scarcity of labour.

There is also

lion. Mr. HOWARD:

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is that an accurate statement of the over-aIl situation-that there are
not as rnany milcb cows in Canada today as
there weie a few years ago?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I cannot prove the
statement.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The honourable gentleman
lias said that because dairy cows are being
exported we cannot expeet a greater quantity
of butter to be available. We bave been exporting dairy cows for a long time. Is the
situation to whicb rny bonourable friend refers
peculiar to Ontario and Quebec? Are there no
dairy cows being exported from the prairie
provinces?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I do not think tbey
are being exported from western Canada.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Tbey are being sbippcd
from Britisb Columbia.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: These cattle are
being sold at prices as high as $125 or $150
eacb. That is only one reason wby butter
will continue to be in short supply.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I tbink what
the honourable senator bias said about the
export of cattle is quite true. I know of one
farm. not more than 20 miles frorn Montreal
where the entire herd was sold to Un-ited
States buyers at from $200 to $250 apiece.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is that a pure bred herd?
Hon. Mr. BAUiLANTYNE:

Yes, Hoîsteins.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The export of dairy
cattle. the increased consumaption of rnihk in
the large centres, and the bigher price for raw
milk are three things that bave interfered witb
the production of butter on a large scahe. We
have been told that the number of dairy eattle
will not increase because of the feed situation.
The federal governrnent bias paid a bonus on
most of the feed coming fromn western Canada.
Sorne of the prices of western feed are as
fohlows: bran, $28 per ton.; oats, $40; ýbarley,
$38; feed-wbeat, $38 per ton, or an equivalent
of $1.77y2 a bushel.
That is tbe situation at the present tirne
and there is very little hope of improvernent.
The question is, sbouhd we amend tbis aet
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

to permit the importation or manufacture of
oleomargarine? 1 arn told by well-informed
people that in New York butter is selling
at 76 cents a pound, and oleomargarine at
74 cents. From another source I learn that
butter is selling at 80 cents a pound and
oleomargarine at 76 cents.
That is right.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: If that is the case,
1 arn wondering wbat relief we co.uld expeet
if the act were arnended as suggested. When
I commenced my rernarks I d'id not know
exactly where I stood on the questionSome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: -but lawyer-like,
I bave almost convinced myseif. I bave corne
to the conclusion that I will support the bill
because, tbough it may not bring mucli relief,
it will bring sorte. Oleomargarine, if it is
not sold at a bigher price tban butter, can be
purchased at the stores in tbe larger centres,
and wvill provide people wbo cannot now
obtain butter the fats necessary to keep their
families in a bealtby condition.
May I
suggest to the bonourable senator who introduced this bill (Hon. Mr. Euter) that it sbould
be only a ternporary measure. I amn not prepared to vote for it as a permanent measure.
I tbink tbe bill would receive greater support
if tbe honourable gentleman would agree to
amend it so that it would remain in force for
a trial period of two ycars. As a ruIe, tbe
(ity people are in favour of the bill, but the
country people are against it.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

H1ear, bear.

Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL:
Honourable
senators, it is not my intention to speak at
any great lengthSome Hon. SENATORS:

Order.

Hon. IVA CAMPBELL FALLIS: Honourable senators, as I bave to leave the ebamber
shiortly, I arn grateful. to the honourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell)
for allowing me ta precede him. I bave
listened withi a great deal of interest to al
the speeches on this bill, pro and con. So far
none but rny maIe colleagues bave spoken,
and I suppose it would be running truc to
formi for a wornan to try to get in the hast
word.
Wbhat bias struýck me most forcibly is that
.all wbo bave participated in the debate, with
the possible exception of rny immediate
prediecessor, bave expressed tiberselves as
being cither very definitely for tbe bill or
very definitely against it. From wbat they
said it would seern that the bill was either

APRIL 10, 1946
ail right *or ail wrong. Weli, that bas flot
been my parsonal reaction to the bill. I have
feit that a good deal could -be said on both
sides. As one who lived for many years on a
farm and who stili maintains close contact
with the opinions of the people in the rural
part of my awn province, I find myseif Vaery
much in accord with the sentiments expressed
in such speeches as tihose of tihe honourable
senatar from King's (Hon. Mr. McDonald)
and the honouirable senator from Bedford (Hon.
Mr. Nicol); an the other hand, as one who
now lives in an industriai town and who has
discussed the matter with a great many people
there, 1 can appreciate tha viewpoint so ably
expressad by the honourabie senator from
Like the
Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne).
honourable gentleman who immediately preceded me (Hon. Mr. Aseitine), I am prapared
to support this legisiation, if it is to be
temparary, but not if it is to he permanent.
I will give my reasons.
I agrae with' tha statement made by some
'honourable senators-ar statement that was
scoffed at by othars-that thîs is a turne when
we necd tu give every possible encouragement
to the producers of food in our country, and
wben we should not pass legisiation which wiUl
inevitably tend to discourage t'hem. ýThe
Minister of Finance himseif bas subscribed ta
that idea. As reported in the press just a
couple of days ago, ha said that the increasa
of four cents a pound in the price of butter
was necessary as an incentive to producars,
and that without it we cou.id not keep up even
the present limited production. I believe ha
is quite right.
On this question of increasad production I
have talked to a great rnany farmars in the
district in wbich I live, and thair answer to
me--has been in affect this: "Seventy-five or
eighty par cent of us who bore the heat and
burden of the day on the farma during the war
years were man past middle age. We are
*orn out physicaily and wa can no longer
maintain tha paca at which we then worked.
Not only are wa unabie to increase production,
but we cannot keep production at its prasent
levai unless the youngar men corne to our
assistance. However willing wa older men
may ha, we are flot physicaliy able to do that."
They go on to point out that the difficulty
is to induca the sons of farmers, and other
young men upon whom they dapand for help,
to stay on the farrns; that the hright lights
and high wagas of the city are praferrad to
the soiitary life and hard work on the farma the dairy farmer's work is probabiy the
hardest of ail.
If young people are to be kapt on the farm,
some inducament must be offered them. Un-

127

less they can sea that farm lifa holds some
promise for tham in the future, thay will
taka jobs in the citias instead of halping the
aider maen increase agriculturai. production.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask if* the
honourabla senator thinks that a bill of this
kind wauld discourage young mens from going
on the farm?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: If the legisiation is
ta ba permanent, yes. I will coma ta that in a
minute.
It was contanded hy its supporters that
this measura, aven if it ware intanded ta ba a
permanent ana, wauld not injure the dairy
industry. That was statad ovar and ovar
again. Well. I am nat going ta argua that
point; but if the dairy farmars of this country
baliava in thair haarts that the bill is going
ta hindar or hurt dairy production, than it
will discourage them.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hlear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: The mai ority of us
hera have beau through enougb election
carnpaigns ta know that at election time what
counts is not what people should think, but
what they do think.
Soma Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: If what counted was
what the peuple should tbink, we in this group
would be sitting ta the right of Ris Honour
the Speaker.
Saine Hon. SENATORS : Oh, oh.
Han, Mr. HARDY: Is it not iargely what
thay are made to think, rightly or wrongly?
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: No. I do not believe
that in a damacracy they ara mada ta think;
I baliava chat they -pratty much think for
thamsalves.
Han. Mr. HARDY: The honourable lady
is an orator wha has done much ta bring that
about, rightly or wrongly.
Han. Mrs. FALLIS: Thank you ve.ry mucb
for the compliment.
To return ta rny point: whan the honourabla
senatar froin Waterloo (Han. Mr. Euler) was
spaaking ta the motion for second reading
of his bill hae said, if my mamory serves me,
that the Dairy Council of Canada- were
opposed ta the legislation. Is chat correct?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: The honourable senator says that is sa. Tha-n apparentiy the
dairy farmers do beliave that legislàtion of
this kind wouid harm their industry. My

SJNATE
point is that if they believe that, then this
measure would discourage them from producing butter.
Some honourable members stressed the
view that legislation designed to help our
farmers at the present time is class legislation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: A good many people
have said that to me. I disagree with that
viewpoint. I think that every possible step
that can be taken to encourage production of
food in this country at the present time is
not class legislation in its narrow sense.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Oleomargarine is a food.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I think that such legislation is in the interests of every citizen of
this country-in fact, of every citizen in the
world. Therefore I believe that we should
give every possible encouragement to the
producers of food.
And now I come to the other side of the
picture. As was just pointed out by the
honourable senator from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), we are faced
with a severe shortage of butter. With a view
to alleviating that shortage I would support
a bill of this kind, provided it was specified
that it was a temporary measure, to be
removed when the farmers of this country are
in a position to supply the demand for butter.
But because no qne can foresee what conditions will face the dairy , industry of this
country in the years to come, I am not prepared to support the measure as a permanent
one.
Hon. DONALD MacLENNAN: Honourable senators, in expressing my opinion as to
the merits of this bill I will have recourse to
a remark made by that wise old philosopher
Sir Roger de Coverley: that much can be
said on both sides. There is no doubt that
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) delivered a very able address the
other day when moving the second reading.
However, with my limited capacity, I failed to
follow his arguments. His references to Denmark would seem to be intended to prove
that the more oleomargarine we import and
manufacture here, the greater will be our
production of butter. I cannot follow that
argument at all. Then the honourable member
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) indignantly
got up and discovered that after a quarter of
a century his liberty was more or less circumscribed because he could not get oleomargarine. Other honourable members paid a
great deal of attention and directed most of
their arguments towards the iniquity of
having their liberty circumscribed in any
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS.

way, apparently forgetting the fact that from
the rising of the sun to the setting thereof a
man's liberties are circumscribed in various
ways, legally, morally and physically. But,
as I said before, it took them quite a long
time to discover that their liberty was so
circumscribed because of the lack of the
importation of oleomargarine. Mark you,
for many years they were in a position where
their influence could be brought to bear on
this proposition.
Now, as I said before, our liberties are circumscribed on every hand. We cannot buy
automobiles today without paying a sum of
money in addition to what they are supposed
to be worth-a sum which does not add to
their value. My liberty is circumscribed in
that way. The same condition applies to
furniture»and to various other items so numerous that to list them would tax the capacity
of an abler man than myself.
There is another phase that is a little
amusing to me, being somewhat old. Not
so very long ago, as the history of a country
goes, I was led to believe that the importation of butter from a sister dominion would
send the Dominion of Canada to the "demnition bow-wows".
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN:
interesting today.

That is rather

Hon. Mr. HARDY: That was under the
Bennett government, though, don't forget.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: The Bennett
government slid in on butter; they did not
stay very long, though they did not slide out
on oleomargarine.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: It is really amusing to me to hear gentlemen sobbing and
bewailing the fact that now we cannot import
a commodity which is very much inferior to
butter. My medical friends in this chamber
need not set up a straw man for the privilege
and pleasure and exercise of knocking him
down. Nobody claims that oleomargarine is
deleterious; it is accepted as a fact that it
is a fairly wholesome food, but not to be
compared with butter.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I should like to
see the two honourable gentlemen, the mover
and the seconder of the bill with a pound of
creamery butter and a chunk of oleomargarine on their table. I should like to see
which way their prehensile fingers would
point. I am confident they would reach for
the butter every time.

APRIL 10, 1946
An Hon. SENATOR: Could you tell the
difference?
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Tell the difference I You can smell it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, ohý
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: The honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) put
forth a few arguments in favour of the bill.
I think he endeavoured to capitalize on the
probability that his prestige would have great
influence in promoting this measure. What
he talked about most was our "expanding
economy". For goodness sake ! If to bring
about "expanding economy" it is necessary
to import oleomargarine, I see little hope of
any expansion, and what his reference to mill
feed has got to do with the merits or demerits of importing oleomargarine I cannot
very well make out. There are honourable
gentlemen who proclaim from the housetops
that they own many dairy cattle. I wonder if
they manufacture butter. Or do they sell
the whole milk? If they do, they are not
possibly as disinterested as they would make
people believe.
The present butter shortage is but temporary. At this season every year there is
less butter produced than at other seasons,
and the season is now at hand when butter
production will be greater. That cannot be
gainsaid.
But this is what made me get up to speak
against the bill. We are having disturbances in
the coal mines, in the lufnber camps, in our
textile and other factories, and disturbances
are even threatened in our hospitals. Well,
I fear this bill will disturb our farmers. For
goodness sake, while there is so much disturbance in the country let us not add to it.
I ask honourable gentlemen to take these
matters into consideration. The honourable
leader of the government in the Senate has
said that such measures are going to disturb
the farmers, and that is something we should
all try to avoid.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. C. J. VENIOT: Honourable senators,
I should like to add to this debate a few
brief remarks along a line of thought which
'has not been presented by previous speakers.
There are some 70,000 cases of diabetes in
Canada, ranging from the very mild to the
severe death-producing type. In 1944 there
were in Canada 2,362 deaths from diabetes.
Honourable senators may well ask what is the
relevance of diabetes to the discussion of oleomargarine. As a diabetic myself for over 16
years, and as a physician concerned about my
own health and interested in the welfare of

129

my patients, particularly in diabetics, I was
compelled to make a special study of the
disease. For that reason I may know something about the critical situation created in
Canada by the shortage of not only butter
but of fat-stuffs in general.
,The all-important factor in the treatment
of diabetes is the establishment and maintenance of a properly balanced diet, without
which insulin is of little or no value. The
prime requisite for a diabetic diet is that the
three basic foodstuffs, namely, fats, proteins
and carbohydrates, should be properly balanced
in the exact proportion called for by the
patient's condition as demonstrated by laboratory tests. If one of these three foodstuffs
is omitted from the diet for any length of
time the patient's condition is likely ta
become seriously aggravated.
Diabetic patients have no difficulty at any
time in procuring their requirement of proteins, such as meat, fish and' eggs; nor
do they experience any trouble in obtaining
their requirement of carbohydrates, such as
bread, cereals, fruit and vegetables. But difficulty does arise for the Canadian diabetie
when he tries ta secure the fat requirements
for his three daily meals. At the present time
in Canada the chief source of fats for the
.diabetic is butter, and of this substance lie
requires a minimum of from one to two ounces
per day. Therefore butter is the backbone
of the diabetic diet. BaconVfat and other
animal fats and rich cream are completely
out of the picture as a satisfactory substitute.
About one-tenth of the cases of diabetes are
to be found in young children. I leave it ta
honourable senators to imagine the situation
created when a little child of four or five
years of age, who is a diabetic-and I have
seen many of them-is obliged to get along
without butter on his bread. The average child
is reluctant to eat any fat substance other
than butter. -If his bread was spread with
shortening or any other kind of animal fat,
lie would object to it, and the parents would
have great difficulty in supplying him with the
fat he requires.
Every other country in the world has an
abundant -supply of vegetable oils and fats.
They allow the manufacture of vegetable substances, such as oleomargarine, or a similar
product, which can be used as a substitute for
the much-needed butter in the diabetic diet.
May I say that Canada alone penalizes her
diabetic patients by this quarter-of-a-centuryold ban on oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. ORERAR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. VENIOT: As a physician, I know
dozens of families who suffer *a financial strain

SENATE
because they have diabetics living in the home.
I have in mind one family where there are
two diabetic children, who require insulin and
at least two ounces of butter each day in their
diet. In one day these two children use as
much butter as is presently rationed to one
normal person for a whole week. From an
economical and financial standpoint this is not
a very encouraging situation for the head of a
family who is a labourer and has a small
income. There are thousands of diabetics in
Canada today who are suffering a lower
standard of health, and who cannot carry on
their regular daily activities because they are
unable to procure the amount of butter they
need or a satisfactory substitute for it.
Therefore, I submit that if oleomargarine
were produced and marketed in Canada for
no other reason than to supply fat substances
to diabetics, it would be a useful and a lifesaving measure.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman just one question? I
assume that it is not the recent scarcity of
butter that has caused this diabetic condition.
Hon. Mr. VENIOT: A searcity of butter
does not produce diabetics, nor does it cause
diabetes; but it is today bringing some diabetic patients close to the grave because,
without the much-needed butter they cannot
last long. May I give'you a personal example?
Four weeks ago I travelled by train from
Bathurst to Toronto and back to Ottawa.
The trip took four days. During that time
I could not obtain the quantity of butter I
required to keep in fit condition. After the
trip I was not fit to stand before this house
or any other gathering, but was ready for my
bed. This is the problem of thousands of
sufferers from diabetes throughout the length
and breadth of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Do not diabetics get a
special permit to buy butter?
Hon. Mr. VENIOT: Diabeties are entitled
to a special permit, but of what use is it in
places where butter is not obtainable? The
question of special permits for diabetics was
raised in this very city three weeks ago when
the butter shortage was most acute. The
loctors issued certificates to the Ration Board,
ind extra coupons were given; but there was
no butter available. If oleomargarine or vegetable oil had been available to diabetics such
a problem would not have occurred.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Might that situation
not drive some of them to milk a cow?
Mahatma Gandhi takes his goat along with
him.
Hon. Mr. VENIOT.

Hon. Mr. VENIOT: It might be a very
good thing for the country if more people
could milk cows; we would then have more
butter.
For the reasons which I have already given,
honourable senators, I wholeheartedly support
the bill, and in doing so I believe that I
represent the opinion of 70,000 fellowdiabetics in Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable
senators, I promise not to take much time
with my remarks, but I should like to summarize some of the opinions that have been
expressed during this debate.
First of all may I congratulate the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) on the introduction of this bill? I
feel that the attention given it by honourable members indicates the wide public
interest taken in the bill.
There is no doubt that Canada, a land of
plenty, should produce from her soil as much
as possible both for her own people and to
send abroad. The government has encouraged
the people of rural communities to produce
more and more food for themselves and for
the people of other countries. In spite of that
there is a greater shortage of butter today than
this country has ever known. Apparently we
have a larger number of milk cows 'throughout the country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is the honourable senator
sure of the accuracy of that last statement?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The statement'
was made; I accept it as a fact. I do not
profess to be an authority on the question.
If it is not truc, there is something wrong
with our farmers for they have been encouraged to produce, and they have been subsidized by a flow of feed from western Canada.
No one will criticize us for shipping butter
abroad. We have pledged ourselves to supply
food to England and Europe, and other
countries throughout the world. I cannot see
that the situation is likely to change.
Canada is capable of producing great
quantities of foodstuffs. We have added to
our capacity by installing mills for the extraction of vegetable oils. This new industry,
which emerged during the war years, enables
us to produce from soya beans and peanuts
an oil which can be used in the manufacture
of oleomargarine as a substitute for butter.
The need for butter is very apparent. Even
around these buildings the slogan seems to be,
"Butter, butter, who's got the butter?" After
the remarks of the honourable gentleman from
Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner) some

APRIL 10, 196
of us may have felt that we ware not getting
our fair share of the butter supply. Howevar,
everyone realizas that the dairy industry is not
able ta supply sufficiant butter ta meet the
needs of the Canadian people. -I submit that
sinca thare ara more dairy cattle in the landHon.' Mr. HORNER: May I intarrupt my
friand? I do not know wha made that statament, but I doubt its accuracy. One hanourable senator has saîd that exporting has
in.craased ail ovar Canada. Just the other
avaning I saw a bard of dairy cattle which was
being shippad ta the United States. Tbay
wauld not be milkad vary long, but would soan
ha turnad inita beef.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: As 1 said bafora,
I do not profass ta ha an authority on the
subjact, but arn maraly repeating what has
been said. The fact ramains that the dairy
industry of this country is producing a large
quantity of milk, but much of it is being sold
as wbola milk, and we have a shortaga of
butter.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the honourabla
gentleman a question? Is it fair ta' put the
responsibility for the butter shortaga on the
farmars of this country whan the govarnment
shipped 500,000 pounds of butter ta the West
Indias?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Thara was a reason for
that.
Han. Mr. CAMPBELL: I do not for a
moment suggest that in order ta have butter
on aur own tables we should refuse ta sand it
ta ather counitnias that are crying for food. I
say that we are producing an inadequata
supply of butter ta meet tha demand in this
and ather cauntries, and so thera is a shortage
on Canadian tables.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Bacause of a shortage
fî farm help?
Hon. Mr. HORNER. The price is toa low.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Tha honourable
gentleman frarn Saskatchewan North (Hon.
Mr. Horner) has anticipated what I was going
ta say. It may be that the price racaivad
by tbe farmaer *was too low and ha becama
discouraged. I submit that instead of doing
as wa did in racant years it would have been
better ta permit, the importation and manufactura of oleomargarine and ta take the
ceiling entirely off the price of butter.
Undoubtedly if bath butter and oleomargarine
were available, the prica of butter, Àf allowed
to find its awn level, would ba highar than
that of oleomargarine.

3

It saems to me there is no reason why we
should vote against a measure which, wa hope,
would inake it possible for our people ta
obtain either the butter that they sa badly
need or a substitute for it. The only argument I have heard here against this bill is
that its adoption might, frighten and injure
the dairy industry. Well, s0 far as we cari see
to-dýay, if we parmittad the manufacture and
importation of oleomargarina there would stili
ha a sufficient, demand on the part of the
people of Canada and of othar countrias for
ail the butter we could produce. No ana
here can definitaly forasee a time when thare
will be a surplus of butter an the mnarket.
Present indications are that the damand for
foodstuffs in this country wilýl be greater than
ever before. I amn one of those who beliava
that in the future the people of Canada will
consume far more food than at any time in
the past.
Those who are suffaring most froin the
shortage of butter are perhaps the men whose
dinnar pails contain butterless sandwiches. I
submit, honourable senators, that if by adopting legisiation of this kind we can make it
possible for the peopla ta obtain butter or a
good substituta, we should do so, and do so
irmaediataly.
Han. Mr. HORNER: The govarnment
should have thought about the man who carry
dinner pails before it allowad restaurants ta
charge fiva cents extra for a cup of coffee.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Would tha honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) permit me ta ask hMm a question?
Ha comnes from a manufacturing centre. Can
ha tell us how much cWsein, ehich is derived
from milk, is used in manufactured articles?
On my trip to Winchaster I was told that a
great deal of casein is going into the manufacture of plasties and other goods.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: 1 am unabla to
answer the honourable senator's question. The
use of casein in the manufacture of plastics,
of which I «m awara, may be ana of the
factors contributing ta tha present shortaga
of butter. It is apparent that avary day naw
are baing found for milk and other
-uses
agricultural products.
On motion of Hon..Hr. Haig, the debate was
adj ourned.
The Senata adjourned until tomorraw at

DATRY INDUSTRY BILL
DEBATE POSTPONED

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion
for the second reading of Bill G, an Act to
amend the Dairy Industry Act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Stand.
Hon11 Mr. EULER: Honourable senators, it
is With some ,reluctance that I oppose the
motion to further adjourn this debate. The
bill bas been fully discussed, and because 1
believe most bonourable members favour the
continuation of the-debate un-til the matter is
disposed of, I see no reason for further delay.
Our entire proceedîngs of Tuesday last
cover only one sheet of Hansard. 9n Wednesday, out of a short afternoon, we wasted
an hour and a baif. Many members, not the
least of whoM is the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), have complained
from time to time that the bouse doas not do
enough work. For these reasons, honourable
senators, I object to any postponement of the
debate.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, may
I speak to a question of privilege? I ask for
the adjournment of the debate on two
grounds. First, honourable members on this
side of the bouse yesterday suggested that the
bill he made effective for only a short time.
That is a very important suggestion, and one
which I have not bad time to fully consider.
Secondly, I hà.ve asked for certain information and so far have received only part of it.
Manitoba is a dairy province. It produces
the finest butter and wins more first prizes
than any other part of Canada. Therefore, I
wish to have an opportunity to consult with
the dairymen of that province.
No committees will ha meeting next week,
s0 no harm wilh come from allowing this bill
to stand.
The Housa of Commons wilh be adjourning
very shortly, so even if the bill passes hère
and goes to the other bouse, it will not be
considerad there immediately.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The bonourable
senator bas said no barm will come from the
delay. "Hope deferred maketh the baart sick."
I behieve this assembly is ready to vote on the
bill.
Some Hon. SENATORS:
Hear, bear.
Question!1
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Honourable senators,
alhough I am going to vote against this bill
I entirely agree witb its sponsor (Hon. Mr.
Euler) that the work of the bouse should be
proceeded witb. We have now been in session
since the l4tb of Match, whicb was a late
date for the convening of parliament, and by
the time we return from the Easter recess
a total of six weeks will have passed away.
The session will perbaps not hast more than
two montbs beyond that time. I feel at
liberty to say that I am very much discouraged by tbe lack of progress we have made in
tbe four weeks that we have bean hère. There
bas been entirely too much postponing of
business. If we are going to discharge our
responsibility to deal with issues facing the
country, we have got to get down to work on
them. Realhy, only one committee bas done
yeoman service this session, namehy, the
special committee appointed hast year to deal
witb income tax. It bas worked strenuously
and made good progress. Bèfore long it will
bave heard ail the witnesses wbo wisb *to be
beard, and the room tbat it bas been occupying will be available to' anotber committea.
I think sometbing should be initiated for consideration, and plans laid, so that the Senate
wihl ha kept busy after Easter.
I am entirehy opposed to the policy of delay
on matters of this kind. This bill, as its

1,34

SENATE

sponsor pointad out, has been before the
bouse for a considerable time now. I want
te sec it voted on, and net postponed from day
te day for tbe cenvenience of anyene. My
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) lias had
ample time ta communicate with Manitoba.
Tic fact is, if lie doas net already know it,
that a latter takes only a day eacli way by
air mail.
From many things that have occurred,
and tic usclessness ef the past waek's performances in this lieuse, I arn led ta believe
tiat we do net know the wliole stary. We
are busy men-we sliould lie, anyway-and if
wc are nat going ta do any work the bouse
sbould have been adjourned so that we could
go home. We are supposed ta be balping te
the hast of aur ability by inquiring into and
considering issues of importance ta tbe country, and we can ouly fulfil that fonction by
gctting on witb our wark. I certainly will
support the honourable senator fram Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) in lis opposition ta -further
delay in dealing witb this blli.
Hoa. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senatars,
I do nat agree witb tbe lionourable gentleman's statement that the members of tic
Senate have not been busy.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Han. Mr. LEGER: Since Tuesday 1 hav e
spant an average of six ta seven lieurs a day
in cammittees, and I am n ot tbe only ana who
lias donc this. It is suggested that we bave
done nothing during the weck, wbereas the
fact is just the opposite. In my opinion aur
cemmitteas hava been doing gaod and uiseful

work.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The honaurable gentleman from Vancouver (Hani. Mr. MeRae) was
speaking of the wvork of tbe Sanata praper.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I dislika very mucli ta disagrea with my good
friand the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig).
but really lia was flot on vary tenable grolund
in. the position lie took a few moments ago.
This bill lias been undar consideration at
several sittings of the Senate. During the
course of the debate, as haebiînself stated, it
was suggested that certain amendments inigbit
ba made ta the measure. If the motion for
second rcading is passed and the 'bill is sent
ta the Cammittea of the Wliolc, ameodmants
wbicb do not violate the principla of the bill
can ha brougbt forward at that stage. Yestcrday My lionaurable friand was allowed ta
adjoura the debate, and I really think-I say
this in the most kindly way-that in asking
Hen.

Mr.

McREA

for a furtbcr adjournment hie is pcrhaps trespassing a littie too much upon the indulgence
of the bouse.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators,
it seems ta me that the leader an the other

sida (Hon. Mr. Haig) is perfect1y in order in
asking that the dabate stand until lie is ready
to go on. Wbile some hanaurabla membars
may believe that noa work is being done, I can
tell tbem that the committeas of ýthis house
have been sitting continuously. Look at the
order paper and see wliat the Divorce Committee lias been daing. I have been sitting
as a member af that cammittee almost every
day, except wlien I was an the tax commitre,
and as a result this farenoon was the. firstthat I have had ta myseif since the beginning
af last week. When bonaurable members who
avaid these cammittees or da not accept
naminatian ta them say that wark is nat being
done here, I feel they are net fiîlly apprised of
the facts.
My purpose in rising wvas to support the
honaurable leader opposite in bis request for
a further adjaurnment of the debate. I have
been desiraus of speaking an this mation, but
uintil this faranoan I had no appartunity ta
get my facts together. I dietateci tliem ta a
i.tenagrapher and have net yet received the
transcript. I shauld like ta speak for a few
minutes an the principle af the bill, but tbis
would flot be possible if we passed the motion
for secand reading today. I hope the hause
ivili aceede ta the honourable g-entleman's
request that the matter bc allowed ta stand.
Han. Mr. COPP: ilanourable senators,
I regret very muai that, wben commenting
an tbe request af the hanaurable leader opposite -ta have this motion stand a few days
langer, my lieneurable friend fram Vancouver

(Hon. Mr. McRae)

made a ratier veiled

suggestion that there was sometbing uindarband ar wrang. If the hanourable gentleman
lias knowledge of anything of that kind I
think lie shauld impart it ta the house instead
of making a suggestion as hie lias done.

Han. Mr. MeRAE: I have no such knawledge.

I naturally drew a conclusion fram a

number af incidents.
Han. Mr. COPP: Then the suggestion shauld
nat have been made.

Han. Mr. HARDY: I do net think the
bonaurable senator, from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) used the word "underband".
Hon. Mr. McRAE: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable senatars,
I wisli ta say a few words in reference ta the
situation tbat lias developed. In the first
place, we must flot forget that the bill under

APRIL 11, 1946
consideration is one in which all the people
of Canada are much interested. I have heard
most of the speeches on the motion for second
.reading, and I am quite sure that all the facts
have not as yet. been placed before us. If
we had an assurance that the bill would go to
a committee where people could appear and
express their opinions, that would be well and
good; but instead the intention appears to be
that the bill shall go to the Committee of
the Whole House.
There is no question at all that two groups
are intensely interested in this proposed
amendment to the Dairy Industry Act. One,
is the entire farming community of Canada,
and the other comprises the people in the
large centres. If there is an emergency because of the shortage of butter, that emergency exists chiefly in the big cities. Now,
let me ask this very simple question. Do we
believe we have all the facts required to
enable us to vote intelligently on the bill?
Hon. Mr. HUSHION: No.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I doubt very much
if we have. If the farming organizations
throughout this country wish to express themselves on this proposed amendment, are we
going to give them an opportunity to do so,
or are we simply going to pass the bill without knowing whether they are for it or against
it? For that reason I think we should have
some assurance from the sponsor of the bill
that it will be referred to the appropriate
standing committee, in order that these people
may be heard.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 1 suppose my
honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) has noted that in another place a
much more important bill than this, a bill
very seriously affecting the whole of Canada,
was dealt with in a few hours.
Honourable
Mr.
CAMPBELL:
Hon.
senators, I should like to add a word or two.
I am sure no honourable senator would desire
to force a vote on this bill if he felt that
ample opportunity had not been given honourable members interested in the subject matter
tjo get any information they required before
speaking in support of or in opposition to
the bill. This measure has been before the
Senate for two weeks. It is similar in form
to a statute which was repealed some years
ago. There should be no difficulty in getting
information from the Department of Agriculture with respect to the subject matter.
If the bill were referred to one of our standing
committees, I fear it would be extremely
inconvenient to call all those who- might be
interested in the bill, though possibly representatives of the dairy industry would attend.

It is apparent that there must be a termination to the debate on a piece of legislation
of this naturé. I repeat, that we have had
ample opportunity of preparing ourselves to
discuss the bill and to raise any questions in
regard to it. With all due respect to those
who have spoken in favour of adjournment of the debate, 1 submit that, as suggested, it is still possible to amend the bill
in Committee of the Whole. I feel that all
honourable members gathered here have more
or less made up their minds as to the course
they are going to take, and in my opinion
we should proceed with the question.
Some Hon. SENATORS:- Question!
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I rise to a point of order,
honourable senators. When the order of the
day was called and the leader on the other
side said "Stand," that was tantamount to a
motionfor further adjournment of the debate.
Such a motion is not debatable; so this discussion, though quite interesting, is entirely
out of order.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
members, the order in question is: "Resuming
the adjourned debate on the motion for the
second reading of Bill G, an act to amend the
Dairy Industry Act." It will be recalled that
yesterday the honourable leader to my left
(Hon. Mr. Haig) adjourned the debate. Today
he has asked that the order stand. That is
tantamount to a motion for the further adjournment of the debate. The matter is now
in the hands of the house.
Those in favour of the motion for the
adjournment of the debate will please say

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT rnoved the
second reading of Bill 02 an act to incorporate Canaidian Acceptance Company#
He said: This is a bill to incorporate a
company under the provisions of part 2 of the
Small Loans Act, 1939. It conforms to the
pattern set forth in that statute. Tbe capital
of the company is to be $250,000. divided into
2,500 shares of $100 each. The bead office
is to be in the city of Toronto.
In reality, the proposed company is to bc
a subsidiary of an old establisbed cornpany
known as the Canýadian Acceptance Corporation, wbicb bas been doing business throughout the dominion for the past twenty-fi%-e
years. The present poliey of the Departrnent
of Finance, administered by the Superintendent of Insurancc, is to refrain from ssuing
licences to dominion companies, unless they
are incorporated by special act, pursuant to
the prov-isions of the Small Loans Act. Briefly,
that is why the petitioners, who are also
directors of the Canadian Acceptance Company, are now asking parliament to pass this
bill incorporating the Canadian Acceptance
Company.
The' Superintendent of Tnsiirance bias approved the name of the company, and if the

He said: Hýonourable senators, I wish to
move the second reading of this bill, copies
of wbicb bave been distributcd.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourahie senators,

gotten astride the miles of the bouse, anti
that the motion should be put by bis Honour

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is moved hy
Honouraeble Senator Crerar thaL Bill P2, An
Act respecting Rupert's Land Trading Coin
pany, be now read the second time.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
now that I amn properly in orcler may I proceed with my remarks?
The ,Rupert's Land Trading Company wvas
first incorporated by act of' parliarnent in
1912, and in 1938 certain amendments were
made to its charter. A furtber amendment
to tbe charter is sought under this bill.

Hon. Mr. HIAIG: Would tbe bonourable
gentleman tell us sometbing about tbe bistory
of the company and wvbere it operates?
Hon. Mr. ýCRERAR: I understand that
Rupert's Land Trading Company w'as the
name under wbicb Revillon Frères traded in
western Canada. Later the Hudson Bay Company acquired the charter and took, over the
business.
Briefly, the purpose of the amendments now
sought is to enlarge the powers of the company dealing witb its properties; in other
words, to give it certain powers it would bave
enjoyed bad it been incorporated under the
Companies Act. Because the company was
incorporated by a special statute, its powers
are limited by the express provisions of that
statute.

APRIL 11, 1946
Honourable senators, after the bill has been
read the second time, I shall move that it be
referred to thé committee on Banking and
Commerce, where the sponsors will appear to
give any further information that may be
required.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The original company
was only permitted to deal in real estate for
its own purposes. The bill appears to give
it the right ta deal in real estate generally,
which, I suggest, is a material departure from
the original act.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think the point
raised by the honourable senator is technically
correct. The explanation is that the company
might have some buildings at a trading site
in the far north which -under the act could
be used only for its own purposes. As I
understand it, the company now seeks power
to dispose of such property if it sees fit.
I move the second reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

PROCEDURE
'Ie

Hon.

the

SPEAKER:

Honourable

senators, some doubt appears ta have arisen
in the mind of the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) as to whether he
should have spoken to the bill when lie first
rose in his place.
The Forms of Proceedings of the Senate
provide that, the Clerk having read the Order,
the senator in charge of the bill rises in his
place and explains it, and moves the second
reading. The Speaker then puts the question,
after which the bill may be discussed in all
its bearings.
NAVAL SERVICE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr: COPP xdoved the second reading
of bill Q2, an Act to amend the Naval
Service Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, I move the
second reading of this bill. I have asked the
honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon.
Mr. Vien) to explain it.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, the note facing the text of the bill
explains the whole purpose of the measure in
a nutshell. Already, under provisions of the

137

Militia Act, corps of army cadets have been
established. This bill authorizes the formation
of sea cadet corps.
For the past fifty years sea cadet corps have
been sponsored by the Navy League of Canada. During the early days of the recent war
the membership of these corps consisted of
some 300,000 cadets, and in 1941 under
authority of order-in-council P.C. 3655, the
Department of National Defence for Naval
Services assumed responsibility for the training of sea cadets and the operation of sea cadet
summer camps. In 1942 permission was granted
to designate the cotps as the "Royal Canadian
Sea Cadets."
The order-4n'.cuncil of 1941 was passed
under the authority of the War Measures Act
and continued in effect under the authority
of the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act. As the powers conferred by this later
act will eventually lapse, it is now proposed
to make permanent statutory provision for
the Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps.
The present bill proposes ta amend the Naval
Service Act, Chapter 23 of the statutes of 1944
in two particulars, by inserting therein, as
sections 28A and 28B, provisions for the formation, training, administration and pay of the
Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps.
The present strength of the corps is 12,906
cadets, and the proposed strength is 15,000.
The interest in the corps now shown by Canadians in all walks of life indicates that the
desired enrolment will be achieved, and that
in the future it will be maintained. The corps,
which number approximately 100, are established in every provincial capital and in all
the larger cities of the dominion, as well as
in many smaller cities and towns. Training
quarters for the majority of these corps are
provided by the Navy League of Canada.
The training course of the Royal Canadian
Sea Cadet Corps comprises such subjects as
knots, boat-work, signalling and general seamanship, naval traditions and discipline, as
well as other topics, both naval and otherwise,
of interest to boys. The course is designed ta
acquaint the cadet with the customs, usages
and significance of -the merchant marine and
the Royal Canadian Navy, ta develop his sense
of leadership and knowledge of his fellow
Canadians, and ta make of 'him a good
potential citizen.
To enable the cadets ta put into practice the
knowledge they obtain during training, the
Navy League of Canada provides at least one
summer camp in each province. During the
past year 14 camps were operated, at which
some eight ta ten thôusand cadets received,
training in naval subjects, sailing and
swimming.

SENATE

138

At present the Navy League is responsible
for providing the corps with training quarters
and camps and, through the local branches and
committees, with citizens to act as sea cadet
officers. Training of the corps is under the
supervision of the Naval Service. The local
branches and committees attend to the general
administrationand to the organization necessary to create public interest in the corps.
This method of operation has been in effect
since 1941 with such outstanding success that
it is proposed to continue it in the future.
I have much pleasure in seconding the
motion for the second reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Did the honourable
gentleman say that it was proposed to enrol
fifteen hundred cadets?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Fifteen thousand.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is different. That
number is not governed by any provision in
the bill.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The number of cadets to
be enrolled will be specified in regulations
issued by the minister.
the minister may:

The bill provides that

(a) authorize the formation of Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps to consist of boys who
have attained the age of twelve years but who
have not attained the age of nineteen years and
wlho have voluntarily applied for membership in
the Corps;
(b) authorize the Royal Canadian Sea Cadet
Corps, or any portion thereof, or any members
thereof to drill or train for such period of
time during each year as he may direct.
28B (1) Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps
shall be drilled, trained and administered in
such manner and shall be furnished with arms,
ammunition and equipnent under such conditions and shall he subject to the authority and
command of such officers as the Minister may
direct, and the members and instructors thereof
shall he entitled to accommodation. medical
care and pay and allowances as may be prescribed by the Governor in Council.
(2) Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps shall
not be liable to service in the Naval Forces in
any emergency.
The information I have given the house is
based on the scheme outlined by the department. Although it is proposed that the corps
shall have a strength of 15,000 cadets, there is
nothing to prevent the minister from deciding
to increase the number to 2ý,000 or 30,000, for
instance.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
Hou. Mr. VIEN.

ROYAL CANADIAN

AIR FORCE BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the second reading of Bill R2, an Act to amend the Royal

Canadian Air Force Act.
He said: Honourable senators, the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell) has kindly consented to explain
this bill.

Hon.

G.

P.

CAMPBELL:

Honourable

senators, this bill is in substance the same as
the Naval Service Bill which bas just been
given second reading. An order in council of
November, 1940, passed under the War

Measures Act, provided for the formation
and establishment of air cadet corps. The
purpose of the bill is to amend the Air Force

Act so as to make permanent statutory provision for these corps, which hereafter will be
Cadet
Air
Canadian
known as Royal
Squadrons.
It may b of interest to honourable members to know something of the splendid work
that bas been donc by the Air Cadet League

of Canada. Under the authority of its charter, and working in close co-operation with
the department, the League bas established
Air Cadet Units throughout the country. The
maximum annual'enrolment in the corps was
about 30,000. The present strength is around
.24,000, of whom approximately 20,000 will be

eligible to continue as cadets under the
statute.
The order in council of November 1940 was
similar in wording to certain sections of the
Militia Act under which for a number of

years army cadet corps have operated.

It

gave the minister power to authorize school
boys who have attained the age of 12 years
but not the age of 15 years, to be formed
into junior air cadet corps, and boys who
have attained the age of 15 years but not
the age of 19 years, to b formed into senior
air cadet corps. In future there are to be
no junior cadets. The bill prôvides:
15A. The Minister may

(a) authorize the formation of Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadrons to consist of boys who
have attained the age of fifteen years but who
have not attained the age of nineteen years and
who have voluntarily applied for nmmbership
in a Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadron;
Boys between the ages of 12 and 15 are
considered too immature for the type of
training which the Royal Canadian Air Force
proposes to give.
A basic over-all course of instruction in
about fifteen subjects will be given to cadets
in future. These subjects include frame conairmanship, basic
struction, craftmanship,

139

APRIL 111,1946

radio instruction, aircraft engines, aircraft
recognition, leadership, hygiene and first aid,
drill and physical training.
Honourable senators will, I think, appreciate
the benefits that accrue' to boys who participate in the activities of the air -cadet squadrons-or of either of the two similar bodies,
the army cadet corps and the sea cadet corps.
These organizations are particularly active in
the larger cities, and I believe the records
show that the training given by them has
brought about a substantial reduction in
juvenile delinquency.
The department will continue to give effect
to -its plans for the training of air cadets
through the Air Cadet League, which in turn
will continue to work in close co-operation
with schools, churches, and groups of publicspirited individuals.
The length of the course for air cadets has
been tentatively fixed at three years. Instruction in the complete course of subjeets, including those I mentioned, will be given at local
headquarters of the squadrons, and also at
summer camps at which the boys will be
entitled to spend two weeks annually. It is
expected that the number of hours of instruction per year at the local headquarters will
be 86, and at the camps, 55, a total of 141
hours.
Enrolment in the air cadet squadrons will
be on a voluntary basis. The proposed new
section 15B (2) provides:
Royal Canadian Air Cadet Squadrons shall
not be liable to service in the Royal Canadian
Air Force in any emergency.
At the present time no actual flying training
is being given-to the cadets, but the plan is
to make familiarization flights available to
them a little later on.
I do not think I need say anything further.
In brief, the purpo'se of the bill is to bring
thé Royal Canadian Air Force Act into line
with the Militia Act, and so provide by statutefor the setting up of air cadet squadrons to
replace the air cadet corps authorized by
order in council.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will the honourable
gentleman explain section 2, which amends
subsection 1 of section 16 of the act?

The other paragraphs I need not quote. It
is proposed to add as paragraph (f):

The organization, maintenance, training, ad-

ministration and efficiency of Royal Canadian
Air Cadet Squadrons and the pay and allowances of instructors and members thereof.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Thank you.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG:

Honourable sen-

ators, I have some familiarity with the statute,
for since 1941 I have had the honour of
being president of the air cadet squadron of
the Gordon Bell high school in Winnipeg.
It is the largest air cadet squadron west of
the Great Lakes, and contributed the greatest
numiber of volunteers to the Royal Canadian
Air Force. Our high schools are allowed to
organize groups of air cadets, sea cadets, or
army cadets, and to give them so many hours
of training each day. That training is taken
in lieu of other- school work. We found that
a number of boys in the Gordon Bell squadron
who had been very backward in other subjects just seemed to find their forte in air
cadet training. The work of the air cadets
has been very satisfactory. The officers of the
squadron are teachers of the school staff who
have taken a course in air force work. The
boys had to buy their own uniforms and all
that sort of, thing, and when they went to
cainp for two weeks some of them found it a
little difficult to get the necessary equipment.
However, through the generosity of the
citizens of Winnipeg the money was provided. Without that assistance some of
the boys could not have secured the full
equipment. We are not trying to arouse a
spirit of militarism in the boys. Every year
in the last three years that they have been
reviewed by the air force officers the cadets
have demonstrated the excellent results flowing from their training. One particular benefit
is the care devoted to their sight. Their
eyes were examined thoroughly and in most
cases defects were remedied. The squadron
leader told me that many of the boys were
cured of visual defects which, if neglected,
might have become permanent.
About half a dozen of the boys could not
pass, and therefore were not entitled to uniforms from the organization. The citizens of
Winnipeg took the matter in hand and got the
required uniforms. They were certainly well
repaid, for there was a wonderful improvement

SENATE

There is one thing I should like to bring to
the attention of the minister and his officials:
the necessity of helping out air cadet classes in
school districts that cannot afford some of the
expenditures demanded by the department.
Cities like Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal and
Vancouver can bear this expense.
In the
smaller towns where there are a sufficient
number of high school boys it would be well
worth while for the department to encourage
the formation and training of air cadet squadrons. Our boys take to the air force more
readily than to the other branches of the
armed services. True, Winnipeg contributed a
lot of volunteers for the naval service and for
the arniy, but in the high schools the air force
had an appeal that neither of the other services
could offset. I heartily support the bill.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN: Honourable
senators, I had not intended to take part in
this discussion, but since the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) has paid tribute
to the air cadets of Winnipeg and their contribution to Canada's war effort, I should
like to enlighten the house on the record of
our men from the prairie provinces who joined
the Canadian Navy. Probably I should bave
made my remarks when the bill to amend the
Naval Service Act was under consideration. I
have found in eastern Canada astonishment at
the number of men from western Canada who
enlisted in our navy-men who never saw any
craft much larger than a rowboat until they
moved to the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.
Many of the men who gave up their lives
in defence of Canada began their naval training in the sea cadet organizations, just as
those who enlisted in the air force began as
air cadets.
The honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) has mentioned the importance of cadet training in overcoming juvenile
delinquency, and I think this fact should be
very strongly stressed. Some people criticize
cadet training on the ground that it tends to
promote a spirit of militarism. I do not think
so; rather, the training arouses in young men
a desire to improve their physique, to become
better citizens, and to rally to the defence of
their country should danger threaten. I am
very happy to endorse the remarks of the
honourable leader opposite in connection with
this movement.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
EASTER RECESS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Before the orders of the day are called, I
should like to make a brief statement with
respect to the Easter adjournment. Honourable senators will recall that some time
ago I suggested that, unless some unforeseen
situation developed, I would move that when
the Senate adjourns today it stand adjourned
until Tuesday, April 30, at 8 o'clock in the
evening. As far as I can ascertain there are
no- matters pending which will suffer by
reason of such an adjo'urnment.
Hon. WILLIAM
DUFF: Honourable
senators, if there is no urgent business before
the house, could not the adjournment be
extended to May 7? Such an extension would
give honourable senators a better opportunity
to go home and look after their private
business.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should like to
accommodate any honourable senator in the
matter of adjournment, but I am sure that
by April 30 there will be a considerable
accumulation of business to come before the
house. I have asked honourable senators who
have motions on the order paper to let
them stand, and it is my feeling that we
should reassemble not later than the date I
have indicated. Most honourable senators
have made their arrangements on that basis.

THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL
OF ATHLONE
REPLY TO FAREWELL ADDRESS OF BOTH
HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT

The Hon. the

SPEAKER:

Honourable

,senators, I have the honour to inform you that

the following communication has been received from the Right Honourable the Earl
of Athlone in reply to the Address of Farewell

presented to him by both Houses of Parliament.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons,

I thank you most sincerely for the kind
Address of Farewell which you have presented
ta me on the occasion of my approaching retirement as Governor-General of the Dominion of
Canada.
It is with feelings of regret that I am concluding my official relationship as the representative, of His Majesty the King in this country.
It has been an honour and a great privilege te
have served as Governor General during the
most eventful and calamitous years in the history of our time. The period of the war was
fraught with innumerable difficulties many of
which appeared at the time to be insurmountable. But Parliament and the Canadian people,
by their unselfish and untiring devotion te the
cause of freedom, played a major part in the
victorious struggle of the United Nations against
the implacable enemies of democracy.
My numerous tours of this vast country have

enabled me to see almost every section of Canada.
I have been a witness of the efficiency, perseverance and courage displayed by the men and
women of Canada, whether they served in the
armed forces or were engaged in factories or in
one of the numerous societies which performed

such miracles of organization and effectiveness.

This ready response ta the call of duty was -an

evidence of the loyalty of the Canadian people
te Ris Majesty the King and ta the British
commonwealth of nations, of which Canada is
so important a part.
I am very pleased to record that my relations
with the members of both houses have been of
the happiest.
I shall net fail. on my return to England, te
convey te Their Majesties and King and Queen
the loyal sentiments so admirably expressed in
your address. It will be my pleasure also te
convey te Queen Mary your kind remembrances.
Her Majesty the Queen Mother has the warmest
interest in the people of this country.
I join with you in expressing the hope that
Their Royal Highnesses the Princess Elizabeth
and the Princess Margaret may pay a visit te
Canada in the near future.
. On behalf of Princess Alice I wish to convey
te you Her Royal Highness' appreciation for
the very kind references you have made to her
in your address. These have touched us both
very deeply.
We shall never forget what Canada has contributed during the past six difficult and testing
years. She earned the admiration and true
gratitude of all free peoples for her magnificent
and munificent contribution ta the victoricus
prosecution of the war and ta the welfare and
rehabilitation of the suffering peoples of' the
world.
In bidding you farewell, Princess Alice and I
wish te assure you of our deep and abiding
affection and at the same time te express our
complete confidence in the continued prosperity
of Canada and the maintenance of her prend
position as the senior dominion of the British
commonwealth of nations.
THE RIGHT HONOURABLE VISCOUNT
ALEXANDER-INAUGURATION AS
GOVERNOR GENERAL
MOTION TO INCORPORATE ADDRESSES IN THE
SENATE DEBATES

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON: Honourable members, with leave of the Senate, I
desire to move:
That the speech of His Excellency the Right

Honourable Viscount Alexander of Tunis, G.C.B.,

Governor General of Canada, together with the

Address of Welcome read by the Prime Minister in the Senate Chamber on Friday, 12th
April, 1946, be printed as an appendix to the
Official Report of the Debates of the Senate and
form part of the permanent records of this
Parliament.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I am glad to second the motion. Those
of us who had the honour and pleasure of
being here -on Friday, the 12th of April, were
delighted with the address of the Prime Min-

ister in welcoming to Canada our new Governor General, and we were equally delighted
with

the

reply

of

His

Excellency.

Very

seldom, 'if ever, has Canada been honoured
by having, as His Majesty's representative
here, one who in a great war las proved himself to be an outstanding General of not
only the nations of the British Commonwealth

but the nations of the world. I am sure that
from one end of the dominion to the other
our people appreciate the a-ppointment of His
Excellency to this high office.

THE MEMORIAL CUP
CONGRATULATIONS TO WINNERS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are called, I
should like to draw the attention of this house
to a very impoiltant event which -occurred in
this part of the country during the past two
weeks. A little village out west by the name
of WinnipegHon. Mr. HAIG.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -sent a hockey team
down to Ontario and won the Memorial Cup.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The boys on the team
were not professional players; I know the
fathers and mothers of every one of them.
As five of these young men were writing
university examinations, they had to study
in the daytime and play their hockey at night.
I am sure they will do as well in their examinations as they did in hockey. Honourable
senators from Ontario will no doubt appreciate hearing about this event.
Hon. Mr. EULER: We know about it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators from
Toronto will be especially pleased to hear
about it.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Page Colonel
Drew!
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We of the west are particularly proud of our hockey teams, because
Regina won the Allan Cup.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What about the football
championship last fall?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not able to remember back that far.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The honourable
senator from Winnipeg has said that Regina
won the Allan Cup. I think he means Calgary.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, I meant to say that.
The Calgary Stampeders won the Allan Cup.
At the conclusion of the Memorial Cup
comopetition in Toronto, members of the losing
team complimented the boys from Winnipeg.
Such a demonstration of good sportsmanship
after an exciting series of games shows that
we need have no fear for the future of
Canada. I was very proud of the Winnipeg
boys for winning the series, but I was almost
as proud of the boys from Toronto who came
forward and showed their good sportsmanship
on that occasion.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators, I
think that we should all rejoice with the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
about the success of the Winnipeg hockey
team. I know that his youthful outlool
would net permit him to let an event of this
kind pass unnoticed. I should like te point
out, however, that it might be inexpedient
for honourable senators to refer in this house
to hockey games and their results. Some
honourable senators might have occasion to
rise and refer to the success of Les Can-

APRIL 30, 1946
adiens of Montreal. Many items concerning
local and provincial organizations appear in
the daily newspapers and are worthy of note,
but they are scarcely of such a nature as to
justify reference to tbern in this bouse. This
being so, the practice of indulging ini such
references would seem to be inadvisable.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: Wby not pass a resolutien about basketball?

A mistake was made in putting the bill i
the namne of rny good friend from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Copp), and the bonourable
senator from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster)
says bie did not sponsor it.
I therefore move tbat the order for the
second reading of tbis bill .sbould be discharged from tbe Order Paper until such time
as some honourable member is willing to
sponsor the bill.

CANADA DAY BILL

Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, when a bill introduced in the otber
house bas been passed there, the Clerk of tbat
bouse brings the bill to tbe Senate with a
message requesting our concurrence. I agree
with the honourable gentleman frorn Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif)' tbat before a House of
Comnmons bill is given first reading here. it
should be sponsored by an honourable senator, and there should be a motion, seconded
by another bonourable senator. However,
over a period of years tbere lias grown up a
practice that wben a Commons bill is presented to the Senate it is, as a matter of
course, read for tbe first time on tbe assumned.
motion of the leader of the government.
Tberefore if, as in tbis case, tbe leader of
the government is not ready to sponsor such
a bill, I think it should be shown on our
Order Paper sirnply as baving corne from tbe
House of Commons with a request for our
concurrence, and it should not be advanced
beyond that stage until a motion bas been
made and seconded.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: If I understand the
honourable senator correctly, this bill sbould
not be on the Order Paper at ail.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: It should appear on tbe
Order Paper as standing for first reading.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It bas had first
reading.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Tbis bill bas had
first reading. Wben a Commons bill cornes
to this chamber with a message stating that
tbe bill bas been passed by the House of
Commons, and requesting the concurrence of
the Senate, the Clcrk reads the title of the
bill and says, "This bill bas been read the
first tirne." Tbe bill under discussion bas
already been dealt with in that way and bas
been read tbe first time. The honourable
leader of the governrnent (Hon. Mr. Robertson) now suggests tbat the bill be allowed
to remain on tbe Order Paper in bis naine,
for a reasonable time, in order that some
honourable senator may sponsor it and move
a motion for second reading, which, would
bave to be seconded.

SECOND

READING POSTPONED

On the Order:
Second Reading of Bill 8, an Act respecting
Canada Day.-(Hon. Mr. Foster.)
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, in asking that this order be allowed to
stand, I wish to explain to the house a chain
of circumstances for which I was partly
responsible.
This bill, whicb is not a governrnent bill,
but a private member's bill, originating in
the other place, came to this chamber during
rny absence. It was placed on the Order
Paper in the namne of the honourable senator
from Westrnorland (Hon. Mr. Copp) witbout
lis consent. Upon my return to Ottawa I
was inadvertently led to understand that the
honourable senator from. Saint John (Hôn,
Mr. Foster) was sponsoring the bill,-and I so
inforrned the Clerk. When the honourable
senator from Saint John drew my attention
to the error I inforrned hirn that at the
first opportunity I would explain the situation and state that this was not so.
The proper procedure for the mover of a
private memher's bill in the other bouse is
to secure a sponsor in this bouse. In this
-instance--this was not done. Today, when the
mover of the bill spoke to me about tbe
-matter, I assured him that personally I did
nlot wish to see the bill dropped from our
Order Paper on a technicality; therefore, I
suggest to thîs bouse tbat tbe order be
allowed to stand in my narne for a reasonable
lengtb of time to enable tbe mover in the
otber place to secure a sponsor-I repeat,
for a reasonable length of time.
Hon. WILLIAM DUEF: Honourable senators, I am sure we appreciate the explanation
given by the leader of the government,' but I
subrnit that before bills appear on tbe Order
Paper of this bouse tbey should comply with
the proper formula. Tbis bill should neyer
bave appeared on our Order Paper until somteone here was ready to sponsor it, and the only
way to deal with it now is to remove it from
the Order Paper until some bonourable niemaber is willing to assume responsibility for it.

EFJIBED EDITION

144

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HARDY: I wish to second the
motion of the honourable gentleman from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif).
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, may
I say another word? The fact that this bill
was given first reading-I presume with the
name of an honourable senator mentioned as
sponsorSome Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: -does not alter the fact
that the honourable gentleman who was first
named as sponsor (Hon. Mr. Copp) repudiated
it and said he had not sponsored it on first
reading. Now the honourable senator who is
shown as sponsor for the second reading stage
(Hon. Mr. Foster) also repudiates the measure.
I therefore move that the bill be removed
from the Order Paper and placed in the hands
of the Clerk until an honourable senator
sponsors it. Notwithstanding what was said
by the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon Mr. Vien), a former Speaker of the
Senate, I submit that the bill should have
remained in the hands of the Clerk until it
was sponsored.
Hon. J. A. LESAGE: Honourable senators,
it seems to me that the suggestion of the honourable leader of the government (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) that the bill remain on the order
paper until such time as the sponsor in the
other bouse has been able to find a sponsor
here, is a good one; and if that suggestion was
made in the form of a motion I desire ta
second it.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, this bill having been adopted by a
large majority of members of the other house
after considerable debate, and having been
discussed in the newspapers and among the
people throughout Canada, I believe it would
be most unfortunate if it were now dropped
from our Order Paper, even temporarily, on a
technicality. Personally I look forward ta
having an opportunity to really get after the
bill. I am sure many other senators are not in
sympathy with this bill at all.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I think that many
people in Canada are under a misapprehension as to the effect and purpose of the bill
and its other features. That at least is what I
gather after having discussed the measure
since it came up in another place. When I
first read in the papers that the bill had been
passed there I took the liberty of wiring to
the honourable leader in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) to say that I thought it should be
deferred here until the people of Canada had
The Hon. The SPEAKER.

an opportunity ta consider it, by which time
we could get the benefit of some public
opinion. I did not say that I should like ta
have it deferred until I could get here and
make a speech about it.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Perhaps I had that in
my mind too. Anyway, within an hour I had
from my honourable friend an assurance that
the bill would not be considered in the Senate
until after the Easter vacation. The situation
as it now exists seems ta me a simple one.
The bill has been given first reading,
whether under a misappreension or not. That
is a fait accompli. Sa far no one has sponsored
the bill, and in these circumstances the bonourable leader has taken it off the doorstep
and said he is willing ta have it stand in
his name for a while. It seems ta me that is
the sensible thing ta do. In due course an
honourable senator will be found ta sponsor
it, and then we can have a full discussion in
this house on a matter of some considerable
importance.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, this occasion may present an opportunity
for us ta do something about revising the
practice with respect ta the first readings of
bills that came ta us from the other house.
It might be better ta have such bills shown
on the Order Paper simply as first readings,
without the name of anyone being given as
sponsor until after the motion for second
reading has been made. That would get over
any difficulty of the kind referred ta by the
honourable gentleman from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff).
I want ta support what has been said by
the honourable gentleman from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris). I think it would
be a bad mistake ta refuse, on any technical
ground, ta have this bill fully discussed in
the Senate. A good many honourable members in the other house voted for the bill,
rightly or wrongly. Ta be quite candid, I
feel that if they had had time ta think it
over the bill might never have been introduced. That is all the more reason why I
want ta have ample opportunity for its consideration here. I dislike being opposed ta
my honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff), but I believe that when be considers the matter more fully he will take
the same position that I am taking. I associate myself with those who say that this bill
should not be dropped because of any
technicality. Let the honourable gentleman
who sponsored it in the other house get some
one ta sponsor it here. I pray that he may

APRIL 30, 1946
get*a sponsor who will make a good speech in
justification of the bill, by way of opening
up a full discussion.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators, the
comments just made by the honourable gentleman from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
and the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) remind me of some stories now coming
out of Europe with reference to captured persons who are accused of war crimes. The reports say that they will most certainly be
given a fair trial, and also that they will most
certainly be shot. There being reasonably good
ground for assuming that this bill is likely to be
treated in a similar manner, I am in accord
with the suggestion made by the honourable
gentleman from Vancouver South.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable members,
perhaps I may be allowed to speak again on
this matter. I have heard with a great deal
of pleasure what the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris) has said, but I
would point out that under the rules of this
house any bill received from the other house
must bear the name of a sponsor before it
appears on our Order Paper. I do not know
how this bill ever appeared on the Order
Paper, for evidently nobody is willing to be
either its putative or its real father.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: That is not the point
under discussion now. We are considering
the suggestion of the leader of the house in
regard to the disposition of the bill.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: If my honourable friend
wants to make a speech he can do so after
I have finished. I submit that the rules of
this house should be observed. I may say
that I am anxious to speak on this billperhaps more anxious than my honourable
friend from Vancouver. I have had a speech
ready now for over a fortnight.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Good'
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes; and if any member
is willing to sponsor the bill, either as its
putative father or as its father in the background, it is all right by me. When someone
is prepared to sponsor the bill, I shall endeavour to show that there is no necessity for
the proposed change and that Dominion Day
is good eiough for all of us. Until then the
bill should be laid on the Clerk's table.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I move the second
reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. BOUCHARD: I second the
motion.

Tr

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Has the honourable senator from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse)
made a formal motion?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Mr. Speaker, I have
tried to move the Senate out of a difficulty.
Two things in connection with this bill are
not altogether clear to my mind. First, I am
wondering how the bill came to be placed in
the names of the two honourable gentlemen
who have turned it down. There is something rather peculiar about that. May I ask
what channel the bill followed in reaching
those honourable senators who have closed
their door against it?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I rise to a point of
order. I do not wish to interrupt my-honourable friend (from Essex, but I would
remind him of the motion submitted by the
honourable senator from Lunenberg (Hon.
Mr. Duif) and seconded by the honourable
senator from Leeds (Hon. Mr. Hardy), and
that there cannot be two motions before the
house simultaneously; either one or the other
must be declared out of order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It has been
moved by the honourable senator from Lunenburg and seconded by the honourable senator from Leeds, that the bill be discharged
from the Order Paper. In the interval the
honourable senator from Essex bas moved
the second reading of the bill. This, I assume
meets the objection of the honourable senator
from Lunenberg. Is it his purpose to withdraw his motion?
Hon. Mr. DUFF:
Mr. Speaker, I am
anxious that somebody should sponsor the bill,
because, as I said to my honourable friend
from Vancouver, I want to make a speech on
it-a speech that I have had ready for the
last two or three weeks. In my humble
capacity as an ordinary layman I am trying
to point out that this bill never should have
appeared on the Order. Paper until such time
as some honourable senator had sponsored it.
Until that time the Clerk should have kept
the bill on his table. Therefore, I submit
again that the bill should be discharged
tonight. Tomorrow, if my honourable friend
here (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) desires to sponsor
the bill, I shall be delighted, for it will give
me an opportunity to state my very strong
objection to the proposal to change the name
of our timehonoured Dominion Day to
Canada Day.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I should like to
correct a statement made by my honourable
friend from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) to
the effect that a bill must have a sponsor
when it comes to this house. When a bill

SENATE
comes from the other place to the Senate it is
called by the Speaker and read the first time
by the Clerk. It is not necessary to have a
sponsor until it comes up for second reading.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, surely, as requested by the honourable
leader of this house, this order can be allowed
to stand.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Honourable members
of the Senate, this orphan must be looked
after. With a motion before the house my
remarks may be out of order, but it seems
to me that the bill having passed the other
house by a substantial majority, should have
consideration in the proper way before this
honourable body.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: The bill at present
stands in my name, and if the mover of the
motion now before the bouse will withdraw
his motion I will move that the order be
discharged and be placed on the Order Paper
for consideration on Thursday next. In order
to bring it properly and decently before this
house I will undertake to move second reading
at that time.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is quite satisfactory
-o me.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The situation
rould be clarified if the motion now before
the house were withdrawn and we followed
the procedure suggested by the honourable
senator from Saint John.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: In view of what has been
said by the honourable senator from Saint
John, I am quite content that the order be
withdrawn and be placed on the Order Paper
for consideration on Thursday next. I am
willing also to withdraw my motion. My point
is that the bill should never have been on
the order paper.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Why should it be discharged? If the honourable senator who is

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the motion
of the Honourable Senator McRae, that the
Standing Committee on Natural Resources be
instructed to examine into the economie value
of metalliferous iined in Canada and report to
the flouse its findings, and to that end have
power to call and examine witnesses and keep a
record of its proceedings.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators,
wlien I moved the adjournment of this debate
before the Easter recess it was not with the
intention of speaking to the motion, but
rather in view of the following remarks made
by the honourable leader of the government
on the 4th of April:
In my official capacity, however, I would request the honourable senators to defer final
action on their motions until after the Easter
recess.
The honourable leader said further as
follows:
As honourable senators probably know, after
the Senate adjourns tomorrow I shall be absent
from the city until the 12th instant, when I
shall return to this chamber for the swearing
in of the Governor General-elect. So before we
adjourn next week I should like to ascertain
from the chairmen of the various committees
wliat demands, as far as they can reasonably be
anticipated. wilI be made upon our clerical and
stenographic services, in order that we may
consider the timing of all this work and make
the necessary arrangements for handling it as
exoeditiously and efficiently as possible.
With those remarks in mind î moved the
adjournrment of the debate. In view of the
fact that the honourable leader has called a
meeting of the chairmen of the standing conmittees of the Senate for tomorrow morning
at 10.30 o'clock, I would ask that the motion
stand until the next sitting of the bouse, when
it can be properly considered.

ADDRESS 0F WELCOME TO BIS EXCELLENCY THE GOVERNOR GENERAL BY
THE PRIME MINISTER OF CANADA
Right Han. W. L. MACKENZIE KING:
It was with great pleasure and no small
measure of pride that the people of Canada
learned some months ago that the King had
appointed Your Excellency to, succeed the
Earl of Athiane as Bis Majesty's representative in Canada.
We were ail delighted at the word of your
sale arrivai at Halifax. We rejoice at your
presence today in Canada's capital.
On hehaîf of the government and&the people
of Canada, I have the honour to extend to
yau and Lady Alexander the warmest of
welcomes to aur country. We in Canada
have sought to make the family and the home
the foundation of our national life. In Your
Excellencies and your children, we recognize
and weicome a happy family.
As Prime Minister it is my priviiege to
express ta Your Exceliency the satisfaction
feit by members af the government, and hy
all Canadians that you have now entered
upon the d-uties af your hîgh office.
In weicoming Your Exceliencies ta Canada,
we are reminded of the visit some years aga
af the King and Queen. The fortitude and
steadfastness dispiayed hy Their Majesties
throughout the long and cruel years af war
are also much in aur thoughts at this- time.
We should like aur firat word ta Your Exceliency ta be one af assurance af Canada's
fidelity ta the crown, and af the devatian and
affection of the Canadian people for Their
Majesties.
We welcome you ta Canada with especiai
warmth hecauseai your close assaciation with
Canada's armed forces, as Commander-mnChief of the Aiiied Armies in Italy, and, later,
as Supreme Allied Commander in the Mcditerranean. The Canadian veterans who served
in the Mediterranean theatres, an land, at sea

or in the air, are eagerly awaiting the apportunity ta express anew the respect and affection
yau inspired in them.
It is our hope that, during your sojourn in
Canada, Yaur Exceilencies may have many
opportunities ta visit ahl parts af aur country.
You will find, wherever you go, a welcoine in
the homes, and a place in the hearts, af the
Canadian peaple.
We are all proud ta recagnîze in Your
Exceiiency one af the great miiitary leaders in
*world history.
It is af interest ta recali .today that in the
war af 1914-18 you gave early signs af the
miiitary genius and leadership which in the
recent warld war you dispiayed in such exceptionai measure. The power ta anticipate developments and the capacity ta inspire confidence
.bave been outstanding characteristies af your
career.
The free nations have reason ta he grateful
for the manner in which, in the years between
the wars, you devoted yaurseii ta preparation
and training for high responsibiiities. In thase
years you acquired a wide command1 of

rearguard action you fought in the jungles of
Burma; the calm courage with which, at a
moment when Egypt seemed all but lost, you
assumed command in the Middle East. From
that moment, from El Alamein to Tunis, from
Sicily to the Alps, the forces you organized and
directed moved forward, steadily and relentlessly, to final victory. Your success in
welding together the fighting forces of many
nations is evidence of the highest qualities of
statesmanship.

During the years of war, Your Excellency
commanded the confidence of armies of many
nations. As a trusted servant of the crown,
you also enjoyed, in full measure, the confidence of their parliaments. That confidence
was shared by none more than by the parliament and people of Canada. It is with equal
confidence that, today, members of both houses
of parliament welcome Your Excellency in your
new capacity as the representative, in Canada,
of His Majesty, the King.

SENATE

Trusting that you will find the material of
value to you and thanking you for your interest
and co-operation, we remain,
Yours respectfully,
W. K. St. John,
Executive Secretary.
It is not my intention to weary the house
by reading all the materiai I have, but I do
wish to refer to some portions of'it. The
memorandum referred to is dated April 30,
1946, and reads as follows:
This is a subject which should be considered
from a long term as well as a short term point
of view. Any hasty action, inspired by "wishful
thinking" to the effect that ierely by amending
a statute we should all have a plentiful spread
for our bread would end in disillusionment, and
may have long lasting and harmful effects upon
a great Canadian industry.
The Dairy Industry, taken as a whole, is a
very considerable one in the total economy of
Canada. It represents a $400,000,000 yearly
business and in 1945 returned to farmers a
value of $320,000,000. In addition it provides
employment in many allied industries such as
manufacturing, distribution, transportation and
the making of supplies and equipment. It bas
been estimated that 17 per cent of all the
people in this country depend on the dairy industry, directly and indirectly for their livelihood, an important element in the labour situation in Canada.
Butter is an important factor in the Canadian agricultural economy, and as such it has
a direct bearing on the w-hole internal economy
of this country. Just about one-half of all the
milk produced in Canada goes into butter. In
1945, 8,119.163,000 lbs. of milk were utilized in
manufacturing this product. Place this lialf of
our total milk production in competition with
a substitute, and it is bound to suffer in a price
comparison.
Oleomargarine in normal times
when the ails come from across the Pacifie in
tankers and are movedi here in tank-car lots,
can he produced very cheaply and admittedly
could be sold cheaper than butter. Butter consumption would be unable to meet such competition and as butter uses half of all milk produced
in Canada, what happens to it in terms of either
price or consumption is bound to influence al]
ather types of dairying.

In normal tines there is a balance which bas
always been maintained between the various
branches of the industry. atd it lias been fournid
in the past that to dislocate any one of these
branches soon reflects unfavourably on the
whole. Making less butter would throw more
milk into the fluid markets. into concentrated
milk plants or into cheese factories. Tiese can
only absorb so inucli without disastrous effects
on the entire prico and marketing structure.
Perhaps the effects miglt not lie noticeable as
rapidly in the east as on the prairies, but in the
final analysis they would be juîst as harnful. For
years an effort lias been made to encourage
mixed farming in the western provinces, and to
a degree this bas been successful.
May I interject the information that of
Canada's total milk production-and of course
butter comes from milk-the three prairie
provinces produce 30 per cent, Ontario and
Quebec 60 per cent, British Columbia 6 per
cent, and the maritime provinces 4 per cent.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

From this one can readily appreciate that
dairy farming is an important industry on the
prairie provinces.
The memorandum goes on to say:
Dairying bas become a big farm industry in
many sections out there, and there are but two
major outlets for milk-the fluid milk trade and
the creameries. Much of the butter sold in the
east during winter months comes from the three
prairie provinces. Depress that market by allowing a cheap substitute and great harm might be
donc to a prairie industry whieh it bas taken
years to build. Production in the western provinces declined substantially in 1945. The discouraging effect enactment of this bill would
have on our producers would undoubtedly result
in a further decline of very serious proportions.
Conditions in Canada and in other countries
as far as this butter-oleomargarine argument is
concerned, are not comparable. Britain for
instance, is a dairy importing country, while
Canada is an exporting country. i the United
States the butter industry has never made
sufficient to supply a demand of anything like
the propoportions we have in Canada. As a
matter of fact the United States pre-war per
capita consmption of both butter and oleomargarine was only about two-thirds of our
per capita consomption of butter alone. In
New Zealand butter can be produced so cheaply
owimg to almost ideal weather and pasture conditions, that substitutes manufactured from
imported oils offer little price competition.
Here in Canada we have deliberately built up
an industry which lias become vital to our
whole agricultural and internal economy, an
industry which has to compete ta a certain
extent with world prices as a result of a liimîited
export, and which would bu seriously threatened
by iiports from loiw priced labour countries.

It is being argued that oleoimargarine is
allowed in such countries as the United States
and Britain, and lias not caused any great
depression to the dairv industry there. This
iay bu truc but the situation is entirely different in Canada. In ieither the United States
nor in Britain does the dairy industry iormailly
produce sufficient butter to supply their populations with antything like the quaintities whici
Canadians norially tise. The Canadian dairv

present, that it can do this. It cati normîally

pay, as indicated by highs sales here conpared
with other countries.

30.8 potinds per capita per year. As rcently
as 1942 the per capita consumption was 33-14
pounds-more butter than is usel by the people
of practically any other and in the world.
This brings out a fact worth noting. It is
argued that since the butter-or rather dairyindustry canînot supply our necds at present it
should ihave no objections to oleomsargarine.
h'lie fact is that the present shortage of butter
has to a veryv considerable extent been the
result of a deliberate plan. We created the
shortage by a subsidy structure and by price

MAY 1, 1946
controls in order to supply Britain with huge
quantities of cheese, and ceoncentrated milk,
at present te the extent of 125 million pounds
of cheese and 600,000 cases of evaporated milk
annually. We do net have all the butter that
our people could buy today because it was
planned that way. We could easily produce the
butter, but the United Kingdom would have to
go with considerably less of our other dairy
products. Normally Canadian creameries can supply all
the butter this country can consume. We have
never before had a serious butter shortage in
Canada, but we have had plenty of butter surpluses which caused great trouble within the
dairy industry. There is no doubt but that in
normal times farmers and creameries can supply
all the butter this country will require, and could
do so today if it were net for our large cheese
contract commitments with the United Kingdom.
Oleomargarine is made from a variety of fats
-vegetable and animal. Some small proportion
of these can be produced in Canada. notably soya
beans, and some beef fat might be used. There
is, however, this point to consider. Making
oleomargarine available might encourage a sizeable soya bean production in Canada, which
might be very hard to maintain in normal times
when supplies of the much 'more cheaply produced palm, coconut and other cils can b e imported. Oleomargarine making would be a matter of big business in the hands of large corporations with world-wide ramifications and resources. It is to be expected that they would
buy in the cheapest markets.
On the other hand butter making in Canada
is a matter of hundreds of thousands of small
business men-farmers and creamery operators.
During the war years the farmers of Canadaand this applies in particular to dairy farmers
-have been urged and pleaded with to produce
more, and then still more. The dairymen responded to the extent of about two billion
pounds more milk per year in 1945 as compared
with 1939. Having built up this extra production they are now threatened with a move which
would endanger half the entire milk production
directly and all of it indirectly. Does this represent a worthy manner of extending our appreciation to the farmers of this country? Would
such action inspire farmers to even greater
production efforts?
It has been suggested that oleomargarine might
be legalized in this country on a temporary
basis, say for two years, or while the present
butter shortage exists. Then in a year or two
we could have this whole argument over again.
But, and this is important, in the meantime the
of oleomargarine would be

able damage
Now from the short term point of view. It
may be true that a negligible quantity of oleomargarine could be produced and placed on sale
in Canada almost immediately. This would,
however, have to be diverted from the supplies
already allocated to this country by the Combined Food Board and now being used in the
form of shortening, cooking cils, or salad oils.
The only alternative would be te import extra
oils, and it is extremely unlikely that at the
present time the Combined Food Boárd would
allow Canada extra cils to make the millions of
pounds of oleomargarine which would be required to help the butter situation here.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: What is his name?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: St. John. The president

at Russell, Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is a circular letter, is it?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it is not a circular
letter. It is signed by the National Dairy
Council of Canada and the Dairy Farmers of
Canada. When I spoke here on the motion to
adjourn the debate I said that I would consult
the dairy farmers. They have a representative in Manitoba, and the president of the
National Dairy Council also lives in that
province. I sent for them and asked them
te come to my office, where I discussed the
whole situation with them.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Did you consult any of
the consumers of this country?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I talk to them every day.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What did they say?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Not a single man in
Winnipeg ever mentioned oleomargarine to
me or asked me to vote for it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You did not consult
any consumers about it, did you?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: They knew the matter
was up before parliament.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But you consulted representatives of the dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There are as many men
in Winnipeg who know me as there are men
in Waterloo who know you, and that is
saying quite a lot. But nobody in Winnipeg
mentioned oleomargarine to me.

I said I would itry to get some information in
Winnipeg, and now you are objecting to what

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? He gave some
figures showing the production of milk in 1945.
Would he give the figures for milk in 1939,
and for butter in 1939 and 1945?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have already given
some of those figures, but I will give them
again after I finish reading this.
. As a matter of fact the Oils and Fats Administrator of the Wartime Prices and Trade Board
states that it will be at least two years before
the world supply position is adequate to justify
the allocation of larger quantities of oils.% Accordingly, if made from supplies already allocated te the country, it would mean that housewives would get a little oleomargarine at the
expense of still shorter supplies of shortening
and cooking oils. As the supply of the latter
does not nearly meet demand, where would the
advantage lie? A few people might get a pound
or two of oleo, but otliers would be able to
obtain even less cooking fats.
If oleomargarine should be legalized in Canada, problems and difficulties would also arise involving the protection of the publie against
allowing oleo to be represented on the market
as butter. The golden colour of our butter is
almost a trade mark, it is traditional and appreciated by all. In certain countries where oleomargarine is allowed it lias been found that
manufacturers trade on the known preference of
the public for this golden colour. They want to
colour their margarine so that it will look like
butter. In other words they want to lead the
public to believe that margarine is butter by
colouring it to a hue traditionally associated with
butter the world over.
Oleomargarine is white, or nearly se in its
natural form, and bas an appearance not unlike
lard. It has been claimed that in the United
States margarine competes freely with butter.
That is not entirely correct. There are a multitude of federal and state laws which govern
its sale, and many of these are aimed at this
question of colouring. Tliere are several specifie
state taxes imposed on margarine and some
states prohibit its sale entirely. There is a
ten cent a pound federal tax on oleomargarine
whieh bas been artificially coloured to look like
butter. In some instances manufacturers get
around this by sell'ing white margarine and
putting a package of colouring in each carton.
Similar difficulties are experienced in other
countries which permit the product. They were
experienced in this country during the period
December 1, 1917 to August 31, 1923, when
margarine was permitted.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Should the sale of oleomargarine be legalized,
an almost impossible policing job will be necessary in order to protect the public. This means
more regulations, more interference in business,
something which we are trying to get away from
at the present time.
This is more than an academie question. There
is more involved than just getting a few million
pounds of oleomargarine to tide Canada over
a period when butter happens to be in relatively
short supply. It is a question which affects
vitally almost all of the farmers in this country, and farming is still one of Canada's great
industries. Farming cannot be depressed without the effects being felt in every other industry
and by every person in this country.

My honourable friend from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) asked me for statistics on the
production of milk and butter. As I said,
the total production of milk in 1945 was the
largest in the history of Canada, 17,620,000,000.
In that year the butter production totalled
346,824,000 pounds.
Now let me give honourable members some
further figures on butter production: 1941,
368,000,000 pounds; 1942, 363,000,000 pounds;
1943, 367,000,000 pounds; 1944, 352,000,000
pounds; 1945, 346,000,000 pounds.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Have you figures
showing the milk production in those years?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. Here is the milk
production in pounds, in round figures:
1939,
15,787,000,000;
1940,
15,999,000,000;

1941,
16,549,000,000;
1942, 17,488,000,000;
1943,
17,518,000,000;
1944, 17,604,000,000;
1945, the highest year in the history of the
industry, 17,620,000,000.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Will the honourable
member give the cheese production for the
same years?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. Here are the
figures for the total pounds of cheese produced in Canada:
1944, 181,000,000 pounds; 1942, 208,000,000
pounds.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Will the honourable
senator tell us the source of his information?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, the Dairying Statistics of Canada, published under the authority
of the Hon. James A. MacKinnon, Minister
of Trade and Commerce. The figures were
prepared by P. H. Ferguson, M.Sc., in charge
of dairy statisties in the Agricultural Branch
of the Bureau of Statistics.

.APRIL 30,1%46
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Will my honourable
friend give the comparable figures of milk
consumption as between 1939 and 1945?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I have some information
here. As 1 said 1 would do when I asked for
the adj ournment of the debate, I wrote to,
Mr. Cordon, Chairman of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board. I got his reply when
I arrived here. He enclosed a copy of a very
interesting letter that had been written on
the lst of March, before this bill was introduced, answering an inquiry from British
Columbia. Early in September it was noticed
that butter prodûction was falling off and
fluid milk consumption was increasing.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If my honourable
friend will permit me, I may say that the
consumption of fluid milk as between 1939
and 1045 increased by more than 500,000,000
pints. I. suggest to hini that instead of going
into butter, this mik went into consumaption.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, there, was. more
butter produced.
Hon. Mr. ýCRERAR: No.
Hon. Mr. HIAIG: Well, there is very little
difference. The butter production in 1945 was
342,000,000 pounds; in 1939 it was 335,000,000
pounds.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR : I suggest to my
honourable friend that the increase in milk
consumption of more than 500,00,000 pinta
as between 1939 and 1945 explains the decrease
in butter production as between those same
years. It doca not show that the dairy
industry is on the road to ruin.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The dairy industry in
1939 produced W5,000,000 pounds of milkHon. Mr. CRERAIR: Butter.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, butter; and in 1945,
346,000,000 pounds. The estimated consumption of milk in Canada in 1939 was 3,500,000,000
pinta.
An Hon. SENATOR: Pinta?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Pinta. In 1944 the consumption amounted to 4,281,000,000 pinta. I
inquired about that feature because I wanted
to know if the, experience generally acros
Canada was the sanie as my own. On inquiry
I Iearned that the consumption of fluid milk
commenced to increase in September and October of last year. This increase, I believe, can
very largely be accounted for by the return
of the soidiers to this country. Speaking from
my personal experience with one returned man,
I can say that although the number of persons
in my househoid only increased from three
63268-12J

153

te four, the mulk consumption was doubled.
My son was discharged on September 19, and
from that date on the milk consumption in
the home doubIed. That boy consumed the
extra supply. The returned men who visited
hini said that overseas they were ail dying
for a glass of milk and could not get it.
Another reason for the increase that I should
like to mention is that last year the prairie
farmers had their first onslaught of demande
for income tax paymenta. The reactioli was
very sudden, and showed itself also in the
hog production and other branches of farming
in the west. Immediately the farmers learned
that they had to pay extra income tax they
sought to reduce their profits, and the first
branch of agriculture to, show the effect was
mik production. In some parts of Saskatche'wan and Alberta the dry year also had
an effect in bringing about a food shortage.
Before I forget, may I give honourable
senators figures for butter production in
January? For the information of my honourable friend froni Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock) I may say these are officiai. figures
ohtained froni tbe Wartime Prices and Trade
Board. The average butter production for
the month of January during the years 1941
to 1945 was 11,600,000 pounds. In January
1946 production totalied 9,640,000 pounds.
Hon. Mr. HAYiDEN: Is that the amount
produced or consumed?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the amount produced. The domestic disappearance of butter
Àn January this year was greater by 1,700,000
pounds than in the sanie month iast year;
in February it was greater by 2,000,000
pounds. Froni these figures I conclude that
the dairy industry in Canada made a magnificent contribution to the winning of the
war.
Some Hon. SENATORSl: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The dairy producers have
met the demands through thick and thin.
They have been the backbone of the farming
industry throughout ail tumes. As a smali boy
on the fanm I cannot remember a tume when
the mothers did not make butter and sell
it on the local market. Later, they sold the
fiuid miik and the creamn. Many fanmera
could not have survived tbe years of crop
failure but for the dairy industry. Any
honourabie senator who bas any particular
feelings for the struggling men and women
of the back townships of our country knows
that since confederation dairy products have
been the backbone that sustained them.
Some Hon. SENATOIIS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: There is no use my honoureble friend from Churchill (Hon. Mn.

go back to any of those provinces for election
to parliament can stand up and vote for this
bill. It is true that the bonourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) asked

me about it.

There is one other matter 1 want to touch
upon for a moment or two, and then I have
done. The argument has not been used
directly in this debate, but it seems to be in
the minds of some honourable gentlemen, that
this bill would be politically unwise and
might have unfortunate repercussions in some
of the rural constituencies. 0f course, we are
faced with the fact that, owing to the uneven
distribution of electoral ridings from the
point of view of population, the rural vote
bas greater weight than the city vote. We
have even been treated to memories of the
raucous cries of "<New Zealand butter" in the
general election of 1930. That question was
raised, I think, iD a most amusing speech by

ta consider this matter solely on grounds of
broad general principle-whether it will operate for the greatest good of the greatest
number of our people, regardless of local or
sectional considerations. I must confess, hionourable senators, that looking at the bull iD
that light, and in that light alone, I feel that
it laya down a principle which deserves my
support; and I believe that it will operate to
the advantage of the immense majority of
our people. I intend, therefore, to vote for
the, second reading of the bill.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, from the outset of this debate I have
held certain ideas somewhat different from
those that have been mentioned se far, and I
should like to bring them to your attention.
I was very much interested iD the speech
of the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) as to the effect that this bull might have
on the dairy îndustry, and I was equallY
interested in what the honourable senator from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) lias juet said
from the opposite standpoint. Their arguments
in the main were directed te the needs of the
different elements of our population. In diseussing this measure I submit t.hat we mnuat
look at the world situation following a long
and most destructive war. If we permit the
importation, sale and manufacture of margarine, where can we get the article iteif or the
basic materials for its manufacture? I took
the liberty a f ew days ago of asking the
Wà.rtime Prices and Trade Board for a statement of the world situation in regard te the
raw materials, the edible fats and ouas and oleo,
wbich enter into the manufacture of oleomargarine. This is the information I received:
The world fats and oils supply position is
extremely serious. At the present time world
supplies are approximately 62 per cent of
screened and reduced requirements. This serjous
supply position is due to the f ollowing factors:
(a) Lack of production in Europe, which continent normally supplied 50 per cent of lier own
requirements.
Its production today is down te a emaîl
fraction of what it was before the war.
(b) 'Lacli of trading goods necessary to pro!note production and sales by native populations
in suc h areas of production as Afrîca, Malaya
and South America.

(c)ý Disorganization in South East Asia,
China, Korea, and the Pacific Islands.
In pre-war days those countries sent large
quantities of vegetable oils te Europe and to
this continent.
(d) Drouglit and famine in Âustralia and
India, respectively.

158

SENATE

The situation in Australia is so serious that
that country will not be a factor in helping
to supply Europe's wheat requirements. Honourable members are aware of the famine in
India. As a resuit of the dire distress there
we cannot expect any of the vegetable ails
which formerly came from. that country.
(e) Exceptionally poor, vwhale oil returns,
purportedly due to unfavourable weather conditions. and to beauy oi films on Antaretie
waters, directly resulting from marine warf are.
In short, the world situation is sucb that
neither Canada nor the United States, or any
other country, can expect to import edible fats
and oils in any quantity.

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: No, of fats and oils,

During the war, in co-operation with the
T
U nited States and Great Britain, we appointed
a Combined Food Board composed of representatives fromn the three countries. The participating countries have followed the recommendations of that board, which bas control
over edible fats and oils and other foods
required by the countries now suffering fromn
starvation.
If we wanted to import margarine from. the United States, as was suggested in the early stages of this discussion,
the Food Board would probably intervene.
That of course applies more to the local
situation.
1 might say that if we permit the manufacture, importation and sale of oleomargarine at this time, we cannot get the necessary raw materials, and the only result wvill
be to encourage a black market in margarine
across the international border. That undoubtedly is sometbing we should do our very best
to avoid.
Now, as to our domestic situation, Canada
is dependent upon world supplies for approximately 50 per cent of bier fats and oiîs, both
edible and inedible. Almost our entire requirements of' edible oiîs, derived from soya beans,
peanuts, cottonseed and sunflower seed, are
imported. Truc, we have a small production
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR.

of soya bean and sunflower seed oul in Canada;
but whereas our reduced requirements for
edible purposes to meet present quotas
total more than 80,000,000 pounds, this production amounts to less tban 4,000,000 pounds.
The domestie situation has been further
aggravated by reduced lard production. This
year we anticipate an estimated production
of 40,000,000 pounds of commercial lard as
against an estimated requirement of 88,000,000
pounds.
It is interesting to compare the
presenit
production
estimates
with
the
amounts of 114,000.000 pounds and 120,000,000
pounds actually produced in 1943 and 1944
rcspectively.
In view of the estimates of
production and requirement. it is apparent
that in the latter part of this year and the
early part of next year shortening and similar
commodities will be in very mach shorter
supply than at any time in the past.
It is impossible for Canada to import increased quantities of fats and oils by reason of
the fact that the Fats and Oils Committee of
the Combined Food Board allocates world
supplies te claimant members on the basis
of screencd and reduced past performance. At
the present time our allocation is small, and
barely sufficient to meet the scaled-down
quotas for shortening and other industrial
ojis that may be required by the bakeries.
canneries and other allied food industries.
There is no hope of obtaining an increase in
our allocation hefore 1948, and it is unlikely
that the quantities available to Canada will
be sufficient to place us on our pre-war level
of requirements.
Confronted with that situation and being
conscious of the needs of the starving peoples
of the world, I think this bill is ill-timed. We
should not be considering a measure of this
nature whien the people of the world are
famisbcd and lacking food which we have
in abundance.
While it may inconvenience
a few people to have less butter on thenr
tables, a consideration of the world situation
should make us realize thagt we in Canada hav e
been very fortunate.
It is intcresting to note that those mo'.t
closely connecte(l with the industrial centres'
are anxious to have the bill passed. May I
read to the bouse a newspaper item of April
6,' dated at Montreal, one of the largeat industrial centres in Canada. It is as follows:
In ansu er to Pope Pins' appeal for aid to the
starving people of Europe. Arclibishop Charbonneau of Moutreal launchied a week-long campaign. He called on the chidren to colleet the
most nourishing tinned food for shipment overseas. The flrst day of the campaign 25,000 tins
were collected from Montreal schools alonie and
the second day 40.000.

It is estimated that by

the time aIl collectionts have heen made 200,000
tins of food will have heeil donated.

_MAY 1, 1946
While the article refers to food generally,
we know that two of the elements of food are
fats and oils, both of which are particularly
scarce in Europe 'today. Canada, alongside the
other United Nations played a magnificient
part in winning the war. If she is to play her
part in winning the peace she must now be
willing to supply a fair share of the food
that is so badly needed by ithe famished
peoples of Europe and other parts of the
world.
As recently as April 11, the Ontario Division
Council of the Canadian Red Cross Society
was told by Divisional Commissioner John A.
Marsh that 54,000,000 people died during the
winter of 1945-46 for lack of food. That figure
is almost unbelievable. We are told now
that in the coming year starvation will cause
a greater loss of life than the recent war. I
submit, honourable gentlemen, that with facts
like these staring us in the face we should
not be considering the repeal of the Dairy
Industry Act to allow the manufacture of an
article the elements of which are so badly
needed in other parts of the world. Only a
few nights ago we heard .the President of the
neighbouring republic broadcasting an appeal
for food, particularly edible fats and oils, so
that UNRRA might feed the starving peoples
of Europe. Three years hence, if the situation
bas changed, we can consider such a bill
dispassionately and in the light of local conditions; but at the present time, 'for the reasons
I have given, I am opposed to this measure.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. C. B. HOWARD: Honourable senators,
before a vote is taken I feel it my duty to
express my views on this important subject.
I come from the Eastern Townships of Quebec,
an area represented in this house by the
honourable senator for Bedford (Hon. Mr.
Nicol) and myself. In that area is to be found
the finest dairy country in Canada, notwithstanding the fact that it also embraces a
highly industrialized section in the centre of
which lies the city of Sherbrooke, known as
"La Reine des Cantons de lEst."
I nake these preliminary observations to
assure honourable senators that I am not
prejudiced. If I were to support this bill, and
by so doing make more fats available, either
in the form of butter or margarine, the city
people in my district would be highly pleased.
But I am definitely opposed to the bill for
reasons which I shal give.
The honourable senator from Peterborough
(Hon. Mrs. Fallis) in speaking to this house
recently said that if this bill were amended to
cover a temporary period of shortage she

would support it, otherwise she would vote
against the bill. That seems to me to express
the situation very well.
We are short of butter, as everyone knows,
but would the passing of this bill remedy the
situation? In my opinion, it would not, for
it would not increase our supply of butter,
neither would it give us any margarine. 'Margarine is composed of many ingredients, but
the two main elements are 23j per cent of
milk and 20 per cent of fats. It bas been said
that milk is at the peak of production, and is
being used in many forms, such as fluid milk,
cheese, dried milk and so forth. If margarine
were made in Canada it would absorb that
23j per cent of milk which now goes into
other products. I am sure no honourable
senator in this bouse, knowing the trend of
the times and what is happening in our schools,
would ask that we take away from the kiddies
the milk they are getting at their noon-day
meal in order to produce margarine.
Another point is this. Under our present
industrial system we have changed our mode
of living, and it is now impossible for factory
employees to go home for lunch. What is happening across Canada is this: the employee
bas a good breakfast at home, at noon he has
a bottle of milk and a sandwich, and at night
he has his dinner at home. Is there a senator
in this chamber who would curtail the supply
of milk to the working man in order to make
margarine?
I do not propose to quote many figures,
but I shall mention a few. In 1939 Canada's
consumption of fluid milk was 4,802,269,000
pounds; in 1944 it was 5,629,667,000 pounds,
and in 1945 it was 5,723,154,000 pounds. In
other words, during the war years, when the
boys were overseas fighting for us and there
remained on the farms only the over-age
fathers and mothers of families to milk sixteen and eighteen cows a day as their share
in the war effort, we increased our fluid milk
production all along the line. We must remember that margarine requires 231 per cent
of milk.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:
May I ask my
honourable friend what .is his authority for
that statement? The information is startling
to me.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I shall deal with
that in a moment.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It did not come from
the Dairy Council?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: No, it is not from the
Dairy Council.
In every pound of margarine, besides milk,
there is from 20 to 26 per cent of animal

160

SENATE

or vegetable fats. Now, where do we get
our Canadian fats? We get them from our
own production or we import them from
other countries, mostly in the southern
latitudes. Under one of the most efficiently
managed departments of any government we
are stripping Canada today of every available
particle of fat.
In considering our imports let us not forget
that we are a member of the Food Board.
The oils and fats section of the board, consisting of representatives of Great Britain, Canada,
United States and many other countries,
met in Washington a year ago. At that time
we succeeded in obtaining the right to import
from any place where we could buy it 200,000,000 pounds of fats. We bought every ounce
of fat we could secure, and in 1944 our imports
amounted to 170,000,000 pounds.
Last Saturday the same section of the Food
Board met in Washington and our delegate'
arrived back on Monday night. While I am
not privileged to give information that has
not yet been made public, I may say it is
hoped that this year again our allotment of
fats will be 200,000,000 pounds. We would be
doing well, though, if we received 170,000,000
pounds, as we did last year. The fats situation
in Canada, the United States and Great
Britain is more difficult at present than at any
time during the war.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Yet in the face of
that situation we have such a bill as this
introduced here.
Let me quote another figure, in answer to
a question asked by the honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). Before the war we had to import 60 per cent
of the fats used in Canada, but during the
war our imports were about 50 per cent,
as they still are. These figures are official.
Since the manufacture of oleomargarine would
require fats that cannot be obtained in
Canada or imported, what is the point in
introducing a bill to legalize such manufacture?
Now I come to the question of importing
oleomargarine itself from the United States,
which would be our only possible source of
supply. The Combined Food Board bas fixed
our allotment of fats and would not permit
a single pound of the product to be exported
from that country to Canada. We could not
manufacture oleomargarine and we could not
import it, yet we are discussing this famous
bill.
The price fixed by the O.P.A. for butter
in the United States is 58 cents a pound,
and for margarine 29 cents a pound. But
Hon. Mr. HOWARD.

if you go to any store over there-not to a
black market-and buy a pound of butter,
as I did two weeks ago, you will pay 80
cents a pound; and for margarine you will
have to pay 75 cents.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Would my honourable
friend permit me to interrupt? I have definite
information that in the city of Chicago the
price of butter is 55 cents a pound, and of
margarine, 25 cents a pound; and that in the
State of Michigan the respective prices are
50 cents and 25 cents.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: There may be a
difference between the Chicago and the New
York markets. I hold in my hand a telegram
sent to me by our own information bureau
in New York city. It reads:
OPA ceiling price best quality butter fiftyeight cents oleomargarine twenty-nine.
Hon. Mr. EULER: There is nothing to
prevent sales below the ceiling.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I myself bought a
pound of butter in the United States two
weeks ago, and I know that the current price
is 80 cents. Margarine was then selling at
75 cents. There are not enough fats in the
United States to permit the production of
sufficient margarine to meet the demand, and
when people can get any at all they will pay
almost as much for it as for butter. As was
said the other day by .the honourable gentleman from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nicol), we could
only increase our importation of fats at the
expense of countries whose need is greater
than ours.
Let us examine some of the reasons for the
present butter shortage. Last fall the price
received by our western farmers for grains
increased considerably, so much so that in
eastern Canada feed went up by several cents
a hundred pounds. Our dairy farmers, who
had donc their share during the war, decided
that the best thing to do was to let the cows
go dry when they were taken in off the grass
in October and November. Another reason
is the shortage of help and the high cost of
wha.t help bas been available. Here I want
to explain that a great deal of credit is due
to our farmers for what they did to keep up
the production of foodstuffs during the war,
though deprived of the help of their boys
overseas and handicapped by unfavourable
conditions of various kinds.
I want now to touch on Canada's position as
one of the United Nations during the war.
Seven days after war was first declared we
made our own declaration of war, voluntarily
and on the advice of our own ministers. I
happened to be in the other house at the
time. At a meeting that was held almost

MAY 1, 1946

immediately afterwards certain foods were
said to be required'froma Canada as part of
our contribution to a peak war effort. Among
these foods was cheese. It is generally admitted
that our government did a wonderful job
during the war, and I congratulate th*emupon
it. What steps were taken to increase the
production of cheese? On fluid milk that
went into the manufacture of cheese, farmlers were paid a bonus of 30 cents per
hundred pounds, -and a b'onus of 2 cents a
pound was given on the cheese. In addition
there was a supplementary bonus of 2 cents
a pound froma thé provincial governments of
Ontario and Quebec.
I will give some figures to show how our
exports of cheese increased:
Pounds

1944 ........................
1945 ........................

90,944,800
131,429,2,00
138,290,000

Now I want to refer to our exporte of
canned milk, a subject that has hardly been
mentioned except by my honourable friend
from Bedford (Hon. Mr. Nîcol). Just prior to
the war the Carnation Milk Company, after
having looked ail over the country for the best
place to establish a factory, decided to build
atHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Sherbrooke.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Yes, Sherbrooke.
They estirnated that in ordýer to break even
they would require a minimum supply -of so
many hundred thousand pounds of m-ilk, but
duri¶Ig the seven years of 'their operations they
have used five times that estimated quantity.
The factory lias been a great boon to our
community. Here are figures sliowing the
increase in exports of sweetened and unsweetened canned milk:
pounds
1939 .........................
1945 .........................

26,148,500
89,462,700

Every can wlien opened overseas contained
good fresh Canadian milk.
The present bonus on the production of
milk, frorn October 1 to April 30, is 55 cents
per hundred pounds, and from May 1 to
September 30, 35 cents. During 1945 the consumption of milk in Canada was one billion
pounds more than in ý1939.
Our own milk company in Sherbrooke sold
350,000 more pounds o6f snilk ini 1945 than in
1944, and 10,000 more pou!nds of butter. The
winter price for milk, 3.5 test, is $3 per hund..
red pounds. That is equal to 62 cents per
pound for butter.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Out of that price
of $3 the producer lias to pay express charges,
bas he not?

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: It ail depends upon
where hie is located. If lie is away from the
plant lie lias to psy for transportation. Thst
does not alter the fact that $3 per hundred
pounds of milk equals 62 cents a pound. for
butter. But the price of butter is 44 cents,
and until the recent increase it was only 39
cents. The reason these prices are out.-of lime
is tliat we were concentrating on tlie production
of cheese.
Hon. M-r. CAMPBELL: Does tlie lionourable gentleman say that is why the production
cf butter has fallen off?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Certainly.
In the course of the debate it was stated by
an honourable member that the cow population of Canada had decreased. I went to some
pains to check up on the situation, and I found
the actual number of dairy cows, giving milk,
to 'be as foilows:
3,933,300
1939 .......................
4,012,600
1945 .........................
So in spite of the fact that ini 1945 we
exported 45,889 cows, our cow population
increased as I have indicated.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I arn sorry ta
interrupt my lionourable friend again. Did
we do that in 1945?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Yes; I gave the
difference between 1939 and 1945.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Has my lionourable
friend the figures for 1944?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Yes; tliey are a
littie lower.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Lest week I
was told that the cow population liad
decreased.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Our cow population
from 1944 to 1946 decreased a little. In 1944
it was 4,888,000; in 1945, 4,012,6W0.
Now, let us look at the matter from another
standpoint. I say this good-naturedly because
I see my honourable friend over there wlio is
interested in the potato business. Tlie ceiling
price lias been taken off potatoes. Th'le potato
grower works eiglit liours a day for six montlis
in tlie year, and is making money. The price
of tlie farmer's wlieat lias been raised considerably. He puts in ten hours a day for
six months of the year, and lie, too, is making
moneyr. But the dairy farmer, wlio pute in
twelye hours a day twelve months in the
year ia not making any money unless lie
happena to lie selling fluid milk.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I was surprised at
some of the statements made by my lionourable friend from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Huges-

SENATE

.62

sen). Neither the steel industry, the automobile industry nor any other industry ern.ploys 43 per cent of our population, but our
farmers do represent that percentage. Although
the implement manufacturers have been
allowed te increase their prices by 12-ý per
cent, yet the prices of dairy produets are
fixed. But we have accepted this control
because we are trying te do our share in
preventing inflation.
We have heard about shortages. Wben you
consider that the boys back frorn overseas
cannot get bouses or apartments and their
only alternative is te share a home with
three or four families; wben you consider the
paper shortage, wbich makes it impossible te
publish newspapers more than seven-eîghtbs
or three-quarters of their regular sîze, and
that even if they could publish full size. the
extra profit would go in income tax; when you
censider the automobile shortage, whicb makes
it impossible for you te get a new automobile;
wben you consider the shortage in nylons is
sucb that after standing in a queue for tbree or
four bours yen may probably net get any

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh I oh I
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Wben you consider
ahl these shortages, is it net surprising that
merely because of a shortage of butter we

should want te disorganize the whole political system of this country? The honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler)
quoted a speech made by Dr. Toîrnie. Wben
that speech was made I was a member of the

House of Commons and the doctor was on
the opposition benches. I arn confident that
if he were alive today and a member of the

want a bill like this let them introduce it
there, pass it, and send it te us. This session

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: No, but to the samne
extent. Let us not now depart from that
practice and send over to the House of Comnmons a bill that I dlaim we have no riglit
to send to that body of elected members. I
eubmit it is futile to proceedý with this bill, for
the reason that we can get no margarine from
the United States; neither can we gat any
,fats from that quarter with which to manufacture margarine.
The hour is too late for me to dîscuss the
effeet of this bill on ,the dairy industry. I
could talk to you about that for at least
another hour. Do honourable members know
why pork production dropped so low a year
,ago in spite of every effort to encourage production? I will tell you why. The farmers
of this country are the canniest and the best
people you can find anywhere, and they
remembered that between 1930 and 1935 the
price of pork went down to 2î cents a pound.
So they said to themselves, "When this war
is over we are not going to be caught with
a lot of pigs on our hands and the price of
pork at rock bottom." And they did not
raise any pigs. If this bill were enacted it
would produce *a similar effect on our dairy
farmers. To them the prospect would be
terrible, and they *would either export their
cows or cease producing butter. Let us al
vote against the pass4ge of this bill, then 1
think everything will go along a lot smoother.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I should like to ask
my honourable friend two questions. He
stated as one of the arguments against the
manufacture of oleomargarine that it would
divert a tremendous -amount of milk into its
manufacture, and hie quoted 20 per cent as the
proportion of înîlk i11 oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: 23J per cent is mîlk.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Then my honourable
friend stated there was bnly 23 per cent fat.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: No, 1 said 20 to 26
per cent was fat.
Hon. Mr. -CRERAR: Very well, I will take
the proportion of fat at 26 per cent. Then
milk and fat total less than 50 per cent of
the product. This being so, will my honourable friend say what comprises the other 51
per cent of oleomnargarine?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I will answer the
honourable gentleman's question in this way.

different ingredients in the produet, but 1

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: From what, department did the honourable gentleman get that
information?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: From the Oils and
Fats Branch of the Department of Agriculture,
down at the corner of Sussex and George
Streets, in an old stone building up on the
second floor.
Hon. N. McL. PATERSON: Honourable

question raised by the honourable senator from.
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard). I understood him to say there was no0 ceiling on the
price of pota-toes.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I u'nderstand it has
been removed just lately.
Hon. Mr. PIRIE: Oh, no, there is stili a
ceiling on potatoes. Did I also understand
him to say that potato growers work eight
hours a day? He should have said sixteen.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Only six months per

lion. THOMAS VIEN: Before the honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. MT.
Paterson) moves the adjournment of the
debate I should like to correct an impression
which may have been created by the honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger).
While the honourable senator from Inkerman

her if in ber travels she had found that
children were consuming more milk.

said that very definitely they were. She said
also that the fanily allowance had permitted
dentists ta repair children's teeth that previously had received no attention.
If I was assured of a reasonable supply of
butter shortly I would be against this measure,
because it is alarming a great many people.
From the figures given by the honourable
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) I
am quite satisfied that the situation will be-

come

worse.

We

produced 15,000,000,000

MAY 1, 19466
pounds of milk in 1939 and 17,000,000,000
pounds in 1945; yet in that period our butter
production went down 20,000,000 pounds. One
reason for the decline is that mil'k is going into
casein for the manufacture of nylon stockings.
Further, milk is being used for new purposes
almost daily, and there is ne indication that
our butter production wîlI be increased.
A further reason for the butter shortage,
as suggested by the honourable senator for
Winnipeg (Mr. Haig), is that the farmer can
make twice as much money by the sale of
raw milk as he can by producing butter. If
the price of butter was raised to 75 cents a
pound production might be increased, but it
would resuit in higher cost of living and
inflation.
I listened with interest to' the remarks of
the honourable senator from Gloucester (Hon.
Mr. Veniot) about the effect of the lack of
butter on diabetics. I think we are causing
these people-especially the young among
them-a great deal of harm by failing to
supply themn with butter or a satisfactory substitute. I arn told that margarine as manufactured today contains vitamins B and C and
is next to butter in nutrition.
May I make a personal reference? I have
a brother living in England who flnds it
difficult to get butter. My wife recently
went down to a shop on Elgin Street in this
city and ordered a supply of butter to be
shipped to him from Denmark. He subsequently wrote and said that lie liad received
a nîce package of butter from Denmark. Now,
if butter is avaîlable in Denmark and can
be shipped to England, why is Europe so
short of it? Personally, I thînk there is
something wrong in Denm-ark.

GOVERNOR GENERAL
INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. DAVID inquired:
Was Section 133 of the British North America
Act amended or repealed?
1. If so, when?
2. If not, why was the official status of the
French language not respected on the occasion
of the installation and official welcome to His
Excellency the Governor General of Canada?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This is the
answer to the honourable gentleman's inquiry:
1. Section 133 of the British North America
Act, 1867, has not been amended or repealed.
2. The proceedings connected with the

installation of His Excellency the Governor
General, in the Senate Chamber on Friday,
April 12, 1946, were in accordance with precedent and did not conflict with Section 133 of
the British North America Act, 1867. The
speeches delivered on that occasion by His
Excellency the Governor General and the
Prime Minister will appear in due course, in
English and French, as an appendix to the
Official Report of Debates of the Senate, and
will form part of the permanent record of
Parliament.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler for the second reading of Bill G, an Act
to amend the Dairy Industry Act.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Honourable
senators, this morning the honourable gentleman from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Léger) asked
me if I would permit him to precede me for
two or three minutes in this debate, which I
had adjourned, as he desired, to correct an
impression that was created last evening with
regard to some legal point. If there are no
objections, I should think my honourable
friend. could proceed now.
Hon. ANTOINE J. LEGER: Honourable
senators, I wish to thank the honourable
gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock)
for his kindness in allowing me a few minutes
to deal with the legal aspect of the bill under
discussion. In doing so, I do not wish to enter
Hon. Mr. MeREA

into a controversy with the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien), but,
to use his own words, I desire to make a statement for the record. I find that the honourable
senator was perfectly correct in stating that
the act was introduced by a Conservative
government in 1914. But in the second session
of 1919, when the Union government was in
office, a new act was introduced, being chapter
24, 10 George V. Its short title was, "The
Oleomargarine Act, 1919," and section 3 provided:
Notwitlistanding anything contained in the
Dairy Industry Act, 1914. chapter seven of the
statutes of 1914, or in any other statute or lace,
the manufacture in and importation of oleomargarine into Canada shall be permitted until
the thirty-first day of August. one thousand nine
hundred and twenty; and the offering for sale.
the sale, and the having in possession for sale of
oleomargarine shall be permitted until the first
day of March, one thousand nine hundred and
twenty-one.
By chapter 30 of the Statutes of 1920, section
3 of the 1919 act was amended by substituting
the words "twenty-one" for the word "twenty".
That is. the date for the manufacture, importation and sale was extended, one year.
Chapter 35 of the Statutes of 1922 authorized
this further. extension:
... the manufacture in and importation of oleomargarine into Canada shall be permitted until
the thirty-first day of August. one thousand
nine hundred and twenty-three, and the offering
for sale, the sale. and having in possession for
sale of oleomargarine shall be permitted until
the first day of March, one thousand nine
hundred and twenty-four.
I find no other extension for the sale of
oleomargarine. But by chapter 43 of 1923,
section 3, subsection 2, paragraph (d), the
Dairy Industry Act of 1914 was amended so
as to provide that:
No person shall manufacture, import into
Canada, or sell, offer, expose or have in possession for sale, any milk or cream or substitute
therefor which contains any fat or oil other than
that of milk.

introduced in 1914 was revived. and in 1923
the section which I have just read was added.
In the Revised Statutes of 1927, chapter 45,
section 5, paragraph (a) I find the following:
No person shall manufacture, import into
Canada, or offer, sell or have in his possession
for sale, any oleomargarine, margarine, butterine or other substitute for butter, manufactured
wholly or in part from any fat other than that
of milk or cream.

Hon. Mr. QUINN: Only to keep the record

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Yes, I simply thought
the record ought to be kept clear.
Hon. -Mr.. ROEBUCK: May I ask the
honourable senator whether the dairy industry went out of business during those years
when the prohibtion did not apply?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I arn sorry I cannot
deal with my honourable friend's question. I
promised the honourable senator from Parkdate (Hon. Mr. Murdock), who kindly
attowed me to preccde him, that I would not
discuss the merits of the bill, and I must
redeem my promise.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:

Thank you.

We have again under discussion, honourabte senators, a question that has been before
the Senate for some hours on several occasions and it occurs, to, me that in this connection we ought to take as our text the old
adage: Self-preservation is the first law of
nature. We are discussing a question that
could not be discussed by any other legisiative body in any country in the world, for
the aimple reason, according to my understanding, that no other country has denied
to its people thc right to manufacture and use
oleomargarine.
Less tl4an a month ago I spent tent happy
days in one of thc southern states, in a home
where evcrything was comfortable and nice.
My hosts told me that on accbunt of the
shortage of butter they were using margarine
at every other meal. Had I not been told, I
certainly could not have distinguished between the meal when I used oleomargarine
to spread on my toast or bread and the meal
when I used butter.
Some years ago when I sat in another place
we denied the people of Canada the right to
manufacture or to use oleomargarine. Some
distinguished gentlemen who preceded me in
this discussion have referred to the fact that,
even if we should pass this measure, we could
not get the necessary oils and fats to manu-

167

,

facture oleomargarine. What has that got
to do with the merits of the case? We have
put up with conditions of that kind under
other circumstances, and, can again. The question today is whether we are to concede to
our people their freedom, or, on behatf of the
farmers and those who dispose of the mitk,
deny it to them. Do not misunderstand me.
I was raised on a farm and I arn first, last and
all the time whotly sympathetie with the
farmer in the hard wyork and drudgery incident to bis calling. I would go any reasonable
distance to help him out, but not to the
extent of discriminating against the other
workers and citizens of this Canada of ours.
Some hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let me give honourable members a few figures indicating what is
involved here. The information I arn about
to ptesent relates to 1941. 0f course this
material is not up-to-date; it is merely offered
as a suggestion of what we can all figure out.

Many speeches have been delivered-particularly the one by our respected leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)-indicating great
concern for the dairymen and farmers, of
whom there appear to be 630,000. I have a
great deal of sympathy for these people; but
what about the rest of the almost 2,000,000
males and 676,000 females who, possibly, have
not been and are not now able te secure
butter?
I am not at all satisfied that, even if this
measure was passed here and in another place,
oleomargarine would be available to us. The
gentlemen who have spoken about the lack of
fats and oils know more about the problem
than I do. No doubt we would have to wait
a considerable length of time before getting
the ingredients with which to make oleomargarine. That is not the question. Rather it
is a question of whether Canada is going to be
as decent to the under dog as it is to the
top dog.
We heard last night how much was being
paid for butter and oleomargarine on the
black market in New York. It was not admitted that these products were bought on the
black market, but according to the record the
price per pound for butter was fixed at 58
cents a pound, and of oleomargarine at 29
cents; yet the price paid for butter was 80
cents per pound, and for oleomargarine 75
cents. Had the speaker been asked, I am
sure he would have said these products were
not bought on the black market, but that
some distributor was ready to take a chance
on violating the law. And what could be
done about it? The salesman was getting
more for butter and oleomargarine than the
price fixed by the O.P.A.
I had intended to refer extensively to what
I regarded as a very peculiar statement made
in this house last night. However, in the
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

absence of the distinguished and well-liked
senator wh-o made the statement it would nOt
be proper for me to dig into that matter, and
for the time being I shall refrain. The question briefly is, and we can all consider it,
whether some of the distinguished senators
here who have not had a tutelage in the House
of Commons, though they now represent the
people of the dominion in the upper house,
have any right to go into a matter of this
kind. Figure it out for yourselves, honourable gentlemen. Your judgment is better
than mine. In the sixteen years that I have
been a member of this house many matters
have net been discussed as I personally thought
they should have been. I have seen measures
get their first, second and third readings the
same day, even though they related to subjects
which I thought should have been discussed at
some length.
A number of distinguished senators have
expressed a desire to discuss this subject
tonight. The point I wish to make is that

while I have a great deal of sympathy for the
630,709 farmers and stock raisers, I have an
equal sympathy for the more than two and
a half million other people whom I have
enumerated. I hope some of the distinguished
gentlemen who follow me will take that
thought under advisement.
Perhaps I should net resume my seat without referring to my very good friend the

leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), who last
night delivered a splendid address in which
he dealt with information he had secured from
Manitoba. Manitoba has a much smaller
population than either the city of Montreal
or Toronto. But self-preservation is the first
law of nature, and Manitoba, with less than
three and a half people to the square mile,
wants to put into the pockets of the farmers
and stock raisers all that can be got out of
the grease that comes from the cow. I may
say te the honourable leader opposite that I
am really with him all the way in doing the
square thing for the people of Manitoba;
but let us be careful that we do not put out
of business some poor labourer in ,the city
of Toronto or Montreal, and crucify his wife
and kiddies who want something to spread
on their toast in the morning. That is exactly
what the honourable gentleman and some
other speakers have been advocating in the
remarks I have heard.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Hon. BREWER ROBINSON: Honourable
senators, at the outset of my remarks may I

express appreciation to the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) for
having introduced this bill? It has brought
forth many constructive suggestions from all

MAY 2, 1946
corners of the chamber, and as a new senator
I feel they have been very hel'pful. Even
tbough 1 cannot support the bill I tender my
thanks to the honourable senator who introduced it.
-Having lived on margarine to some 'extent
ini the United Kmngdorn, and more recently
in the United States, I think I know something
about it. The discussion here has brought
to mind something tha~t we heard a great deal
about a few years ago-New Zealand butter.
Hon. Mr. HAIG. Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: As I corne from
.Prince Edward Island, where the people are
very much interested in the production of
butter and dairy farming in general, I feel
it 'my duty to express the wishes of the
majority of the people of that province.
Tonight I received a resolution from the
president of the Prince Edward Island Dairy
Association. 1 shail flot mention his name;
some honourable members miglit recognize it;
but I may sa.y that hie is one who has reason
to remember the advantages and disadvantages of New Zealand butter. As I think
nearl•f everyone recails, it worked both ways.
I believe honourable senators would be well
advised to be very cautious in this debate. I
doubt if most people ever get too old to learn,
s0 I suppose it is -neyer too late to change
one's mind. It is ail very well to refer to the
interests of the big cities of Toronto and
Montreal, but the prosperity of the cities
depends on the prosperity of. the farming
community, and~ particularly on one of its
most important and efficient groups, the dairy
farmers.
I have some personal knowledge about the
use of margarine in the United Kingdorn, since
I spent almost four years over there, approximately half of that time as a soldier and the
other baif as a civillan i the city of London.
Unlike the UJnited States product, the English
margarine bas the appearance and the taste
of butter, and is a very good substitute. -A
large quantity is used in the army and among
the civilian population. The civilian ration is
about 75 per cent margarine and, 25 per cent
~butter. Nevertheless, margarine is without
question merely a substîtute, though it is certainly much better than crearn cheese. I
would be most unfair if I did not say that.
I spent my recent Easter holidays in Boston, and because of this proposed arnendment
to the Dairy Industry Act Ir decided to make
as many inquiries as I could about the use of
butter and margarine ini the United States.
Margarine may be legally manufactured and
sold there, but only in a'formn similar to lard.
It is a vegetable composition, uncoloured and
almost unsalted. I understand that a short-

169

ening called Crisco is almost as good a butter
substitute as the margarine that is sold ini the
United States. In fact, some people have told.
me that they aàd colouring and sait to Crisco
and use it as a substitute.
,'Margarine is very difficuit to obtain in the
States. The saal merchants are allotted an
almost insignificant quantity for custorners
who may require it. I understand that hotels
and restaurants in which, it is served must
have a special license, because the product
prepared for thern is coloured and is in a
somewhat different category from that sold
in the stores. After discussing the matter
with a considerable number of people I got
the impression that although margarine can
be legally sold, there is a series of obstacles
designed to make the sale as difficuit as
possible. Apparently home-made butter is
preferred by many to margarine. It is clairned
that a quart of heavy crearn can be converted
into a pound of butter. I ar n ot a dairyrnan
or a farmer, and I accept 'these staternents as
given to me. The fact that many people are,
as I found, buying eream at 90 cents a quart
in order to make butter indicates that
margarine is* either not readily procurable
or not very popular. If this bill were passed
by both houses we could not hope to imnport
mucli margarine from the United States,
where there is a delinite shortage of the
produet and where even what is available is
in an unattractive form.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Then why worry?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Passage of the bill,
would not do any harm, apparently.
Hon. Mr. ROBINS ON: There are other
factors of importance tbat we should consider before passing a bill which would not
becorne operative. The proposed amendment
ta the act might create unrest and disturbance among dairy farmers throughout Canada,
and cause thern to adopt some other means of
earning a livelihood.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Would
passage of the bill not demonstrate that the
people of Canada have as much freedorn as
the people of other countries?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is there any doubt
about that?
Hon. Mr. ROBINS ON: Not rnany Canadians are dissatisfled with the freedorn they
have. It is pretty nearly unexcelled anywhere
in the world, and I do not think we need
make any experiments to dernonstrate that.
A further reason why I cannot approve of
this bill is that in ail my life I have neyer
heard of a really serîous shortage of butter

in Canada. 1 do remember, though, when
there was flot an outiet for ail the butter we
produced.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I asic the
honourable senator a question? Does hae know
why the statute, of 1919 permitting the manufacture, importation and sale of oleomargarine
was enacted? Was there flot a shortage of
butter in Canada at that time?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Doubtiass thora was,
aithough I do not recali hearing of it than.
I beliave it is generaliy agraad that the
present butter situation is mereiy temporary
and wilI correct itseif within the naxt f ew
weeks. Then we shall have ail tha cear wa
need for churning into butter. I arn quite
sure that the passage of this bill would not
bring about any immediate relief.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: llaving regard to what
the honourabie gentleman has just said, would
hae be in faveur of this bill if it were presentcd in such forrn as te, ralieve only the
prescrnt tcmperary need?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: At the prescrit time
I wouid net be in faveur of the bill under
any conditions; a whiie age I maight have been
disposed te consider it. I have definitaly
made up my mind that this would he a mest

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Is the honourabie

Hon. Mr-. ROBINSON: Certain hionourable inmbeýrs who have preeedaed me have
atated that the importation of vagetable fats
frorn the United States andl other pre-war
sources of suppiy is practicaliv impossible at
the presenit tirna. But regardless of where we
mighit obtain a supply of vegetable fats. I arn
confident that ne- henourahie senator wouid
desire their importation once lie realized that
it would mean dcpriving the people of the
United Kingdema and the other ceuntries of
Europe of nutritional elemennts essential te
their hath and well-being. I îxouid net say
that our gond friends in Great Britain are

dewnhearted or discouraged. but according
te latters I have racaived racentiy, they are
unquestionably short of food. Indeed, they
are eating less today than at any time during
the war, and in those grirn years food was net
at ail plentiful. The United Kingdom uîses
more fats than aither Canada or the United
States.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
the people of the United Kingdomn have been
using about 75 per cent margarine te supplement their butter ration. In the years when
butter was available they used very littie
margarine; which shows that they prafer
butter. I inay say that thair butter ration is
oniy two ounces per week. Are we prepared
te eut down their Iiimited supplies of margarine and so rnake their condition worsa than
ever?
Perhaps the butter shortage in the
par]iamentary restaurant and in this and other
cities bas tended to focus attention on the
absîence of margarine.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Wouid my honeurable friend ho willing that Canada should
forae

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I wrîuid ha in faveur

ta jeopardize their position. The fertility of
the sil is dependent in na smail measure
on dairy farming, and we shouid do aur utmast ta encourage the industry. Taday labour
on the farm is a seriaus problem, and if we
make tbings more difficuit for the dairy industry I fear that ultimately it will prejudice
aur men fromn overseas against becoming
farmers. Sa let us make farming as attractive
as we can.
It bas been stated that the gavernmnent
Well, aur

farmers are not arganized; they know notbing about the principles af labour unions,
and certainly tbey neyer can become monopolists. Let us preserve their pence af mind.
Let us do notbing ta disturb the dairy industry at the present time, even if the butter
shortage be as seriaus as some bonourable
members have stated.
Honaurable members will recall tbat during the *war years the gavernment urged aur
farmers ta produce ahl tbe cheese tbey passibly could, and cantributed towards the cost
of canverting creameries inta cheese factories.
The greater production ai cheese must ta a
certain extent bave decreased the production
af butter. Anotber faêtor in tbe present butter shortage is the steadily increasing consumptian of fluid milk. Most af aur boys
,çha bave been overseas for the hast tbree or
four years appreciate a glass of milk, and
aur cbildren are also, very fond of it. As a
result, the consumption af fluid milk is greater
today than ever before. If we are ta encourage aur farmers ta produce more butter I
would suggest that the gavernment adopt
mensures similar ta those that proved sa
belpfui in increasing the production af cheese.
Let tbern naw raise the price of butter and
sa give additionai encouragement for its production.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: In short, no coinpetitian and higber prices.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Yes. There are
fcw, if any, fields, wbere the farmer lias a
monapoly. If bie bias a monapaly li butter
production, I arn in favaur af preserving it ta
him.
Han. Mr. EULER: Wauid my honourable
friend permit a question?
Han. Mr. ROBINSON: 1 wili try and
answer it, but remember 1 amrn ft sponsoring
the bill.
Hon. Mr. EULER: What would the hanourable gentleman think af a letter that I
received today suggesting the removal of tbe
ceiling price and the su'bsidy on butter?

171

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I tbink we should
not be too hasty in removing our contrais.
I believe ini the principle of supply and demand. If we want to relieve the present
butter shortage, why nlot increase the price?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Raise the ceiling.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Would the honourable
gentleman cansider remaving the ceiling and
retaining the subsidy?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Well, there are
some questions which I arn nat going ta try
ta answer.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, ah!
Han. Mr. ROBINSON: I was very much
interested i the remarks of the hanaurable
senator fromn Glaucester (Hon. Mr. Veniat)
concerning the difficulty diahetics have in
getting the amaunt of butter they require.
May I make a.suggestion for the relief af
these unfortunate people? At the beginning
of the war when butter was readily procurabie
in Canada, and befare I had become accustomed ta oleamargarine, butter was sent overseas in tins. It hias occurred ta me that butter
could be put up in tins and made available
ta diabetics thraugh praper channels tbrough
drug stores, perhaps, or an a doctar's prescription. We ail agree that when a doctar prescribes butter for a diabetic it sbauld be made
available. I arn told that dealers and retailers
wil give a preference ta such people if they
can, but there are times when butter is nat
procurable.
Han. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
hanourable gentleman whether, in an attempt
ta alleviate the present shortage, hie would be
in. faveur of the rationing af butter made
and used on the farm?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: From what I know
about the farmers, most af themn get their
butter from the creameries and give coupons
for it. When there is a sitortage I think
most of thi dairymen make an effort ta sel
their creamn thraugh the proper channels. It
does nat pay them ta make butter at home
when they can get their supply frein the
creameries at a slightly lower price.
Like other bonourable senators who have
spoken, I have a great deal af data available;
but I do not intend ta burden tbe bhouse witb
tiresome statistics. As I arn a newcomer ta
this bouse it might be cansidered presumptuous an my part ta give advice; but I believe
tbat if we deferred action on this bill at thé
present time it wauld be better for Canada.
If a shartage occurs again at a time wben fats
are available, we can then consider the matter
quite spart framn any tbaugbt of taking food
fram other peopIe whose need is greater than

SENATE

ours. The duty of this house, as I understand
it, is to prevent hasty legislation by giving it
a second thought. In my opinion this bill
should be classified as hasty legislation. The
passage of this bill now would, I believe, reflect
unfavourably on the Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
gentlemen, apparently my memory is a little
longer than that of some of my junior colleagues here. I recall that after the last war
we paid 75 or 80 cents a pound for butter, and
I am quite sure that amount did not go to the
producers, but rather to the cold storage
warehouses and the large companies. I also
remember very distinctly the election of 1930
to which frequent reference bas been made.
After that election there was some discussion
in this chamber about erecting monuments to
worthy sons of Canada. At that time the
representative of a dairying constituency in
Ontario said in another place that he thought
the government of the day should put up a
monument to the cow, because it had ridden
into power on her back, and she had been
ill-used ever since.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: The honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
expressed the view last evening that the pork
producers were rather canny when, despite
urging on the part of the government, they
decided not to increase production because
the price had dropped so low after 1930. The
honourable gentleman did not say that despite
the prohibition on New Zealand butter and
the ban against oleomargarine, the price of
butter in Canada had dropped to as low as
approximately 20 cents a pound.
The morning and the evening newspapers
today are full of complaints from dairymen,
who say that if the bonus on milk is reduced
production will immediately drop. Yet we
continually hear that in order to make the
production of butter profitable to the farmer
he must receive at least 62 cents a pound for
it. This price would put butter out of the
reach of the average Canadian citizen.
The honourable senator from Summerside
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) referred to the poor
people of Britain who have to eat oleomargarine, and who are allowed only sufficient
butter to enable them to retain their taste for
it. He did not suggest that we might take
some of the oleomargarine and send them the
butter. I would be in favour of such an
exchange.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: Complaints are being
Uon. Mr. ROBINSON.

received that there is a great production of
butter in Denmark for which there appears to
be no distribution. I hope that situation will
be remedied, because I am fully aware of the
desperate need in Europe today. I should have
liked to read to this honourable bouse five or
six letters I just received from some children
in France. Their story is most pathetic.
I hope we shall not continue to favour one
section of the farming community while we
raise the price of implements to other producers. Though I should like to see the
farmer get more encouragement, I do not
think it would benefit the ordinary producer
as much as it would the large dairy associations.
Among the many speakers on this bill we
have heard from two medical men. One of
them said that he had a herd of dairy cattle
and certainly could not supply the demands
made upon him for milk. The other honourable gentleman explained the difficulty of
securing fats for some 70,000 diabetics in
Canada.
For the reasons I have given, I shall
support this measure.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question?
On motion of Hon. Mr. Bencli, the debate
was adjourned.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. G. V. WHITE moved the second
reading of Bill S2, an act to incorporate the
Executive Board of the Church of the
Nazarene.
He said: Honourable senators, the Church
of the Nazarene is seeking to be incorporated
in order that the legal processes relating to
the ownership and transfer of property may
be simplified, and so that the church may
have a proper status as a religious denomination in the Dominion of Canada. The church
was founded about forty years ago, and now
bas a membership in Canada and the United
States of more than 200,000. Its doctrines are
precisely the same as those of the former
Methodist Church. It conducts missionary
work in twenty foreign fields, and maintains
in Canada and in the United States seven
accredited degree-granting colleges with a
total registration of approximately 3,000
students.
The objects of the incorporation are fully
set out in clause 4 of the bill. My information is that the bill is along the lines of similar
legislation appearing on our statute books.

terms and conditions of such admission;
.And that the said committea, report its findîngs to this house;
And that the said committea have power to
send for persons, papers and records.
Hon. THO MAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I have very little to add to what I said
whan I moved the adjournment of this debate.
I then stated that Canada, which is already a
great country, is capable of becoming in future
much greater and more populous, but we
should bear in mind that additional population is not an unmixed blessing. I urged
that in opening our doors to immigration we should ha extremely careful, because
in this matter quality is probably aven more
important than quantity. In coma countries
the health or the character of newcomers has
been a source of trouble, unrest and numerous
problems. It is difficult to make sure that
those whom you admit within your borders
will ha assimilated into the social and political structure of the country.

SENATE
The people who have settled and developed
Canada spring from two main sources, the
Englishi and French races, and inherit traditions, forms of culture and ways of life
that derive from the ancient civilizations of
Greece and Rome. As Blackstone once said,
Christianity is part and parcel of the common
law of England. The origin of Christianity
is to be found in the Old Testament. We are
therefore indebted also to the Jews for many
of the fundamental principles whichi underlie
oui' present way of life.
We should try to ensure that the people
to whom we open our gatos will he capable
of accepting and conforming to those traditions and principles which have been handed
(lown from father to son and cherishied in this
country for generations. It is my hope that
Canada will nover have to face certain acute
problems that have arisen in other countries
which Çailed to take adequate precautions in
the selection of immigrants.
Before rosumning my seat I should like to
express my thanks to the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) for having brought this matter to the
attention of the bouse, and to congratulate
bim upon the masterly argument be made in
support of bis motion. It is evident that he
dovotcd a groat deal of patient and painstaking study to tbe suhject, and altbough I
arn unable to accept witbout qualification
some of the principles he enunciated, I feel
deeply grateful to him.

MAY 7, 1946
throughout -Saskatchewan were exercising their
authority by declaring a price ceiling on tractors, and I was under the impression that this
practice was general throughout the country.
I attended a good many auction sales in
Saskatchewan where retiring farmers were
disposing of their goods, and I know that ini
each case the representative of the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board notified the farmer
that lis tractor could be sold for, say, not
more than $1,200, even though buyers were
willing to pay much more. In some cases
the matter was settled by putting in a hat
the names of those desiring to purchase and
allotting the tractor to the one whose name
was drawn. Last Mardi when going out on
the train to Western Canada, I happened to
meet a vcry fine man who informed me that
he was on his way to Yorkton with a trainload of flfty tractors, combines and other farmn
machinery. I said, "You will be up against
the price ceiling." He said, "No, I fixed that
a year ago. 'At that time I had shipped a
trainload of from fifty to seventy-five tractors to Moose Jaw. The Prices Board man
asked me to cail at their office ini Regina.
When I appeared there I said, 'Well, gentlemen, what do you propose to do?' They saîd,
'You understand there is a price ceiling on
those tractors'. I replied, 'I don't understand
any such thing. Tt is my belief that there is
no price ceiling, and that you have no authority to impose one'. They said they would get
in touch witi Ottawa. I told them, 'Very,
well. I'amn a busy man. If you want me you
will find me at Moose Jaw selling tractors and
otier farm machinery as fast as I can'." He
sold tractors, three or four years old, that
for as muci as $2,000. Hle
cost $1,325 -new,
said to me, "Ever since then in Saskatchewan
you have had no price ceiling on farm
tractors."
I arn caliing this matter to the attention
of honourable senators so that any publicity
my remarks may receive in the press will
resuit in every farmer in western: Canada
becoming aware of the facts, for thcre are
stili many in Saskatchewan who think there
is a ceiling on farm tractors. This is a very
important matter to the farming community
of western Canada, as the scarcity of tractors
has affected sceding operations. Honourable
senators may be interested to know tiat
30,000 farmers attended the sale at Moose
Jaw to which I have referred, due to the fact
that no new tractors have been sold in the
West for some years.
This mnan informed me that the freight rate
on used tractors is only haîf the rate eharged
on new ones. There is a suspicion abroad that
a tracter does not have to be run around
63268-13

very mucli in Ontario mud to make it look
second-hand; and it is oaly natural to expeet that the seller will use tic tractor for
a few days if he can get $600 more for it by
making it appear' to be second-hand. Used
tractors are still being shipped from the
East, and the price asked for a four.-year-old
machine is from $500 to $600 more than the
price of a new one. In his income tax return
a farmer is allowed 20 per cent depreciation
for the first year on a new tracter. I wonder
what he would be allowed on a second-hand
machine wich cost $600 more than the price
of a new one, and whidh may be well worn.
The man to whom I refer was, I believe,
telling the absolute truth when he said the
second-hand tracters he was selling were as
good as new. An honourable senator tells
mue that lie knew there was no ceiling on
tractors, but I was not aware of it until I
was told by this man. Surely this situation
enormeusly inereases the ceat of farming
operations in western Canada. If there is no
ceiling on tractors, why is there stili a ceiling
on cars? Cars have very littie to do witi
the seeding of a crop.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Does the honourable
senator suggest that-the ceiling should be removed, or that there should be a ruling to
the effeet tiat there is ne ceiling?
Hon. Mr. HIORNER: My point is that discrimination is being siown. We have a good
many lawyers in Saskatchewan, but I should
like to put a question to my honourable
friend who is a member of the legal profession.
Has the farmer who sold his tracter for a
tiousand dollars less than he could have got
for ýit any right of action against the official
who told him he could not seli te the highest
bidder?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I do not propose to enter
into a controversy. I am simply trying to find.
out what tie honourable senator suggests.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I suggest that if there
is a ceiling on the products the farmer has to
selI, there should also be a ceiling on tractors.
Further, the fact that there was no ceiling
should have been announced, so that al
farmers would have been treated alike. Personally, I think thc farmers who were told by
officiais that they could not sell their tractors
above, a certain price have a right of action
against those officiaIs to recover the amount
they lost.
AIl new tractors are held for the use of
soldiers, which is quite proper. But the Minneapolis Company, wiich. is only one of about
six producers of this kind of maciinery, has

twenty tractors sitting on its floor now. I
imagine that at the distributing points in
western Canada there are possibly a hundred
or more new tractors sitting idle.
I have here a letter from a young man who
was in service and is now taking training in a
vocational school conducted by the army. He
says that two completely overhauled tractors
are sitting at the school, which will be closed
from now until next fall. He thinks it shameful that they should sit there idle when they
are so badly needed. This young man is anxious ta get a tract-or for his own use; but apparently the new machines reserved for exservice men go to men who have entered into
the scheme whereby they get government
assistance, and not to those who already own
their land. In many cases the government is
away behind in its dealings, and lands have
not been inspected. In the meantime these
two tractors at the school are doing nothing,
and land in many parts of the country is being
only half worked.
I bring up this situation immediately upon
my return from the West, because even yet it
is not too late to remedy it. The government
should arrange to put these tractors into use,
first satisfying itself that they will be properly
cared for and maintained. It is a terrible mistake to leave machinery sitting idle when it is
so badly needed on the land. Throughout the
country today one can see many old tractors
chugging over the land, the farms being only
half worked. Every farmer knows that the
care taken at seed-time means a great deal at
harvest.
I have heard many excuses, such as, "This
was not done during the last war;" but I
know of nothing to equal this great farce
about 'tractor prices.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Would the honourable gentleman be good enough ta supply
me with information as to the location of the
tractors to which he refers?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I certainly willRegina, and out from Saskatoon.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should be
pleased to have whatever information the
honourable gentleman can give me, but I will
not ask him for it now.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I shall endeavour to
supply the information to the honourable
leader opposite.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The honourable senator
knows, of course, that there is a school of
thought in Canada which holds that if ceilings
are removed prices will adjust themselves
more rapidly. Mr. Gilbert E. Jackson of the
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

Canadian Chamber of Commerce, speaking
before the Rotary 'Club in Montreal on
March 12, had this to say:
Here our Canadian commissarsI think he goes a little far in using that
term.
-inform us that we must keep the controls, or
at least a lot of them, because goods are still in

enough goods come to market. Only when supplies become adequate, can these controls be
removed.
In other words, we must retain (in part, at
any rate) a system which was intended to prevent civilian goods from being produced: and
we must retain it, if you please, with a view to
getting the same goods produced now. To me,
sir "this does not add up."
those of us who learned our economies before
the nineteen-thirties, can remember when these
problems were looked at otherwise.
Then it was believed that a demand for goods,
backed by money, was the best means of getting
goods produced-provided, of course, that the
money backing the demand was enough to render
production of them worth while, from a maker's
standpoint.
Of course, it was realized then as now, that
shortages of goods provoke high prices. But it
was realized also that high prices, in their turn,
provoke abundance of supply thus bringing prices
down again ta reasonable levels.
The secret of capitalism is and always bas
been simply this-There is a causal connection
between shortages and high prices; there is a
causal connection between high prices and abundance; there is a causal connection, too, between
abundance, and a corrective lowering of prices.
Thus have consumers governed the course of
production. Just naturally, demand has begotten supply.

Mr. Jackson in his address suggests that
removal of the price ceilings on all commoditics would restore prices to their normal level
more rapidly than any artificial control by
regulation.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Of course the high
price of used tractors means that the demand
is great.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I rise to a point of order. Is not this discussion out of order?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is quite out
of order. The honourable gentleman from
Saska.tchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner) had
a perfect right ta make reference to this subject, as he bas done; but the question is not
debatable. If it is to be debated, it should
be put in the form of a motion.
DIVORCE BILLS

READINGS

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG moved the third
readings of the following bills:

Bill T-2, an Act for the relief of Ruby
Rosina Burnett Walters.

MAY 7, 1946
Bill U-2, an Act for the relief of Winnifred
Violet Unsworth Thomas.
Bill V-2, an Act for the relief of Helen
Louisa Willcox Reid.
Bill W-2, an Act for the relief of Richard
Carter Eaton.
Bill X-2, an Act for the relief of Annie
Coyle Frances.
Bill Y-2, an Act for the relief of Beatrice
Irene Moore Hawes.
Bill Z-2, an Act for the relief of Laura
Lillian Butler May.
Bill A-3, an Act for the relief of Gladys

Bill B-3, an Act for the relief of Elizabeth
Maude Foy Gage.
Bill C-3, an Act for the relief of George
Burley Beresford.
Bill D-3, an Act for the relief of Isabella
Eleonbra Cantlie Angus.
He said: Honourable senators, before these
bills are given third reading, may I make a
few remarks about the question of divorce
generally? Last week in another place certain
statements were made which to me are very
disturbing. Divorce is a serious business.
There are divorce courts in every province of
Canada but one. The number of applications
for divorce this year will exceed all previous
records. I am authoritatively informed that
in the province of Ontario, despite the large
number of judges working on divorce, there
will be more unheard cases at the end of the
year than there were at the beginning. In
Great Britain the situation is beyond the
ken of man. The courts are quite incapable
of handling all the cases, and legislation has
been passed giving lawyers of certain standing power-to hear them. But there are not
enough stenographers to take down the evidence. It is estimated that to hear the
applications at present on record will take
fifteen years.
Ever since confederation the Senate has
been passing special divorce legislation. This
house does not grant divorces, but rather
passes special acts, each of which provides
that two people who are narried to one
another shall be separated. I think-and I say
this not -because I am a member of the
Divorce Committee-that the Senate owes a
debt of gratitude to the members of the
committee for the services they have rendered. Parliament has been in session about
a month and a half, and every week during
most of that time the committee has been
sitting on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays.
The committee has heard 91 cases, but there
are 237 petitions yet to be dealt with, ten of
which will be opposed by the respondents.
63268-131

In order that the house may better understand the problem, let me give a few figures.
During the last ten years 787 bills of divorce
have been granted by parliament, the number
in each year being as follows:
1936 ............................
40
1937 ............................

1938 ............................

This year we have received already a total
of 328 petitions for divorce. The only previous year in which that number was approached
was 1930, when 247 petitions were heard and
recommended. Many of those cases were
from Ontario, as the courts of that province
then had no jurisdiction in divorce.
Many people in Canada are opposed to
divorce. They have a right to their opinion,
and I respect it. I have no desire to argue
with them at all. What I am discussing is
the problem that faces us as senators, as
members of one branch of the Parliament
of Canada. The other day this divorce problem was quite seriously discussed in another
place. I know the rules prevent me from
quoting what was said, but for the information of honourable members who wish to
refer to it I may say the discussion is to be
found in the House of Commons Hansard
No. 30. Divorce is just as much the business
of members of that house as it is of senators.
Why should we have to hold the committee
meetings, hear the evidence and do all the
other divorce work we now do? Why should
they not do part of it? Some honourable
members hold up their hands in horror. at
the granting of these divorces. Well, I invite
any men or women who hold such-a view to
come to our divorce committee and listen
to the evidence. They will be shocked.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: It is bad enough for
men.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am not referring to
the kind of evidence my honourable friend
is apparently thinking about. Rather, I have
in mind evidence which discloses that a young
woman of 28, say with two or three children,
has a no-good, drunken husband who is running around with other women. Her life is
in danger of being ruined; she wants to make,
a fresh start, and I do not blame lier.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Have action taken under
the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Quebec is the only province whose courts have not got jurisdiction in
divorce. The number of cases coming from

SENATE

178

that province is such that our problem will
not be any lighter next year; indications are
that it will be just as bad or worse.
Bon. Mr. McRAE: It will be worse.
'Hon. Mr. HAIG: It may be worse, but at

any rate it will be just as bad. We are not
going to be able to deal this session with all
the petitions now on hand. In these circumstances I have a- suggestion to make: that we
invite representative members of the House
of Commons-some from the government side,
some from the official opposition, some from
the C.C.F. and some from the Social Credit
party-to meet with a committee of the
Senate to consider this whole matter.
It seems to me that the only hope of getting relief from the present situation is by
doing one of two things. We could pass
legislation establishing in Ottawa, say, a court
somewhat along the lines of the Exchequer
Court, to hear petitions for divorce from any
province. In practice nearly all the cases
would come from Quebec, but occasionally
there might be one from another province
when the domicile of the husband was in
question. The other day we had before our
committee a case in which it was not certain
whether the domicile was Ontario or Quebec.
The petitioner had no option but to come
before us, since we have jurisdiction throughout Canada. A committee of members of
both houses could consider this whole problem
and see if it is not possible to arrive at some
solution. It is popular to get up in another
place and denounce hasty divorce, and so on.
We could make an effective reply to criticism
of our procedure by just refusjng to hear any
further cases. That would bring the issue to a
point, but it would be an awful price to
exact from men and women who are not to
blame for the situation.
I am bringing this matter to the attention
of the house, not to cause a controversy but
in an endeavour to solve the problem. We
are not making any headway at all. I have
had the honour of being in the Senate for
about eleven years, seven or eight of which
I have been a member of the Divorce Committee, and it is my recollection that there
has been a discussion of the growing divorce
problem almost annually. Yet nothing has
been done about 'it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My honourable friend
suggested there were two possible solutions of
the problem, but he mentioned only one.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: One solution would be to
confer divorce jurisdiction upon the Exchequer
Court or a specially-appointed court here in
Ottawa. The other would be to appoint a
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

a report to us in each case, recommending the
granting or refusal of the petition; then we
could put through a bill or refuse to do so,
just as we can now.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: You are suggesting
the appointment of what are called "triers"?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. I am not saying
that we should endeavour to force legislation
on the province of Quebec. We could not do
that, in any event.
I believe that those people who are opposed
to divorce-whether they are members of one
of the houses of parliament or note-will agree
that our present procedure is really a recognition of divorce, When we are asked to give
second or third reading to divorce bills, my
honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Duff) always calls out "On division." My
conscience is not as bad as his, so I do not
need to do that.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am sorry the Chairman
of the Divorce Cominittee (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) is not here today. It is because of the
serious way that the divorce question was
discussed in another place a few days ago
that I felt something should be said here on
this occasion. We do not want this divorce
work. If members of the other house think
we are not doing the work properly, for goodness' sake let them do it! Let them take over
the job. I do not think there will be any
rush to take on the work. I have occasionally
invited members of the other bouse to come
to our committee and listen to the evidence,
and at the end of the sitting they have told
me, "We will never raise any objection again."
I suggest that we hold ourselves ready to
join with members of the other house in a
committee to seek a solution-not to the
problern of divorce, for I know that cannot be
solved, but to the problem of how best to
handle the Quebec cases that now come
before us.
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
I agree entirely with what has been said by
the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) as to the seriousness of the problem.
Perhaps I might be permitted to offer a solution that would give, not full relief but a little
relief. Back in the late 'twenties, when the
petitions from Ontario became numerous, we
increased the number of members on the
Divorce Committee to fifteen, or probably
more than that, and the committee sat in three
divisions, the quorum of three being maintained in accordance with what had already
been laid down. That was the only way in
whichwe-were able to get through the work. I
2u~
~im-t

179

MAY 7, 1946
think in one ye-ar we got through 330 cases,
rnany of them contested. The honourable
leader on the other side has suggested that we
should have a conference with the House of
Gommons. In the meantixne I think we ini
this bouse could get some relief by hiaving the
committee sit in two divisions or even three,
if necessary, to deal with the great number of
cases now coming forward. Then each division
could present its reports ini the usual way.

witb the House of Commons, because its
members will nlot share in it, we must adopt
some other procedure to relieve hoi;ourab1e
senators from this onerous and disagreeable
work.
The motion was agreed to, and the bis
were read the third time, and passed, on
division.

Hon. Mr. HAIG. If the bouse will allow
me to answer the honourable gentleman, I
may say that the Divorce Committee is now
sitting in two divisions, and we have reached
the li.mit of reportorial help. In that respect
we are just as badly off as they are in England. This morning we had difficulty in
getting tbe proceedings of the main cornmittee
and the sub.-comrnittee reported.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Uhnder what provision, either constitutional or stat-utory, does
the Senate Divorce Committee perfomn its
functions?
Hon. Mr. HAIG. It is simply an arrangement adopted at confederation.

MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Is it not specifically
mentioned in the Senate and House of Commons Act?
Hon. Mr. COPP: I think it is covered by
the British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: If that is the case,
does not the matter really resolve itself into
the control of parliament over its own
constitution?
Hon. Mr. HAIG- I'am not suggesting that
we could not pass an act cstablishing a divorce
court. It can be done. The only difflculty
is in getting everybody to agree to sucb a
course.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT - It might he a very
good occasion to examine the power of the
Parliament of Canada to amend the constitution.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It seems to me that
the real difllculty lies in the taking of the
evidence. Why not have a harrster hear the
evidence-which, of course would be recordedand make bis recommendation to the cernmittee, whicb, in turn, would make its recommendation to the Senate? Such an arrangement would relieve the members of this bouse
who now give their time generously and
patriotically to this very unattractive work.
Sucely, if it is not possible to enact legisiation
establishing a court-which naturally would
be the hast way of dealing with the difficultya.nd if it is not possible to divide up the work

DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
2, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Euler for the second reading of
Bill G, an Act to amend the Dairy Industry
Act.
Hon. J. J. BENCU: Honourable senators,
I intend to propose an amendment to this
bill, ini the hope that it may serve to compose
at least some of the differences of view that
have found expression ini this debate. However,
beSace presenting this amendmént I should
like to comment briefly-and, may I say,
respectfully-on some of the statements made
during the discussion that has taken place.
It seems to me that if this were only a
question of oleomargarmne or no oleomargarmne
the debate might nlot have been so protracted
or as interesting as it has proven to be. But,
as was s0 well stated the other evening by
the honourable senator from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock), there is involved here something more-the very highly important question of principle as to whether Canadians are
to be free to deal in a wholesome article of
food, or whether that right is to be denied
them in order to concede special privilege to
one portion only of our population. I am
wbat, I suppose, might be called an oldfashioned Liberal.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BEINCH: Like the bonourable
gentleman fi-oui Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) I amn against measures which unreasonably restriet the righit of the individual
tae trade in legitimate -articles of commerce.
In times of war or other national emergeney
many of the ordinary rules must go by the
board. but in times of peace 1 arn unalterably
opposed te this kind of bureaucracy and dietatorship. This being se, when I corne upon
it 1 mnust try te do somet-hing about it. If
the bonourable gentleman from Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard) w&e present, 1 would
say to him that I think that obligation reste
upon me with equal weight whether I be a
member of the Senate or of another place.

SENATE
As a senator I arn relieved only to the extent
of the constitutional limitations placed upon
the powers of this bonourable bouse.
The other evening the esteemed gentleman
from Wellington boasted of a long experience
in both bouses of parliament-a career. whirlï
I arn happy to attest, constitutes a very fine
record of publie service. Nevertheless I venture to suggest to him, and to any other
honourable member who might bave agreed
witb bis remarks, that lie is under a very grave
misa ppreb ension if bie thinks a private member is acting irnproperly in introducing a
meas-ure of'this kind in the Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hlon. Mr. BENCH: I would remind the
bonourable senator that froni time to time
Ibis chamber is criticized for allegedly
displaying an attitude of laissez-faire sucb as
bie advocates in regard to this matter. Wbatever may be the attitude of tbis bonourarble'
bouse towards the mernts of this bill, I most
sincerely hope that the impression will not
go out that honourable senators are not to ho
initially concerned wvîth problems of thi '
kind. For myself I wish niost empliaticall 'v
to disassociate myseif entircly frorn any sc
idea.
Somuc Hon. SENATOPS:

Ilear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: As to the mcasîîre itseif,
I tbink the dcbate bas establislied several
tbings in its favour. It scems to be agreed
tbat oleomargarine. manufactured according
to present-day standards, is a wholesome and
nutritive article of food, entirely fit for burnan
consuimption. It is admitted to bc an inexpensive substitute for butter, of whicb
there i.; acknowledgcd tu be an increasing
shortage.
Many of the arguments against tbe bill,
notably those of the bonourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), bave shown that notwitbstanding an increasing volume of milk
production the amount of butter available on
the market is on a descending scale. Sucb
arguments, I think also go to prove tbat the
presenit trend is likely to continue for some
considerable time.
Tbere are tbree main points raised in objection to the bill. Firstly, il is said that to
remove tbe existing prohibition against oleomargarine would constitute a very grave tbreat
to tbe future of one of our most important
primary industries--that of dairy farming.
Secondlv, it is stated that the manufacture
and sale of oleomargarine in Canada would
deprive tbe starving population of Europe of
tbe ojîs and fats which are now surplus to our
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

own needs. Finally, it is argued that we now
bave no oils and fats available in this country for tbe production of butter substitutes.
In connection with tbe first point, a good
deal bas been said of the great production
record of tbose engaged in the dairy industry
d-uring tbe war. I think no one will gainsay
the fine words of praise uttered in tbis chamber in that connection. Neither, I tbink, will
anyone cballenge the credit wbicb. is due to
Canadian fnctory workers for tbeir war record.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: If tbat type of argument is relevant to the issue now before the
bouse-wbicb I mucb doubt-then it may
not be unfair to compare tbe positions of these
two classes of our population with respect to
the present butter shortage. The industrial
worker, living in the urban centre, secures
butter for bimself and bis family only on the
production of ration coupons and payment of
the current price; and even tben bie bas great
difficulty in securing tbe quantity bie requires.
Tbe dairyman, on the otber band, can keep
bis table liberally supplied from bis own berd.
Witb tbat situation in mmnd I respectfully
venture to suggest tbat the attitude of the
dairymen of tbis country bias not been fairly
rcpresented in tbis debate. I do not believe
tbat in tbe present stnte of affairs tbey want
to play the part of tbe "dog in tbe manger".
I bold firmly to the opinion tbat wbile tbis
sbortage lasts tbe dairy farmers of Canada
would be only too bappy to see their fellows
in towns and cities get a good, bealtbful
substitute for butter.
As to tbe availability of fats and oils, I would
remind bonourable senators that the *ngredlents of oleomargarine are already contýrolled
by tbe Combined Food Board, and in Canada
by tbe Wartime Prices and Trade Board. I
presume tbose controls will continue in effeet
wbetber or flot tbis bill is pas.sed. Tbese substances would be allocated to tbe production
of oleornargarine according to some priority
rating wbicb would be assigned to it baving
regard 10 tbe over-alI national needs. Tberefore I must say tbat 1 amn not at alI impressed
by the arguments against the bill, wbicb.
rest on an alleged shortage of fats and oils.
While, as I bave indicated, I was prepared
to support second reading of tbis measure on
tbe basis of opinion already expressed in this
debate, I felt I could flot entirely ignore tbe
circumstance tbat tbe probibition contained
in tbe Dairy Industry Act bias remained
on our stattîte books since àt least 1914. Some
reference also bas been made tn the fact
that in a comparable emergencv following
the last war steps were taken 10 temporarily

relieve the situation which existed at that
time. It occurred to me that the precedent of
1919 might be worthy of some investigation,
and with that end ini view I moved the adjournment of the debate on Thursday last. On
looking into the matter I was amnzed to di&cover that oleomargarine bas a legislative hidtory much longer than I had any reason to believe. I think it was s«aid by sonie honourable
gentleman that the first legislative reference to
oleomargarine was in 1903. If honourable senators wilI bear with me for a few minutes
longer I tbink I can give themn some very interesting details with respect to the bistory of
this legisîntion which may help them to reacb
a conclusion on this bill.
,It seems that more than sixty years ago some
enterprising soul had discovered the means of
praducing oleomargarine, and that the substance was being, manufactured and sold in
Canada prior to 1886. Up to that time the
only action taken by the g.overnment of Canada in relation to the produet was to impose
upon it a very heavy excise and customs duty.
I might say that at tbat time oleomargarine
had a very bad nome and, I should add, judging £rom some of the material which I have
examined, it certainly deserved the unsavoury
reputation it had in 1886. It was actually
considered unfit for human consumption; and
to make matters worse it was passed off to the
consumer as butter.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: And will be again.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: In that state of affairs,
at the session of 1886 one Mr. Taylor introduced into the other bouse a resolution calling
for a measure to, regulate the manufacture and
sale of oleomnargarine and other butter substitutes. If the honourable gentleman from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) were present
I arn sure he would be very interésted to know
that Mr. Taylor was a private member supporting the governiment of Sir John A. Macdonald. Moreover, when the private member's
resolution was being debated there was standing on the order paper a government resolution
to authorize the introduction of a mensure to
prohibit the manufacture of butter substitutes,
in the br.oad sense, except under license from
the Minister of Agriculture.
A debate of considerable length ensued on
Mr. Taylor's motion. During this debate the
statement was made several tumes that if the
-produet was not injurious to health, and was
properly stamped, and not sold as butter,
parliament could not probibit its manufacture
although it might regulate it hy a system of
Mr. David Milîs, then in the
licensing.
opposition but later Minister of Justice in one
of the cabinets of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, con-

curred in that view, and said that any measure
prohibiting the manufacýture of butter substitutes, as distinguished from regulation, muet
be based on the ground' of protecting the
publie health. My understanding is that it
would have to be brought within the ambit of
criminal. legisiation.
Mr. Taylor's motion was subsequently withdrawn, and later in the session the government
of the day introdueed a bill to prohibit the
manufacture and sale of butter substitutes.
The debate on this measure was extremely
short, the bill getting first, second and third
readings in what appears to be a inatter of
minutes.
As it may be of interest to honourable
senators, I sbould like to read the debate in
the other house on the original oleomargarine
bill that became law in 1886. In the flouse of
Commons Debates of 1886, Volume II, at page
1728, I find the following:
Substitutes for Butter
Mr. McLELAN introduced Bill (No. 149) to
prohibit the manufacture and sale of substitutes
for butter.
Bill rend the first time.
Mr. MeLELAN moved the second reading of
the Bill.
Mr. BLAKE: I do not know what is in the
Bill, but I hope it does not prohibit the importation of ail substitutes for butter. The titie is
rather wide. There are a good many very wholesome substitutes for butter.
Mr. MITCHIELL: I wonder if it would cover
molasses. Because in my part of the country
the people use a good deal *of it as a substitute
for butter.
Titie changed by adding after "sale of" the
word "certain."
Motion agreed to, Bill read the second time,
considered in Committee, reported, read the
third tinme and passed.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: That is worse than the
Canada Day Bill.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I might say that when
the measure reacbed this bouse it reeeived
equally summnry and favourable treatment.
I was very mucb interested to note that the
preamble of the bill of 1886 recited that, "the
use of certain substitutes for butter beretofore
manufactured and exposed for sale in Canada
is injurious to bealth." I expeet that this preliminary statemnent must have been designed
to meet the point raised by Mr. David
Milis and others who dwelt on the constitutional aspect of the measure. Oddly enough,
when the Statutes of Canada were revised in
the samne year, and when this measure was
carried into the Revised Statutes of 1886
as Chapter 100 of that consolidation. the preamble was dropped, and doca not appear
thereafter. It would be grossly improper for

182

SENATE

me to make any suggestion as to what that
might imply, but honourable senators, particularly those of the profession to which I
have the honour to belong, can reach their
own conclusions.
While I am speaking of the legal profession
I may say that I lay no claim to being an
expert on constitutional law, but I venture to
suggest that there is grave doubt whether this
parliament has any jurisdiction to prohibitthat is, as distinct from regulating-the manufacture and sale in Canada of an article of
food which cannot be shown to be injurious
to the public health. I suppose parliament
can prohibit the importation of any substance into Canada, but manufacture and
sale certainly seem to me to be matters of
property and civil rights, and as such to come
within the legislative powers of the provinces.
I doubt very much if this parliament bas
any more right to enact a prohibition of the
manufacture and sale of wholesome butter
substitutes than it would have to enjoin the
making and selling of, say, patent leather
shoes or rayon stockings, or even nylon
stockings.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: In the past parliament
bas enacted certain prohibitions with regard
to liquors, in the Canada Temperance Act. I
suppose that was done on the ground that
liquors are injurious to health.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Who disputes that?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I am sure there are
many honourable gentlemen in this house who
would not agree that that was a sound ground.
I am prepared to leave the decision on the
constitutional point to people who are more
competent to deal with it than I am. I only
wish in passing to point out to the dairy
industry's friends in this chamber that paragraph (a) of section-5 of the present Dairy
Industry Act may not be the strong bulwark
against competition from oleomargarine that
they believe it to be. Possibly, if the statute
had been designed merely to regulate the
manufacture and sale of the commodity it
would have a better chance to survive a
test in the courts, as coming under the heading of "The regulation of trade and commerce", or "Weights and measures", or a combination of both. But why should the manufacture of oleomargarine be regulated any
more than the sale and manufacture of Crisco
or some other types of shortening, or salad
oils? I am not pressing the constitutional
point. I only mention it by the way, in the
hope that it may disturb some honourable
gentlemen who have so strongly pleaded the
cause of the dairy industry.
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

It bas already been explained by earlier
speakers that the legislation which first
appeared in 1886 was translated as a section
of the Dairy Industry Act, first passed, I
think, in 1914; and the prohibition with which
we are now concerned appears as paragraph
(a) of section 5 of that act. The first time
subsequent to 1886 that the prohibition was
relaxed was, as we know, in 1919. The act
passed in that year suspended the prohibition
for a stipulated period, and this suspension
was later extended for yearly periods up until
1923 or 1924. I am told it was 1923.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I think the last suspension was dropped in 1923 but sale remained in effect until 1924.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
1924.

That is right: March

Hon. Mr. BENCH: Actually, from my
notes it would appear that the last amendment to the act was made in 1922, extending
authority for the importation and manufacture until the 31st day of August 1923, and
for the offering for sale until the 1st of March,
1924. So apparently the 1st of March 1924
was the last day upon which oleomargarine
could legally be sold in Canada.
It would seem that by 1919 the reputation
of oleomargarine as a butter substitute must
have considerably improved.
The product
could not then have been regarded as injurions
to public health.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It must be remermbered that the price of butter was then 80
cents a pound, and that oleomargarine was
selling at 25 cents.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I was about to say that
there must have been some good reason for
enacting the Oleomargarine Act of 1919.
Whether the supply of butter was short or
the price of butter was very high, I am
unaware, but in any event the government and
parliament of that day deemed it desirable in
the interest of the country that the absolute
prohibition which had obtained since 1886
should be temporarily suspended to meet a
then current need. I suggest to honourable
senators that the act of 1919, must have
proved satisfactory, otherwise the extensions of
1920, 1921 and 1922 would not have been made.
In the present state of affairs why should
we not follow the precedent of 1919? In my
respectful opinion a suspension of the existing
prohibition for a limited time would meet all
the objections which have been put forward
against the bill, and might serve to put on the
tables of countless people in this country a
wholesome butter substitute which they need,
and which is now denied them.

MAY 7, 1946

Only today I received from a housewife
in Niagara Falls, Ontario, a letter which I
think constitutes one of the finest arguments
I have heard outside of this chamber in support of the bill under consideration. If I may
not be considered as imposing on the good
will of honourable members, 'I should like to
read the letter. In the opening paragraph the
writer remarks that she has read newspaper
aceounts of the debate in the Senate and is
writing me on that account. She then says:
We need butter in adequate amounts in our
daily diet if we are to maintain the reasonably
high standard of health and nutrition that we
have already achieved here in Canada. If it is
not possible to procure butter in sufficient quantity then we must have a suitable substitute.
The only wholly satisfactory substitute of which
we know is oleomargarine.
Butter is one of our very best sources of
Vitamin A, and our first real knowledgeof
Vitamin A deficiency seems to have come from
Denmark during.World War 1, when all butter
was exported to Germany, leaving only unsatisfactory substitutes for expectant mothers and
small children. Over 400 of these children were
studied; 27 per cent became totally blind; 35 per
cent retained vision in only one eye, and the remainder showed that both eyes had been involved.
We are, however, more concerned with borderline cases caused by faulty nutrition than we
are by an extreme vitamin deficiency. An examination of nutritional research material revealing studies among industrial workers suffering
from "night blindness" (that is, undue consciousness 6f the glare of head-lights when night driving, and the inability of the eye to readily adjust
itself from light to dark), shows that in most
cases these workers carried lunches in which
there were insufficient amounts of butter or
other satisfactory sources of Vitamin A.
Now, it is true that carrots and lettuce, because of the carotene which they contain, and
egg yolks are equally valuable sources of this
important food factor, but unfortunately they
lack the staying power or hunger-satisfying appeal of a robust sandwich.
But who cares to eat sandwiches that, regardless of the excellent qualitv of the fillings contained, are dry because of lack of butter? I
know whereof I speak, because for two and a
half years, and until recently, I was the nutritionist at the Norton Abrasive Qo. in Chippawa,
where we not only served thrée hot meals a
day to plant workers, but prepared packaged
lunches for a large number of workers in the
plant ,who, working straight eight-hour shifts
were allowed only twenty minutes for lunch,
and were therefore unable to eat a hot meal at
the company restaurant. Last year I was Chairman of the Greater Niagara Branch of the
Health League, and a large part of our programme as assigned to us by the Health League
of Canada was devoted to a study of box lunches
carried by workers and school children.
Prior to my work at the Norton Co., I had ten
years' experience as a hospital dietitian; four
years at the MeKeller Hospital at Fort William,
four years at the Park Avenue Hospital in
Rochester, New York, and two years at the
University Post Graduate Hospital, Philadelphia. Therefore, I know how necessary butter is
in the patients' dietary. Convalescent postoperative patients are frequently allowed cer63268-14

183

tain foods that could only be made palatable by
butter; many diabetic patients and others on
gastrie ulcer diets or on high fat diets used in
the treatment of epilepsy need it for therapeutie
reasons.
There seems to be a general feeling that we
are being denied oleomargarine because of a
sentimental consideration for the industry which
produces butter, and that this consideration is
being shown out of gratitude for the excellent
work donc by the members of this industry
during the war years.
This indicates that some comments of my
honourable friends in this house have gained
wide publicity. The letter continues:
But, indeed, Mr. Bench, who is there among
us in all industries and professions who did not
do his utmost according to his ability? What is
there unique about any citizen who does his
duty during war-time?
We have no assurance that this is the last
period in which we are likely to experience a
butter shortage, but rather that there is a tremendous need for Canadian food products all

over the world. Therefore, why do we-not supplement what butter we are able to produce
here in Canada with oleomargarine, thereby
taking care of our own requirements as well as
those in Europe and elsewhere?
I think, honourable senators, that is an excellent letter, and for that reason I have
brought it to your attention.
To return to the precedent of 1919, the
Oleomargaine Act, which suspended the prohibition then and now appearing in the Dairy
Industry Act, in addition to effecting a temporary suspension of the prohibition provided
for a system of licensing both the importation
and manufacture of the substitute. The Minister of Agriculture was charged with the
responsibility of administering the act. He
could issue licenses and could cancel them for
violations of the act or of the regulations
which under its provisions the Governor in
Council was empowered to make. Incidentally, the Governor in Council was also authorized to make regulations for marking and
labelling packages and so on, and penalties
were prescribed for violations of the regulations or of the act itself.
Having given the house that glimpse of the
act of 1919, I would now suggest that we compose the differences which seem to divide us
on this matter by following, in principle, the
precedent of 1919. I do not think it is necessary to incorporate in a bill all the provisions
of the previous legislation having to do with
licensing, inspection and so forth. The Food
and Drugs Act, passed in 1920, would seem
sufficiently broad to cover the situation in
It contains provisions under
that regard.
which the Governor in Council is empowered
to make regulations fixing standards of quality,
limits of variability, packaging and labelling,
and so forth, which of course would apply to
a food product such as oleomargarine. I

might also add that under that statute severe
penalties are prescribed for violations of its
provisions or the regulations made under it.
Section 6 of the regulations passed under
the authority of the Food and Drugs Act
deals with the subject of edible vegetable
fats and oils.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will you read it?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The section is quite
extensive, but if the honourable gentleman
wishes me to do so I will read it.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Section 6 will be found
in the office consolidation of the regulations
of 1942, at page 27. It covers two full pages
of fine print.
For all the reasons which I have stated, and
which honourable members have listened to
very patiently, I suggest that the situation
would be fully met if the present bill were
simply amended by suspending the operation
of subsection (a) of section 5 of the Dairy
Industry Act as to the importation and manufacture of oleomargarine for a period of,say,
two years, and as to sale, for a period of
three years. The reason for proposing the
difference in time of expiry as between manufacture and sale is of course obvious: persons
with a stock of oleomargarine on their shelves
would have to be given time to get rid of it.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: At the outset of
his remarks the honourable gentleman declared
that as an old-fashioned Liberal he was against
any restriction whatever on the manufacture,
importation or sale of food or a food substitute. How does he reconcile that declaration
with his proposal to re-impose the present
restriction one or two years hence?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I would say to the
honourable gentleman that my old-fashioned
Liberalism is having lots of trouble.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. BENCH:
the section entirely.

I 'hould like to repeal

Hon. Mr. EULER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: But in an effort, as I
have said, to compose the differences of view
which have been expressed in this chamber,
I thought justice might wink for a moment and
let me urge this amendment. I may also say
to him that in the two-or-three-year interval
I hope some enterprising gentleman may have
cause to let our courts have a look at subsection (a) of section 5 of the Dairy Industry
Act.
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

Let me conclude my remarks, honourable
members, by moving, seconded by the honourable senator from South Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly):
That Bill G, an Act to amend the Dairy Industry Act, be not now read a second time, but
that it be amended as follows:
By striking out the words "Paragraph (a) of"
immediately before the word "section" in line
4, and by striking out the word "repealed" in
line 6, and by inserting after the word "is" in
ine 6 the following:
"amended by adding thereto the following
subsection:
"(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in
subsection 1 of this section or in any other
statute or law, the manufacturing or importation of oleomargarine into Canada shall be permitted until the first day of August, 1948, and
the offering for sale and the having in possession
for sale of oleomargarine shall be permitted until
the first day of August, 1949."
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Has the honourable
gentleman considered paragraph (d) of section 5? I have not the act before me, but I
think there are two prohibitory paragraphs
in that section. It nay be that his amendment is broad enough to cover both.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I am grateful to the
honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger) for bringing that to my attention. I
am sorry that I, too, do not have the statute
before me. I may say, however, that I did
consider the whole section, and I took advantage of the advice of our Law Clerk. He
considered that the amendment which I am
now proposing would be sufficient to accomplish the purpose I have in mind.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senalors, when this bill was first discussed I
expressed the opinion that I would support
it, subject to a certain amendment.
The
amendment just moved by the honourable
senator from Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) is
along the lines of the amendment that I had
in mind at that time. As I understand, its
effect is to suspend for two years the prohibition of the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine. I was anxious to see some limitation on the suspension of the prohibition
against the manufacture of substitutes for
butter, for I felt that otherwise our dairymen
might become alarmed and not make the
necessary preparations to supply the future
demand for butter. If the bill is amended as
now proposed, and they have reason to expect
such a demand, they will no doubt place
themselves in a position two years hience to
supply it.
I have listened to a good many arguments
against the bill. My reason for supporting
it is that il may assist the man of ordinary

MAY 7, 1946
means, who is not in a position to get butter
for his family, to purchase in the form of margarine those fats and oils which are so essential to the normal growth of children.
It may be argued that if the bill were
enacted it would take away the butter market
of our dairy farmers. I cannot regard that as a
sound argument under the circumstances,
because at the present time there is not
suffièient butter production to supply the
demand, and therefore they are not losing
anything. It is contended in some quarters
that with spring opening up the increased flow
of milk will make plenty of butter available.
I cannot agree with that contention at all. I
am glad to hear from our leader (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that there is plenty of milk in Manitoba, but I understood from him that since
most of it is required for other purposes, no
great increase in butter production can be
expected. I am not hopeful that there will
be any marked increase in production for
some time to come. In my view it depends
largely on labour. The dairyman has ta milk
every morning and evening seven days a week,
and his cows require careful attention. A
farmer and his family can carry on dairying
all right, but the farmer who has to rely on
hired help finds it very difficult to get.
I heard somebody express sympathy for the
sons of farmers who enlisted in the early
stages of the war and are now returning home.
He feared the passage of this bill would deter
them from resuming farm life. My experience
in interviewing farmers' sons who have returned from overseas is that they are as well
satisfied as any class of service men, and are
very glad to get back to the quiet life of the
farm with its freedom from discipline incident
to army life. The serious loss of labour is
accounted for by the fact that during the war
many farmers' sons who were unfit for active
service were allowed to go into war factories
during the winter aftdr working on the farm
throughout the summer. They got accustomed
to the, short hours and bright lights of the
city, and they resent working Saturdays and
Sundays-something absolutely necessary in
the dairy industry. Now that they are no
longer required in war work, we find great
difficulty in getting them to go back to farm
life.
I may remind honourable senators that one
branch of the livestock business is the production of beef; the other, of milk and milk
products. To successfully produce beef much
less labour is required than is necessary to
produce milk and milk products. A generation ago the practice was to tie up beef cattle
and feed them in their stalls. Now twenty
to thirty head of cattle are kept together in
63268-144

185

large sheds equipped with running water
and ample racks, and it is a simple matter to
put sufficient hay in the racks to last over
Punday. Consequently there is a great
temptation for dairymen to go into the beef
business. Of course it requires a different type
of cattle. As far as I am concerned we
should give the dairymen every encouragement possible. At the same. time we are in
duty bound to do all we can to give relief
to the people who are so much in need. At
the present time they require butter or a
butter substitute containing oils and fats.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Has the honourable
senator from Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) considered the practice under which he is now
proceeding, and will he please quote the rule
by which he can amend a bill on second
reading?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Could the honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
quote a rule which prevents such an
amendment?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I have not had time
to look it up, but I think the honourable
gentleman, instead of moving that the bill be
not now read a second time, should allow it to
proceed to second reading on the understanding that it will be sent to the Committee of
the Whole to ba amended in accordance with
his suggestion. On the motion for the second
reading of a bill we can discuss its principle,
but I do not think we can make any form of
amendment.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: If the honourable
gentleman from L'Acadie will permit me to
cite an earlier experience in this chamber, I
think it might clear up his problem. The
honourable senator may recall that a session
or two ago in a debate on a bill to amend
the Election Act, I moved an amendment
on either the second or third reading of the
bill-I do not recall which-and the same
objection was raised as is now raised by the
honourable senator from L'Acadie. The honourable the Speaker of this house was at first
inclined to sustain the objection; but on reconsidering -the matter he said that while in the
House of Commons a motion to amend a bill
on second or third reading-whichever it waswould not be proper, in the Senate such a
motion was quite in order. The words which I
employ in the amendment today are the words
which he very kindly put into my mouth at
that time. The motion before the house when I
rose was that the bill be read the second timp.

186

SENATE

It seems that I am bound to move that it
be not now read a second time, but be dealt
with thus and so. To refer to that precedent
in this chamber is the best way I can explain
my position to the honourable gentleman.
Hon; Mr. FARRIS: If the bill is not to
be read a second time now, when is it to be
read?
Hon. Mr. COPP: What does my honourable
friend say in regard to rule 24 (c)?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What does it say?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Rule 24 (c) reads as
follows:
One day's notice must be given of any of the
following motions: (c) for any substantial
amendment to a private bill.
Hon. Mr. EULER: This is not a private
bill. It is a public bill introduced by a
private member.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: On the point of order.
There is no doubt that an amendment eau
be moved on third reading, because that is
the last chance. An honourable senator who
wishes to move an amendment on second
reading of a bill should rise on the motion for
second reading and state that when the bill
goes to committee he will propose a certain
amendment.
My honourable friend from
Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) could say that he
supports the second reading of this bill, but
that his reason for doing so is to get the bill
into committee where he will move a certain
amendment. My experience in this house
and my knowledge of the rules in the other
place lead me to believe that one cannot
move an amendment to change the whole
principle of a bill, as this one would do.
I would suggest that the honourable gentleman adjourn the debate until tomorrow. In
the meantime he can look up his authority.
In that way he will make no mistake.

the house the then honourable member for
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) said he would
not move the third reading, so I moved it
when he was not present.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The bill was read
the second time.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, it was read the second time and then went to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. The reason I remember the incident so well is that some
honourable senators used to refer to me as
"the honourable senator from Winnipeg," and
the then honourable senator for Winnipeg
would get up and protest, stating that I was
the "junior member for Winnipeg."
I said to Mr. Meighen, "Can we not strike
these sections out in committee? We are
going to have trouble with some honourable
senators who will vote against the bill." He
replied, "Yes, you can strike out the sections
in committee." I said, "If they are not struck
out in committee then you can vote against
the bill when it comes back to the house."
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators,
I think the question of whether an amendment
can be moved before a bill is read the second
time is quite clearly answered by the Forms
of Proceeding of the Senate of Canada. Section
69, which is to be found at page 34, reads as
follows:
The Clerk having read the Order of the Day,
the Senator in charge explains the nature of the
bill, and moves second reading. The Speaker
puts the question: "It is moved, etc." The
bill is then diseussed in all its bearings, and
usually only such amendments as are necessary
to prevent the bill being read the second time
are moved at this stage.
Section 74 provides that:
If an amendment is moved to the motion
for the second reading, the Speaker says: "The
question, honourable senators, before the Senate, is for the second reading of Bill intituled,
etc. In amendment, it is moved by . . . .

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I remind the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
that in the debate on the Divorce and Matrimonial Causes Bill in this chamber in 1938
the then leader, Right Honourable Mr.
Meighen, took that position, but that the bill
was referred back to a special committee.

seconded by . . . , etc."

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I happen to remember that
bill very clearIy. As introduced into this
house it was supposed to follow the English
act, but the honourable member who intro-uced it added two sections of his own. The
honourable leader said that he was in favour
3f the bill provided those two sections were
taken out. It was read the second time with
those two sections in it, and in committee they
were struck out. When the bill came back to

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable members,
since the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) bas raised the question,
I should like to follow it up. I desire to
adjourn the debate until tomorrow, at which
time I will produce the official report of the
1938 debates.

Hon. Mr. BENCH.

So it is clear from Forms of Proceeding
that the rule permits of amendments being
moved on second reading of a bill.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: That deals. with
an amendment to a motion, not to a bill.

Hon. Mr. EULER: The honourable senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) cannot move
the adjournment of the debate.

MAY 7, 194
Hon. Mr. HAIG: 1 have not spoken on the
amendment.
Hlon. Mr. EULER: Arn I wrong in sssurning that the honourable gentleman bas just
said that there could be no amendinent on
second reading?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: As the honourable
member from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) bas said, there can only be an
ameadment to a motion. I could move the
three months' hoist or the six months' hoist,
which does not involve the principle of the
bill; but in order to settie the point I move
the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, may I point out that His Honour
the Speaker bas not yet put the amendment.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The ainendinent
is now before the bouse. Rule 24, section (c),
provides that one day's notice must be given
for any substantial amendment to a private
bill, and section (d) of the same rule says
that one day's notice is required for the consîderation of a substantial amendment made
in a public bill by a Committee of the Whole,
but I flnd no rule relating to amendment on
second reading.
There is now before the Senate a motion
by the honourable senator from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that the debate be adjourned.
Is there a seconder for the motion?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I second the motion.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No; let us go on with
the debate.
The Hlon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators. those in favour of the motion for
adjourument of the debate will please say
"ccontent."
Some Hon. SIENATORS: Content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those opposed
will say "not content".
Some Hon. SENATORS,: Not content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I declare the
motion carried.
The debate was adjourned.

items concerned. As honourable senators are
aware, there are now standing on the order
paper for second reading the bihl amending
the Dairy Industry Act and the bill respecting
Canada Day. I have no means of knowing
how many. honourable senators wish ta discuss these two measures, but I hope that if
either one or both of these bis corne before
us for consideration tomorrow, they may be
deferred until we have disposed of the Ujnited

BUSINESS 0F THE SENATE
TARDY PROGRESS 0F LEGISLATION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. A. C. HARDY: Honourable senators,
before the orders of the day are called, with
the permission of the Senate I should like to
say a few words on a matter which has been
causing rnany of our members considerable
concern. My remarlçs are proxnpted by a short
news item which appeared in this morning's
paper. I wish to protest the eternal delays,
the standing over of bills and motions, and
the adjournrnent of debates in the middle of
the afternoon. Yesterday the debate on a
matter of considerable interest and to which
a good deal of time has been given, was

188

SENATE

adjourned at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. The
Canada Day bill has been on the doorstep of
this chamber since the 9th of April.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: A few weeks ago the
honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon.
Mr. McRae) deplored the fact that, except for
dealing with a few government bills introduced by the honourable leader of the government here, the Senate had accomplished but
little since the opening of parliament.
Earlier in the session the honourable leader
made us very happy by saying that he would
bring before us twelve bills-he will correct
me if I am wrong-some of which were routine
and others of importance. Of the four already
brought in, two were of routine character, one
was fairly important, but not·contentious, and
one, the Explosives bill, received a good deal
of consideration. These bills represent the only
work the Senate has initiated this session. It
is true that we have also had a few routine
bills from the other bouse. The motion introduced by the honourable member from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has been
standing on the order paper for four or five
weeks. The bill to amend the Dairy Industry
Act was introduced on March 27, and we still
seem to be as far from a conclusion on it as
when we started.
Now, with the permission of the house, I
should like to read the newspaper; article to
which I have already referred. It appeared
in the Ottawa Citizen this morning, and is as
follows:
For some unexplained reason the Senate adjourned without taking up either the Canada
Day bill, sponsored by Senator W. E. Foster,
or a resolution by Senator Arthur Roebuck
urging an inquiry into Canada's immigration
I call particular attention to the next
saragraph, which reads as follows:
The common practice of the Senate in adjourning and spreading debates on different subjects
:ver so many days, or weeks, or months, tends
to dissipate interest in the questions and remove

all chance of attaining any impact on public
opinion on the matters being discussed.
This paragraph sumas up everything I have
said and should like te say. But I do wish
to protest now against the continual practice
of asking that business stand over or debates
be adjourned, pqrticularly in the middle of
the afternoon. Yesterday afternoon we sat for
an hour and a half, and adjourned with
nothing done. I have heard several honourable gentlemen speak of this matter. One
distinguished senator said he proposed to leave
next week and did not intend to come back.
Though I do net pretend to be a distinguished
senator, I could follow his example and go
Hon. Mr. HARDY.

back to my farm where I can, as my honourable friend from Saskatchewan North (Hon.
Mr. Horner) suggested. milk a cow or two
and at least be getting something donc.
I do not wish te be personal in my remarks,
but I feel in this honourpble bouse there is
something resembling a campaign of attrition, as this newspaper article suggests, that
a debate goes on for a few minutes or an
hour or se, and then is adjourned. In that
way it is dragged along for more than a month.
until people have lost interest in it. J venture te say that honourable members have
not only lest interest in the Dairy Industry
Bill but are getting pretty sick of it. I hope
that when the orders of the day are called
this afternoon they will be dealt with, net
postponed until tomorrow or some day two
or three weeks hence.
DAIRY INDUSTRY BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING

NEGATIVED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Euler for the second reading of Bill G.
an Act to amend the Dairy Industry Act, and
on the proposed amendment of Hon. Mr.
Bench that the bill be net now read a second
time but that it be amended, as follows:
By striking out the words "Paragraph (a)
of" imnediately before the word "section" in
line 4, and by striking out the word "repealed"
in line 6, and b-Y inserting after the word "is"
in line 6 the following:
"amended by adding thereto the following
subsection:
"(2) Notwithstanding anything contained in
subsection 1 of this section or in any other
statute or law, the manufacturing or importation
of oleoinargarine into Canada shall be permitted
until the first day of August, 1948, and the
offering for sale and the having in possession
for sale of oleomargarine shall be permitted
until the first day of August, 1949."
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, yesterday at the conclusion of his
speech on the motion for second reading of
the Dairy Industry Bill the honourable senator from Linwen (Hon. Mr. Bench) moved an
amendment to the motion.
Exception was thereupon taken te the right
of a senator to move such an amendment
on the motion for second reading of a bill.
The Senate Rules were consulted and disclosed
that one day's notice must be given of a
motion for any substantial amendment te
a private bill, and a substantial amendment
made in a public bill in Committee of the
Whole requires one day's notice but there
is no rule providing for an amendment to the
motion for second reading.
The honourable gentleman from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) quoted section 74 of the
Forms of Proceeding of the Senate, which indicates that such an amendment may properly

MAY 8, 1946

189

where amendments could be proposed; but
of late the practice has changed somewhat,
and now bills are more often referred ta
standing committees. Amendments made to
a bill in a standing committee are of course
reported to the Senate for its consideration.
Although there is no rule of the Senate
governing the point raised yesterday, I rule
that the amendment is out of order.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
with leave of the Senate, perhaps I, as mover
of the amendment, may say just a word.
After some slight research into the question
of procedure which was raised yesterday by
the honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon.
Mr. Léger) I concur in the opinion just
expressed by His Honour the Speaker, and
consequently I intend humbly to submit to
his ruling that the amendment is out of order.
That being so, may I add this further observation? In my view the bill should be amended
for the reasons I stated yesterday-rather
lengthily I fear. I now desire to inform
honourable senators that it is my intention
to support the motion for second reading
and, if it is adopted, to move either in committee or on motion for third reading, the
amendment which I sought to move yesterday.
Some, hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. T. D. BOUCHARD: Before the motion for second reading is put, I should like
to state my opinion on this bill. I come from
a dairy farming district, and if I thought the
measure would hurt the dairy industry I would
vote against it. But I, do not believe that in
the long run it would have any prejudicial
effect.
The prohibition against the manufacture,
importation and sale of oleomargarine bas
been in force for a good many years, and from
what honourable members have stated it
appears that Canada is the only country in the
world having such prohibitory legislation. I
do not believe that this is a good way of
protecting any industry; indeed, if the prinany circumstances connected with its introducciple were extended beyond a certain point, it

be made, but most honourable members are
aware that neither in the House of Commons
nor in the provincial legislatures has it been
the practice to move amendments at the
second reading of a bill.
If I had been required ta make a ruling yesterday, it is probable that I should have
ruled the amendment out of order for the
simple reason that our general practice requires that at least one day's notice shall be
given of intention to move an important
amendment to a bill, it being felt that such
notice is necessary in order that honourable
members may have a fair opportunity of
being apprised of the amendment before it is
votèd upon. However, I was saved the necessity of making a ruling yesterday by the
motion of the honourable leader ta my left
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that the debate be adjourned.
Since then I have had an opportunity to review the practice ofothis house. I am advised
by officers who have made a search of our
records that there appears to be no rule prohibiting an amendment ta the motion for
second reading, but no precedent has been
found an amendment being made on the
second reading of a bill.
It is stated in May's Parliamentary Practice, page 356, third paragraph:
The second reading is the most important
stage through which a bill is required to pass;
for its whole principle is the» at issue, and is
affirmed or denied by a vote of the house; though
it is not regular on this occasion to discuss, in
detail, its several clauses, and this principle
bas been enforced on other stages of a bill.
And on pages 357 and 358:
The ordinary practice is to move an amendment to the question by leaving out the word
"now," and adding the words "three monthe" or
"six months" or any other term beyond the
probable duration of the séssion, etc.
It is also competent to a member who desires
to place on record any special reasons for not
agreeing to the second reading of a bill, to move,
as an amendment to the question, a resolution
declaratory of sone principle adverse to, or
differing from, the principles, policy or provisions of the bill; or expressing opinions as to

families the right to purchase, in the form of
oleomargarine, the oils and fats so essential
to the diet of growing children. If it is necessary to subsidize the manufacture of butter,
let us do it and advise the people what it
costs. There is such a difference in taste and
appearance between oleomargarine and good
butter that even if the substitute were offered
at a lower price I am confident there would
still be a good market for butter-a market
that would keep the dairy industry fully engaged. I am opposed to class legislation, and
the act which this bill seeks to amend
zertainly comes under that designation.
An honourable member stated that he could
not vote for the introduction of oleomargarine
because the people in his constituency were
against it. They may be, but I do not believe
electoralism should induce the Parliament of
Canada to enact legislation limiting the freedom of our people to purchase whatever kind
of food they may desire. It has been stated
on good authority that 20 per cent of milk fat
enters into the manufacture of oleomargarine.
It may be argued that the substitute can be
sold so much cheaper than butter that it may
displace this last-mentioned commodity; but
I think honourable members will admit that if
the volume of oleomargarine sales increases
by leaps and bounds, as bas been suggested,
and not a pound of butter is sold, even then
so much milk would be sent ta the oleomargarine factories that in the long run the dairy
industry would not suffer at all. I am confident that no matter how low the price of
oleomargarine may be, good butter will always
command a ready sale in this country.
It is my opinion that in considering the principle of the free manufacture and sale of foods
necessary to humanity we should bear in mind
not only the dairy farmer who sells his butter
fat but also the live stock farmer who sells
the beef fats which enter into the making of
oleomargarine. It is said that we shall have
to import certain vegetable oils and fats; butI do not believe this will in any way hurt our
farming industry.
As to the amendment submitted by the
honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon. Mr.
Bench), I shall be glad to consider it. I hope
that without undue delay the government will
find some method of protecting the dairy
industry without prohibiting the manufacture,
importation and sale of an article of food
essential to the welfare of the masses of this
country.
Hon. J. A. MacDONALD: Honourable
senators, I do not propose to make a speech
on this bill, for I think all the arguments,
either for and against, have been brought to
the attention of the house. My purpose in
Hon. Mr. BOUCHARD.

rising is ta place before honourable senators
a resolution passed by the Dairymen's Association of Prince Edward Island. It is in these
words:
Whereas, the maintenance of soil fertility
should at all times be the main object of the
f armers,
And whereas, it bas long been recognized by
agricultural authorities that dairying is the one
branch of farming that tends the best to maintain this fertility and anything that might be
done to weaken the dairy industry would reflect
unfavourably upon agriculture in general by
lessening its purchasing power whieh in turn
might disturb the whole economy set-up.
And wbereas the present shortage of butter is
only temporary, caused in part by an unwillingness of labour to engage in agricultural work,
a scarcity of dairy equipment, and partly by a
greater quantity of milk being diverted into
the fluid milk trade rather than into churning
cream caused by the low price paid for butterfat in comparison to that paid for fluid milk,
And whereas, during the war years the dairy
farmers of Canada, under great difficulties and
at a financial sacrifice, valiantly maintained the
production line, a feat only made possible by
overtime work and family labour.
And whereas, anything that might cause the
farmers of Canada to turn their attention from
dairying to other lines of agriculture such as the
production of poultry, hogs, beef, grain or potatoes, lines that would be more attractive to
labour and allow of shorter hours, but would
at the same time rob our people, especially the
children, of a food which cannot bo replaced for
its nutritional value by any other commodity,
Therefore, be it resolved, that we, the Prince
Edward Island Dairymen's Association oppose
most strongly the passage of the Bill now before
the Canadian Senate having for its object the
manufacture and sale, within Canada of aleomargarine, a substance produced by the products of cheap labour in other lands where a
lower standard of living prevails than that
which we would like to see for our own Canadian people.
-Hon. Mr. HARDY: Did the honourable
senator say that was a resolution passed by a
dairymen's association?
Hon. Mr. MacDONALD: It was a resolution passed by the Prince Edward Island
Dairymen's Association.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:

Hon. Mr. MacDONALD: I am fully in
accord with the resolution, and believe that
to pass this measure at the present time
would be a mistake.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it is moved by Senator Euler, seconded by Senator Hardy, that Bill G,
intituled an Act to amend the Dairy Industry
Act, be now read the second time. Is it your
desire to concur in the motion?

MAY 8, 1946
Honourable senators, I would point out that
when the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr., Euler) has spoken the debate will
be concluded.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators, I
should like to express to honourable members
my satisfaction that at last the stage has been
reached when we rnay corne ta a decision on
what is perhaps, in a national way, a matter
of relatively srnall importance. I introduced
this bill five weeks ago with the feeling that
its merits were so obvious that honourable
senators who are not embarrassed by political considerations would accept it without
very serious opposition. I arn prornpted by
the remarks of the last speaker, the honourable senator from Cardigan (Hon. Mr. MacDonald), to say that the only real opposition
to the bill in this house has corne frorn the
dairyf interests. Opposition from thîs s~ource
is quite understandable. But may I say to
my honourable friend that I have received
dozens of letters, sorne telegrarns, and certainly rnany statements, frorn the mass of
consurners in this country who are in-favour
of this bill.
Let us consider the situation for a moment.
It is adrnitted that there is a growing shortage of butter; it is also adrnitted that there
is an excellent sixbstitute for it ini what is
When there is a
called oleornargarine.
scarcity of one article, and perhaps an available substitute-I ernphasize the word "perhaps"ý-what is rnore natural than to rnake
available the substitute for the article we
cannot get in the quantity we desire? Apart
from pcrmitting every man and womnan to
exercise the inherent right to purchase freely
what he or she canï afford, what harrn can corne
to the dairy interests by the passing of this
measure? My honourable friend frorn The
Laurentides (Hon. Mr. Bouchard), who
speaks with some authority, is of the opinion
that the dairy interests will not be injured.
That has been rny conviction ahl along.
My honourable friend, the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) stated in his address that
he was for butter. Suýrely nobody is against
butter! *If the people of Canada had a
choice between butter and oleomnargarine I
believe that 90 per cent, or per.kaps 99 per
cent, of thern would choose butter.
Sorne hon. MEMBERS8: Hear,' heay.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I had intended to inake
sorne reply to the objections to the bill, but
this has been done sa effectively by others,
notably by the honourable member for Inkerrnan (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), the honourable
senator from St. Boniface (Hon. Mr. Howden),
and the honourable senator who moved the

191

amendment and was ruled out of order (Hon.
Mr. Bench)-if I rnay name thern without
discririnating-that it will not be necessary
for me to say very mueh.
I should like, however, to make one or
two observations. After my speech, if I may
sa designate it, upon the motion for second
reading of the bill, 1 was rather surprised at
the alacrity with which the honourable leader
of the government hastened to declare his
opposition to the measure. Here are his
words:
Honourable senators, 1 take the earliest oppor"tunity to speak on this bill in order that I may
clear up any misapprehension as to the government's attitude with respect to it.
The honourable gentleman said, further:
-the goverument bas not, to my knowledge, considered taking any further action, and in no
way is it directly or indirectly concerned with
this bill, which is introduced by a private member acting in that capacity.
And again, he said:
-the introduction of this bll in the Seoate had
nothing to do with governmeut policy.
I do not know just why reference was made
to the private member ini that way. It seerns
to me rather gratuitous. Every honourable
senator knows--unless he is such a novice ini
this house as can scarcely be irnaginedthat no private member would introduce a
government bill. Such bills are always introduced here by the senator whio represents
the government. I think the implication was
that I arn only a private member. 0f course
I arn only a private member. With the exception of the honourable leader of the government, and possibly Hîs Honour the Speaker,
every honourable senator in this chamnber is
a private member. I believe even the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
would be forced to classify hirnself as such.
Hon. Mr. COPP: You are in good cornpany.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have aIl the rights of a
private niember. I do not think 1 was presurnptuous in introducing this bill, althoughi
the honourable senator from Wellington (Hon.
Mr. Howard) rather intimated as much the
other day when he suggested that ail legi-l"lation should corne froni the other house, and
I suppose should receive the rubber-,starnp
of approval without any amendment by the
Senate. May 1 read rule 61, which is a simple
one? It says
It is the right of every Senator to briug ln a
bill.
If the remarks of the honourable leader of
the government concerning his opposition to
the bill which of course he had a right to
make-were for the purpose of iuforming
the Senate that the government was opposed

192

SENATE

to the bill, I should have welcomed a more
frank statement on his part. If the statement
of my honourable friend from Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard) is correct. that private
members of this house have no right to introduce a public bill hereHon. Mr. HOWARD: That was not what
I said.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I am subject to correction, but that is the implication of the honourable gentleman's remarks as I read them.
If it is a fact that a private member of this
house has no right to introduce -a public bill
here, I should say that we are receiving our
remuneration under false pretences, and it is
about time the Senate was abolished.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The bill that I have
introduced is my own bill. I am not flying
a kite for anyone, whether for political, financial, commercial or any other purposes. It
may be a poor thing, but it is my own. In
a recent Canadian Press dispatch from Ottawa,
Mr. H. Hannam, president of the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture, is quoted as
follows:
We have reason to believe that private interests who would stand to profit from the manufacture and sale of oleomargarine are taking
advantage of the short supply of butter to press
the issue.

He kindly adds:
We are not charging that the legislators who
are sponsoring this bill in Parliament are connected with. or inspired by such interests. We
cau point out, however, that their action is unconsciously playing into the hands of these
interests.
I rather resent the implication in that statement. While Mr. Hannam exonerates us from
any charge of sinister motives. he does say
by implication, or directly, that we are more
sinned against than sinning, and that in our
ignorance we are the unwitting tools of others
and doing something injurious to the dairy
interests. I alone am responsible for this bill.
In my innocence I looked upon it as a
measure that migbt benefit the masses of the
people, and certainly it was not directed
against the dairy farmers or any other class of
farmers. In 1922 and 1923, when I was a
member of the other bouse, I opposed as
strongly as I could the prohibition of the
manufacture, importation and sale of oleomargarine.
The constituency which I had
the honour to represent contained a good
many dairymen; yet in the next election
that constituency returned me by a larger
majority than ever before. The dairy farmers
Hon. Mr. EULER:

in my constituency did not seem to think
that the Oleomargarine Act did them any
harm.
Three facts have stood out clearly in this
debate. The first is that oleomargarine is a
wholesome, nutritious and palatable substitute for butter. That is no longer denied.
The second is that there is at present a great
scarcity of butter and that it will long continue.
A Canadian Press dispatch from
Ottawa, under date of May 2, says:
Stocks of creamery butter held in cold storage
and dairy factories in 99 principal cities
amounted to 1,682,161 pounds at the opening of
business May 1, 1946, compared to 6,065,771
pounds May 1. 1945, the Dominion Bureau of
Statistirs reported today.
The third fact that stands out is that the
price of oleomargarine, in spite of what was
said the other day by my honourable friend
from Wellington, is only about half the price
of butter. That is a matter of some importance to a good many people in this country.
Practically the only thing that has been
urged by way of argument against the bill is
the fear that in the future the sale of oleomargarine might interfere with the demand
for butter. My honourable friend from
Laurentides (Hon. Mr. Bouchard) has answered that much better than I could. When
speaking in this debate a little while ago the
honourable senator from Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis), for whose opinions I have a great
respect, argued that passage of the bill would
discourage dairy farmers by causing them to
fear that their interests would be prejudicially
affected. Well, I think the farmers of this
country are made of sterner stuff than that
implies. We hope that in future they will not
have to pass through such difficut times as
they have known in the past, for we hope there
will not be another war. The self-reliance of
the Canadian people was not built upon a
philosophy of fear.
The honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and others have referred to the great
importance of the dairy industry, but to my
mind that is beside the point. The supporters
of this bill do not wish any harm. to that
industry, but we say that even if the bill
would prejudicially affect the industry-and
I do not think it would-we surely have to
consider the interests of ten million consumers in this country.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I was not particularly
impressed by the letter which the honourable
genetleman read to the bouse from'the dairy
interests.

MAY 8, 1946
Hon. Mr. HAIG: From the National Dairy
Council of Canada and the Dairy Farmers of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Organized dairy interests, both of them.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Producers and processors.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I was flot interested by
the statement that the dairy interests would
be seriously injured if this bill were passed.
I do not believe that at ail. Just before the
Easter recess my honourable friend moved
the adjournment of the debate, saying that
he desired, when he went home to bis beloved
Winnipeg-and I do not blame him. for bis
affection for tbat city-to ascertain the views
of people on this bill. But wbose views did
he obtain? According to bis own, admission
he consulted no one but representatives of tbe
dairy organizations.
'Hon. Mr, HAIG: Correct.
Hon. Mr. EULER: In ail fairness one
would think that if he wanted to find out
what the people thought about oleomargarîne
be would at least bave consulted a few consumers. I submit to honourable senators that
that would have been the proper course to
pursue. I could read many very interesting
letters and newspaper editorials and other
communications from people who would like
to bave a choice of purcbasing eîther oleomargarine or butter. Some of the pleas for the
privilege of obtaining oleomnargarine wben
there is no butter are impressive. However, I
will not take up the time of the bouse to read
these communications.
My honoura-ble friend from Wellington-I
must apologize for referring to bim again, but
he is sa genial that be will probably take
wbat I say witb good graceAn Hon. SENATOR: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: In bis speech the other
day. besides expressing the fear that I was
tinkering witb the foundations of the constitution, be made tbree other errors. The first
was that tbe ceiling price on potatoes bad
been removed. The second was that 23% per
cent of the composition of oleomnargarine was
milk. Hie said lie got this information in a
certain old stone building somewbere down on
the far side of the 'canal. It does not matter
just wbere be got it, except that it was the
wrong place.
Hon. Mr. HOWAIRD: I got it from the
man who knows.
Hon. Mr. EUJLER: I arn afraid not. 1 bave
bere a statement frorn the Nutrition Division

of the Department of National Healtb and
Welfare, showing the composition of oleomargarine to be as follows:
Moisture ................
14-7 per cent.
Even if that were all milk. whicb it 'is not,
it would stîll be only slightly more than baîf
the proportion mentioned by my bonourable
friend.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Milk is not ai moisture.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That increases tbe force
of my point.
The statement of composition continues:
Sodium Chioride.......... 3-0 per cent.
Fat ....................
809 Per cent.
If I recali rig.htly, my honourable friend
said that the fat content was 20 to 26 per cent.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That is rigbt. Get a
list of all the contents in a prnind of oleomargarine.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I have the information
bere. Tbe milk and fat percentages mentioned by my honourable friend accounted for
less tban 50 per cent of oleomargarine, and
my bonourable friend was unable to say what
the other ingredients were, altbougb be was
asked for this information by the bonourable
gentleman from Cburchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: 1 did not bave tbe
detailed information.
Hon. Mr' EULER: I have it bere. The
components, besides those I have already
mentioned are:
Protein ...................

Carbohydrate..............0 -5 per cent

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: How many bundreds
per cent does tbat make?
Hon. Mr EULER: It makes 100 per cent.
The figure of 2,000 Vitamin A is not a percentage; tbat is 2,000 units.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Te that the British
or the American formula for oleomargarine?
Hon. Mr. EULER: I arn unable to say.
Tbe information was obtained, as I stated,
from the Nutrition Division of the Department of National Healtb and Welfare.
Opponents of tbe bill bave contended that
the ingredients to, make oleomargarine could
not be obtained in Canada. The fact is that
although there is a prohibition against importing oleomargarine, there is no prohibition
against importing the ingredients. Furtbermore,
a considerable number of the ingredients-including, I arn informed, the soya beanare produced in thîs country. I agree with
what was said a few moments ago by my

194

SENATE

honourable friend from The Laurentides (Hon.
Mr. Bouchard), that oleomargarine could be
manufactured in this country if parliament
and the government were agreeable. In any
event, if the bill passes and the ingredients
cannot be obtained, and there is no oleomargarine available for import, the butter
producers will not need to worry. If there
are no ingredients there will be no margarine,
and consequently any cause for worry on the
part of the dairymen will disappear; but the
principle for which the bill stands will be
maintained. I submit, honourable senators,
that the normal element in the enactment of
any law should not include the principle of
prohibition.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If an emergency arises,
as it might during a war, and some adjustment
is necessary, then legislation might be introduced to prohibit for a short time the manufacture and importation of an article such as
oleomargarine. In my view we have placed
the cart before the horse. The prohibition
should be removed, and if any adjustment
should be necessary later on, it could be made.
From my point of view, all the information
we have received with regard to the dairy
industry, while interesting and important, is
beside the mark, because when introducing the
bill I made as my chief point what I still
believe to be paramount in the consideration
of this matter, that no government should
interfere with the inherent right of any citizen
to purchase any legitimate article of commerce merely in order to protect or to form a
monopoly for the benefit of some one class of
the community, however admirable that class
may be in all its activities. That is my essential
argument, that we have no right to create
a monopoly for any one class-an argument
that was made more eloquently, and better
than I could possibly make it, by the honourable member from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen).
No reply whatsoever has been made to the
appeal by the honourable senator from Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Veniot) that the lives, not
the livelihood, of 70,000 diabetics are dependent upon butter or some suitable substitute.
No one has attempted to answer that.
An Hon. SENATOR: There was no need
to.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No reply, except in a
general way, bas been made to the plea for
restoring to Canadian citizens liberty of choice
in regard to the purchase of oleomargarine.
No réply bas been made to the eloquent
appeal of the members from South Bruce
Hon. Mr. EULER.

(Hon. Mr. Donnelly) and Alma (Hon. Mr.
Ballantyne), that a man who bas a large
family and small means should not be prohibited from buying a substitute for the butter
which his family may need so urgently. No
reply has been made at all as to why, when
butter is not obtainable at all, you should not
be permitted to buy a suitable substitute.
Hon. Mr. COPP: If you can get it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If you cannot get it you
will not be any worse off.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I would
say, give back to the Canadian people their
right of freedom of choice.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Not very long ago a
notable Englishman while in this country said,
"Freedom of choice is really what the war
was fought for." We have not freedom of
choice while this prohibitory legislation remains in force, and it is this principle which
makes me support the bill so strenuously. We
are not interfering with anyone in asking for
the legalizing in this country of the manufacture, importation and sale of oleomargarine.
Let the children of Canada drink milk, which
is so beneficial to them; let the dairy interests
make cheese instead of butter if they so desire; let our farmers sell their dairy cattle to
the United States-as they have done of recent years in fairly large numbers; let theni
send butter to the West Indies, Great Britain
or any other country if they wish to do so;
and let the government-as it is doing-prohibit the importation of butter or any product
of butter, whether it be milk, cream or even
ice cream from Australia, New Zealand, the
United States or any other country. Let all
these things be done, but if the doing of them
brings about a more or less artificial scarcity
of butter, then I ask, why in the name of
ordinary common sense should not the plain
people of this country be permitted to buy a
suitable substitute?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: This bill does not, I
hope, involve party politics.
An Hon. SENATOR: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators
opposite can readily see from the support
which is given the bill from this side of the
house that there is not much party feeling
here; and I hope the same condition prevails
on the other side.
An Hon. SENATOR: Sure.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I believe that if honourable senators consider the bill on its merits

MAY 8, 1946
it will pass. -The Senate is often criticized for

bemng an undemocratic body. It is more or
less an undemocratic body because we are
not elected-and I have a rather strong feeling with regard to that-but if we pass this
bill it may be a lesson to the people of this
dominion, who perhaps have had a wrong
conception of the Senate, that after ahl we
have n consideration for the rights of the
people and the consumers of this country
which mnay well be emulated by the members of the other chamber.
Now, honourable senators, I have only this
to say in conclusion. Yesterday we had from

the honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bench) an arnendment. Today it was
ruled out of order. I believe there may be
sorne senators who would like to support such
an amendment. and I would suggest that the
bill be given second reading and then, he referred to Committee of the Whole House, when

Hon. Mr. LESAGE: 1 was paired with the
honourable senator from Bedford (Hon. -Mr.
Nicol). If I had voted, I wohld have voted
for the bill.
CANADA DAY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. E. FOSTER moved second reading
of Bill 8, an Act respecting Canada Day.
He said:- Honourable senators, after listening to the lecture delivered by the honourable
senator for Leeds '(Hon. Mr. Hardy), we
should not delay this bill further. May I say
the delay at the outset was due to somne moisu.nderstanding as to the sponsor of the bill in
this house.
This is a public bill introduced in the other
house by a private member, and passed by a
substantial mai ority. It now cornes through
the regular channel to the Senate for approval.

In undertaking to move second reading I amn
somewhat in the position of a lawyer-though
1 arn not a mamber of the legal professionwho is called upon by the court to defend an
accused person whose case appears to havo
some menit. So, like the lawyer, I will do my
best to discharge my duty.
I would not, e,,en if I could, suggest to
honourable members how they should vote on
this particular question. I realize that honour-

able members of this house in votîng on a bill
of this kind are flot actuated by anything
other than their own independent views, and
that they vote accordingly. I do not believe

that anything I can say would alter the
opinion of the members of this hoidse with
respect to the measure. I therefore propose
to do no more than place the matter as f airly

as possible before this house.
The wording of the bill is very simple. It
provides that .the first day of July in each and
every year shahl ha known as Canada Day
instead of Dominion Day. I think it rather
unfortunate that when the naine Dominion
Day was selected Dominion of Canada Day

was not chosen instead. 0f course at that
time the namne Dominion Day was specific, but

conditions have changed, and we now have
other dominions such as Australia, New
Zealand and South Africa-and with the passing of time other dominions will no doubt be
brought into being. I believe the naine Canada
Day is'more distinctive; that is one reason
why I support the bill.
Honourable members, I arn neither a lawyer
nor a historian, but judging from the remarks
of the honourable member from. Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) I think both the
hegal and historical aspects of the bill will
be taken care of. If the honourable gentleman chooses to speak I arn sure hie will -do
so in his usual pleasing and informative way.

SENATE

But may I say that the name Dominion
Day for the first of July holiday is not as
traditional as some people think. Since my
name has appeared as sponsor for this bill I
have received a considerable number of communications concerning it. Some of those
letters strongly urge that the traditional usage
of the name Dominion Day should not be
abandoned. Upon looking into the matter I
find it was not until 1879, some twelve years
after confederation, that a resolution was
introduced in this bouse suggesting that the
first day of July be recognized as a day for
celebration and be called Dominion Day.
That resolution passed in this very chamber
was the basis of the legislation that now
appears in our Revised Statutes of Canada,
1927, as Chapter 49. That was twelve years
after confederation, seven years after I was
born--not so long ago as I remember it.
Therefore the traditional aspect of the name
is not as impressive as some might think.
When it was my privilege to attend public
school I recall tbat when the lst of July was
approaching we were told about Dominion
Day; but as far as I was concerned, the
most impressive feature was that we would
bo pleasure-bent on that day. We were not
instructed as to the real meaning back of
that holiday. The explanation may be that
I was reared in an environment where there
was a strong anti-confederation sentiment.
The results of confederation in our part of
Canada had been detrimental to our local
financial interests by reason of the fact that
the market for our natural products bad been
restricted and very much diminished, and our
transportation to other parts of Canada was
not good. Therefore, we were feeling the
pinch of the times. That was twelve years
after confederation, and the results as far as
we were concerned were very disappointing.
Our exchequers became depleted and, to use
a modern expression, the "take-home pay"
was greatly reduced. For those reasons the
teachings in the public schools concerning
Dominion Day were perhaps not as thorough
as they should have been.
Whether or not the younger generation has
been given more interesting and enlightening
instruction as to the purpose of "Dominion
Day" celebration, I cannot say.
I suggest
though, that there is need for the spreading
of propaganda through the public schools, the
Boy Scouts and Girl Guides organizations and
other institutions in this country, in order to
impress upon our young people and newcomers
the wonderful privileges and advantages they
possess as citizens of Canada. We do not have
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

to search far for proof that such propaganda is
needed and that there are fertile fields for
endeavour. By listening to echoes from the
walls of this chamber, where a DominionProvincial Conference was held last week, we
would learn that education is required if there
is to be more unity in this country and a
greater degree of tolerance towards the smaller
provinces.
During the last week or so, since it has been
stated in the press and elsewhere that I would
move the second reading of this bill, I have
received communications from people expressing the fear that the contemplated change in
the name of our national holiday would tend
to weaken the tics of loyalty that bind us to
the Mother Country and its institutions. In
my opinion it would take something more
than a change in the name of a day we celebrate to do that. I have never seen any
weakening of those tics, although there have
been occasions when the fear of such a possibility has been utilized before the bar of
public opinion. The past twenty-five years,
in which there have been two world wars, have
provided ample evidence that the fear is
groundless. I have no doubt that if it ever
again becomes necessary to send out a call for
the protection of British institutions, Canada
will respond to that cal], whether the flag that
goes up to the mast-head be the Red Ensign
or the Union Jack, and whether we call the
1st of July "Dominion Day", "Canada Day"
or by any other name.
I intend to vote for the bill, because so
far as I can soe the only change it would make
would be in the designation of the legal holiday on the 1st of July from "Dominion Day"
to "Canada Day". It may be that some traditions have become attached to the present
name, but under all the circumstances I consider the proposed new name to be more appropriate for the day we celebrate.
Another reason why I am supporting the
bill is that the name "Canada Day" would be
more easily understood by the younger generation and those who will follow. Furthermore, that name would be simpler. more impressive and of greater significance than the
present name to persons coming from other
countries te make their homes here.
May I quote from a tribute that was recently
paid to Canada by the. Right Honourable Malcolm MacDonald, who during the war was
British High Commissioner in this country?
He said:
By their efforts during the past six years they
have made an indelible impression on world
affairs by the sheer physical force of their war
effort and the spirit in wbich it was made.
Canada has won a reputation not simply as a
gallant, chivalrous comrade in war but as a
sage counsellor in peace.

MAY 8, 1946
The things that Canada has done, and of
which we are justly proud, are known
throughout this country and the world, not
as Dominion achievements, but as Canadian
achievements.
For the reasons stated I am moving the
second reading of this bill.
Hon. ATHANASE DAVID: Honourable
senators, I fully understand the importance of
this bill. For years I have been looking forward to the time when there would be a really
national holiday, but because of certain bills
that are now before the other house I am
wondering if it would not be better to postpone consideration of this measure. I am not
suggesting a six months' hoist; far from it.
There is now before the other house a
measure known as the Citizenship Bill. In
the Senate we shall have to devote a good
deal of time to that, especially because-and
I say this with all sincerity as a Canadian
-especially because of the way the measure
has been discussed in another place.
Another matter that will be discussed in
parliament this session is a national flag. I
humbly ask honourable senators if they do
not believe it would be better to establish
our citizenship and agree on a design for a
national flag before we 'decide what we are
going to call our national holiday.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Do honourable senators
not believe it is our duty to know what we
are? I have a good deal of sympathy for this
bill-although I do not say I am in favour
of the name "Canada Day", because for me
every day of the year is Canada Day.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: My respectful submission is that before we decide on what our
national holiday shall be called we should
establish our citizenship and agree upon a
design for a national flag. I wish to propose
that this bill be not read the second time
now, but after the Citizenship Bill and the
Flag Bill have come over from the other
house and received consideration here. I
realize that a motion to that effect would be
too indefinite, so I will move that the bill be
not read a second time now, but be read one
month frorn today.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Six months.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: No; one month from
today.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: I second the motion.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Honourable senators, in
order to avoid any difficulty, I think that
a definite date should bc specified in the
motion.

197

Hon. Mr. DAVID: I agree with that. June
Il would be satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am sorry I
was not in the house when the honourable
senator frorn Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) was
speaking. What is the reason for wishing to
have the second reading postponed?
Hon. Mr. DAVID: In another place the
Citizenship Bill is under discussion, and later
on there will probably be a flag bill, measures
which will have to be sent over to us for consideration. I suggest that we should not
choose a name for our national holiday before
knowing exactly what we are going to be.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: We are something
already, I hope.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, the other day, when there was no
sponsor for this bill, I intimated that I thought
it would be very unfortunateHon. Mr. LACASSE: I rise on a point of
order, to ask if the motion of the honourable
senator from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David) has
been seconded.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Yes. I seconded it.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I stated the other day
that it would be very unfortunate if this bill
were dropped on a technicality and not discussed on its merits. I think it would be
equally unfortunate if the bill were to be
postponed indefinitelyHon. Mr. DUFF: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -under the impression
that the people of Canada do not know what
they are. I have no hesitation in saying that
I know I am a Canadian-regardless of what
may happen in the House of Commons.
An Hon. SENATOR: But they do not know
in that bouse.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: It seems to me most
unfortunate, after the people of Canada have
been given an opportunity to express their
views in the press, and by letters and resolutions, that there should be any suggestion that
we are not now in a position to discuss this
question intelligently and practically. Surely,
honourable senators, what may happen in the
selection of a flag is not to determine what
our national holiday is to be-if that is the
way it is put. Surely what another place may
decide about the formalities of technical citizenship cannot affect our views on what constitutes essential Canadian citizenship, or our
conception of national status, or what our
holidays should be, or what steps should be
taken to recognize our historic background.

106

SENATE

For those reasons I sbould be very sorry
indeed to, see sucb a postponernent. I understood that rny honourable friend from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) was going to move
adjournment of this debate until next Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: No, until tornorrow. I
arn ready to, go on now.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There are other bis
to corne before us tomorrow. Personally I
should think that next Tuesday, when we
corne back frorn the week-end, would be a
very good tirne to discuss this bill. But to
postpone it on any of the grounds suggested
-well, for my part I would not want to
discuss the matter at ail.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I know I arn out of
order, but rnay I answer the honourabie
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris)?
In the other bouse tbey are discussing wbat
shahl constitute Canadian citizenship in the
future, and a joint comrnittee of both bouses
is engaged in cboosing a design for a Canadian
flag. Therefore I arn asking tbat we wait until
tbose two matters bave been deait wjth before
we decide on the narne of our national holiday.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators, I
arn eager to take part in the debate. Ia fact
I have bad a speecb ready now for several
weeks. However, in order to satisfy rny bonourable friends-I believe tbey share my views
unanimously-if there is any desire to postpone tbe debateHon. Mr. HAIG: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: -I arn willing to agree.
Otberwise I arn ready to go on now.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Go on.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Ia my opinion we should
proceed witb a discussion of the bill without
undue delay. I would tberefore move that
tbe debate be now adjourned until next Tuesday afternoon.
Tbe Hon. the SPEAKER: It bas been
rnoved by Senator David, seconded by Senator
Howard, that tbe debate be adjourned until
June Il.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I do not think, Mr.
Speaker, that tbis bouse wants a month's
adjournrnent of the debate. I have argued
frorn the very opening of this question that
we in this bouse sbould do nothing to stir
up feelings in this matter. I would suggest
tbat the bonourable senator frorn Sorel (Hon.
Mr. David) ask ]eave to witbdraw bis motion
in favour of tbe motion of the bonourable
senator front Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duif) that
the debate be adjourned until Tuesday of
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

next week. In the meantirne let birn consider
what bis other motion rneans. By adjourning
tbe debate as I have suggested, tbe leader of
tbe governrnent will be able to proceed
tomorrow witb the United Kingdomn lan bill._
I arn intensely anxious that we sbould dispose
of that measure with tbe least possible delay,
and in so saying I know that I express tbe
views of everiybody in this bouse and in the
country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If it is at all possible, we
sbould pass that bill tbis week, because Congress i5 110W discussing a measure whicb is
most important flot only for tbemselves and
for Britain but for the wbole world, and if
the prompt passage ofour boan bill will belp

Hon. Mr. DAVID: 1 sball be pleased to
adopt tbe suggestion of the bonourable leader
opposite, but I really doubt tbat my doing
so will bring any good to Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Try it.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: With the leave of the
Senate, I witbdraw my motion.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Has the bonourable senator leave to witbdraw bis motion?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The motion of Hon. Mr. David was
witbdrawn.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: It is rnoved by
Senator Duif, seconded by Senator Haig, that
Bill 8 be proceeded with next Tuesday. Is
it the desire of the Senate to concur in the
motion?
The motion was agreed to.
IMMIGRATION
MOTION

AGREED

TO

The Senate resumed from Tbursday, April
4, tbe debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Roebuck. that the Standing Committee on
Immigration and Labour be authorized and
directed to examine into the Immigration Act
(R.SC. Chaptor 93 and Amendments) its
operation and administration and tbe circumstances and conditions relating thereto
including (a) the desirability of admitting
immigrants to Canada, (b) the type of immigrant wbich should be preferred, including
origin. training and otber characteristies, (c)
the availabihity of stich immigrants for ad[mission. (d) the facilities, resources and
capacity of Canada to absorb, empioy and

MAY 8, 1946
maintain such immigrants, and (e) the appropriate terms and conditions of such
admission;
And that the said Committee report its
findings to this house;
And that the said Committee have power
to send for persons, papers and records.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable members, the resolution moved by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) several weeks ago is of great importance to the country as a whole. The
resolution is very wide in scope, and its allembracing character may well preclude consideration of all the matters which it covers.
I consider this resolution important for
two particular reasons. One of them I might
describe as a materialistic reason; that is, it
would be good business for Canada to again
adopt a vigorous immigration policy.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The arguments in
support of that policy may be mentioned very
briefly. There are few people in Canada
to-day who give thoughtful consideration to
the general well-being of the nation who are
not concerned over our financial commitments.
The war added at least $15,000,000,000 to the
national debt, and the servicing of that debt,
with the other requirements that have to bc
met, will call for an annual revenue of
$1,800,000,000. Indeed, we shall be fortunate
if we are able to confine it to that figure.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It will be more
like $2,000,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: In addition to that
we have net only federal obligations in the
general conduct of the country's business, but
we also have to take into account the needs of
provincial administrations. These run into
very substantial figures. I have observed with
some concern that in recent years the legislatures of most of the provinces have been
increasing their expenditures. I am not
criticizing them for doing so, but in the end
this means increasing taxation.
We are in a position somewhat similar to
that of a business man who, after operating
his business very successfully for many years,
finds that owing to causes over which he had
no control his profits have shrunk to such a
degree as to necessitate his taking drastie
steps to restore his business to its former
satisfactory condition. That, it seems te me, is
what faces this country today. At the moment
we do not know what sort of a world we shall
live in for the next fifteen, twenty, thirty or
forty years; but there is enough in the news
of the world today to indicate to everybody

199

who.follows international matters that very
grave and difficult problems must be solved
before the world can get back to any general
condition of stability.
Having regard to our financial needs, federal,
provincial and municipal, it is imperative that
we maintain our national income at the
highest possible point. National income is the
result of the labour and production of the
individual units in our society. My argument,
therefore, is that by steadily extending our
immigration policy so as to encourage the
bringing into Canada of carefully selected
people, we shall be increasing our national
production, and to that degree assisting in the
effort to meet our commitments.
The second reason, and te my mind the
more important one in favour of immigration,
is what I might describe as a moral reason.
The honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who introduced this
resolution in a very excellent speech, made
reference to the fact that on almost half a
continent we have about 12,000,000 people, or
approximately three persons per square mile
as against 700 or 800 per square mile in some
European countries. It is true that all of
Canada's vast area may not be suitable for
population, but we still have vast unused
resources of all kinds-agricultural, mineral,
timber, fisheries and many others. We have
a great heritage in this dominion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I can understand a
civilized and cultured European who works
amidst a population of 700 or 800 persons to
the square mile, looking across to Canada
and thinking what a great boon it would be
if he and some of his neighbours could make
a new home in this young country with all its
opportunities. I entirely agree with the
mover of the resolution, that we cannot sit
permanently on a land as vast and rich as
Canada without inviting net only the envy
of people less fortunate than we are, but ultimately their effort by force to come here and
share these good things with us.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Speaking of the moral
aspect, I do not think we are justified in
sitting on top of all these resources and taking
the attitude that we will keep them to ourselves and share them with no one. Such a
policy will in the end bring disaster.
A few objections have been raised to immigration. Until some time after the first.great
war the general belief in Canada was that
immigration was desirable and necessary.
Then in the early thirties, when the depression struck the world, there was a change in

200

SENATE

public sentiment, and the attitude of labour
in Canada was that we should not bring in any
more people to compete with our own workers. I can recall farmers' organizations passing resolutions stating that it was not desirable to bring new agriculturists to Canada to
compete with our farmers in the production
of wheat and other agricultural products for
which we might not be able to find markets. I
am convinced that the argument then
advanced was fallacious, because there never
was a time in our history when this country
was more prosperous, business more active,
and the people had more work to do, than
when we were conducting an active immigration policy.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: And producing more.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is truc not only
of Canada but of the United States. The
great immigration movement to the United
States started one hundred years ago, following widespread political troubles in most of
the European countries. Many fine people
in those countries turned their eyes across the
Atlantic to the new country known as the
United States, and the total number who
migrated to that country between 1850 and
1910 was almost twenty-five and a half
million.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Does that figure
include the Canadians who moved to the
United States?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Yes, it includes the
Canadians who went to the United States.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: And they are happy over
there.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The total number of
Canadians who went to the United States in
that period was 1,172,668.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: And 9,000 veterans
from the last war.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That was an average
of over 400,000 emigrants per year to the
United States. It is within the judgment of
honourable senators that in that period the
United States found its greatest expansion,
and laid the foundations for its powerful and
influential position in the world today.
Canada is a young country. The confederation of a few scattered Canadian colonies took
place only 80 years ago. When we remember
that in 1867 there were only a few Crown
colonies. and Upper and Lower Canada
under one legislature, we have reason to be
proud of the progress made in a comparatively few years. When we recall that it
took many weeks for the Toronto delegates
to travel to the Charlottetown Conference,
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

and that the Nova Scotian delegates required
almost as long or longer to go to Quebec,
it is almost inconceivable that in the short
space of eighty years this country should
have made the progress towards naationhood
that it has made.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Could the honourable
senator give the reason why Canada with all
its wealth of resources did not develop as
fast as the United States?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I was about to come
to that question. Briefly the reason is that
the eyes of the world, so far as North America
was concerned, were focused on the United
That was the great country of
States.
freedom.
Hon. Mr. DAVID:
Canada.

No

more

free than

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: "The land of the free
and the home of the brave"; and there was
the Statue of Liberty holding up the beacon
to the immigrants who flooded into the port
of New York. We were a northern people
and later in starting, and we and the rest of
the world were profoundly ignorant of the
extent of our resources and area of our country.
Seventy yea.rs ago the popular conception of
the great prairie country of western Canada
was that it was fit only for Indians and
buffalo.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is quite so.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The speeches in the
Parliament of Canada on the construction of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway, for instance,
are most interesting. They afford a curious
commentary today. The great body of eastern
opinion at that time was that the West, except
for a fringe of land on the Pacifie coast, was
of no value. However, notwithstanding these
mistaken assumptions, we have made progress
of which every Canadian may be proud.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The efforts of 12,000,000 people scattered across 4,000 miles of
territory, during the five years of war, for
instance, have been unsurpassed anywhere in
the world. So we have reason for confidence
in the future of our country, and if we follow
wise and sound policies we are on the eve of
great things.
There has been an opinion current in Canada that the whole movement of people
across the international boundary line was
from this country to the United States, but
our immigration figures disprove that. It is
true that in the sixty years from 1850 to 1910
some 1,172,000 Canadians emigrated to the

MAY 8, 1946
United States, but in the period from 1881 to
1899 there was a substantial immigration from
that country into Canada. I have not got
the total figures before me, but I see that
in 1884, for instance, those immigrants into
Canada from the United States numbered
more than 65,000. For some years the figure
is smaller than that, and for others it is
greater.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Would my honourable
friend permit a question? Is there any way
of ascertaining whether some of those immigrants from the United States were former
Canadians?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No. All we know is
that they were American citizens. Some of
them may have been former Canadians who
had emigrated in earlier years.
-Hon. Mr. DAVID: Was that around 1858?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No. I am speaking of
the period from 1881 ta 1899. The point I
am making is that there was not a very
large movement of immigrants ta Canada
during that period. The really big immigration into this country began later, following
the active immigration policy adopted by the
Laurier Government at the end of the last
century, and continued until the first or
second year of the first world war. The
number of immigrants who entered Canada
in 1913 was 382,000, but I should say that the
annual average during the period I have
referred ta was substantially below that. If
any honourable senators desire ta know the
actual figures year by year, and the countries
of origin of the people who came here, they
can find the information on page 200 of the
report of the Department of Mines and Resources tabled in this house some weeks ago.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I am sorry ta interrupt
the honourable senator, but will he allow me
ta inquire if he knows why the migration
ta the United States was so much greater
than that ta Canada? I think I can state
the reason. Was it not that the United
States were independent, whereas we were
just a colony?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No, I do not agree
with the honourable senator on that point.
I should say that the reason why Canadians
go ta the United StatesHon. Mr. DAVID: If the honourable senator will pardon me, I asked why people went
ta the United States, not why they are going
now.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The reason why Canadians went ta the United States over the
years I mentioned was much the same as the

201

reason why every year a great number of
Scotchmen migrate ta England, namely. to
find wider opportunity.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: That is it.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: May I add this? It
does no harm ta blow our own horn a little
bit once in a while. I think that the average
Canadian is at least the equal of the average
American. It is certain that no capable,
intelligent and energetic Canadian who emigrates ta the United States finds any difficulty
in successfully establishing himself there.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is right.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: The honourable gentleman did not answer my question. Why was
the migration ta the United States so large
and that ta Canada so small? Was it because
of the independence of the United States?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I would say "Yes."
Hon. Mr. CRERÂR: Fifty years ago Europeans even the people of Great Britain, had
only a very sketchy knowledge about Canada,
but they knew a great deal about the United
States. I venture ta say that if Canada will
adopt a sane and vigorous immigration policy
now there will be no difficulty in getting scores
of thousands of the best people in Europe ta
come ta this country.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: If we are a nation.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The effect of the
immigration from 1899 ta the outbreak of
the first Great War is seen in the fact that
during that period Canada made greater
progress in the accumulation of wealth and
the development of industry than at any
previous time in ber history. Why? Because
the immigrants, though in general having
little capital, worked steadily and were continuously producing new wealth. There were
railways constructed, towns built, coal mines
opened, timber areas exploited, and the
prairie sod was broken. All these things were
.a direct consequence of the large immigration that we had from 1899 until about 1916.
Many of the people who came ta Canada
during that period were from Central
Europe. I should like ta say a word or two
on that point. Some of the best immigrants
who came ta western Canada were known as
Ukrainians. We also got Poles and other
good people. Nearly seventy years ago a
colony of Icelanders came ta the West and,
as I am sure my honourable friend who leads
the other side (Hon. Mr. Haig) will agree,
made an excellent contribution in every
respect ta the life of Manitoba and
Saskatchewan.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Today they or their
descendants are in the professions, in business,
and in the educational field. The Ukrainians
have greatly contributed to the development
of that part of the prairie provinces. I recall
that when those people first came to Canada,
some forty or more years ago, they had very

where they settled. They got their homesteads, 160 acres of land-not very good landHon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
they built
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -and
mud cabins, in which they had mud ovens for
cooking their food. They worked diligently
at whatever they could find to do, and saved
their earnings. In that district today you
find good farms, good roads, good houses,
good barns, and all the other attributes of a

who came to this country wore sheep-skin
coats, were completely ignorant of our
language, and had no money in their pockets;
but their children, or grandchildren are not
only in business and in the professions, but
are serving as members of municipal councils
and of legislatures. and in every way are
taking a full part in the life of the community.
Besides doing that these groups have made a
very definite contribution to the cultural life
of not only the communities in which they
live but of the dominion as a whole.
Sometimes I think we pay too little attention to the cultural and other finer things of
life. In this connection I should like to tell
the house of an experience that I had in July
of 1935. Being a candidate for the constituency of Churchill in the election then pending,
I was invited to attend a Ukrainian picnie at
Ethelbert, a little town a few miles south of
the southern boundary of the constituency.
The Ukrainian people are fond of music and
social life, and the pienie was in celebration of
some particular national day in the Ukrainesomething similar, I would judge, to our St.
Andrew's Day or St. George's Day. In the
crowd numbering more than 1,000 there were
less than a dozen persons of Anglo-Saxon
origin, and I was one of them. The local
people had built a stand to accommodate those
invited to address the gathering, and it was
covered with green boughs to protect from the
sun those who were to make the speeches. A
brass band composed of members of the community provided excellent music throughout
the day. Well, speeches were delivered, and
I listened to them and took a little part
myself. Then I wandered over to a baseball
diamond where several teams were competing
in a tournament. While I sat there for fifteen
lon. Mr. CRERAR.

or twenty minutes watching the game I was
interested to notice that not a single word
of Ukrainian was spoken in conducting the
game. The players were young fellows, and
the crowd frequently wanted to kill the
umpire and do the other things usual with a
baseball crowd, but the talk throughout the
game might have come from any AngloSaxon community. I took particular note of
this because I was keenly interested in everything around me.*t may astonish honourable
members to know that this wholly Ukrainian
crowd spoke English quite as much as they
did their native language. I recall that in
the evening after dinner at an excellent little
Ukrainian hotel, while I was sitting on the
verandah my attention was attracted to seven
or eight youngsters playing on the street with
a bat and ball. They were carrying on their
garme in English. That evening I attended a
play in a fine community hall, and although it
was given in the Ukrainian tongue,.I confess
that for two and a half hours I followed the
drama without my interest flagging for a
moment. The acting and singing were excellent, and altogether I enjoyed the evening.
I have recited that experience to lead up to
this particular point. People of that type have
a very useful and definite contribution to
make'to the well-being of this country. Consequently when we consider the resumption of
immigration we must clear our minds of any
prejudices, we must not feel that the people
we are bringing here will be inferior in education, culture or any other respect to those
already here. We can secure from European
countries the very best type of immigrants by
adopting a selective policy. I recall on one
occasion a Ukrainian saying to me, "Mr.
Crerar, your immigration laws were altogether
too lax when we were coming to this country.
Some Ukrainians had criminal records in their
homeland and should never have been permitted to enter Canada." There is no great
dificulty in guarding against that particular
trouble. By wise selection we can get good
industrious people-people with the pioneering
spirit. I would remind honourable senators
that we are not yet through the pioneering
stage in Canada. We have yet extensive areas
to open up. To go back no further than a
few hundred years ago, when the early
settlers came to Quebec they did not have
everything right at hand; they had to depend
on their own energy and resourcefulness to
establish themseIves in the wilderness. I know
that when, a hundred years or more ago,
the early settlers came to Ontario they went
into the dense forest, cleared the land, and
created this very rich province. But if a
hundred or a hundred and twenty-five years

MAY 8, 1946
ago those already here had said, "No, we
must flot bring in any more people to this
country. We are flot able to make a good
living ourselves, so why bring others to compete with us?" this country would flot have
been developed as we see it today. The
plain fact of the matter is that by increasing
your population and diversifying your activities you stimulate and fructify business and
commerce in a score of ways. By so doing
you increase national production and, in turn,
national income, and you case the national
financial load. At the same time ýour
fine generous action would give fresh hope
and courage to dcspairing millions in Europe
who today are homeless and do not know
where to go.
I could give several illustrations along this
line, but I will cite only one. In 1938. after
what is callcd the Munich agreement, a delegation of Sudeten Germans came to Canada to
sec if they could get in this country a haven
for some of their compatriots who had
rcmaincd loyal to Czechoslovakia and who of
course had to get out of the country when the
The
settiement with Hitler was made.
British and French Governments gave them
some capital, not a great deal. Two communitics settled in Canada, one at Tupper Creekup in the northcast part of British Columbia,
some five or six hundred miles northwest of
Edmonton-and the other at Walberg ini
Saskatchewan. I have followed with a great
deal of intercst the developmetit in those
two communities. Thcy have both made magnificent progress. Not only thet, but as they
have become acquaixted with Canadian ways
an;d traditions they have shed some of the
ideological notions they brought with them.
The Tupper Creek settiement, with which I
arn more familiar, although in existence for
only seven years, bas already a well-establishcd library and community centre. While
thosc scttlers work their fields and tend
their stock, thcy do not ncglcct the cultural side of life, and are.fond of music and
reading. I was able to assist them in getting
the provincial government at Victoria interested in hclping them to establish a library.
I think honourable senators will agree with
me that people of that type, who are willing
to work with their two hands and establish
thcmselves, and at the same time take an
interest in the history of their adopted eountry and are cager to informa themsclves about
its political institutions, will in the end make
excellent citizens.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think there can b e
no q1estion of- that whatever.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

I had hoped to conclude my remarks before
six o'clock. I trust that the press reporter
who criticized the Senate for its laxity yesterday will observe that we are sittîng until
six o'clock this afternoon.
Some Hon. SEN ATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Where shail we get
these immigrants? I have a suggestion to
make with which perhaps some honourable
senators will not agree. A few months ago
there were in Italy about 110,000 Poles who
had been in the forces of their country serving
with the Allies. Now they are being disbanded. There are from 65,000 to 70,000 more
Polish soldiers in thé British Isles. The great
mai ority of these soldiers do not want to go
back to Poland, because most of thcm are
persona non grata with the present Polish
authorities.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Thcy do not want to be
liquidated.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is what they
fear. Here, I would say, is an opportunity
for Canada to get some good immigrants.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Those men are physically fit and, having braved all the dangers
of gctting out of Poland in order to join the
Allies in the figlit for freedom, must, I submit, have some sound moral qualities. Those
Poles have very little capital today, but I
venture to say if you brought 50,000 of them
to this country you would within a very short
time find them working as harvest hands and
at any other jobs they could get; they would
not be particular about the type of work they
did. There is a tremendous amount of work
to be donc in this country, and we need men
today for manual labour. I do hope the
governient will give earnest consideration ta
the problem.
There-is another suggestion I am about te
make, though it may shock some of my
honourable friends.
Hon. Mr. DUFF : I do not thiok so.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: There are in Gcrmany
today several millions of displaced Germans.
I would not objeet to giving some of them a
refuge here. We know what the Sudctcn
Germans have 'done at Tupper Creek. There
was a German community established in Winnipeg in 1928, with which my honourable
friend the leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) is
familiar. These people have built gond homes
for themselves and have made a real contribution towards developing the productive
wealth of this country. The German has certain good qualities. He is easily led-perhaps
misled-but he is industrious, law-abiding,

204

SENATE

frugal and intelligent. Part of the problem
of getting the world back to something like
a normal condition lies in settling the homeless people who today are wandering aimlessly,
about Europe. The boundaries of Germany
have been drastically circumscribed. My suggestion may not find much favour in this
house, but on the broad grounds of humanitarianism I think it might well receve consideration of parliament and the country.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Before my
honourable friend sits down, may I remind
him that he did not mention other European
countries with fine racial stock, countries like
Denmark, Norway and Sweden.
Hon. Mr. 'CRERAR: I did not mention
them because I was looking at the clock.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Never mind
the clock.
An Hon. SENATOR: You can adjourn the
debate.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I do not want to do
that. The people of Holland, of Denmark
and of NorwayAn Hon. SENATOR: Are the best people
in the world.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -all make excellent
settlers. The Polish people who settled in the
prairie provinces have invariably made good
as farmers, and have taken their place in the
general life of the country. So the problem
is not one of finding immigrants. As a matter
of fact, if this country adopted what I would
consider a sound policy in regard to the
resumption of immigration, we could have
literally millions of the best people in Europe
come to this country, if we would accept them.
If we adopt a generous policy, I submit,
we shall be making a contribution that will
be increasingly recognized in the years to
come, for it will augment the productive
power and strength of this country and its
capacity to carry its financial burden. In
addition to that, we shall be doing a fine
generous Christian act in endeavouring to
make some contribution towards relieving the
terrible plight of the homeless millions in
Europe.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Can the honourable
gentleman give the house any information as
to the shipping situation? At the present
moment it is said we have not the requisite
shipping to bring people here.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That is true. If the
policy I have suggested were adopted now a
good deal of organization would be required,
and it would be a year or so before we
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

could get any large movement of these
people to Canada. The Polish soldiers I
spoke of could probably find their way here
without a great deal of difficulty. The troops,
both American and Canadian, are now nearly
all home from Europe, and the shipping and
other transportation problems are lessening
every week. At least that is the information
I have.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!

He said: The committee have examined and
amended this bill. There are three or four
small drafting.amendments, and two amendments of some substance. One of these is to
substitute the corporation itself for its directors
in exercising the borrowing powers conferred
upon the corporation; the other is to delete
the power of the corporation to invest in such

ROBERTSON:

Honourable senators, before the orders of the
day are called, may I inform the house that
when we adjourn this week it is my intention
to suggest that we reassemble on Monday
next, May 13, at 8 o'clock in the evening.
Just when we shall adjourn depends, of
course, on the progress of the legislation now
before us. If I correctly judge the temper

MAY 9, 194

205

of the bouse, it is that we should press on
and lose no opportunity ta dispose of aur
business as rapidly as possible.

I am against long adj ournments, and I agree
witb tbe suggestion tbat we resume Monday
night.

Hon. J. J. BENOR: Honourable senators,
may I ask if it would not suit the convenience
of ail i ust as well if we resumed on Tuesday
afternoon? The suggestion is that we sbould
not meet before Monday evening, in any
event. In order ta be here at that time those
of us whose homes are distant an over-nigbt
train ride must travel eitber Sunday evening
or ail day Monday. It seemas ta me that te
bouse would lose very littie .useful time b
adjourning until Tuesday afternoon.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: The bonourable senator
from Bedford-Halifax (Hon. Mr. Quinn)- would
not be inconvenienced by aur resuming on
Tuesday afternoon instead of Monday nigbt.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If we resume on Monday nigbt, tbose of us wbo must stay in
Ottawa over the week-end will bave the
satisfaction of seeing other bonourable mem,bers obliged ta do tbe same tbing.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: This is a question
that cornes up frequently. I sbould like ta go
as far as possible in meeting the convenience
of bonourable members wbo go borne overth
week-end. It bappent- just now, tbough, that
there is some important legisiation ta which 1
sbould like the Senate ta give first reading.
I bad boped ta bave it bere today, but it is
not available; if we met tomorrow, it might
be possible ta introduce it then. It occurred
ta me tbat by meeting next Monday nigbt we
migbt advance tbis legislation.
It is difficult ta meet the convenience of al]
in tbe matter of adjournmients. It is hoped
that next week we may be able ta adjourn
on Tbursday; therefore I suggested that we
begin the week's work on:Monday nigbt. Unless our meeting on Monday nigbt would
inconvenience a large number of honourable
members, I wou.ld urge tbat my suggestion be
adapted; but af coure I amn in tbe hands of
the mai ority.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
I sbould like ta support wbat bas been said
by the honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bencb). As bie pointed oû't, if we met
on Tuesday afternoon we would be just as far
abead as if we met Monday evening.
Hon. Mr. QUJINN: We would bave bast a
day.
Hlon. Mr. EULER: Not a wbole day. If
we resumed on Tuesday afternoon we could sit
tbat evening as well, and ini that way would
be as far abead as if we bad sat on Monday
evening and Tuesday afternoon only.
Hon. FELIX QUINN: Honourable senators,
I suggest that some consideration sbould be
sbown ta those of us wbo live at a great
distance from Ottawa-in the Maritimes, in
tbe prairie provinces and in British Colu~mbia.
I tbink the members wbo live in close-proximity ta tbe capital bave been treated very
well. A sbort train tnip-a night's run, at the
most-takes tbem borne or brings tbem back.

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART rMcL. ROBERTSON
moved tbe second reading of Bill 28, an Act
respecting tbe Financial Agreement batween
Canada and the United Kingdom sigied on
the sixth day of March, 1946.
He said: Honourable senators, this bull asks
approval of a financial agreement between the
Government of Canada and the United Kingdam, signed on March 6 and made. public
immediately after its signature. This agreement is the most important of a number of
financial agreements and arrangements made
by thîs country in connection with international trade and reconstruction. Tbe need for
a credit of tbis magnitude stems from the
effeets of tbe war upon Britain, and tbe vital
importance ta Canada of tbe re-establishment, expansion and continued development
of foreign trade.

SENATE

Canada hias enjoyed a high standard of
living in the past, and the higher standard of
living which she hnpes for in fuiture yea: s
depends more on export trade than does thait
of perhaps any other country in the world.
Our financial strength and economie prosperity
require higher levels of national income, and
if we are to be successful in public finance we
cannot afford to be he8itant and half-hearted
in promoting foreign trade, which is the basis
of our prosperity. It bas beon dýesirable in the
past. and 1 believe it will also be desirable in
the fuiture, to use the payments which we
reccive from our exports in discharging our
debts and purchasing the imports wbich we
require. One of the characteristies of oui'
international trade in the past bias been that
the volume of our experts to the United
Kingdom, and indeed to Etiroýpe, bias greatly
excceded that uf our imîports. We have used
this surplus purchasing power to enable us to
discharge obligations which we incurred in the
purchasing of gonds in other countries, such
as the United States, so that we hav'e a special

interest; in being able to continue the use of
the currency we receive froin export trade to
obtain other currency which we need in order
to pay for gonds that we must import.
As lionourable senators know, we have
undertaken many measures to restore and increase Canada's trade. Under Part Twýo of the
Expert Credits Insurance Aet as amended at
the last session of Parliament, our total
authority for making direct boans to, certain
goveroments is 750 million dollars. Against
this authority we have entered into agreements
to lend $502,500.000, and have undertaken
to lend additional amounts of $142,000,000 to
those with who-m we already bave made
agreements. This makes our total commitment $644,500,000 at the preserit time. 0f this
amount $67,412,051 had actualiy been advanced
up to March 31.
The amount and terms of individual boans
can be more conveniently gîven in a short

I will place on Hansard at this point. It is as

Since temporary advances have been made
oil behaîf of Allied governiments under section
No. 3 of the War Expenditures and Demobilization Appropriation acts, they will, in dire
course, be represented in and form part of the
amounit of credit whieh bas been extended
under the authority of the Expert Credits
Insurance Act. The most notable figure in
this classification is the credit of 80 million
dollars on behaîf of France, with varying
other amnounts to other counitries, and honourable gentlemen may have noticed that the
lion. Mr. ]ROBERTSON.

amount used up to March 31 last was nil.
It is contemplated that the eredits proposed
for Britain should be dealt with as a special
case, since they are buge in comparison with
those of other countries, and special factors
necessitate and justify terms different from
those we have offered as a ma tter of policy
in other cases. The goverilment is therefore
not proposiilg to deal with the credit of the
United Kingdom under the Export Credits
Insurance Act, but rather is askin-g the specific
approval of parliament for this financial agreement which lias been concluded withi the
British government.

MAY 9, 1946
During tbe next five years the United Kingdom will be passing tbrough a period of
transition and reconstruction in both its
domestic and international economic affaire.
The United Kingdom. of pre-war years was
a very wealthy country in international terme,
having bunge overseas inveetments; and as
one of tbe world's greatest trading nations
she had followed a liberal policy in relation
ta tbe question of importe. Ini many respecte
the national ecanomies of tbe United Kingdom
and Canada were complementary. The United
Kingdom, year ini and year out, provided a
market for Canadian exporte ta an amount
far in excess of the quantity o~f goods or services furniebed ta Canada in return. As a
result, we bave had, year in and year out, a
-very large surplus of British currency, whicb
in pre-war days was easily convertible into
other currencies-particularly of the United
States--and tbis surplus was used ta discharge
aur liabilities in tbe various countries where.
we had obligations.
I do nat need ta remind bonourable senators that as a result of the direct and indirect
effects of the war, the purcbasing poiWer of the
United Kingdam bas been very eeriously
reduced, and will be regained only over a
period of years by means of very careful and
intensive efforts. Her ability ta import bas
been seriously- reduced, first, because of the
lessening of bier capacîty ta produce goode
for expart. Britain suffered great losees at
home-lasses of praperty, man-pawer and
wealth. Her ahility ta maintain bier export
trade was seriously curtailed during tbe war
wben all bier man-power was mohilized for
war service, war production and only the most
essential civilian services.
We are familiar with the spectacular
damage caueed by bomba and rackets, but we
muet aiea remember the lose resulting frorn
Brîtain'e inability ta repair and, maintain hier
equipment, bier bouses and all that goes ta
make modem civilization. -But bier ability
ta import bas been eeriously reduced in
other directions as well. She, bas bad to
sacrifice many of bier overseas investments,
and will no langer be able ta count on as
much income as befare ta belp pay for
importe. Despite assistance-after Dunkirk
-by the United States and Canada through
Lend-Lease and Mutual Aid, Britain's huge
effort ta carry on tbe war has forced bier ta
liquidate overseas investmnents ta a value
approximating five billion Canadian dollars;
and about 20 per cent of those liquidated
investments were Canadian securities. Moreover sbipping lasses incurred during tbe war
bave reduced, at leaet temporarily, the incarne
that Britain previauely derived frornt bier
merchant marine, and the general dislocation
- 63268-15

207

of trade and finance bas interfered with her
overseas insurante and financing serviceF, the
earnings from which formerly helped bier to pay
for imports.
In co-operation with tbe authorities in
Britain the Canadian government has made
a most careful inveetigation of tbe financial.
situation of that country, and we believe
that broadly speaking two alternative types
of policy are open at tbe presenit time. The
first, and much more desirable type of policy
from our point of view, je reflected ini tbe
British war- agreements and the proposais
for the expansion of world trade and employment put forward by tbe United Statee government. Tbis type of trade and exchange
policy involves flot only a minimum of
restriction on trade, but tariff reductione, the
elimination of -discriminatory import quotas
and exchange practices, and the freedom of
every country ta accept any currency that it
bas obtained through trade witb another
country in carrying on trade with any third
country. This type of policy wauld make
possible not oniy a bigb level of trade, but
freedom of tbe direction of trade. The alternative type of proposai is one of bilateral
arrangements under wbich Britain would purchase goode on condition that tbe selling
country would take British goods in exehange
-a policy involving discrimination ini both
importing and exporting, and substantial
restrictions an the use of currencies received
by exporting countries.
The choice that Britain makes as between
these two alternative policies is vitally important ta, Canada, as well as to the United
States and other countries which are largely
dependent an exporte. We are convinced,
however, that if Britain is ta adopt the liberal
policy with respect to international trade
which wiIl be sa manifestly advantageous to
Canada, she will have during the next five
years very substantial deficits as between bier
necessary imports an-d possible exporte. Thus,
for the period as a whýole, if Britain is to
follow the policy with respect to trade which
we hope she will follow, it seems likely that
she wili need to borrow from abroad a total
amount whioh will exceed the equivalent of
five and a baif billion Canadian dollars. -It
is proposed that the United States boan will
provide the equivalent of four billion 120
million Canadian dollars for future purposes;
and this boan which we are proposing to make
would bring the total up to five billion, 375
million dollars. The remaixning amount tbe
United Kingdom. will need to flnd elsewhere,
together with such amounts as are required

to discharge any existing indebtednes which
is not included in the estimate of ber deficit
on current account.
While credit extends to the 31st day of
December, 1951, it is generally assumed that
Britain will need to use this one billion, 250
million dollars of credit within the next three
years, and that after that date she will in all
as respects
probability finance ber defic
Canadian trade from other sources, such as
by selling us gold or other foreign exchange
which we may require. The government is
convinced tbat the terms as to interest and
repayment are such that over the next fiftyfive years the British government will be able
to meet its obligations under this agreement
together witb those assumed with respeçt to
the proposed loan by the United States.
I should like to point out tbEt this financial
agreement and the agreement on the settlement of war claims are separate and distinct.
The latter is essentially a measure to settle
the outstanding claims between the two governments. The amounts of some of the claimo
which are settled thereby are open to argument, and it would have been possible to
spend years debating their respective values.
Both sides have come to the conclusion that
the payment by the United Kingdom to
Canada of 150 million dollars would be a fair
and reasonable settlement of the net excess
of Canada's claims over the claims of the
United Kingdom on Canada.
The transactions to implement this agreement are being
carried out under the War Expenditure and
Demobilization Appropriation acts of the fiscal
year 1945-46. Britain bas already paid us in
gold the 150 million dollars which she undertook to pay in this settlement.
What this bill contemplates is the financial
agreement relating to the credit of a billion
and a quarter dollars, further provisions as
respects the War Appropriation Act of 1942,
and an agreement with regard to the financial
obligations arising out of the British Commonwealth Air Training plan.
The terms of the loan relating to interest
and repayment are, of course, the same as
those in the agreement between Britain and
the United States. During the years 1946 to
1950 no interest is payable on the amount
of the loan whicb will have been used. The
reason is that this is the period during which
Britain, as a result of the immediate aftereffects of the war, will be experiencing difficulty with ber balance of payments. Interest
commences at the beginning of the year 1951,
and principal repayments are to be made at
the end of each year, from 1951 to 2000 A.D.
The interest rate will be 2 per cent. We
naturally would have preferred a higher rate
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

of interest, but after careful consideriÛ n of
the probable British balance of payments we
reached the conclusion that 2 per cent was
all that Britain would be in a position to pay.
Indeed, she will not ba able to afford even
this rate of interest unless her exports expand
and are maintained at a higher level. It is for
this reason that waiver of interest payments
is provided for under certain circumstances
in our agreement, as in the agreement with
the United States. This is provided for in
article 4. In effect, we say to the United Kingdom: If your exports are sufficient to enable
you to pay for a pre-war volume of imports
without running further into debt, then we will
demand interest from you; if, however, they
are not up to this level, and if therefore you
must go into debt or liquidate your capital in
order to import on the pre-war scale, or else
you must restrict your imports to avoid the
strain upon your resources, then we will be
prepared to waive the interest payments.
Article 5 is a provision that each government will grant to the residents and products
of the other, treatment not less favourable
than that provided for in any instrument of
agreement with the government of any other
country signed prior to the-date of this agreement.
Article 6 of the agreement provides in effect
that the arrangements already existing in
respect of the loan which we made to the
United Kingdom in 1942 will continue as they
are at present until the beginning of 1951,
and that before that date we shall discuss
the question of payment of interest on, and
the terms of repayment of, any balance of
the loan then outstanding.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Does the honourable
leader know how much it is at the present
time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was coming to
that. It is reduced by the securities that are
being applied to it, to, I think, about 500
million dollars.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is wbat I understood.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The loan which
was made in 1942 was, of course, a war loan
made to finance United Kingdom war expenditures in Canada in 1941. The act which
authorized it provided that no interest should
be payable under this obligation prior to the
termination of the war. In view of - the
enormous burden of international debt which
war bas thrust on Britain, the government
bas come to the conclusion that she bas not
the capacity to pay interest on this loan during the period from now to 1950, any more
than on the main loan, and that she should
not be asked to do se. At the time we made

MAY 9, 1946
this loan in 1942, the United Kin dom goverment undertook to ensiire that when Canadian securities payable in Canadian currency
and held hy residents of the United Kingdom
were soId to persons flot resident in the United
Kingdom the proceeds would be paid to the
government of Canada as part of the repayment of this loan. This arrangement bas now
been extended and will continue until the end
of 1950. We should distinguieli, honourable
senators, between these sales and the conversien which the British government required to
be made of any Canadian securities held by
residents in Britain. The sales mentioned
here are those made outside Britain by residents of Britain, and the Canadian currency
received in payment therefor is applied to this
loan.
Hon. Mr. HUIGESSEN: Voluntary sales.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Are- the repatriation
figures available?
Hon. Mr. ýROBERTSON: They may be,
but I have only the ap.proximate figures. I
may be able to obtain the exact amounts for
my honourable friend.
Under this arrangement the Joan is being
paid off or reduced by the sale or redemption
of Canadian securities held in Britain. As a
result of what has been paid and what was
pending for the latter part of 194, this boan
will have been reduced to approximately 500
million dollars, and the process will continue
in the future.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: How much was
the original loan?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
It was 700
million dollars.
Article 7 provides for the cancellation of the
amount owing by the United Kingdom.government to Canada under the British Commonwealth Air Training plans -of 1939 and 1942.
'Under hoth the first and second plans the
United Kingdom's share was intended to be
finaneed *mainly by contributions in kind:
that is, contributions ini aircraft, spares, supplies and equipment. As a result of the
changing circumstances due to the intensifièation of the air war in 1940, the United Kingdom's inability to,,discharge her part of the
obligation in materials hecame very evident,
and the financial. settlement accounts for the
first and second plans indicated that the United
Kingdom owed the Canadian govemment the
sum of approximately 425 million dollars as
hier share of the original agreement.
In agreeing to cancel this amount owing by
Britain with respect to Air Training, the
government has been motivated by a numiber
of strong reasons. In the first place, this

209

service provided to Britain is one that might
well have been covered by Mutual Aid, and
perhaps would have been covered by Mutual
Aid had not the Air Training agreements been
entered into before Mutual Aid began, and
the accounts worked out only after Mutual
Aid had terminated.. In the second place, the
United States furnished siiilar assistance as
Lend-Lease. And tbirdly, we came to the
conclusion, after much consideration, that repayment of this 425 million dollars was beyond
the United Kingdom's capacity to pay within
a reasonable period. It seemed to-us futile te
ask the British government to pay this 425
million dollars some time in the next oentury
when they have completed the payments on
the boan which we are now making to them.
We think it far better to face the facts clearly,
and cancel this particular war debt. It should
be rcmembered that the United Kingdom has
no production assets as a result of incurring
this debt-nothing that will add to hier ability
to pay it.
Article 8, regarding consultation, indicates
that the two governments will work together
in putting the agreement into effect, and that
if major changes occur in the international
situation they will consider together what
changes in its provisions they should make,
subject of course to such legislative approval
as xnay be necessary.
I think, honourable senators, I should point
out to the house that, in addition te the terms
of the bull itself, an understanding has been
entered into, betwedn the Chancellor of the
Exchequer in the United Kingdom
and
Mýinister of Finance in Canada, covering the
the
possibility that the proposed boan to the
United Kingdom by the United States should
not' pass or be amended in such form as to,
vitally affect this agreement. The understanding is that if Congress does not approve
the Anglo-American agreement, Canada anid
the United Kingdom-în the termis of Article
8 of our agreement-may have to reconsider
parts of the agreement which would he definitely affected. If, for instance, the Congress
of the United States does net approve the
Anglo-American agreement, we shaîl not
benefit from the trade and exchange provisions
of that agreement, either directly -or through
the application of Article No. 5 of our agreement. Consequently, we feel that those portions of our agreement which it is not necessary
to implement, immediately ini order te enable
the United Kingdom te proceed now with its
purchases in Canada, should be deferred until
we sce the result of congressional action.
Be~fore concluding, I shuuld like to say one,
further word on the question of repatriation
of Canadian securities held ini the Old

210

SENATE

Country. I have heard it suggested that
inasmuch as there have been very material
holdings by nationals of the United Kingdom,
those securities should be repatriated before
any loan was undertaken. On the face of it
this seems not an unreasonable contention, and
as I felt it had some bearing on this bill I
endeavoured to secure what information I
could on it. It appears that in 1939 securities
to the value in Canadian funds of about two
and a half billion dollars were held in the
United Kingdom. It appears moreover that
in the period between the outbreak of war
and the present seme one billion dollars of
that two and a half billion dollars worth of
securities had already been disposed of by
United Kingdom interests. Part was applied
on this specific loan of 700 million dollars.
There remain, therefore, securities to the
value of about a billion and a half dollars. I
am advised that of that amount approximately
half, or 750 million dollars worth, is in Canadian securities or obligations payable in
Canadian currency, about 500 million dollars
in Canadian securities payable in sterling, and
the balance of 250 million dollars in British
investments in Canada in real estate and
business undertakings of one kind and another.
Take first the 750 million of Canadian
securities. I presume if they had to be repatriated, it would be necessary for the.
British government, by some process of expropriation, to take them from the individual
holders in the United Kingdom, who would
receive bonds in exchange. I would point out
that, as I understand, whatever portion of
that 750 million dollars may in the period
between now and 1950 be voluntarily sold
outside the United Kingdom, is already
pledged on the first loan. As respects the 500
million dollars payable in sterling, I am not
sufficiently apprised of the intricacies of
finance to speak definitely, but I gather that
so far as utilizing that money goes, the fact
that it was payable in sterling would not help
materially, unless we made sterling convertible
in order to get the balance. .As to the remaining 250 million dollars representing real estate
and business investments in Canada, the
British Government would I suppose require
their nationals to surrender those investments
in order that they be converted into cash.
The very essence of this agreement is that
it will in all likelihood result in our selling
to Britain Canadian goods and services equivalent in value to the amount of the loan.
That, of course, is a very important factor.
But what is of vital importance to us is this.
The position in which Britain finds herself
following the war raises the question as to
which type of economic policy she will follow
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

in the years that lie ahead, and the likelihood that she will adopt whatever policy she
thinks is good for the world as a whole and
vital to Canada in particular. This contemplates that she will regain her position and
carry on business, as in the past, as one of
the world's great trading nations. It might
be said, "We will take from you the very
last security you hold in various countries."
It might seem to be an advantage to do so;
but it would be only temporary, for to handicap Britain's ability to get back into the
trading position she occupied before the war
would be a very short-sighted policy indeed.
The position of Canada has changed tremendously in recent years. In my recollection we
used to be looking for capital from outside
countries to assist our development. We have
almost reversed that position now. But the
time may come when we shall again want
capital from the outside, and from the national
point of view it is not a bad idea to have
individuals in the United Kingdom who have
not only a sentimental desire that Canada
shall be prosperous, but a financial desire as
well. Even were it possible, I doubt that it
would be good policy for us to attempt to
strip a customer whom we hope to get on
ber feet as a trading nation. In fact it might
be a very dangerous policy even to contemplate. As far as the United States is concerned,
while some of her public men have suggested
that their proposed loan should be made in
exchange for British bases in the North
Atlantic, they have not gone to the length of
suggesting as an alternative the forcible
repatriation of any American securities that
may now be held in the United Kingdom.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I should
like to say that we should bear in mind the
fact that the objectives of this bill in all its
ramifications are mainly that we should assist
the United Kingdom-who in the past has
been Canada's largest and most reliable market-to adopt an economic policy in the
future which will not only be of benefit to
the world as a whole, but to Canada perhaps
more than any other country. The bill does
not contemplate only a market for an equivalent amount of Canadian products, although
that is an important factor. It is to enable
the United Kingdom, one of the world's
greatest trading nations, to overcome the
obstacles which are in the way and restrict
her in adopting an economic policy for the
future which will not only contribute to her
own welfare but will serve to increase the
prosperity of the world as a whole, and which
for that reason is of outstanding importance

ta this country wbose economy is built up
on exports ta. a greater extent, perhaps, than
that of any other country i the world.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: Has the honourable leader any information on bow many
busbels of wbeat per annum Britain is
obligated ta take and apply on this credit?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The probability
is, as 1 understand, that Britain's purchases
in Canada--if indeed we are in a position ta
supply tbem-will be materîally in excess cf
tbis credit, provided the necessary fadiities
are available. But 1 do not think this agreement contemplates any undertaking on the
part of Britttin ta make any specific purchases
from Canada.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: If the honourable
leader finds that is not the case will hie advise
us?
Mr. ROBERTSON:- Yes, but I think I arn
right.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Has any arrangement
been reached with Britain for lifting import
licences or other impediments to trade?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That matter has
beén under -constant review. Britain's desire
ta purchase Canadian goods is even greater
than aur desire ta seIl thern. The difficulty
apparently is ta arrange the necessary balance.
I understand that today, because of Britain's
buge comrnitrnents, sterling is not convertible
into American dollars. That of course was
flot the case*before the war. I understand that
to-day it is not convertible at all. The only
way that Britain can pay us is by lier exports
ta this country, or by some arrangement which
not only contemplates providing goods, but
places hier in a position where sterling' will
be readily convertible ito Canadian currency.
Hon. *Mr. McGEER: I did not hear the
amount still outstanding on the 700 million
dollar boan.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It is approximately 500 million. The figures I have indicate
that approximately 160 -million dollars bave
been applied, and the balance of approximately
40 million dollars is in process cf application
-a total of approximately 500 million today,
or it rnay be up ta March, 1951.
Hon. Mr. MoGEER: May I ask the hionourable leader what rnetbod of procuring this
money is proposed?
Hon. Miý ROBERTSON: The 'only two
methods I know of are taxation or borrowing.
We must borrow the rnoney ta pay our
producers.

1211

Hon. Mr. MeGEER: But when the government goes into the business of lending money
at the rate of a billion dollars, the people who
are going ta pay the bill ought to kniow how
it is proposed ta finance it. How does this
program line up wjth the taxpayers of Canada?
How does the government propose to finance
this billion and a quarter dollars? That must
be decided, because the arnount bas been
agreed upon.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I presume tbat
these or any other monies advanced for the
purpose of financing expenditures authorized
by the Canadian parliament are provided for
in the budget. How much will be raised by
taxes and bow much will be obtained by
borrowing I arn not in a position ta say, but
obviously the money must be raised by ont
means or the other.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Did I oorrectly
understand the bonourable leader to say tbat
tberc was no compulsion dn Britain ta spend
any of tbis money in Canada?
Hon. ',Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 see nothing ta
tbat effect in, the agreement.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Tbe Export Credit
Insurance Act, under which we loaned money
ta France, Belgium and the Netberlands, provided that the money rnust be spent in Canada.
Amn I rigbt in that interpretation?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes. In tbe case
of those countries the credit advanced represented flot only the quantity of goods. but
about 70 per cent of their purchases. May I
illustrate the point by saying that if a credit
of 10 million dollars was extended ta a country, varying amounts, genérally 30 per cent
already would have been paid ini cash. For
instance, out of 13 million dollars three million
dollars would be paid in cash, and the credit
advanced would be ten million.
We must distinguish between tbis loan ta
Great Britain and tbe credit extended ta other
countries. Credit was extended to France and
otber European cointries ta belp tbem get on
their feet; but i this instance, as I understand it, specific financing cf Rurchases is prop-osed. Tbis agreement, along with the action
of the United States, contemplates putting
Britain ini a position ta resume bier pre-war
place as a trading nation. Consequently tbe
attitude of the UJnited States may have a vital
bearing on the amount of the purchases and
tbe major objectives of the boan.
Before the war, with no boans involved,
Britain took a tremendous surplus of goode
from tbis country, probably for no other
reason than tbat she wanted the goodes and
they suited bier. I tbink tbere is every pro&-

SENATE
pect that she will purchase to an even greater
extent in the future. However I doubt if there
is any binding agreement that she must do so.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
I first wish to compliment the leader of the
government on the very clear statement he
has made to this house. I have read the
agreement carefully, and believe the matter
can be approached from several angles. First,
is it a good business deal? Second, as asked
by the honourable senator from VancouverBurrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer), where is the
money to come from? Third, does Canada
owe anything at all to Britain, aside from*a
purely business aspect? Fourth, is it advisable
to let Britain go down, and let the devil take
the hindmost?
I may say candidly that I am looking at this
question purely and simply from the Canadian
viewpoint. I admit that I have the kindliest
feelings towards Britain as part of the British
commonwealth of nations. Some of my own
family risked their lives over there, but they
did it for Canada and for no other country.
Therefore, I approach this question frorn the
standpoint of what is best for Canada in the
world today. I take second place ta no one in
this bouse in my love of Canada, but in this
problem I wish to exercise-and I want honourable senators to do likewise-the same
business sense that I would exericse in a personal problem.
The end of the war came a year ago. At
that time no one would have believed that
today we would be facing the problems we do.
We are most uneasy. We have formed the
United Nations Council, and its executive has
been meeting in London and in New York;
the foreign ministers of the four great powers
have been trying ta reach an agreement, and
have practically failed. We watch the outcome of the elections in France and, in other
parts of Europe looking for a signal as to what
may happen. We are disturbed because our
newsmen are not allowed to go into Russia, or

even into the Russian zone. A former President of the United States has given us distressing reports of world conditions-and who
would accuse Herbert Hoover of being an
alarmist?
Such is the gloomy picture of world affairs.
Yet Canada, which normally holds fifth or
sixth place among the trading nations of the
world, last fall authorized a 750 million dollar
loan to certain countries of the world, and
we are now asked to authorize a loan of one
and a quarter billion dollars to Great Britain,
all in an attempt to put the world back on
its feet and in a position to trade. With the
absence of trade the great threat to the world
today, as I see it, is famine. And famine
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

means communism-I do not mean the ordinary struggle between labour and capital, but
revolution. Famine is the breeder of rebellion. If we value our freedom it is up to us
to do our'part ta put the world back on its
feet. 'When you talk to the boys who went
overseas in the armed services, particularly
those who were in the air force, they will tell
you that the devastation in Europe is so
great that it is difficult ta imagine how that
continent can ever be restored. We are
attempting to effect a restoration.

If a man who for years had been my best

customer found himself in difficulties through

no fault of his own, and ho still had the
character

and ability

demonstrated

by the

British people during the war, it seems to me
that it would be good business on my part to

lend him sufficient money to get going again.
Fundamentally, that is the principle involved
here.
This agreement calls for a loan of 500 million dollars without interest, for the writing
off of 425 millions, and for a loan of one billion 250 million without interest for four or
five years, and after that interest attthe rate
of 2 per cent, provided that the trade justifies
it. I think under the circumstances that is
good business.

My honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) has accused me of always supporting the government. In this instance I
am not supporting the government. I am supporting myself and my fellow Canadians, particularly the businessmen and producers of
Manitoba. The businessmen and farmers of
the three prairie provinces are more interested

in this bill than are the people of Ontario
and Quebec. I believe that the three prairie
provinces and British Columbia have sold a

proportionately larger share of goods to Great
Britain than have any other parts of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: And we spend our
money in Ontario.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am talking now about
the goods we have ta sell. My honourable
friend from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr.
Horner) says that we buy our goods in
Ontario. But if we did not sell our own-products first, Ontario and Quebec would soon
feel the effects. My argument is that fundamentally the people in our part of the country are strongly in favour of this loan. The
throwing off of 425 million dollars is per-

haps necessary, as the honourable leader has
said, in order to get started.
In the good old days when the banks loaned

money in the three prairie provinces it was
common to hear the statement: "Mr. Brown
ought to be worried about the money he owes

MAY 9, 1946
the batik." Invariably the answer was: "Why
should he worry? The batik is daing the
worrying." Usually the borrawer owed the
batik s0 mueli money that it was necessary to
lend him mare ta keep him in business. Our
position today with respect to the loan ta
Britain is samewhat similar ta that af the
batik. Lt is tiat what we would like to do,
but wliat is necessary under the circumstances.
I arn nat going ta 'argue whether the loan
should have been at 2 per cent or 3 per cent
or any other rate. I arn convinced that the
people ai Canada will lend money ta the
gavertimetit ta make this loan, or will pay
the money in taxation, if it lias ta lie raised
that way. Sa mucli for the business end ai
the transaction.
I was glad ta liear my lionourable friend
the leader of the govertiment make the point
tliat the putting tlirough af the American loan
is necessary in order ta make ouy own boan
af amy real use ta Britain. Lt is nat certain
yet that Cangress will apprave the loan. I
wauld like ta say ta aur American friends
something that I have na right ta say, namely,
that it is just as mucli in their interest that
we sliould pass aur lan as it is in aur interest
that they shauld pass tlieir boan, for the twa
boans are part af one whole.
Some people have asked me: "Why shauld
we nat let the British people finance themselves? We need ail the maney we cati get
riglit here ta take care af aur unemplayed
people and ta pravide for a great. many
In the circumstatices, wliy
requirements.
8liauld we lend maney ta Britain at ahl? And
in any event, why sliould we lend it at sucli
a law rate ai interest as 2 per cent?" Well,
it is pure business. I feel sure that if I had
been in Mr. Ilsley's place I would have made
the rame deal, for I thin-k it is ane that must
lie made.
We are part ai the British Empire. We
Anglo-Saxons feel very' grateful ta Britain
wlien we remember tliat in the dark da±s ai
1940 lier peaple stoad up and battled ta save
civilization. After liaving listened ta Cliuréhill1
and others, we reabize that the people ai
Britain hiave something that the world needs.
I arn persuaded tliat their genius and ability
will pull them tlirougli. I have heard it said
that by lending this rnoney we are helping
the Socialiste ai Great Britain ta make gaod.
I do nat believe any sucl thing. The infrmation available taday is that the peopile ai
Britain are undergoing warse liardships than
tliey suffered during the war. In any event,
wliat helps ta keep a party in power is, not
a boan frarn an autside country, 'but the
party's domestie policy.

Any people who cati fight with their backs
ta the wall as the British people did in 1940
and 1941, surely cati pull through now if
given the tools and raw materials to work
with. They are making a desperate effort to,
produce goads for the export market, and
they can only succeed in that if they are
able to buy raw materials. Wlieat, cattie,
hogs, dairy products, lumber, minerais and
raw materials for manufacturing purpases will
lie bought by Britain if she cati sell goods
to us. A seriaus question that we in this
country will soon have to face is this: How
mucli British goods are we willing to admit
into this country in order that the manufacturers may purchase our raw materials? It
will be a hard question to answer, for we ourselves produce many of the kinds of goods
that Britain will want ta sei., In the western
provinces there is of course a school of thouglit
that favours absolutely free trade, whule the
central provinces are more inclined to
demand adequate protection for itidustry. Our
problem is to find a plan acceptable to the
country as a whole. Unless we do alI we can
to help Britain, there will be no British market for our goods in the future.
Lt is but natural that 1 should like to see
help given ta Britainm If I had to make a
chaice between doing something for the benefit of my own city of Witinipeg and doing
somethmng for the benefit of the city of Toronto, say, I would only lie acting as an
ordinary human being in cboosing in faveur
of Winniipeg. Similarly, if there has ta be
a choice between giving aid to Britain anid
giving aid to Russia, my vote will lie for
Britaiti. That is no more than one would
expect.
This bill, hanaurable senators, asks us -ta
authorize the letiding of the sinews of trade
ta aur best customer, sa that she may get
back on lier feet. I amn strangly in favour of
the bill. I think the government made a good
deal, and I hope that this hause will unanimously-I use that word advisédly-e.ppTOve
of it.
Han. Sir TIHOMAS CHAPAIS: Honourable members of the Senate, I sincerely regret
having to dissent from the aim ai the present

was limited-limited, not by the capacity of
the Canadian people to work, not by their
capacity to utilize their enormous.heritage of
national wealth for the betterment of their
own standard of living and to help the standard of living of other people less fortunate
than themselves, but upon the theory that
the operations of our civic and -provincial
governments, our national government, and
our public utilities were all dependent upon
our ability to borrow abroad. You have all
heard it. There is not a man in this chamber
who has not heard the chairman of the Finance
Committee and provincial and dominion
Finance Ministers all declaring that our limitations were compelled by the necessity of
maintaining our credit abroad. Go back, if
you will, to the days when the Canadian
Pacific Railway Company commenced its
operations under the enormous bonus system
which the Dominion government inaugurated
at the very dawn of confederation-and you
wil find it splendidly outlined in the Sirois
report-go back, if.you will to the days when
the colonies were overwhelmed with public
debt, which was the real basis of the formation of our confederation. . The hope was
expressed that if the debts of Nova Scotia,
Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick,
Lower Canada and Upper Canada were eonsolidated into one common obligation, the
wider basis of credit to be established would
offer greater security and so make it easier
to borrow abroad.
That policy of borrowing abroad has continued. Go into the more recent history of
the construction of- the Mackenzie & Mann
railway system. The guarantees for that
gigantic exploitation did not come from our
national parliament, they came very largely
from the provincial governments. What happened? Guaranteed by provincial credit, the
promoters went abroad to Berlin, to Paris,
te London, to New York or any other financial centre where the credit of Canada was
established, and they loaded us up with obligations that brought the system into receivership and this great nation to the verge of
national bankruptcy.
-Always there has been advanced this theory,
that the development of Canada's mines, .er
fisheries, her forests -and other natural
resources, the building of her villages and
cities, highways and railways, was dependent,
not upon the power of Canada to finance her
own internal needs, but upon the value of
Canadian credit abroad. Because of our
economic policy being based on that theory,
Canada, instead of being a strong and powerful nation with three or four times the population that it has today, saw the best of her

youth settle south of the line. In substitution for that loss of real Canadians we went
to Europe to bring in all kinds of people who
might find a better condition of life in Canada
than they had in Eastern Europe. One of the
tragedies of Canadian history lies in the fact
that from the province of Quebec and the
Maritime provinces hundreds of thousands of
Canadians-yes, I fancy that it runs into
millions-have gone south; whereas had they
been transplanted to the rich lands of western
Canada we would have a much stronger and
more powerful nation than we have today.
I know it is not easy to change men's attitudes towards principles that have long been
accepted, but this bill affords ample proof that
we eau finance the development of Canadian
wealth for Canadian people, and that we have
not only the power to contribute to a much
higher standard of life for a much greater
population than we now have, but also the
proven capacity to make great contributions
to better the standard of living for the peoples
of this troubled world today.
We have lived through two disastrous wars.
I cannot help reflecting that our belief in our
financial theories has contributed to the cause
of war. By that I mean that under our mistaken theories of finance we had reduced ourselves to a condition of pitiable incompetency
in the matter of defence. Canada, the United
States, Australia, New Zealand and Great
Britain-in fact, the domain of the Englishspeaking world-came to the conclusion that
they could not maintain an expensive programme of armament equipment for their own
défence in a world threatened with aggression
to the point where the aggressors rose up and
said: "We are prepared, and they are not.
Let us go forward and take what they possess."
Is it reasonable to believe that in 1914 the
Kaiser and his general staff would have moved
into the conflagration of aggression they
started had they known that the powers latent
within the English-speaking world would be
developed and would rise up te bring that
aggression to disaster and destroy the Kaiser's
kingdom?
Why were we so indifferent to supporting
Great Britain then? We paid for our indifference not only in money but in suffering
and the sacrifice of lives.
Why in 1939 did we, a nation rich beyond
the dreams of Midas in possibilities for
human endeavour, allow a million of our Canadians to go unemployed and hungry? We convinced Hitler and the German general staff,
and even Mussolini and the Japanese, that
the time to wipe out the British Empire had
come. Because of our attitude towards finance we invited the very attack that came.

SENATE

Does anyone think for a moment that this last
great martyrdom of man would have been
thrust upon us if our policies, adopted by our
national government and approved in this
bouse, had not convinced the aggressors that
we were a diffident people, incapable of meeting the demands of modern defence, and incompetent in spirit to appreciate the need of
protecting the enormous share of the world's
resourôes which we are privileged to possess?
We have come through that period, and now
we emerge into the world of that great counterpart of the British Empire, the English speaking union-a world dominated by the community of the British comnonwealth and the
peoples of the United States and ber associates. I do not think we in Canada can
escape that new responsibility. By the Ogdensburg Agreement Canada and the United States
established a permanent board of defence for
the protection of the North American continent-a citadel of freedom for the whole
world.
The Ogdensburg Agreement recognizes that
Canada, in ber partnership with the United
States, is to remain a full member of the
British Commonwealth of Nations, owing allegiance to the Crown and accepting, as she
always has accepted, the full responsibility of
a non-qualified member of the British Empire.
We have a right to be proud of the part we
played in bringing about AngloAmerican
friendship. Those who believe in the British
parliamentary system of democracy and freedom cannot look upon the world of tomorrow
with indifference; the right of the Englishspeaking world to continue ta play its part is
being challenged by forces that are just as
great and powerful as any which have been
marshalled against it in the past.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: More sa.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Let me put it plainly.
We of Anglo-Celtie stock in the British Empire, numbering somewhere between 75 and
80 million, happen to be the dominating
influence in an empire of some 500 million
souls which is being challenged from within
as well as from without. We cannot look
with indifference to the demands of the
Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Far
East. No matter what happens there, the
British Empire will still have its responsibilities. Australia and New Zealand will still
be in the South Pacifie, the islands of the
United Kingdom in the North Atlantic, and
Canada on the North American continent.
The British Empire will still be a world empire, and it will always bave world responsibilities.
Let us go a little further in this matter of
world population, and add ta our 70 or 80
Hon.

Mr.

MeGEER.

millions the 140 million people of the United
States.
Even then the English-speaking
power that has given the world its best hope
for freedom still represents less than 10 per
cent of the total population of this seething,
surging world of new demands. We need a
continuation of the power we developed during the war; and the greatest source of the
power that saved us from utter ruin and
disaster was unity born of Mother Necessity.
The proudest moment in my life was
when as a supporter of the government, I sat
in the other place and heard the Prime
Minister of our nation ask parliament to
authorize the gift of a billion dollars to Great
Britain. Other members, I know, felt as I
did. I believe that was the first time in the
history of the empire that a government had
said, "We will give." There was no thought
of lending or leasing; there was no hope of
repayment. The hope in the minds of everyone then was the hope of success in the common cause. With the fulfilment of that hope
there has come a new burden of responsibility
which calls for a different conception of the
use of the power we possess, and that we
acquired in the hard school of experience.
Honourable senators, we got into trouble
before because we had a mistaken appreciation of real values. We valued dollars,
pounds, yen and marks more bighly than
human beings. That is what we are doing
to-day. We are talking in terms of interest
and repayment, and are adding to the overwhelming burden of the English-speaking
people a world of interest-bearing debts.
Let me state what it really means to us to
advance Great Britain a couple of billion
dollars. During the war we had a national
income of nine billion dollars a year. Spread
that amount over fifty years, the period of this
loan, and the total is 450 billion dollars. We
are talking about two billions. Now let us
assume that our national income will nat
maintain its wartime level, but will drop to
five billion dollars. That, which is the minimum income for the Dominion of Canada,
would mean a total national income over fifty
years of 250 billion dollars.
If it was good kusiness for us ta give
Britain a billion dollars a year during the war,
would it not have been equally good business
to have given ber a quarter of that amount
for a period of ten years before the war,
thereby permitting ber to prepare ber defences
and our own? Had that been done there
would have been no war. Has the time not
come for us ta consider in cold reality some
of the mistakes that we can be reasonably
certain led to the outbreak of the last two
wars, and to take steps to avoid making similar

MAY 9, 1946
mistakes in the future, in the hope that thereby we rnay flot only improve the standard of
living but prevent the coming of another war,
one which would be more disastrous and more
costly in treasure, huinan life and suffering
than any war has ever been in the past?
But we are rnoving backward, rather than
forward. We are talking in terme, flot of
human values but of business. We are getting
back to the cold calculation of dollars and of
rates of interest. What nonsensel 1 am ini
favour of making this contribution te Britain
without requiring interest or the repayment of
principal. My opinion is that this would be
no more than a return to the people of the
BritislhIsies of sarnething that we had already
received frorn thern.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The people of this
earth did enjoy peace for a period following
the Napoleonio wars. The British fleet then
held rnastery aver the seas. It had rid the
seas of piracy.
Han. Mr. DUFF: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The seas then becarne
flot only free, but, for the flrst time in history, secure to ail mankind. The United
States proclaimcd the Monroe doctrine, but
the efficacy of that doctrine depended upon
the power of the British fleet. Ini Canada we
neyer assumed any obligation te defend our
own shores or to maintai either the freedom
of the seas or the spirit of world-wide good
wil-things which were as rnuch a blessing to
us as to any others. We left the whole burden
to the people of the British Isles. We spent
nothing, until the cail came in 1914.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: In 1910 we did, when
Laurier was in office.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: We know what happened ta the Naval Bill of 1.910, which was
brought in by Laurier. That was changed
into a proposal ta contribute a few dollars to
build a British battleship in the Old Country,
and even that was dropped before 1914.
The point I want te make, is that in this
loan we are flot giving anything to Britain. In
stipulating for repayrnent and in charging
interest rneanwhile, we are exacting a measure of contribution that we do flot need and
that the people. of Britai cannot afford to
pay.
Hon. Mr. DUEF: And which we owe thern.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: We do not need British
pounds, for do the people of Britain need
Canadian dollars. What they do want frorn us
is a portion of the surplus foods and raw
materials that we Canadians can produce in

217

abundance over and above our own requirements. In Canada we have no shortage of
food or of many af the raw materials that
Britain sa urgently needs. Our farms, our
fisheries, our forests, our mines can produce
these things in great abundance. Are we gomng
te continue ta make the same mistake that we
made in the past, by lirniting, aur help to
preserve those institutions which we hold
dearer than life-in short, by putting dollar
units ahead of human values?
I have spoken of aur position in the English-speaking world. I now want ta corne te
the basis of our own confederation. The
Canadian people have been blessed with a
great experiment in the developrnent of a
nation. I neyer read the Confederation
Debates without experiencing a heightened
respect for the members of the conference in
the old city of Quebec at which the resolutions that gave birth ta our nation were
passed.
Hon. Mr. DUFE: Don't forget Charlottetown.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: There was a little
backsliding.at Charlottetown. As a Canadian
I arn thrilled when I think af that conference
at which Taché and Cartier, Macdonald and
Brown, and other representatives of the two
Canadas, came together ta build a national
home for two great races of people. Well,
today our people are facing something that is
more than a mere political discussion. The
adjourninent of the Dominion-Provincial conference presents us with a real challenge ta
develop, under the changed conditions of these
tirnes, a satisfactory basîs for the continuation
of the union that was s0 nobly based on a
spirit of good will in 1867. There is no question today as to the good will of the people
in every province towards the people of ail
the other provinces. No one can doubt that,
so far as the people are concerned, Canada is
a united country. Whence cornes the trouble?
It arises frorn aur attitude ta, finance.
Let me put the matter frankly. We who
can vote 600 million dollars for Britain, 750
millions for foreign trade, and upwards of 2
billions for aid ta England, cannot provide
the means of flnancing the needs of our cities
and provinces. Our own schoais, aur hospitals,
our railways, our highway developments, aur
tourist trade-these and other things ame put
into a strait-jacket of centralized power in
Ottawa. If the proposais that I heard. affered
ta the provincial governments in this chamber
had been put forward as the basis of confederation, there would have been no Dominion of Canada. The Fathers of Confedera-

tion would never have agreed to centralized
control over the local affairs and well-being
of the people.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Those who want to
comfort themselves by saying that this loan
to Britain is good business, may do so. But
they who justify it on that ground are faced
with this question: What kind of business is
responsible for the financial policy we are
adopting with regard to our own provinces and
cities? Yes, we must thoughtfully contrast
our domestic policy in finance with our foreign
policy. One of the greatest mistakes that we
as a nation could make today, with the responsibilties that we now have, would be to
sacrifice our internal economy to build up our
foreign trade on a business basis. If a large
proportion of our wage earners ever lose
respect for our institutions, if they come to
doubt that there is fairness and justice in the
administration of the government, our boasted
freedom will be in great danger.
I have a high appreciation of the value of
lending money to foreign countries in order to
maintain our foreign trade, but, honourable
senators, I do not forget that it was in the
days of foreign trade that we came to the disaster of the hungry, workless thirties. Yes, we
had trade agreements. We were even driven at
that time into the British Empire agreements.
As I look upon the world today I for one believe that not only should we do what we are
doing more substantially, but that Canada
should again take the lead to build up not
only ber own power but the power of all the
nations of the British Commonwealth.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: And the United States.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Of course. The United
States is part of our own family today. Before
the war we had a trade agreement with the
British West Indies under which we maintained ships to trade between the two countries. At that time it was proposed that New
Zealand, Australia, Great Britain and Canada
should unite together and build ships of the
type needed to give service necessary to encourage trade relations between those countries. If those ships had been built in our
depression years they would have been worth
their weight in gold to meet the emergency of
the war.
Now, are we to be told in Canada that we
can build ourselves up by financing foreign
trade, or are we going to realize that something
more is required, and that is to build up a
Canada that will be a real neighbour of the
United States and a member of the British
Empire?-an empire that will keep on advancHon. Mr. McGEER.

ing in its service to mankind until peace with
freedom and security comes to bless for all
time every man in every land.
I want to refer to a statement little heeded
at the time, but which was I thought of great
significance. It was made by one of the members of the Royal Commission that after
investigating our economic and financial position recommended the formation of a central
bank-the present Bank of Canada. He was
a man of wide experience in a part of the
country where banking takes on more of a
social aspect than it does in other parts of the
dominion. I am referring to Mr. Beaudry
Leman, who represented our French-Canadian
bankers. He said:
Sufficient stress lias not been laid upon the
factors of national recovery, far more dependable and permanent than the temporary advantages of export trade of raw materials or
foodstuffs. Outside markets for our surplus
specialized production of certain commodities
should unquestionably be sought, but it should
always be borne in mind that world markets are
unreliable and a source of constantly recurring
disappointments. Rightly or wrongly, but as a
matter of fact, the countries of the world are
economically becoming more and more nationalistic.
What will be the production of foodstuffs in
Europe two years from now? I do not pretend
to be a prophet nor to have any specific
knowledge of an area so doubtful, but a little
common sense takes me back to 1937 and
1938, when there were surpluses of food in
Europe. There was no starvation then. Those
surpluses filled our granaries to overflowing
with unsaleable wheat. Do you think that is
not going to happen again? With the power
of organized production that the Soviet Union
possesses and the control that it bas over the
great food-producing areas of Europe, it will
be dangerous for Canada to rely upon the
security of foreign trade to maintain the
national income that must be maintained in
order to prevent our country sinking into pitiable bankruptcy under the appalling load of
debt already incurred. Why, the first plea of
the dominion authorities at the recent conference with the provinces was: We need the
money because we have $460,000,000 of interest to meet as a first charge on the federal
revenues. Well, we cean go on with that kind
of nonsense, and with the kind of nonsense
that this bill offers, but to go on will not mean
that we can escape the penalties that in the
past have been imposed on us by the same
kind of action.
That warning of Mr. Leman's in 1933 is
just as potent today as it was then. It is not
individual nationalism. Make no mistake

MAY 9, 1946
about the power of the Soviet Union to produce, and also its control over the distribution
of food in Europe. Mr. Leman continues:
Are we to await the belated results of international conferences between bankers, that may
or may not, in the near or remote future, restore
international exehanges and trade, or shall we
endeavour to build up as rapidly and as soundly
as possible our own domestic market? Paragraphs Nos. 243 and 244 should be read and
studied in the light of the effeet that world
prices have had on the value of field crops.
These are the tbings you must anticipate
when you start advancing Canadian dollars in
the foreign exchange market if your own prosperity depends on your money ever coming
back wîth -or witbout interest. Mr. Lernan
adds:
Meagures calculated to develop intra-Imperial
co-operation or Imperial monetary co-operation,
as set forth in paragraph No. 21.1, should not be
developed beyond the scope of providing ample
facilities for the interchange of goods and serVices,

unless the people of Canada understand

and decide, in f ull knowledge of the consequences,
that close monetary co-operation may lead to
close economie association, whjch. in turn is a
step towards common political action.
Do you realize what that means? That was
the false doctrine fed to the people of Canada.
We had it in the House of Commons right up
to 1939. We were told we should not associate
with Britain economically, financially or in
defence, because if we dared do that we should
become involved and could flot escape our
obligation to go to war when Britain went to
war. So we were told to withdraw from the
English-speaking world, to keep clear of
Brit&in and avoid war in the future. That
very advice brought us into the most disastrous
wars we have ever known in the bistory of the
world. W7hat could keep Canada out of war
at Britain's sida when Britain aýlone stood in
the breach to preserve the freedom of the
whole world?
Soine Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: That ia the kind of
nonsense we -have had, and it stems from the
saine kind of pitiable selfishness that inspires
public men to advocate exacting from Britain
repayment of an interest-bearing boan. when
I arn satisfied that the overwhelming majority
of the Canadian people would gladly approve
our giving everything we can afford to the
British people and neyer asking repayment
of a cent. In law and in finance we are told
how wise it is to discuss matters of political
economy i termis of sound business. But,
honourable senators, the tragedy of that kind
of thinking is i the record of great disaster
that the business-minded leader interpreting
pobitical and international economy bas left
in bis wake. I do flot know that anybody

can measure the bosses in money and material
wealth that the last two -wars have cost, but
what a. refiection upon civilization are the
battered chties of two continents, and the
blood of millions of innocent men and wornen
and little chiîdren, slaughtered in the namne
of business-no, in the naine of a freedom
whose preservation was required because men
in autbority in our, eivilized governments put
dollars ahead of human values.
We have great natural resources; our people
are bbessed with great abilities and a brave
spirit. But these carry with tbern responsibilities. 1 like to remember Sir John A. Macdonald's proud declaration: "A Britisher 1 wMi
born and a British 1 shaîl dia", but I iým
always extremely grateful to my own parents
that they decided to leavo the little islands.,
on the other sîde of the Atlantic and give'
me the privilege of being 'born in the Domin-,
ion of Canada. I do not know of any. place*
where I can anjoy the realby worthwhile
things of life more fully than in my own
country. Neither do I know of any other
place to wbich I can advise my children to
go, feeling that they can look forward to a.
better future than I could wben I was a boy.
The future of Canada is secure, provided
our men of government learn some of the
lessons that millions have been sacrificed to
teach. I like to think of this emp ire of ours
as meaning something more than that. We
can pay our own tributes, but somne tributes
that corne from witbout are such as no other
nation bas ever enjoyed.
We are a nation fashioned of two great
races. History tells us that a son of the conquered race, a man of pure French extraction, a member of the Roman Catholic faith,
was loved and respected in all parts of Canada and rose to a position of national leadership, and beld it from 1896 to 1911. But hie
babd it as the son of the nation. When Sir
Wilfrid Laurier passed on -to his reward hie
left bcbind bim a record of empire statesmansbip as glorious as that of the greatest of
empire builders of the past. He said:
The sun does not shine on any people who
enjoy greater peace than my people in Canada
possess under the British constitutional sybtem
of government and the Union Jack.

He abso said:
Freedom is worth fighting for; it is worth
dying for; and when England is at war Canada

is at war.

maintain the supply line which was so valuable in building up resistance and power to
smash through on the Alamein line.
This empire will never be measured in
termas of dollars and cents; it does not function in terms of monetary values. It goes
forward carrying the doctrine of preservation
of world freedom. Maybe that is not a
matter for the consideration of parliament
today.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Yes, it is.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Perhaps we should
keep ourselves out of the realm of great ideals,
and hold to sound business-dollars and
cents.
I have taken this occasion to say what I
think about this measure, and the contribution we owe and should make to Great
Britain. In the absence of a better neasure,
I propose to support this one, in the hope
that some of the light which I have tried to
cast will reach those who control our financial
destiny, and that when the time comes to
collect, we shall be in a mood, not of getting,
but of forgiving.

laudable as the effort may ha, the trada of

We ara really a smail
nation. In my opinion Canada should ha
well able ta take care cf saveral times its
present population without regard to expcrt
trade at all. I remamber that wben Rigbt
Honourable Arthur Meighen was leader cf the

with Sanator Maighee and the hancurable
senatar from Saltcats (Han. Mr. Calder),
made this statamant: "I am oe of those wlio
halieva that if Canada were pusliad out on
the ocean where it was impassible for ber to
assaciate or trade xwitb any othar nation in

Han. Mr. HORNER: Neyer again will I

converted to the idea that after aIl mcnay is

undarstand, particularly sinca Dr. Brady advocated the eatieg of wliole wheat hecause
it was the hast food in the world, wby, with
their granaries fuill, s0 many people in western
Canada shculd tell me they were starving.
I still do nat uederstand haw Canada cen ha

anxious not onîy ta assist England, hut ta reestablish the entire world. I think, bnwaver,
wa are assuming a great task, and thet aur

Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

Han. A. N. MeLEAN: Honourable sanators, I am in favour cf this boan ta Great
Britain, and I quite agrea with the sanator
from Vancouvar-Burrard (Hon. Mr. MeGeor)
that it would ha hatter to aliminata the interest tag.
We are told that it is hast ta leave ciir
debts and ather obligatians in England, hacausa sha naads the interest and dividends
from usý, and than we stert te load bar up
with interest charges over here. Sa muchi

Hon. Mr. HORNER.

Credit or debt is excellent ta belp anc iii
time cf need, but it was neyer meant ta ho
an eternal campanian.
Early ie the war we, alaeg with other
cauntries. liad a substantial accaunt in the
Bank of England. Why this accaunt was
clased is biard ta understand. Having traded
around the warld for many ycars in scores of
countries. I know that we in this cauntry di<l
flot seli aur goods abroad for Canadian
dollars. WXe sald them for pounds sterling.
Tha pound sterling bas been a great unit of
currency. It is understood and used as a
tradieg unit by mare peoples than is tbe
dollar.
I have seen the Britishi pound go
doPn ta around thrae dollars, aed 1 bave
seen it go up ta ovar six dollars; but it bas
always came back ta somewbere near normal,
1 feel it can be depended upon. Why tbis
couetry should have closed its bank account
ie Great Britain is difficult ta axplain. It
seems ta me that a substantial bank account in
England would add at least a little to tbis
eauetry's prestige when peace treaties or trade
agreements are being -negotiated. llowever,
we toak a damand note for aur balance, and
we are rcceiving paymeets on this note as
Canadian securities beld in England are sold
abroad.
I rather question soe
phases cf
this policy.
At least a billion and a baîf dollars worth
cf Canadian dabts and securities are beld in
Europe, cbiafiy ie Great Britain. Undar our
preseet policy thase sacuritias ara being sold
ae.ywbere, and while wa are getting the Procaeds wa seam ta ha losing rathar than gaining
control cf aur own resourcas. Take the case
of aur large privately owned railway, wbicha
this country endawad with tans of millions cf
dollars worth of western lands, and whicb owns
ana of the cauntry's largast wartime and
peacetimd industries.
At the end cf 1944,
Canada owned 13 par cent of the sharas cf
ibis railway, the United States 15 per cent
and the United I(ingdom aroued 66 par cent.
By the ecd of 1945 Canadian ownersbip bad
dropped ta arcued 10 par cent, and that cf
the United Kingdom ta 61 par cent; on tbe
other hand, United States ownarsbip had gone
up ta 221/2 paer cent, or more than double
Canadian holdings, showiýng that the actual
sh ares are baing transferred fram Great
Britain to the United States.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Would the honourable gentleman please repeat the figures ha bas
just givan?
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: At the end of 1944,
Canada ownad 13 par cent of the shares, the
United States 15 per cent and the United
Kingdom araund 66 per cent; at the end cf
1945 Canadian awnership had drapped to

MAY 10, 1946
around 10 per cent, that of the United Kingdom to 61 per cent, whereas United States
ownership had gone up to, 22% per cent. I
think the reason for Canadian holdings going
down is that someone is trying to get control.
Hon. MT. LAMBERT: 0f the C.P.R.?
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: Yes, of the C.P.R.
After sixty years we own 10 per cent of the
stock, and we are simply changing the master
control. This, no doubt, is happening in other
industries.
It lias been intimated in this house that the
United States are not bringing back their
American securities from England. According
to a statement of the Honourable Fred M.
Vinson, Secretary of the United States Treasury, published in the New York Times on
February 23, 1946, the United States have
r4patriated by far the greater portion of their
securities from Great Britain. Out of a total
of $3,238,900,000 ail have heen brouglit back
except seven hundred million. Concerning
this latter amount Mr. Vinson says:
Inaccessible to British Goverument, or not
readily realizable because of varions factors including the f act that 400 million dollars of this
suma was in estates and, trusts not subject to
effectuai government seizure, and because other
portions of the sumn probably represented accounts of Nationals of third nations lield ln
American accounts of British banks.
Canada is the only country I know cf that
is flot steadily repatriating its debts and
obligations from outside its domain. After
reading the United States Senate committee's
report'on cartels, I am sure tliey are not going
to, leave abroad any shares of companies
mixe4l up in cartel operations.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The honourable gentlemaAn is making a very good speech, but would
lie please speak a little more slowly 80 that
we ýcan follow bis remarks?
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: Marshal Smuts, who
is flot only a great empire statesman, but a
great patriot, did not hesitate to arrange to
transfer control of the Southi African diamond
and gold mines from London and Amsterdam
to, South Africa a year or two ago. A full
account of this transfer was published in the
London Economist, and the Prime Minister
of South Africa lias placed a tax on the'
shares se they will not be returned.
If the cost of this war is to be met on the
basis of equal sacrifice, and it sliould be, then
we sliould ahl stand together. No class of
people shoul- be placed in a preferred posid
tion wliereby they can hold choîce investments
and not pay their fair share of taxation. It
is true that through the Britishi government
we have repatriated a considerable quantity

223

of three or four per cent bonds which, generally, were held by trust companies, trust
funds, .widows, orplians and small investors.
But why did we suddenly stop short when it
came to taking over choice investments paying substantial dividends, and held chiefly lýy
a comparatively small group of international
syndicates or investors? It seems to me that
if we were going to leave any securities
abroad, the Iow rate bonds would have served
best for that purpose. They were scattered,
and certainly were not tainted with cartel
operations.
I could namne some of the choice companyinvestuients still held abroad, most of which
are known on the exehanges of London,
Amsterdam and Paris. Several of the coinpanies concerned have been very unfavourably
mentioned in the McGregor report on cartels,
and certainly sliould be owned in this country
if any corporation should. Their past operations have bèen deplorable as far as Canada
is concernied.
Cartels are responsible for many vicious
trade practices, and the wliole policy of the
cartel system runs ceuniter te the very things
that make for general prosperîty i foreign
trade. Cartels stand for the 'raising of prices
and the lowering of production. Tliey seek
abnorudal profits -but evade risk-and risk is
really about the only argument for the profit
system. Matches, medicines, cliemicals, fertilizers, explosives and tini are alI tied up in
cartels. Vicious cartel systems are carrying
on their pernicious work throughout the country. For instance, every time one lights a
match or eats eut of a tin can, toil is paid
te some cartel operator abroad.
Cartels centrol vast assets ini this country,
and local directers take their orders from
foreign lands. We aIl know that before the
war the I. G. Farben Company ef Germany
was the master-mind ef the cartel system
throughout the world; and this great ectepus
was a part of the German higli command. I
commend the investigational reports on cartels
by the committees of the United States Senate
published within the last year or two. These"
should be distributed te and read by every
member of this lioneurable body. The cartel
system often defeats gevernment policy, and
througli its central research laboratories is
careful te keep its "know liow" abroad. The
June editien of the American Magazine
carried an article by the Honourable Henry
Wallace, telling ef the removal from Germany
of 250 tons of scientific documents and ether
information of the I. G. Farben Company,
which had more men engaged in research than
any other company in the world.
This country makes trade treaties with
different natiens te, secedre preferences fer

224

SENATE

Canadian goods. But time and again the
cartels rule differently. Their owners abroad
say: "Canadian goods wbich we control. will
flot be shipped to such and such a country,
trade treaty or noa trade treaty, because it
saits aur purpose to allocate world territary
as we see fit and not as governments may
desire." Canada should be the~greatest match
exporting country in the world. We have the
chemicals and lumber-and what more
economical and profitable way is there ta seil
lumber than through the match business?
But the cartel bosses keep us out of world
markets. I believe Sweden is the great matchexporting country.
Honourable members, we in this country naw
have the opportunity ta bring back share control of these vicious cartel organizations ta
Canada, hy having a majnrity of the shares
owned here. This is pasitively the only real
way in whicb they can be controlled, and if
we do flot embrace this great opportunity of
making ourselves independent of ane of the
most viciaus trade systemos the world has even
encountered we will regret it beyond mieasure
during the years ta come.
Again take the case of South Africa. Her
diamond and gold mines were cantrolled by
the DeBeers and Oppenbeim Syndicate with
headquarters between London and Amsterdam. It cost the government of South Africa
over a quarter of a billion dollars, or the
equivalent in sterling, ta transfer the contraI
to South Africa, but it is far better for gaad
Britishers in South Africa ta own their mines
than for an international group or syndicate
ta do sa. The British government arranged
the deal. I understand the shares were paid for
at stock excbange prices and charged ta the
accaunt of South Africa at the Bankc of
England.
India bas taken back all ber securities, and
Australia and New Zealand hav e been paylng
off their debts.
These Canadian commercial investments or
debts held abroad are in a preferred position
regarding income taxes. During the war we
had ta impose heavy taxes in Canada. These
shares beld abroad get the benefit of lesser
taxation. Large dividends are paid by these
companies operating in Canada to their
awners in Europe, and there is no double
tax on dividends over there sucli as we have
in this country. Europe encourag-es foreigo
investments. In England, for instance, the
shareholder is credited with the tax already
paid by tbe corporation. Once a company
pays a tax on earnings there is practically no
further tax paid by tbe sharebolder wbo draws
the dividend. unless, in exceptional cases, the
sharebolder is a wealthy persan wha gets
Hon. Mr. MeLEAN.

caugbt in the surtax and bas ta pay the
difference between the rate the company pays
and the rate he himself is assessed. Sa anc
can see what a preferred position is held by
these investars, when compared with shareholders here. If these securities were 'brougbt
back ta Canada aur government would get
double taxation, which would make taxation
less on the rest of us, and we could budget
for less and borrow less, for aur commitments
ta Europe would be eut dawn hy the amounts
repatriated.
The argument that Europe should have
investments here, for if it bas it will buy mare
fram us, is hardly logical. It is like advising
a farmer, who is unable ta sell ail bis crop,
that he had better mortgage bis place and
then pay $500 a year interest on the martgage,
because if he does that tbe mortgagee will came
hack and spend $500 witb him for farm
produce. One can easily see that tbe farmer
would bave ta get the $50 in the first place
ta pay. It is the same as regards a creditor
purcbasing fram a debtor. Tbe debtor bas
hiad ta dig up the money first, 50 lie receives
no advantage wbatsaever; in fact, he is at a
disadvantage.
It is the rank and file of people, nat a few
inside syndicates or graups, who are the big
consumers and give us a market. These
Canadian securities held abraad shauld be
paid for, brougbt home and put into the pool
ta belp finance war obligations, especially
where we are called on ta extend s0 much
belp ta Europe. We are nat practising equal
sacrifice for ail in connection witb war finances unless we hring these securities hack
and tax them the same as shares beld bere.
We sbould not be afraid ta let aur credit
accumulate in the Bank of England in the
form. of pounds sterling, if necessary, for sucb
a hank account will prove very useful if we
.iust have patience.
Here we are taxing the littie man in this
country down ta earnings of six bundred
dollars a year, and on tbe other band letting
the big cartel owners off with less taxation
than they sbould pay. Why we tax aur own
citizens the way we do, especially thase in the
lower brackets, andl let these cartel owners
ahroad get off so easily, is beyond oiie'
comprehension.
The stock of campanies that belangs ta
cartels sbould neyer be owned outside, for it
is an establisbed fact that cartels entered into
nefariaus agreements witb fareign countries
wha became aur enemies, agreements which
were ruinous ta Canada. Full stock control of
sucb companies sbould be maintained in tbis
country.
These international cartels defeated government policy witb regard ta trade treaties.

MAY 10, 1946
They held prices Up abnarmally on many
every-day necessities, and the Canadian public
had to pay. These cartels claimed they saved
us from carrying an research work ini Canada,
as we would get the benefit of their foreign
laboratories. However, we .know how many
valuable secr~ets in the production of war
material were held baek from this country
when war came. The mai ority of these nefarious cartel agreements are stili in existence.
They simply were suspended during the war
period, snd the cartels are ail ready to go on
with their toli-gate practices as soon as peacetiine trade becomes firmly established.
Let me give an illustration ta show how
outside debts breed ill will unnecessarily. It
will be remembered that 'within the last year
or twa Alberta, Mantreal and Moose Jaw had
some bonds outstanding ini England, and that
owing ta the war they were difficuit ta refund.
Some were past due, although either ail or
part of the interest was being paid. At that
time some London financial papers were continually flnding fault with these bonds and
saying same harsh things. I remember one
paper called Montreal a rake city. Ail this
friction could have been avoided had we
brought these debts back to this country
through aur lend-Iease or mutual aid. We
had the sterling on hand ta do so many times
over.
This is not the end of the credits that, will
be needed abroad, so we might as well get
these international transactions on a sound
and sensible long-term basis.
More credîts will be needed. There are, I
understand, more than five hundred millions
stili outstanding on the demand note. I feel
it would be hy far the best policy for Canada
to use this amount ta pramptly repatriate
Canadian debts and securities from abroad.
Also, when any further credits are requested
the repatriation of securities should be made
part of the deal. The greater the portion of
Canadian assets and resources owned and controlled by Canadian citizens here, the stronger
our country will be;'and it should be oui- de* sire te build up a strong nation standing on
its own feet within the British Empire. As we
do this aur influence for peace will grow correspondingly. Another point I should like to
make is that these needs from abroad, no matter how much menit they may have, should
not overshadow the needs of our own provinces, and we should show the same generous
spirit in connection with aur dealings with
them.
As for the present loan, this is a time of
great crisis and great need by England, and
while I should prefer seeing the interest tag
eliminated front the bill, I am prepared te
support the measure as it is.

Some Hon. SENÂTORS: Question!
Hon. WISHIART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, yesterday the honourable
>senator from St. Jean Baptiste (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien) asked me whether the agreement.
specifically provided that the credits should
be expended for the purchase of Canadian
goods and services. I expressed the opinion
that it did net. I have since confirmed the
correctness of my answer. Neither, I may add,
is there a similar provision in the United
States-United Xingdem agreement in regard ta
any part of the three and tbree-quarter billion
dollar loan being expended in the United
States. There is, however, this difference between the two agreements. The late Lard
Keynes stated in the House of Lords that it
was generally understood that in the case of
the American loan probably flot more than
half the amount would be necessary te finance deficits as respects Great Britain's purchisses in the United States. On the other
hand, the Canadian requirexuents of the United
Kingdom will for the next few years be very
materially ini excess of the $l»20,00,000.
Though there are no speciflc provisions ini this
bill for Great Britain's purchases of Canadian
go-ods and services, there are agreements in
effect between Canada and the United Kingdam ta caver ppirchases of Canadian gooda
and services for the next year or two, and
other similar agreements are in contemplation.
0f course, this proposed loan fscilitates payment for such purchases, as it is flot likely
that within the next year or two British exports te Canada wilI be sufficient to offset her
requirements.
A point bas been raised in respect ta the
interest rate. I regret very much that circumstances made it impossible for me te be
present during the whole of the very excellent
address of the honourable senator from
Vancouver-Burrard MHon. Mr. MoGeer), but
I have had the apportunity of hearing the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Southern New Brunswick (Hon. Mr. McLean).
I am sure that we all appreciate the generous
impulse which prompted them ta suggest that
the boan should be interest free. Much cau
be said in support of their suggestion, but I
would point out that in preparîng a measure
of this kind the gavernment has ta find some
common ground between thase w-ha say -the
interest rate is not higb enough and those
Who Say it is too high. Honourable members
will r.ecall that under the Expart Credits Iiisurance Act the rate of interest-approximately 3 per cent, varying over the period of
the loan-about equals the cast ta Canada
of raising the money. This loan, a§ hanourable senators knaw, is on a 2 per cent basis

SENATE
for a certain period, and for the first five
years bears no interest at all, so the effective
rate is something under 2 per cent. That
has been criticized in some quarters as being
too low, but I think it will .be generally
agreed that it is a reasonable compromise as
between those who feel the rate should have
been at least 3 per cent and those who have
generously suggested that the loan should
be interest-free.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: There is no interest
payable at all in the event of certain conditions of British foreign trade. The loan is
on much more generous terms than the leader
of the government has stated.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is very true.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: It may be that unless
Britain's foreign trade vastly improves over
what it was in pre-war years, and what it is
likely to be in the face of increased industrialization of the whole world, no interest
will be payable at all.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend is correct. Whether or not the loan
becomes interest-free will depend on how her
financial position may be affected by unforeseerr circumstances.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have great
respect, as I am sure every honourable member of this house bas, for the viewpoint of the
highly esteemed senator from Grandville (Sir
Thomas Chapais). He expressed an opinion
which can be readily appreciated, that in view
of our great financial obligations we should
not embark upon the policy which this bill
contemplates, and he called attention to the
increasing expenditures of the federal government. That is perfectly truc. As was stated
in this house a day or two ago, our normal
peacetime budget may well be between
$1,800,000,000 and $2,000,000,000. Provincial expenditures for this year are expected to total
about $450,000,000 as compared with $225,000,000 before the war. Those are impressive
figures. While of course it is possible to reduce
expenditures, both federal and provincial, I
fancy that no matter what reductions may be
made in both fields, increased financial requirements over pre-war years are inevitable. Let
me remind my honourable friend from Grandville that the only possible solution is to
increase our national production and national
income, and this, I submit, can only be brought
about by increasing the volume of our foreign
trade. We may, some time, be able to attain
the happy position which the honourable
senator from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr.
Horner) has suggested, so that we shall no
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

longer be concerned about export trade, but
the fact is that the economy of this country
is at the present time, and has been practically
ever since confederation, based on foreign
trade. Our national income must be sufficient
te enable the federal government to secure the
taxation necessary in order te meet the expenditures which it bas undertaken, and also
te meet the obligations of the provincial
governments-including the government of
which my honourable friend is such a distinguished member. This will be possible only
if the income of our people is very materially
increased by the expansion of our foreign
trade. We are trying by this measure to put
the United Kingdom in a position where she
can recover ber pre-war standing as a trading
nation and, if possible, improve it substantially
-a condition as necessary to our future prosperity as it is to hers.
In conclusion, I desire to compliment honourable senators for their very excellent contributions to this debate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question is

SENATE
BANKRUPTCY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHARD McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill A5, an Act
respecting Bankruptcy.
He said: Honourable senators, before asking
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) to explain this bill, I
should like, on behalf of the government, to
make a brief statement with respect to it.
The present bankruptcy law has been in
force since 1919. Substantial amendments
were made in 1932 after a parliamentary inquiry. Since then suggestions were made from
time to time with a view to improving the
law. These suggestions were assembled by the
Superintendent of Bankruptcy, and those
which commended themselves to the department have been included in the present draft
bill. The government has introduced the bill
in the Senate with the view of having its
various provisions studied by a committee,
before which representations may be made by
the various interests concerned with the conduct of business affairs in this country. It is
hoped that as a result of this procedure the
bill will receive thorough study and the bankruptcy law will be brought up to date and
put in such form as will serve the best
interests of the people of Canada.
I would now ask the honourable senator
from Vancouver South to explain the measure.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, I fear that this bill is just as formidable as it appears. Its preparation bas involved
a great deal of work, and if after second reading it is referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce, its consideration
will entail a good deal of time and effort on
the part of that committee.
The honourable leader of the governnent
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) bas said the bill is
substantially a redrafting and revision of the
present Bankruptcy Act. The work is that of
the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, Mr. W. J.
Reilley, K.C., who bas been in office a considerable time, and who had extensive experience in bankruptcy before he accepted his
present position. To have a bill of this kind
prepared and supervised by a man of Mr.
Reilley's experience is of great value to
parliament. At the same time we know that
officials, the most zealous in the service, even
with the very best of intention, sometimes
have a departmental view, and in our scrutiny
of the bill we should keep that thought in
mind.
This bill is one of the several responses this
session to the desire of members of the
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Senate to have important legislation sent to
this bouse before going to the House of
Commons.
In view of the wide latitude extended to
the Senate by the suggestion of the leader
of the government here, I should not think
much discussion need take place on the
second reading of the bill. The real principle
involved at this stage is whether the bill shall
go ta the Standing Committce on Banking
and Commerce to be thoroughly revised and
checked up before that committee. When it
goes to the committee the first concern will be
the checking of the draftsmanship. No matter
how skilful the Superintendent of Bankruptcy
may have been in his redrafting of the bill,
the committee must make sure that its provisions are clear and mean what they are
intended to mean. In the second place, it
will be necessary for the committee to make
a careful study of the principles involved in
the bill. That will require thoughtful effort
on our part and careful attention to what
Mr. Reilley bas to say. It will also require
that the fullest opportunity be given to all
representatives of business interested in
bankruptcy law-and I believe there will be
many from various parts of Canada-to appear
before this committee.
With this background a brief statement of
the history of bankruptcy legislation in
Canada might be of interest.
The first Bankruptcy Act was passed in 1869.
just two years after confederation. This act
was a re-assembling and amending of the
pre-confederation laws which existed in the
four provinces. In 1875 a new act was
brought in, and, according to Mr. Reilley,
did not prove satisfactory. 'Part of that act
was repealed in 1880 and the balance in 1886.
For thirty-four years thereafter there was no
bankruptcy law in Canada. During those
years we depended on the powers of provincial legislatures to pass acts relating to
voluntary assignments for the benefit of
creditors, which they did. This was held to
be within the competence of the provincial
legislatures as a matter of property and civil
rights.
The next act, which was brought in in
1920, was modelled on the English act of
1914. The basic provision of that act was
that the affairs of the debtor were to be
operated by the creditors almost entirely
through inspectors. That law did not prove
entirely satisfactory, and either in or prior to
1932 a House of Commons committee con
lucted an exhaustive inquiry into the whole
question of bankruptcy.

As a result of that

inquiry the jpresent act of 1932 was brought
in. That act contained two important fea-

MAY 13, 1946
tures which materially improved the operation
of the law. One was the appointment of a
new official, the Superintendent of Bankruptcy, who was given wide supervisory powers.
From first-hand knowledge and from information that I have received from. others I arn
convînced that Mr. Reilley has done a good,
job and has much irnproved the administration of bankruptcy law in Canada.
The second' important principle introduced
in that statute was the licensing of trustees.
Prior to that tirne anyhody could be appointed
a trustee-he might be selected by the creditors. or through the influence of the debtor
himself-hut the 1932 act placed ail these
trustees under the direct supervision of the
Suptrintendent of Bankruptcy, their licences
being renewable annually. The 1932 statute
wias the last amendment to the present Bankruptey Act, which is to be repealed by this
legisiation.
The chief changes proposed by the bill relate
partly to procedure and partly to principles
of the law.
The first proposed change in procedure is
that proceedings by way of petition for bankruptcy may be brought in the Superior Court
of any province, in any registry of that court,
and before any judge of that court. Heretofore the j urisdiction bas been somewhat centralized, particularly in the province of Ontario,
I think. I do flot know as to Quebec. but
there has not been this centralization in
British Columbia: the judges have jurisdiction there, and I think they have. extended it
ver>' generaîlly to the registry offices. However, there always has been one judge assigned
as the Judge in Bankruptcy. If the proposed
change is agreed to, the jurisdiction in bankruptcy will not be an>' different from that in
an>' other civil proceeding. For instance, a
man who wishes to sue someone for damages
in Ontario or any other province, files his
dlaim in an>' registry office in the province,
and thé action will corne before whatever
judge happens to ha dealing with litigation
in that particular registry district.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: A bankruptcy case
cornes before a Judge in Bankruptcy, not a
civil court judge.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is the procedure
now, but the proposal is that hereafter bankruptcy petitions may be filed in an>' registry
office and dealt with b>' any judge of the
Superior Court in the province concerned, the
same as civil cases. If an>' honourable senators do not feel inclined to favour this proposal, I would suggest that the>' do not vote
against the motion for second reading of the

bill but leave the point to be thoroughly
thrashed out in the Banking and Commerce
Committee.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: May' I ask the honourable senator if, when he refers to the registry
office, he means the office of the registrar?
In Ontario we have Registrars of the Supreme
Court.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is what is meant,
the registrars, if my honourable friend prefers
that word. There are Suprerne Court registries in different parts of the provinces, and
registrars are in charge of them. I think that
is the way it works. In Ontario, I understand,
petitions in bankruptcy are filed at the registry
office in'Toronto. If the proposed change is
adopted, petitions ma>' be filed at the local
registry offices. A man in Ottawa, for instance,
could file his petition right here, and it would
be deait with by any one of the Ontario
Supreme Court judges who happened to be
hegring civil cases ini this part of the province.
However, as I have already suggested, the
adoption of this proposed change is flot essential to the principle of the bill, but is something that should be considered ini committee.
Another proposed important change-I do
not know whether it should be called one of
procedure or of substance-is a widening of
the application of the bankruptcy law. The
bill would make it possible to file a petition
âgainst a married woman or against the estate
of a deceased person. Heretofore there bas
been some question as to whether the estate
of a person who has died can. be put into
bankruptcy. I think we will ail agree that in
])rinciple there should not ha an>' objection
to doing that.
I now come to a part of the bill which I
think should receive particular attention from
honourable senators. It has toi do with proposais for compositions, which proposaIs' the
bill provides ma>' ha made aither before or
after bankruptcy. I arn advised by Mr. Reilley-I do not recaîl the circumstances myseif
-that a provision of this kind was included in
the statute of 19W0, but that it did not prove
satisfactory and was repealed in 1923. Mr.
Raille>' explains the unsatisfactory operation
of that provision on the ground that in those
days the trustees were flot of the right kind;
they were not then licensed or under the
supervision of the superintendent. 1 ar n ot
prepared to go into ail the detaîls of the
clausei with reference to compositions. Honourable senators wi]l find the provisions respecting this important matter in Part II of
the bill, sections il to 24. The section to
which I wish to call particular attention is 23,
which bas some 13 subsections. Subsection 1
provides that in the case of a corporation,

SENATE
where a proposal of composition is madehonourable senators will remember that a
proposal may be made before bankruptcy-then, unless it is approved at a meeting of the
creditors or shareholders, the court may appoint a committee, which I understand may be
entirely independent of shareholders and
creditors, to formulate a proposal of composition. Then there are a number of sections
dealing with how the creditors and the debtor
himself are to proceed to try and arrive at an
arrangement under that proposal.
But if an agreement is not reached, you come
to the provision which really bas the teeth in
it-section 23, subsection 10 at page 23 of the
bill. We have got to this stage in the composition procedure, that the committee appointed by the judge has made inquiry and
ascertained the facts, and there bas been no
agreement amongst the creditors that any
scheme will be carried out. Then subsection
10 comes in:
The court on the hearing of tise application
shall take into consideration the report of the
committee and such other evidence as may be
submitted or as may be adduced from such
further investigation of the affairs of the corporation as the court may direct to be made
and hear such representations as may be made
by the corporation or by any of tise creditors or
shareholders or any one on their behalf and if
in itr opinion it is desirable and expedient in
the interest of the corporation, the creditors
and the shareholders or in the public interest by
reason of the nature of the services renderedOf course, honourable senators will recall that,
as originally devised, bankruptcy was for the
purpose of the distribution of the debtor's
assets among the creditors.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Right.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: But this procedure, as
will be seen, is quite a step forward. Let me
read the remainder of the subsection:
-or the business carried on that a proposal
should be formuiated and put into effect notwithstanding the objections of tihe corporation
or any creditor or shareholder or any class of
them and .if reasonably satisfied of tise ability
of the corporation to carry out tihe terns of the
composition that may be formulated tise court
may by order formulate a proposal of composition modifying or altering the rights of creditors
or shareholders or any class of them and providing for the issuance of such new securities or
shares or other evidence of title or interest
therein as may be necessary to carry out tie
terms and formalities of the proposal.
The first thing that will have to be considered
is just how far that subsection goes. I think
it goes pretty far.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Is that taken from the
Farmers Creditors' Arrangement Act?
lion. Mr. FARRIS.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Some of that subsection is not new. The principle is in the
Farmers Creditors' Arrangement Act. I will
deal with that briefly in a moment.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It goes further than the
Farmers Creditors' Arrangement Act.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes. This does go
further. The Farmers Creditors' Arrangement
Act only deals with a compulsory composition
when a farmer is unable to meet his obligations as they mature-which is a standard
definition of bankruptcy.
This provision
applies either before or after bankruptcy. It
thus goes farther; and for the benefit of my
honourable friend from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Leger) I should like to say that in committee
ho may have a chance to give consideration
to tise constitutional question. In 1937 the
Farmers Creditors' Arrangement Act went to
the Privy Council. There it was argued very
strenuously that the act was not bankruptcy
legislation at all, that it was only a colourable
attempt to look after the farmers under the
guise of bankruptcy; but the Privy Council
would not listen to that argument and held
the act to be proper bankruptcy legislation.
But it was commented on that the schemes
were formulated in relation to a farmer who
was not able to pay his obligations as they
matured. However, my passing or offhand
opinion is that probably this wider definition
would be swept within federal competency
as a power necessarily ancillary to the enforcement of bankruptcy. But this is not the
moment to consider any difficult questions of
that kind.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: May I ask my
honourable friend is this legislation intended
to replace the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes. It is intended to
merge all such Acts.
I am sure honourable senators would not
wish me, even if I had any really intelligent
information to give in addition to what I
have given, to go on right now discussing the
problems involved in the subsection. It is
sufficient to call the provision clearly to the
attention of the bouse and make sure that
the public understand that this question is
up for consideration, so that when the bill
is referred to a committee, those interested
will take the opportunity, to appear and make
their representations. There is a lot to be
said for this composition proposal, and a
good deal to be said against it. In principle
the same can be said for this bill as for the
Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, that it is
a good thing to head off bankruptcy. There
are some cases where creditors may desire

MAY 13, 1946
bankruptcy in order to enforce their securities
and -get possession of desirable assets; but,
generally speaking, neither the creditors nor
the debtor nor the publie want to encourage
bankruptcy, and in so far as schemes of this
kind can be formulated with teeth in themfor they are not much good unless they have
teeth-there is in the desire of the promoters
of the bill a proper objective in anticipating
and, if possible, avoiding bankruptcy, with
all its loss and harm to the country. On the
other hand, there is the question of interfering with securities, the question of how
far it will hamper flotations of large capital
investments which may be required in the
future, and mattera of that kind. Again, I
say the principle we have to consider should
be simply this: Shall we study this and see
if we ought to do it or not?
The next section I want to refer to is the
one doing away with custodians. The idea
is the result of Mr. Reilley's experience.
Honourable senators will recall what happens
now, that after a petition in bankruptcy is
made a receiver is appointed, and he selects
from the creditors a custodian. This custodian
remains in office until the creditors select a
trustee, who may be the custodian or an entirely different person. The suggestion is
that you should short-eut the procedure a
little by having the trustee appointed from
the start. Of course, there are provisionsthere are even in the present act-for
changing the trustee, but it is felt that when
the trustee is first appointed the prospects
are that he will continue to be the trustee.
It saves a change in the administration of the
business of the debtor at probably a very
critical time in bis affairs. I think likely we
would all give approval to that principle
right now.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: By whom would the
trustee be appointed?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: By the superintendent.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: The creditors would
have nothing to do with the appointment?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Oh, yeg, they would
have power to change the appointment if they
saw fit afterwards. I think, however, that the
superintendent would certainly seek from
the start to appoint a person whom the
creditors themselves would approve at a later
date.
Provisions are made for the clarification of
the parts of the statute dealing with fraud
and fraudulent preferences. Honourable senators will please refer to section 64 and later
sections.

231

Honourable senators will find in paragraph
(jj) of section 2, on page 5 of the bill, a new
'definition of "transaction". In the present act,
when one wishes to refer to the mouthful of
things that are dealt with under "transaction"
it is necessary to repeat them each time; so
the superintendent has re-defined the word
transaction. There would appear to be a
clerical error in the third line of this paragraph, where it reads "course of action may
arise," rather than "cause of action may
arise." The superintendent has attempted to
define the word "transaction" in such a way
that thereafter in the statute, instead of
enumerating all these things, the word "trans-

action" may be used.
With that new definition of transaction let
us look at Section 68 of the bill which says:
Every transaction whether or not entered
into voluntarily or 'under pressure by an insolvent person becoming bankrupt within three
months thereafter resulting-

I wish to call particular attention to the use
of the word, "resulting".
-in any person or any creditor or any person
in trust for such creditor or any surety or guarantor for the debt due to such creditor obtaning
a preferenceThe old section related to intent to grant a
preference. All honourable senators who are
lawyers, and some.who are business men, will
recall that this questioù of intent bas involved

much litigation. Perhaps the litigation is about
finished, so it may be a good idea to have a

new word, for then we can start all over
again.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The question raised
was as to whose intent was referred to: the
intention of one party, the other party or
both parties. Mr. Reilley, in the wealth of

his experience, bas thought that "resulting" is
a better word. That matter also will have
to be considered in committee.
Section -69 takes some of the sting out of
the word "resulting", and must be read along
with section 68. It provides that where prior
to bankruptcy a transaction was made, and
a person secured property as an innocent
purchaser for value, without knowledge of
anything being wrong, he is not affected by
this provision in regard to fraudulent prefer-

ence.
The extension of reciprocal relations in
regard to enforcement of orders in all British
courts, should, it would seem, go. in as a
matter of course.
Honourable senators will be interested in
the simplification of the dividend distribution
scheme found in section 126. Mr. Reilley
shows in bis notes the weirdest number of

232

SENATE

preferences to be worked out. There are, for
instance, the Workman's Compensation Act,
the Income Tax Act and many other preferences; and nobody knows which one is
first, except that the tax people come first
if they can. This section provides an attempt
arbitrarily to fix seriatim each preferred rank
in relation to the others. The scheme is good;
the enumeration may or may not need
modification.
Another feature is the amplification of the
provisions relating to' bankruptcy offences
and the procedure thereon.
Hou. Mr. LEGER: Would the honourable
senator wish to tell about the constitutjonal
powers as far as that previous section is
concerned?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I feel that my honourable friend is not very serions in inviting
me into unknown fields at this time.
Other features are the application for discharge of debtors to be brought before the
court automatically within a specified time;
provision for summary administration of
estates with little or no assets, and the broadening of the functions of the superintendent.
Honourable senators will wish to look very
carefully into Mr. Reilley's proposals relating
to these matters. However, my dealings with
him have convinced me that he is very moderate in his demands. There is a proposaland I speak from memory, after having heard
a great deal in a short time-that the trustee
shall get his discharge from the superintendent rather than from the courts, as be does
at the present time. A combination of the
two may be desired. There is also a proposal for a broadening of the grounds of
appeal to an appeal court, and-if I may read
Mr. Reilley's words-for "the elimination of
innumerable repetitions of verbose phraseology." Those features will also have to be
dealt with wben the time comes.
That, honourable senators, is my understanding of this bill.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Very good.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I am sure that when
the bill receives second reading and goes to a
committee it will provide a fine field for work,
and I believe that we shall be able to present
to the government and the other house a constructive and worth while piece of legislation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, I do not intend to follow my honourable
friend in his remarks, but rather would point
out that this procedure is very unusual. This
bill was placed on our files only today, and I
Hun. Mr. FARRIS.

do not think any honourable senator has had
an opportunity to study it. We already have
a bankruptcy law in this country, and in
agreeing to the second reading of this bill we
are adopting no new principle. Further, as
the honourable gentleman has said, these proposals are open to consideration in committee.
I have had an opportunity of discussing this
bill with one or two people., and if there is
any attempt to embody in it the principles
underlying the Farmiers' Creditors Arrangement Act, which has been most unsatisfactory
it will require most careful scrutiny.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I appreciate the very
clear explanation given by the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris), and join with him in inviting the publie to note what the bill proposes, and in asking the business people of Canada to send
their representatives to Ottawa in order that
the committee may have the benefit of their
experience.

Every practising lawyer will agree that
bankruptcy proceedings have not been prevalent during the past fifteen or twenty years;
but the time may come again when they are
prevalent. I wish to congratulate the government on introducing this bill in the Seiate.
It is the first time that I have seen the government exercise real judgment in this respect.
We do not need to fear demands frolm creditors,
on the one hand, for more severe legislation,
or from debtors, on the other hand, for protective legislation. We can hew to the line and
produce a reasonable bill that I have no doubt
the other house will be only too glad to accent.
I am heartily in favour of sending this bill
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
At some stage the committee will probably
find it necessary to appoint a subcommittee,
and I suggest-not because I myself am a
lawyer-that this subcommittee ought to be
largely composed of legal members of this
house, so as to thrash out the probable effects
of the bill on actions and settlements; and
when the report is made back to the main
committee the whole question can be considered from the business standpoint. I have
not consulted anyone on this point, but I
think what I suggest would greatly facilitate
the work.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
WORK OF COMMITTEES

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
before the orders of the day are called I should
like to make a suggestion. The Order Paper
before us contains a great many divorce bills,
and some other items of more importance.
For instance, there is the Canada Day bill,
Order No. 54, on which I believe the honourable senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) desires to speak. In addition to these
items before the house, there is a great deal of
business before various oommittees. The
Committee on Iatural Resources has witnesses waiting whom it is anxious to hear;
the. Flag Committee has been called to meet
at four o'clock, and the Committee on Divorce
is in the midst of a contested case which will
probably continue for three or four hours. In
view of these circumstances, may I suggest
that immediately following the remarks of the
honourable senator from Vancouver South the
house adjourn in order to facilitate the work
of the committees?
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, the leader opposite
pointed out to me the very difficult position
of the committees.
After consulting the
honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) and the honourable senator
from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff), who had
intimated their desire to speak on the Canada
Day bill, I would now suggest that we might
hear the honourable senator from Vancouver
South this afternoon, and then , have the
honourable senator from Lunenburg adjourn
the debate so that he may have first opportunity to speak upon the bill when it comes
before us again.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thank you very muoh.

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. W. J. HARMER moved the second
reading of Bill B5, an Act to incorporate
Evangelical Churches of Pentecost.
He said: Honourable senators, the purpose
of this bill is to incorporate the Reverend
William John Ernest Baxter, of Vancouver,
Albert D. Marshall, of Heinsburg, Alberta,
and several other ministers and laymen into a
body to be known as Evangelical Churches of
The bill conforms closely to
Pentecost.
chapter 35 of the Statutes of 1943-44 which
incorporated a similar religious organization.
Section 3 of the bill provides that the head
office of the corporation shall be in the town
of Eston, Saskatchewan. - Honourable members will notice that the incorporators are,
with one exception, residents of the western
provinces, the one exception being a gentleman
who lives at Toronto, Ontario.
The organization is a very worthy one,
which I believe has done a great deal of
admirable work, both in urban and rural districts. In particular it has carried on highly
commendable missionary work in disseriînating Christian teachings in outlying sections.
I submit that because of the fine record of
this body, its petition for an act of incorporation should receive our support.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if this is an old evangelical organization?
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Yes, it is very old.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In Canada?
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Yes. It bas a temple
here in Ottawa, known as the Bethel Pentecostal Tabernacle.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Does the honourable
gentleman go there?
Hon. Mr. HARMER: No; I listen to ità
services over the radio. I believe the Bethel
Corporation of Ottawa is incorporated under
chapter 35 of the statutes of 1943-44.
The admirable objects of this proposed corporation are set forth in section 4 of the bill,
where it will be seen that they are sîmilar to
those of other religious organizations.
If the bill is given second reading, I will
move that it be referred to the Standing Comnmittee on Mîscellaneous Private Bis.

CANADA DAY BILL
MOTION

FOR

SECOND

READING-DEBÂTE

CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday, May

8, the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Foster for the -second reading of Bill 8,
an Act respecting Canada Day.
Hon. J. W. de B. FARRIS: Honourable
senators, 1 do not wish it to be understood
with reference to the arrangement this afternoon that I insisted on obtruding myself on
this occasion. I told the honourable leader
that I should be glad to discuss the bill at any
time hie set, and am doing so now in accordance with his working out of the arrangement.
This bill proposes to repeal the Dominion
Day Act of 1927. and in place of Dominion
Day to substitute "Canada Day", as the naine
of our national holiday. The original measure
was. fot enacted ini 1927, but in 1879, when it
was introduced in the Senate. It was passed
not only by this house, but also by the. House
of Commons, and ever since has been carried
in the Statutes of Canada and has been the
law of the land.
1 think it important to look baek to the
terms of that statute. It is rather interesting
to read the recitals, which appear in a footnote to page 1287 of the Commons. Hansard
of 1879. It says:
Whereas it was on the First day of July that
the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick became one Dominion under the naine
of Canada; and whereas Rupert's Land and the
Nor.th-Western Territories and the Province of
British Columbia became part of the Dominion
in the month of July-

235

0f course that is of another year.
-and Prince Edward Island became part of the
Dominion on the first of July; and whereas it
is expedient that auch important events should
bie commemorated; therefore Her Majesty, by
and wîth the advice and consent of the Senate
and House of Commons of Canada, enacts as
follows:
1. Throughout the Dominion of Canada in
each and every year, the first day of July, not
being a Sunday, shail be a legal holiday, and
shall be kept and observed as such, under the
namne of Dominion Day.
Those recitals make it clear that the namne of
this country was then, as now, Canada; they
also make it clear that while. the namne Canada
was retained as the name of this country, the
namne Dominion Day was chosen as commemorative of the fact that on that day the
three provinces, Canada, Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick, were joined in a union as one
dominion. That is a recital of an historical
fact.
If we turn to the British North America
Act we find the samie situation is recognizedt
In section 3, under the heading of Union, it is
declared that:
-the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick shall form and be One Dominion
under the Naine of Canada, and on and after
that DayThat is the date of proclamation, which
now 's July
1.'
-those Three Provinces shail form and be One
Dominion under that Naine accordingly.
If we turn to the debates in this Chamber
in the year 1879 we find 'that Dr. Carrail, the
senator, I believe, from. British Columbia,
introduced -the bill, the preamble of wbich
I have read. He expressed his senae of the
honour accorded him of introducing a bill
consecrating the day of the bix'th of the
dominion. H1e further said:
If you reflect upon it, yýou will coins to the
conclusion that the time may arrive when this
half of the continent may become a separate
nation. I hope that day may be f ar distant,
but 1 think we should fix upon saine national
holiday, and educate the rising generation to
revere the flag under which we live. If we turn
to history, which bas its roots in the past, f ar
f ar. away, we find that every country bas its
national holiday.
If honourable members are initerested in
reading the then, currenit debates in both
houses, they will find there never was any
question about the propriety of our naitional
day being named. Dominion Day. In thoee
days, when ideas were somewhat different
about- holidays from what they are now,
there was some question a to, whether sny
more holidays were needed, but nonie whsitever s to the terra used to describe whaît was
then, and is now, a historical fact-that Con,.

federation under the British Nortii America
Act did join us in a union as one dominion.

236

SENATE

The bill before us proposes to change the
name of the day set apart for the commemoration of that event. The question is, therefore: Shall we in Parliament revoke that
consecration which nearly seventy years ago
was initiated in this Chamber, and shall we
start the process of re-educating our children
in the idea that there is something wrong
with that first consecration which has endured all these years? The test lof time has
shown the fitness of that name; it bas shown
beyond question its historical significance, as
set forth in the recitals I have just read. So
far as I know the name has never been in
question until a little over a month ago,
when something happened in another place.
For my part, I behieve the burden of proof
rests very heavily on those who seek to make
a change at this time.
Speaking for myself-and I ask honourable
senators to pardon some personal references,
because I think in a speech of this kind they
are quite proper here-speaking for myself
as a Canadian born just one year before the
original statute was passed, I find the reasons
suggested for this change rather disturbing.
You know, names are personal things; in their
nature they carry with them a sentiment,
and they are not changed except for very
strong reasons. We know that the name of the
capital of Russia was changed from St.
Petersburg to Leningrad. Why? Because a
new political power had come into existence
in Russia. St. Petersburg was named after
Peter the Great, and the new political power
wanted to repudiate the old regime. There
was no mistake about the intention of the
Communists; and, granting their viewpoint,
there was nothing wrong in their substitution
of the new name for the old one. There is
no sentiment of that kind in this country
today. A man sometimes changes his name
in spite of sentiment, but it is nearly always
because the person himself or one of his
ancestors has brought that name into disgrace
or disrepute. Nothing of the kind can be
associated with the word that has marked a
historical event that we have celebrated over
all these years.
May I dwell briefly on this personal aspect
that names and memories are always associated.
The name of our national holiday has been
associated with my earliest memories, and if
in this rather casual way that name were
tossed out the window and another one substituted for it, I should feel that something
had been torn up by the roots.
The word "dominion" was selected, not as
the name of a country but as a descriptive
term, by a great Canadian and a very disHon. Mr. FARRIS.

-

tinguished New Brunswicker, Sir Leonard
Tilley. It has been authoritatively stated by
his son, the former Premier of New Brunswick,
that Sir Leonard got the inspiration for the
tern "dominion" from the 72nd Psalm, the 8th
verse, which reads:
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea,
and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
If I rnay be permitted to continue this
personal reference to memories associated with
our holiday, I would call to mind another
New Brunswicker who had something to do
with the affairs of this country, both before
and after confederation.
My grandfather,
John Farris, was a member of the legislature
of his native province for fifteen years, up to
confederation, and was member of the House
of Commons for the county of Queens, New
Brunswick, from 1867 to 1878, when he retired
because of advancing years and ill health. He
was succeeded by George King, the father of
His Honour the Speaker. These men played
their parts in the happenings of those days,
and my memories of them are very dear to
me. I am sure other honourable senators here
have recollections and sentiments of the same
kind.
My honourable friend from Saint John
(Hon. Mr. Foster) has said that the Maritime
Provinces were net as enthusiastic about these
matters as they might have been. That is
undoubtedly true. But the lack of enthusiasm
was not caused by the fact that we were a
dominion, or that we continued to be associated with the British Crown-as we were at
that time-but rather by worry on the part
of the maritimes about being tied up to
Quebec and Ontario.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That must have been
hard.

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In reading later debates we find that British Columbia did not
like the idea of uniting with the other provinces, because the terms of confederation for
some years were not carried out. But the
historical fact is that at the time of our birth we
were born into a dominion, and one cannot
find in the records a single question of that
fact. So for my part I do not intend to be a
party to repudiating what our fathers did;
neither do I wish to disrupt the continuity of
. history, unless the reasons are definite, urgent
and very convincing.
Now may we look at the reasons given for
the suggested change? I have gathered these
reasons from the newspapers I have read and
the comments I have heard in various places.
One is that the name of our country is
Canada, and that therefore we should celebrate "Canada Day." Several answers may be

MAY 14, 1946
made to such a suggestion; but as I have
already shown, there neyer bas been a question about the name of this country. It was
named the Dominion of Canada at confederation-a fact perfectly consistent with
the name of our national holiday-and bas
continued-to be as. cailed to this day. The
name was put in our constitution in 1867 for
the reasons I have given, and it was donc
reverentiy. .It
is stili there, honourabie
senators; and it was consecrated in this
ebamber in 1879. Since that time we have
grown, and with cvery passing year the celebration of Dominion Day bas meant more
to us.
It sccms to me the question we now bave
to face is this: Are we ashamed of the ladder
by which we have climbed? The suggestion
is made that the name of the national holiday
must bie that of the country. I do not know
of any people more discriminatory about
their- country-and with good reason-than
the people of the United States of America.
Howcver, the 4th of July is nlot named
,United States Day or America Day. It is
Independence Day. The historical fact, if I
may repeat it, is that confederation was not
the origin of the name Canada; but it did
originate the descriptive term, "dominion". 1
would point out that the name Canada bas
existcd in this country since more than tbrce
hundrcd ycars before confederation. In 1536
wher- Jacques Cartier saiied up the St.
Lawrence river and reached the Isle of
Orleans the Indians told him the name of the
country was Canada, and that in the Huron
and Iroquois languages Canada meant a
village or a collection of huts.
The name Canada continued throughout
the French regime, and in 1840 by the termas
of the Act of Union, Upper and Lower
Canada were united under the name of
Canada. So I 'repeat, gentlemen, that al
confederation did was to continue that name.
To -me thlis situation às -not one that caîls
for any apology. The declarationi of this
couStry as a domintion is part of our glorious
history, and I and many others, 1 believe,
are proud to celebrate Dominion Day because
%as
our national holiday it la .the annivcrsary
of the union of theovincesof NewBrun&wick, Nova Scotia, and Upper and Lower
Canada, into one dominion.
The second reason givenr for the suggcatcd
change of name is that other countrica wilýl
then underatand that we are an independent
nation. Particular reference is mande in this
argument to thé Amýericans, and the fact that
there are stili in that 'country a number of
people who realiy think we are taxed by and
pay tribute to England. I know many very

237

fine and educated American.s who share no
such 'tbought or sentiment, and.it la liard for
me to take that kind of oriticism seriously.
It is truc that ,there are ignorant people in
the United States; but it is not so long
since a census in Canada sliowc thet there
were màny people wbo could not tell the
difference beitween Liberals and C>oinservatives. If we are to ýtake seriousiy this ignor-.
ance on the part of sorne people in the United
States, the question then eonfronting us is:
Must we forsake our traditions in order to
appease the ignorance of our ýneýighbours?
Somre Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If it may not be regarded as frivolous in what I hope is a serious
speech, may I cite 'the &tory of a stranger who
went into a smail American town in the
middle west aone years ago, and was, surprised to see a niumber of workmoen, moving a
church.
The sheriff, wearing bis typical
hroad-brimmed bat was eupervising the movmng. The strange-r weînt up to him and asked,
"What is this abo>ut?" The man Tepiied: I
this town we have an ordinance pToviding
that no saloon shbaîl be within two hundred
yards of a churcli, and I have just given this
congregation twenty-four hours to move tbeir
echurch." Honourable senetors, if this kind
of argument were to prewaii, I slvould expect
sometirne to see a bill brought in to provide
,the "Lieutenant-Governors" of our provinces
be referred to in speech as "LootenantGovernors," s0 that our neiglibours to the
south miglit uriderstand us botter. I think
the best answer to that kind of sentiment is
to be found in these lines:
To thine own self be truc,
And it must foliow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be f aise to any man.
The third argument to wbich I objeet is
that our national holiday should be called
"Canada Day" because we are now a nation.
Weil, honourable senators, if it is the fact
of our becoming a nation that we want to
celebrate, it scems to me that we have chosen
the wrong date altogether..- Canada did net
become a nation by virtue of confederation
on the first day of Juiy 1867. If we want to
celebrate the achievement of nationhood, let
us select that day in 1926 when the Balfour
resolution, passcd at the Imperial Conference,
deciared the statua of the great nations making Up the British commonwealth.
Or there
miglit lic a preference for that day in 1931
when the Statute of Westminster was passed.
If it is not the bcginning but the compietion
of nationhood which we want to mark by a
national celebration, we should select that
day, and not tamper with history to make a
misfit choice.

238

SENATE

I think that those who argue for the change
of name on this ground have altogether the
wrong idea. 'Canada was not born a fullfledged nation; it has been by the course of a
gradual and peaceful progress of events that
she has grôwn into the nation she now is.
Our national day celebrates the beginning of
our nationhood, not the time of actual achievement. To bring home the point I am trying
to emphasize, I will make a contrast between
the first of July in Canada and the fourth
of July in the United States. The fourth of
July is called Independence Day in the United
States and represents to.Americans-I emphasize that, for I do not say that we agree with
them-it represents to Americans the birth
of a nation, conceived in rebellion, born in
bloodshed and established by victory in battle
against the Motherland. The Declaration of
Independence, as written by Jefferson, was in
effect a declaration of war. The conclusion
of that war resulted all at once in the achievement of a full-fledged nation. But Canada
has no such historical background. We can
thank God that we have never needed a
Declaration of Independence. We have never
felt the heel of the oppressor, and our reasonable demands and requests have never been
refused. By friendly co-operation in the empire, and later in the British Commonwealth
of Nations, Canada has achieved all the freedom and liberty, both national and individual,
that the United States achieved by rebellion
and bloodshed. That, I think, makes the
contrast that I want to emphasize.
In one of his speeches contained in a book
which is to be found in the Parliamentary
Library, Sir Wilfrid Laurier quoted these
lines of Tennyson:
A land of settled government,
A land of just and old renown.
Where freedom broadens slowly down
From precedent to precedent.
That, together with other remarks that I have
made, is a reply to some of the comments
made by my honourable friend from Saint
John (Hon. Mr. Foster). A day commemorating the statute formulated at the Quebec
Conference and passed almost without alteration by the Imperial Parliament can never be
expected to stir the emotions and cause the
blood to circulate in the same way as would
a day commemorating victory in battle after
a rebellion. But to those who give sober
thought to the matter, the great significance
of what we have accomplished over the years
should be a ground for genuine emotion
equal at least to that felt by our American
friends on the fourth of July.
I repeat that Dominion Day does not celebrate the birth of a nation born full grown.
It does celebrate the day when was laid the
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

corner-stone of that union on which a nation
has been steadily and grandly built. And
I can see no reason why in our celebrations
we should seek to glorify ourselves by a
denial of the fact that we are what we are
because of what we have been.
I come now to my fourth objection. It is
asserted that the word "dominion" carries
with it the meaning that'we are inferior to or
dominated by some outside power in some
way dérogatory to our present position as an
independent nation within the British commonwealth. Well, honourable senators, when
Sir Leonard Tilley quoted to his colleagues
the 8th verse of the 72nd Psalm, there was
no such idea in his mind. I think that if he
were here today lie might also quote to us
the 13th verse of the 145th Psalm:
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and
Thy dominion endureth throughout all genera-

tions.
It is truc that in 1867 Canada was a colony,
but it is equally true that there was no
pretence that confederation would change
that fact, for at that time the people of this
country were not ripe for a change and did
not desire one. Today, though, Canada is a
vastly different country from what it was in
1867.
We have never been held back because our
country has been described as a dominion.
Our achievements to which reference has been
made in other places all serve to emphasize
the fact that our development as a nation has
proceeded side by side with the development
of Dominion Day as our national holiday.
The meaning of both these terms has changed.
As I said, Canada is a very different Canada
from that of 1867. Canada is a very different
Canada from what it was in 1565. I sometimes wonder how any Canadians-not in
this chamber-that sometimes have visions of
grandeur could ever tolerate the word
"Canada." Why, if they only stopped to
think, this word means a collection of huts
-and Indian huts at that! The word dominion has changed in its significance, its deeper
and inner meaning, just as the word Canada
has changed by the passing of time and by
development and growth.
In the first place, the word "dominion" is
now associated with a description of all the
nations within the British commonwealth of
nations, except Great Britain herself. That is
an association not to be regarded as derogatory, but to be proud of. We are proud of our
association and the designation which marks
that association. The idea that the term
dominion is associated with the domination of
the British King is as antiquated as is the
idea that Canada is a collection of huts. Why,

MAY 14, 1946
it seems to me only the other day that His
Majesty .sat on the Throne in this Chamber,
and there was not an Englishman or a Scotchman in sight.-unless he was up in the gallery.
It was the King of Canada surrounded by
his advisers, the Ministers of the Parliament
of Canada, representing the people of Canada.
It is true today that Canada has a King, but
the meaning of the word hai changed with
constitutional developments.
His Majesty
is a constitutional monarch under responsible
government. I looked up Dicey on .the British
Constitution. I have the book on my desk.
At page 432 he refers to "the ultimate
supremacy of the true political sovereign-the
electoral body." In other words, under our
form of constitutional government today, the
rulers of Canada are the people who elect
their representatives. Now, if that is true, if
there is any idea of domination in the word
dominion, it can only mean that we today as
Canadians have domination over ourselves;
and that the scriptures may be fulfilled, it
may be said, literally and reverently: We shall
have dominion also from sea to sea, and from
the river unto the ends of the earth.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is the full significance of the word "dominion" in this country today. It is the dominion that we, the
people of Canada, have over this great union
which began in 1867.
There is another reason, an unspoken reason
-I am sure it does nnt apply to any honourable member of this chamber, but I get a
whisper of it in some quarters-a desire to
tear away every last vestige of our historical
association with Great Britain. I do not
believe that any honourable senator has any
feelings of this kind or any sympathy with
arguments founded on any such desire. We
are proud of our past position in the British
Empire. .We are proud of our present position as an independent nation within the
British Commonwealth of Nations.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: We look forward to
the future in the confident belief that this
great family of nations will long endure as
the world's best guarantee of peace, and the
greatest assurance of our own progress and
security.
I sincerely hope, honourable members, that
the Senate will kill this bill. There are no
sound reasons for its support. The Parliament of Canada in my submission-and I
make it only from my sense of Canadianism
-should not attempt to change history or seek
to deny the occasion of our birth as- a
dominion. We have faith in the present; we

have confidence in the future; let us not
turn our backs on our past or forget that
we are what we are today because of what we
have been in our past. To deny Dominion
Day is, to me, to deny our past. To hold
fast to our great institutions is our best guarantee that our house is built on a rock strong
and enduring.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Haydçn)
explained this bill on second reading, and is
familiar with the amendment made by the
other house. I am desirous of having the
amendment considered while he is here, so
that he may explain it also.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, at the time we passed the bill, the
department was seeking to say that associations incorporated before 1912 should not be
permitted to conduct running races unless
their charters contained specific permission

so to do.
were in existence a number of associations
whose charters permitted them to hold trotting and pacing races and to operate driving
parks, and it was desired to prevent such
associations from conducting running races.
Later it was found that but one association
had such a charter, and that for some years
this association had been conducting running
races.
It was felt that it would be unfair to single
out this one association and by this amendment prohibit it from doing what it has been
doing for a number of years. This bill does
not affect associations incorporated after 1912,
for each of them had to be specifically incorporated either by an act of the Parliament of
Canada or an act of one of the legislatures.
Except for this amendment, the other house
adopted the bill in the form in which it was
passed here.

PRIVATE SECRETARY TO THE
LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION
REPORT OF INTERNAL ECONOMY COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. WHITE presented and moved
concurrence in the sixth report of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy and
Contingent Accounts, as follows:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

The Committee recommend the appointment
of a private secretary to the Leader of the
Opposition in the Senate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure, honourable senators to concur in the
report?
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators I should like to add a
word of explanation in connection with this
report. As a member of the government, I
am entitled to the services of a secretary, and
to secure them all I have to do is to make
the necessary representations to the Treasury
Board. The leader of the opposition is in no
such position; he can be provided with a
secretary only on resolution of the Senate.
This matter was çonsidered by the Internal
Economy Committee, and the report contains
their decision.
Apart altogether from the responsibility that
rests on me and on those who have been kind
enough to assist me, bearing in mind the
growth in the volume of government business
which is being initiated in this house-a growth
which we hope will continue-I realize my
need for secretarial help. But similar help is
needed equally, perbaps more so, by the
leader 'of the opposition, for not only does
he discharge the onerous duties of his office
as leader, but is most faithful in his attendance on committees, particularly the Committee on Divorce. Almost every day I fear
that the honourable leader opposite will tell
me that his responsibilities are such that he
cannot continue to carry them all. I should
be placed in a very difficult position if that
were to happen, and I think we would be
well advised to give favourable consideration
to the report of the Internal Economy
Committee.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, is it your pleasure to concur in the
motion?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. G. G. McGEER: Honourable senators,
I think all of us appreciate the work the
leader opposite has to do and fully agree
with the recommendation of the Internal
Economy Committee that he be provided with
a secretary. Before the report is adopted,
however, I should like to refer to certain
matters that are relevant to the subject under
discussion. One of these is the question of
secretarial assistance for senators at large. If
the Senate is to carry on the program indicated by the committees already in operation
this session, the secretarial set-up must be
greatly improved.

MAY 15, 1946
The poorest kind of economy that can be
practised ini any organization is that which
reduces to sub-standard any office carrying
on the work of the organization. For the
entire membership of the Senate there are
now provided a total of, I think, nine
stenographers. Some senators whose offices
are Iocated near Ottawa have the advantage
of their own staffs; but those who corne from
the Pacifie and the Atlantic coasts, or from
the prairie provinces, are completely eut off
from their office organizations.
I think the time bas corne when, in the
government of Canada, the Senate should do,
and will have to do, much more of the detail
work than it did during the war years or
even in the years preceding the war.
Whether we like it or flot, the Dominion
Government will be compelled to deal more
and more with the day-to-day problems of
not only the provinces, but the cities, the
corporations and the people in general. The
quantum of administration now carried on by
order-in-council and by officialdom is developing into a very wide and powerful bureaucracy
of a type which we caiinot allow in the democracy we are building.
May I refer to one matter which to my
mind is manif estly and strikingly a responsibility of the Senate? When dominion
representatives are unable to agree with
representatives of our provinces and our
cities, or when the two great factions within
our confederation fail to agree on how the
people shall he taxed or how the local affairs
of the provinces and cities shall be carried
on, the responsibility of stepping in and
acting as arbitrator falis on the Senate of
Canada. It should act as a mediator betweeii
the dominion and provincial authorities, to
prevent a deadlock such as has been continuing ever since the Sirois Report was first
under consideration, a period of five years.
I ask how many honourable senators, with
the secretarial assistance furnished them, are
able to sit down and deal with the Sirois
report, the Duncan report, the White Commission report or other documenta w.hich gre
involved in the most important issue wbich we
have had to deal with since confederation,
namely that of working out a basis of taxation
that will be just to the people of Canada and
equitable as between the dominion and the
provincial or civil authorities? I suggest that
in endorsing this rnost necessary assistance to
the leader opposite, we should also take -cognizance of the necessity of seeing to it that
the leader of the government in this bousewbose responsibilities are in my humble
opinion as great as those of any minister of,
the Crown-is recôgnized as something more
63268-17J

241

than. a mere minister without portfolio -and
without office whose position, by reason of hlis
having to carry on his work with only the
assistance of a secretary, is reduced to absurdity
and ridioulousness.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The leader of the
governiment in the Senate should have the
assistance of not only a secretary, but a
thoroughly competent staff.
In the United States the responsibilities of
modern democracy are recognized. Members
of the House of Representatives or of tbe
Senate are regarded as men w'ho are carrying
on work of an involved and difficult character,
and they are given the assistance that they
require. This is not so in Canada, and any
member of the Senate of Canada or of the
House of Commons who is performing bis
duties fully and properly-and this would
certainly apply to our two leaders-cannot
possibly meet the demands made upon hii if
hie is required to do the detail work bimself.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, 1 should like to associate myself
wi'th the remarks of the honourable senator
who sits just behind me (Hon. Mr. McGeer).
I hope that ail the support of bis proposai wilI
flot come from this ènd of the chamber-the
uttermost end of the earth-but that we will.
bear from our colleagues generally.
One thought that occurs to me is this: IE.
the supplying of a secretary to the leaderopposite wiIl mhake bim more efficient t-han liebas been in the past, perhaps we should!
consider the matter twice before doing
anything.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The very fact that
we are giving him a secretary in order to
increase bis efficiency carnies with it at least
a suggestion that the same kind of service be
given to aîl senators. I have not the slightest
criticism to offer of the very courteous and
belpful young women who form our secretarial staff, and do their best to assist us.
However, there is a very great difference
between having a stenographer from a pool,
wbo -comes in and takes a few notes and types
them, and baving a secretary who, in addition
to typing, answers the telephone and pcrforms
innumerable other duties in the office and
generally assists ber employer.
That is the kind of assistance which every
senator who desires it should receive. I
receive it, but I pay for it myself. A number
of other senators have found it necessary to

SENATE
keep their secretaries bere. Lt scems to me that
senators sbould nlot be burdened with the
expense of secretarial assistance, but that every
one who requires that service should be
allowed to have it upen requisition. It is the
poorest economy to ask a senator, who should
be doing better work, to make trips to the
post office for bis mail and attend to a
thousand other details which coold be looked
after by a secretary. 1 think the time for
extreme economy on the part of members of
this bouse bas gone by, and that we sbould
have the courage to furnisli ourselves with the
assistance we require in order to properly
carry eut our duties.
sure
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 ar n ft
whether 1 hcard the bonourable senator from
Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. MeGeer) correctly, but I thought lie said there were nine
stenegraphers available for senators. 1 may
say, for the record, that tlie Clerk advises me
tiiere are ninetcen, of wboiîn four are s
i
fiea-lly assigncd: one to the Speaker, one to
the government leader, one to the leader opposite and one to the translstors.
Il amn not in any way disagreeing witb the
rgeneral tbought that has been advanced, for
I feel there is probsbly mucb. room for
improvement. Under our set-up any change

tommittec, and I should ba glad te suggest
to the very capable chairman of that com.mittee Mion. Mr. White) that perhaps there
wii be an early opportunity for further consýidcration of tbc opinions that bave been
expressed.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
last ýession the Internai Economy Committee
g2tve favourable consideration to a proposaI
that our stenographic staff be increased, and
it was decidcd that at the bcginning of this
session it sbould be increased by 50 par cent.
We are in the unfortunste position, however,
of being unable to get the full numbar of
stenographers desired. This mornmng I discussed the mattar with the Clark, wbo
infermed me that this is still tbe situation.
I arn sure thec committea is eager to serve
honourable mcmbers of the Senate as far as
possible along the lina suggested this afternon provided the necessary employees can
bý' obtsined.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I tbink it sbould ba stated tbat for the
last few~ years, and probably prier to tbat, the
policy of the Senste bas beau to econorniza
as rnuch as possible. Tbat is a very laudable

frem the Housa of Commons I was surprisad
to find that the maximum allowed for a

stanographer was $4 a day during the session
and $3a a day during the recess. Tbose rates
were continued for some time, and tban were
increased to $5 and $4, respectively, tha
present scale. I migbit add that very few
stenographers are retained on the staff during
the receas.
The salary of $5 a day is not adequste at
tbis tirne. In the House of Cemmons quite
a few stenographers with secretarial ability
are paid at a daily rate of $6.50. and some
receive in addition a secietarial allowance of
$50 a menth. Wben I was Deputy Speaker
of that bouse I bsd an excellent secretary,
wbo was paid $6.50 a day, pîus an annual
allewance of $600. Upon my promotion te
the Speakership of the Senate I was not a
little aniazcd to lcarn that the rules of the
Senate precluded bis being paid more than
$5 a day, together witb the allowance of $600
a year.
He found something better, of
course, and left me, rnucb to my regret and
bis own. He was wortb at lesst $10 a day, a
sum w-bich I know bas been paid to others
who were nlot so competent.
I have hsad somne experience in publie life,
wbicli I entcred in 1917. To my knowledge
the pay of the clerical staff in the House of
Commens bas been increased from time to
finie. At least 132 stenographers, perhaps a
faw more, are employed to assist bonourable
members of tbat bouse, wheraas our staff
numbers 19. I realize that, as xwas just stated
by the Chairman of the Committe on Internal Economy, we have lbad difficulty in
finding stenographers. If the other bouse can
get 132, but we are unable to get 19, there
is sometbing wrong.
I am familiar with conditions in Montreal.
Quebec and Ottawa, and I would point eut
that in law offices and other places where
we used to pay a stenographer from $20 to
$25 a wcek. we are now paying $30, $35, $40

agree with the bonourable gentleman frons
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
The pers.oos sclected te disebarge the important ftinctions of senators have usually
enjeyed a reasonable degrea of success in
their vocations and walks of life. It is net
expected that wben a man is appointed to the

I.would suggest to the chairman of the Internai. Economy Committee that if we cannot
get efficient clerical assistance at $5 a day, we
rnust try to get it at $6; and if it is not available at $6, we rnight try to get it at $7 a day.
This is the practice elsewhere.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.

ANNUAL

REPORTS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. E. FOSTER: Honourable senators,
rnay I be permitted at this tirne to refer to a
dispatch in a' Montreal paper of yesterday,
report-ing that the annual estiMates of revenues
and expenditures of the Canadian National
Raihways had just heen tabhed in the House
of Coxnmons. I inquired at the Distribution
Office today but could not obtain a copy oi
those documents. I would ask the leader of
the government to ascertain whether it will
be possible for this house to'be furnished with
the same information as is tabhed in the other

place. During the session we are called upon
to approve, by way of legislation, of capital
expenditures of the Canadian National Railways Systern. In the past we have had te
authorize borrowings to meet deficits. Wc can
only hope that the revenues will continue te
increase to an extent sufficient to offset
încreased operating costs.
I think we should be placed in the same
position in regard to the annual budget of
Trans-Canada Airlines. Last session when a
bill was before us to incresse the capitalization to sorne $25,000,000 the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) stated he
intended to scrutinizc very carefully the
accounts of the company.
Estimates of the ;proposed expenditures of
these two large publicly owned and operated
corporations should be available to members
of this bouse.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shaîl endeavour
to get the information for the honourable
senator.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Is the annual report
of the Canadian National Raihways referred
to the Senate committec on railways as a
matter of course?
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I arn not refcrring top
the annual report, which has been tabled in
this bouse. 1 arn referring to the budget of
estirnated revenues and expenditures for 1947.

Hon. WILLIAM DUFF: Honourable senators, after listening to the excellent address
delivcred yesterday by the senator from
Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) I feel
rather modest, and if 1 arn to follow in his
footsteps I must proceed carefulhy. I was
delighted to hear the honourable senator
quote two passages of seripture because one
can always go to the Bible for inspiration. In
discussing this bill this afternoon honourable
senators will pardon me if I refer to another

passage in this Book of books. The twentysecond chapter of Proverbs at verse 28, reads
as follows:
Remove flot the ancient landmark, which thy
fathers have set.
Though this Book was published thousands
of years ago one can always go to it on
important matters and find something propbietic and appropriate to the occasion.
Honourable senators will agree that we are
living in strenunous times. At the conclusion
of the war a year ago we hoped that conditions would get better, so that i'n the interest
of our couîntry we could devote our eneugies
to legisiation and to business matters, and
mighit start to rebuild the edifice which had
been partly shatteued by the terrible holocauî;t of war. If I appear critical, 1 shaîl
aenpt to give remsous for ni' view. It seems
to mie tlîat in dealing with this bill we
tire wasting time teauing down one of the old
landmarks of Canada.

Following the preamble,

Througbiout the Dominion of Canada, in eachi

a Sunday, shall be a legal holiday, anti shall be

Wlien the first day of July is a Sunday, the
second day of July shaîl be, in lieu thereo f,
throughout the Dominion, a legal holiday, and
shall ho kept and observed as such under the

I think lionourable senators will agree that
thce tatcîle i,. qcîite chear. A gond deal of consicleration nos given to it hefore it became
law.
lIon.

MIr. DUI I.

Bill 8, which is now before us, proposes to
repeal chapter 49 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada, 1927. The second clause of this act
reads:
Throughout Canada, in each and every year,
the first day of July, not being a Sunday, shaîl
be a legal holiday, and shaîl bc kept and ohserved as such, under the namne of Dominion Day.
Now I cannot see why it was necessary for
the legislators of the day-and since 1 was
here myseîf, perhaps I should take some
responsibility for it-to pass the act to which
I have just referred. It is a repetition of tbe
language used in the act of 1879.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: It is the same act.
Hon. Mu. DUFF: I amrn ot of the legal
turn of mind, but I wondeu why it was nocessary to pass the later act. My young frîend
fuom Matapedia-Matane wbo sits in the
other cliamber, now presents a bill to ropeal
the act of 1927, but hie does not seek to repeal
the act of 1879. If bie seeks to change tbe
name of Dominion Day to "Canada Day"
by ropealing the act of 1927, is it not nocessauy to ask fou tbe repeal of tbe 1879 nct?
Should we in our judgmcnt decide to pass
Bill 8, the act of 1879 will stili be on the
statute books',
bccause it lias net been
repealed. So, honourable gentlemen, if my
argument is fair, we shoîîld not be asked to
deal with this matter at aIl.
Howeveu tbis bouse is faced with the fact
tliot tIhe bill lias beeri senl from the otlier
place, nliere, for somne reason or otîcer, 123
of tbe 245 menîbers voted in its favour.
Hon. Mu. MeGEER: Thîey dIo not appeau
to bc in a lîîrry about any otîcer'business.
Hon. Mu. DUFF: I quite aguce.
The uînsettled conditions in Canada today
are ueason enotîgh, in my opinion, to have
carised the mcmbeus in another place to refrain
from rusbing this bill thîuoughi and sending it
here to bcecither conccîrred in ou tbrown out.
However, we mnust deal witbi things as we
flnd tbc'm.
I arn one of tîcose who have bcen bonouued
wîth a seat in tbis ebamber, and who by reason
of circumslances are unpuejudiced. I was 1101
born in Ibis country. In my first eloction campaign my opponent took ton minutes to tell
wbere hie was boun, and where bis fatber and
guandfathcu were born. He did not mention
me, but eveuyone knew wîcat hoe was duiving
at. After hie was through speaking 1 rose and
complimentod him on bis predecessors and on
the biuthplace of bis father and guandfathier,
and concluded by saying: "I came into this
country fuhhv clolhed and in my righl mind;
my friend came in naked and' uinashamed.
Some Hlon. SENATORS:

Oh, oh!

MAY 15, 194624
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Many konourable members are better qualified than I to speak on
this important subject, but coming ta Canada
as 1 did a grown man-and now thankful not
only to the people of Canada but ta the
country itsclf for what it bas dons for meperhaps 1 arn in as good a position as anyane
to speak with regard ta the proposaI ta change
the name of Dominion Day ta Canada Day.
Not only are many editorials an this question appearing in newspapers acrass Canada,
but na doubt many honourable senatars are
getting letters, as 1 am, from people ai over
the dominion who are concerncd about this
important subject. I learn from the carrespondence 1 receive and the editorials 1 read that
very few people in Canada desire this proposed change. Personally 1 can see no reason
for change. For instance, as my honourable
friend frorn Vancouver South said yestcrday,
in the United States of America the 4th of
July is known as Independence Day, not
United States of America Day. The national
holiday in France is called Bastille Day; and
in other countries of the world the national
holiday docs not bear the narme of the
country concerned.
I arn not a pessimist; I do nat go around
corners looking for trouble, but ta my mind
there is one very important reasan why we
should not accept this bill. I arn proud of my
adopted country, and wbile, unlike some
others, I cannot sing, I should like ta quote
these words:
Breathes there a man with soul sa dead,
Who neyer ta himself hath said,
This ie my own, may native land!
As an adopted son of Canada, honourable
senators will agree that I arn not orily entitled ta ahl the privileges of a Canadian
citizen, but I arn entitled ta appreciate the
privileges I have received since becoming a
citizen of this great country, which extends,
ta use the words of the 72nd Psalm, "from
sea. ta sea, and from the river unta the ends
of the earth."
There are a certain number of people in
this country with an inferiority complex
wha from tirne ta time, because they happen
ta have been born here, .prétend ta enjoy
certain rights that others do not have. I say
that the people of every race who live in this
cosmopohitan country of Canada are entitled
ta the saine privileges and rights as are those
wha were baru here. I arn nat gôing back
on my own nativity. Lice Sir Cavendish
Boyle, that great Irishman, who wrote the
National Ode of Newfaundland, I can say:
When sun rays crown thy pine-clad hilîs,
And Summer spreads hier hand,
When silvern voices tune thy rilis,
We love thee, smiling ]and.

When blinding storm-gusts fret thy shore,
And wild waves lash thy strand;
Through spindrif t, swirl. and tempest roar
Welove thee, wind-swept land.
When spreads thy cloak of shimmering white
At winter's steru command;
Through shortened day and tar-light night
We love thee, f rozen land.
As loved our f athers so we love,
Where once they stood, we stand;
Their prayer we raise to Hleaven above;
God guard thee, Newfoundland.
I came from N.ewfoundland, and arn proud
of it, but though 1 was born there I arn now
a citizen of this great country Canada. 1
raised my family here, my grandchildren were
born here, and like myseif they are ail goad
Canadians.
There is stili another important reason
why we should not change the name of
Dominion Day to "Canada Day." During the
last six rnanths, per-haps for the last year,
we have observed that things are nlot running
as smoothly as they should in the international world, of which wc are a part.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Nor in the Canadian
world.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I arn coming ta that point,
I shal try to show that Canada belongs to
the world; and that although we are a
dominion within the British commonwealth
we are part of a greater community which
must keep the peace in the future. Every day
a good many people in this country, and perhaps in mast other countries, rcad the newspapers or listen to the radio in order to flnd
out what is happening at conferences of the
Big Four or the United Nations or some other
organizatian, and our hearts are saddened
by the ncws. We have noticed that in every
élection held in Europe within the last
twelve months a certain faction has endeavoured to aplit the population and split
the vote. The same kind of thing is going
on in the United Nations Organizatiôn today. There is no doubt that a certain
country-I do not mind speaking plainly
and saying that I mean Russiaý-is trying to
put up a great big bluff in order to get bier
own way. If she did get lier own way she
would practically rule the world, and I say
that it is the duty of us as Canadians to
watch and see that, so far as we can prevent
it, that does not happen.
The abject of this bill is to have tlw naine
"Dominion Day" changcd to "Canada Day."
Last session and this session there bas been a
joint committee of bath houses considering a
design for a distinctive Canadian flag. What
docs it ail mean? I know thcre are some hion-:

own. I say te them and to the people of this
country that if I thought for one moment that
there would be peace for the next fifty or one
hundred years I would change my views with
regard to this flag question. But I can sec a
small, dark cloud that is gradually becoming
bigger and bigger, and I say that if certain
things being done in this country and other
countries should happen to have the effect of
dividing the United States of America and the
British Commonwealth of Nations,' Canada
will be a communistie country within the next
forty years.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Or before that.
Hýon. Mr. DUFE: Or before that. I say
that this bill to change 'Dominion Day" to
"Canada Day" is just the thin edge of the
wedge which some of the people who support
the bili-not ail of them, but people with communistic ideas--think would help to separate
Canada froma the British Commonwealth of
nations. The severing of our ties with the Old
Country and with Australia, New Zcaland and
South Africa, would weaken not only the
empire itself but the empire's relations with
the United States. W~e had hetter be very
careful and watchi where we are geing before
we adopt a bill of tbis kind or any proposed
national flag. I submait to voit, honourable
senators, that the only hiope for the salvation
of thi,, world lies lu some kind of unity hetween
thec people of the, United States and the people
of the Britishi uuîiîonw ealth, of which we are
part. Let us do nothiag to interfere with the
good relations between those two great powers.
Let there be no backsliding here. Let us not
give Russia or any other country a chance to
impose upon us doctrines that are centrary to
everything we hold dear.
H on. JOHN T. HAIG: Honeurable senators, I want to congratulate the honourable
senator from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Farris) on the care that he obviously took in
the preparation of the address he delivered
yesterday. I do not intend to travel over
any of the ground covered by him or by the
honourable gentleman fromt Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duff).I simply cannot understand why this bill
was ever introduced-and no one has ever
been able to help me on this point. I listened
to or read nearly everything that was said
about the bill in the other house, and for the
life of me I cannot see any more reason for
changing the name of the flrst of July from
"Dominion Day" to "Canada Day" than for
changing my own name fromt "John" to sometlîing else. I often told my father and mother
that I could bave chosen a better name than
that for myscîf; and 1 object so strongly to
my second name that I neyer ]et anyone
Hon. 'Mr. flUFF.

know what it is. However, my parents chose
my name, and I bave neyer attempted to
change it. Some of us have bad the opportunity or duty of choosing names for eildren,
and when these children have grown up they
have sometimes asked what kind of dilemma
we were in when we made the choice. I have
noticed, though, that none of themn ever went
so far as to change their names. Occasioaally
you will find a person wîlling to change bis
surname, but I have not known anyone who
selected for himself a new name in place of
his Christian or given name.
Honestly, I do not sec why we should change
the name of the first of July. 1 am just
taking a sort of whimsical line. Why make a
change at ail? Dominion Day is the name
we give to the first of July, the day upon
which we celebrate, as was said by the boncurable gentleman from Vancouver South
(Hon. Mr. Farris), the birth of a dominion.
Let us deal with the word "dominion". If
it had any derogatory meaning it certainly
would not have been used as it w'as in the
Statute of Westminster. I have a copy of
that statute in my hand. It is the Statute of
Westminster, 1931, (22 George V, chapter 4.).
The word "dominion" is used frequently
throughout the act. Here is the first paragraphi of the preamble:
Whereas tlie delegates of His M-Najesty-s Governînents iii the Unitedi Kingdoîn, tlie Dominion
o~fC'anada. tlie Commonîwealth cf Australia. thec
Dominion of Newv Zealand, thec Union of South
Africa. tlîe Irish Free State and 'Newfoundland.
at Imperial Conferences holden at West.
inster..

And the third paragraph:
And wlîereas it is in accord wita tlie establishied ccîistitutional position that ne law liereafter madle by tlîe Parliamient of the Unîited
Kingdomi shall extend to any of the said Dominions as part of thic law of that Dominion
otherwise than at the request and with the
consent of that Dominion..
Although in the first paragrnph the various
countries are mentioned by name, in the third
paragrapb they are ail referred te as dominions. Section 1 defines "Dominion" as follows:
In this Act flhe expression "Dominion" means
any- of thic following Dominions, that is to say,
the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of
Australia. tlie Dominion of -New Zealnnd, the
Ujnion of Southî Africa. flie Irish Free State and
Newfoundland.
Section 3 says:
It is herehy declared and enacted that the
Parliament of a Dominion lias full power te
make laws ]îaving extraterritorial operation.
I need not read ail the sections, but let me
quote eue more, section 1l:
-Netwithstanding anything lu the Interpretatien Act, 1889, tlie expression "Colon ' slall îlot,
in any Aet of thec Parliamnent of the Unitedi

MAY 15, 1946
Kingdom passed after the commencement of this
Act, include a Dominion or any Province or
State forming part of a Dominion.
In other words, the delegates to the Imperial
Conferences of 1926 and 1930, to whose resolutions the Statute of Westminster gives effect,
adopted from Canada the name "Dominion"
and applied it to every self-governing country
in the empire, even thouglh officially that
country might be -named a union, as is South
Africa, or a commonwealth, as is. Australia.
That application of the word "Dominion" by
this statute was an honour to Canada.
In passing, I would add that anyone who
reads the Statute of Westminster can come ta
no other conclusion than that Canada has all
the authority she wishes.
I might remark here, for the benefit of nonlegal members of the Senate, that the
Dominion Day Act of 1879 was one of those
consolidated in the Revised Statutes of 1927.
That explains why the name of the act which
this bill proposes to repeal is the Dominion
Day Act of 1927.
In. my attitude to this bill I need not join
with anyone else. We are all Canadians, and
we have reason to be proud of that fact. Look
at the history of our country. Some of our
governments have no doubt made mistakes,
but I warrant they were mistakes of the heart
and not of the head. In doing what they did
our governments thought they were acting in
the best interests of the country. The Confederation Debates show what a great future
was envisaged for this country by the men
who framed the British North America Act.
I often wonder at the breadth of view of those
men. .I am told, and I have read on good
authority, that the original idea was ta call
this country "the Kingdom of Canada," and
that only after the British authorities suggested that that name might be offensive ta
our neighbours ta the south was the name
"Dominion" brought forward and adopted as
a substitute. I personally like "Dominion"
better. I say that quite candidly. That does
not alter the fact that I am loyal to the
Crown and that I think we have the greatest
constitutional monarchy the world has ever
seen. I believe the present line of royal succession has done wonders for us, especially
in the last two world wars, by holding the
empire together as nothing else could have
done. We have, I repeat, a constitutional
monarchy, and we are proud of our democratic rights in this country.
As T have said. I cannot see why anyhodv
would want ta change the name of our
national holiday. If I may be pardoned for
making a personal reference I will tell a little
story. When I was a young man, the business

247

firm with which I was employed occupied the
whole of the ninth floor of a building, except
for a small room which had one window and
was rented for $25 a month. Possession of
that room would have enabled us ta dispense
with all the hallways and thus have one-third
more space. Being office manager, I thought
that was a fine idea. I found out that on the
third floor, which was a much better floor,
there was a vacant office with two windows,
and I went ta the man who had the office on
our floor and offered to pay the difference-in
the rent if he would move down ta that other
office. He refused. When I asked him what
his reason was, he replied: "I haven't got a
reason. I just won't do it." I reported this ta
the head of our firm, and he said: "If the man
would give you a reason for not moving, you
would have a chance ta show him that he was
wrong, but so long as he says he has no reason
you cannot move him." So we just had ta
wait two and a half years until the lease of
that office ran out. That is what I think about
this bill: I can see no reason for it. If the
bill were offensive ta the United States or ta
Great Britain or France or Russia, one might
argue against it. But of course it is not. I
was not a bit surprised that the bill went
through the other house so fast, for there was
no reason whatever ta pass it, and in the circumstances it is hard ta talk against or even
for the measure.
It bas been reported in some newspapers
that the government of the day would like ta
see the Senate defeat the bill. We have a
responsibility ta discharge. In fact I thought
yesterday the honourable senator fron Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) would, in
effect, say that the Senate is in existence ta do
the very thing that I think it should do,
namely, destroy this bill. If in a year or two
.years from now there developed so strong a
public sentiment that the bill was again passed
by the other house, then we would have ta
consider very seriously what we should do
with it. But at the moment this is just a
piece of hasty legislation, hastily put through
the other bouse.
The proposed change of name is a matter
of sentiment. On this point I trust the house
will pardon another personal reference. A
certain young man at the front wrote ta his
mother: "Don't tell me about politics in
Manitoba or the Dominion; don't tell me who
is mayor of Winnipeg, and all that sort of
thing; just tell me who was in for supper
last night." The young fellow's sentiments
were cuntred about his home. Our sentiment
for the first of July goes back ta the time
when as children we went with our parents
ta the Dominion Day picnic, which, ta us,
was the great event of the year. The first of

and eager to shoulder our great responsibilities.

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, I think it would bu proper to place
on the record an editorial from Canada's
National Farm Magazine, the Family Herald
and Weekly Star, of May 1, 1946. The ediIt reads as
torial is labelled "Silly Bill!"
follows:
One of the silliest things to come out of parliament for a long time is a bill to change our
traditional old "Dominion Day" to "Canada
Day." The first reaction among most people is the
natural question, "What on earth's the idea?"
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Most of us have the fairly strong feeling that
there are plenty of more urgent affairs to be
dealt with by the parliament of the Dominion
of Canada than changing an historical name
with strong associations in the minds of millions, to a new name without any such personal
or historical associations, which yet means
exactly the same.
"Dominion Day" was so named, and was set
aside as a national holiday, to commemorate
Confederation,-the birth of a new nation
stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacifie,the birth, in fact, of the Dominion of Canada.
It does not commemorate the birth of Canada.
There were Canadas before Confederation,several of them,-Upper Canada, Lower Canada,
the Province of Canada. The great change in
our national history was when these separate
provinces joined with other provinces on the
Atlantie, and British Columbia on the Pacific,
and Manitoba at the heart of it all, to become
the Dominion of Canada.
The word "dominion" was a new one then,new in geography and new in political theory.
It marked a new and great experiment, which
has proved so triumpbantly successful that it
has brought a new political conception to the
nations of the world.
Today, the word "dominion" has acquired a
fine dignity, due largely to the good sense and
sound political thinking of the people of Canada
themselves, and of the people of Great Britain.
Between us we have evolved what looks like a
pre-view of the nation of the future. A conception of nationality which avoids both the Scylla
of colonial inferiority and the Charybdis of
rampant nationalism. The "Dominion of Canada" means something. It means something
proud, something indefinable, yet of happy
augury for the future. It means successful
development of a new idea in international
relations. It means full freedom, with full cooperation among equals. It means a truly independent nation which bas nevertheless banned
from its heart the idea of war as an instrument
of national policy. It brings a glowing vision
of the future, when the nations of the world
will bave caught up with us in their political
thinking and will live together as the dominions
of the British Commonwealth of Nations live
together.
Why sacrifice an honourable title wbieh we
ourselves have made honourable and great, for
the sake of a few vociferous remuants of colonial
inferiority, whose inferiority complex is so deep
that they are afraid of their own history?
For that is the pressure behind this propaganda to change "Dominion Day" to "Canada
Day,"-tIe little minds which lack faith in themselves and their destiny.
The "Dominion of Canada" means something
more than "Canada." It means achievement of
a new and great principle. "Canada" is merely
another political entity like "Uruguay," "Guatemala," "Italy" or "Spain." But the "Dominion
of Canada" is something greater, finer, more
prophetie than any of them. It is our own title.
It is something we bave forged and dignified.
It is something which is more in accord with the
reality of the modern world than any simple
national name, including either the Republics of
Uruguay or Spain, or the United States of
America.
This silly bill has been allowed to slip through
the House of Commons in Ottawa and is now in
the lap of the Senate. The Senate has been
criticized often enough, but it can do its good
deed for this session by killing the "Silly Bill,"
or letting it die quietly.

MAY 15, 1946
We all know, even though we do not want
to say it out loud, just how and where this
bill originated. It came from those, or their
representatives, who in the first and the
second Great War repaired to the confines of
the hills or the woods to avoid doing their
share of duty for the Dominion of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I rise to a point of
order. I am sure, honourable senators, that
the honourable member from Parkdale (Hon.
Mr. Murdock) will on reflection realize that
he should not impute ulterior motives to the
sponsor of this bill in the other place.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Shortly, according
to reports, we shall hear an earnest request
for forgiveness of those who in the war effort

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: -the contribution
of their just duty.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I rise to another
point of order.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I hope that every
senator bas still got the right to express his
personal views.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: But without breaking
the rules of the house.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Those who do not
like my views can hold views otherwise. But
we all know, even though it is not altogether
nice to mention it, how this bill originated.
It originated in the minds of those who want
the sameHon. Mr. FARRIS: I ask for a ruling from
the chair.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: This bill comes
to us from the House of Commons, where it
was sponsored by a reputable member, and
his motives should not be impugned.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I bow to the ruling
of His Honour the Speaker and to the objections of two or three other gentlemen, and
shall refer to it simply as the "silly bill"
which is dealt with in the editorial which I
read a few moments ago.
Hon. T. D. BOUCHARD: Honourable
senators, I hope that no member of this house
will think I am a friend of those who have
been described by the honourable gentleman
from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock). I rise
at this moment to -ay that among thosc whofought for this bill were broad-minded members of parliament belonging to every race
and creed in this country. If the honourable
gentleman wants my opinion, I would say that
63268-18J

249

it is not the bill that is silly but the article he
bas read. The reason I believe it is silly is
that the words of the author express deprecation of the term Canada. The writer declares
that the word "Canada", which is applied to
our country, originally described just a few
Indian huts. I think this sort of article is
silly.
I wish to state that I favour a change in
the law as suggested by this bill, because
Canada is to me no longer a dominion but
a nation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BOUCHARD: That is the reason
I should like the word "Canada" to have the
honour and respect of those who live in this
country, whether they were born here or elsewhere. I do not understand why we should
always annex to the word "Canada" the two
words "Dominion of".
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: May I ask the
honourable senator a question? He bas stated
that this country is not a dominion. If he
looks in his own desk he will see there a copy
of the debates of the Senate under the heading: Debates of the Senate of Canada, 1946Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: That is the change we
want to make.
Hon. Mr. BOUCHARD: Yes, that is the
purport of the bill. I do not think Canada
is still a dominion. I may tell you that in
French Canada we have no exact translation
for the word "dominion". I challenge anyone to give an exact translation of the word
-unless he says "dominion," which is not
French at all. It bas been translated by the
word "puissance", which means "power", not
"dominion". This is one reason why broadminded men who have done their duty in the
war, and who have been abused by those who
did not dare do their duty, are in favour
of a change in the law.
When the Statute of Westminster was
passed we became a nation, and I do not
see why we should refrain from publishing
that fact. If this bill receives second reading,
I will propose that the name "Canada Day"
be changed to "National Day". Those who
want to keep the name Dominion of Canada
in their speech and writing may do so; and
those who, like the French, call the first of
July "Confederation Day"-as it really is-may still speak of it as such.
I should like to see the bill give us a
national holiday, something we have not got
under Lhe iaw as iu nuw dsands. We have a
legal holiday, but not a national legal holiday. The reason I favour that change is
that in the province of Quebec we would

Lt is true, as was

a great many changes have occurred since
1867, when this nation was born as a confedieration. But those changes bave not been

Somo of my honourable friends are very

But if we take the word "dominion" as defined

As ta the definition of "dominion", aur goad
friend from Vancouver South (Han. Mr.
Farris) said that its meaning had changed
since 1867. Well, I took the trouble ta, consuit the 1945 edition of ýFunk and Wagnall's
Standard Dictionary, where I find "dominion"
defined as:
The right ai absolute possession and use;

-same as domination.
Let me quote another definition af "dominion"
from the 1940 edition of the John C. Winstan
Company dictionary:
Dominion: a territory or a country with a
high degree af local authority, but subject ta
the contrai oi another government.
Hanourabie members, 1 arn sure no one in
this chamber bas the sligbtest idea of allowing any other country in the Britisb Commonwealth af Nations ta, dominate Canada; nor
do they wish Canada ta, dominate any af ber
sister members. The word "Dominion" was
justified in 1867, but I submit that since we
have grawn ta nationhood it is no longer an
appropriate description of aur status. Whiie
listening ta my distinguished colleague yesterday I could nat help thinking ai the words af
St. Paul in chapter 13, verse il of bis Epistie
ta the Carinthians:
When I was a child 1 spake as a ehild, 1
understood as a child, I thought as a child; but
when I becamne a man, I put away childish
things.
I tbink this applies ta all of us. We must
realize that we -are no longer in aur infancy;

that the descendants of these two great races

boon not anly to the Canadians af French
origin who, were pioneers on the shores of
the St. Lawrence in 1759, but to the Englishspeaking people who came here afterwards.
Honaurable senators, before yau decide in

The Hon. Sir THO MAS CHAPAIS: Honourable senatars, it is flot rny intention ta make a
long speech on the question naw being debated
in this bouse. I simply wish ta offer a few remarks on the propased change in thé official
designatian of aur national haiiday.
I hasten ta say that I arn not naw and neyer

Day"l. Had I been a member of this honour-

254

SENATE

able house in 1879 I should have made a plea
in favour of a name which, to my mind, is the
proper one, namely, "Confederation Day". I
put this question to my honourable colleagues:
What great event took place in our country
on the first of July, 1867? Was it not the inauguration of a new politeial regime for the
Canadian provinces? Was it not the birth_ of
our confederation?
Therefore would not
"Confederation Day" be the correct designation of this anniversary? The political independence of our great neighbour, the United
States, was proclaimed on the fourth of July,
1776, and very logically the anniversary of that
great historical event is known as "Independence Day".
I have never liked the name "dominion,"
which is used to designate our Canada. One
of our greatest statesmen, Sir John A. Macdonald, who, with Cartier and Brown was
mainly instrumental in the framing of the
new constitution, would not accept responsibility for the name "dominion," as given in
London to the Canadian confederation. He
would have designated the Canadian provinces
which were united under the new constitution
as "the Kingdom of Canada". Later on he
wrote these words:
The change of title from "kingdom" to "dominion" was made at the instance of Lord
Derby, then foreign minister, who feared that
the first name would wound the sensibilities of
the Yankees.
Honourable senators you may find this
passage in the book entitled "Sir John A. Macdonald," written by Joseph Pope, Volume 1,
at page 313. Further, I am inclined to believe
that Sir George Cartier was of the same mind,
for the reason that in the French language
the word "dominion" has absolutely no standing, and an attempted translation of "Dominion Day" would give us the horrible wording
"le jour de la puissance."
When I was young-it was some years ago
-we
never spoke of "Dominion Day". We
were told that the first of July was "le jour
de la confederation, fête de la confederation."
At college we had a holiday-"le jour de la
confederation."
If we peruse the old debates of this house
we shall find that during the session of 1879
when a vote was taken on the second reading
of the Dominion Day Bill there were as many
as 25 nays against the 37 ayes. Of course I
would not assert that the suggested name influenced the voting of that numerous minority,
but I have a right to infer that there was no
strong enthusiasm over the whole thing.
The present bill has for its main purpose,
not the changing of the official name of our
country, but only the changing of the name
of our national holiday. It aims at giving
Hon. Sir Thomas CHAPAIS.

to that day the name "Canada Day" instead
of "Dominion Day".
As I have already
stated, I would prefer "Confederation Day",
which I would deem the right name. But
as the bill would eradicate the horrible "Jour
de la puissance", I am inclined to accept it
as a progressive step.
Moreover, should the name of our beloved
country be deemed an unwelcome intruder?
Is not "Canada" the real, the historical, the
time-honoured name of our native land?
Canada is the land of our pioneers, of the
heroes and the saints who suffered, struggled
and died to make it a land of steady progress,
of freedom and of Christianity. At the present
moment, more than ever, that name is honoured in the whole world. Every Canadian
citizen should be proud of it; and none
should be ashamed to say that our national
holiday is "Canada Day". Having such a
feeling, I should not like to stand in the
path of my fellow citizens who want to adorn
that name with a glorious priority.
I shall vote for the second reading of the
bill.
Hon. G. G. McGEER: Honourable senators, I have heard it said that this bill, which
has come from the other house, is of an
inconsequential nature, and that it is creating
a great deal of difficulty over a matter that
is not vital or important at the present
moment. I cannot bring myself to agree with
that conclusion. One of the things that gave
me reason for real concern was the support
given to the measure in the other place. It
bas been stated that the bill was passed there
with great speed, but on looking up the
records I find it was voted upon several times.
There was a vote on a motion for the six
months' hoist: that was defeated by 131 to
60. There was a vote on a motion to adjourn
the debate: that was defeated by 161 to 28.
There was a vote on the motion for second
reading, which was carried by 129 to 59. And
there was a vote on the third reading, which
was carried by 123 to 62.
On reading the debates of the other place
I find that the measure came forward as a
private member's bill. The government, as
such, took no part in connection with it, and
the Prime Minister neither spoke nor voted
on the issue. The Leader of the officia]
Opposition voted against the bill but did not
speak on the issue. From these facts I conclude that this is a House of Commons bill,
a bill of the elected representatives, who
freely expressed views which they no doubt
believe are endorsed by the electors in their
constituencies. I find grave difficulty in setting myself up to judge the action of the
members of the House of Commons on an

do not think they have changed with many
people in Nova Scotia or New Brunswick.
Sitting here as an appointed member of
parliament. I have at least to respect the
views expresscd in another place by the
electcd representatives of the people. When
I looked at the vote in the House of Commons, I found that the minister representing
New Brunswick in the cabinet, and all but
three of the other elected representatives from
that province. supported the bill. I also found
that in regard to Nova Scotia the Minister of
Finance and all but one of the other members
from the province supported the bill. I have
even more difficulty in regard to my own
province. Arn I to take my lead from the
honourable senator from Vancouver, who is
senior to me (Hon. Mr. Farris), or am J to be
guided by the Minister of Veterans Affairs
and the eight other British Columbia representatives who voted for the bill? I do not

a majority of the elected representatives of
British Columbia, Nova Scotia and New

would be to break the tic with the United
Kingdom, and that as a result in forty years
or less we should all become communists. I
thought the people of Great Britain voted
socialist in the last election. If the electors of

By what logic could my association with a

becoming a communist? If there is some great
distinction between socialism and communism,
that line of reasoning may be sound; but I
doubt whether it would convince a great many
people in British Columbia who want to be
associated with the United Kingdom for the
purpose, not of preventing themselves from
becoming communists, but of spiting the
people of the British Empire with the people
of the United States and all other lovers of
freedom throughout the world, so that humanity shall have a better deal than it bas bad
in the past. Our representatives in the United
Nations organization are struggling today to
find some way of working in co-operation with
the representatives of the people of Russia.
We want to see those ends achieved; but,

reasons for killing it, but those reasons must
be such as will be accepted not only by the
majority of the members of the other place,
but also by the majority of our people. To
repudiate this bill upon any other ground
might have serious repercussions. I do not
know how other members of my profession
or of my chosen activities in public life deal
with things. I like to take the other side;
to put myself in the position of the mover of
the bill. If as a private member, elected for
the first time to the House of Commons, I had
introduced a bill of this significance and got
129 of my fellow-members to support me, I
would feel mighty proud of the achievement,
for a private inember does not find it easy to
get much support for anything he may propose in that house-and I happen to know it
botter than most of you.

there was to find myself in a minority of one.
What is the situation at Westminster

Hon. Mr. McGEER: -and I would insist
on the government taking the proper constitutional course for the appropriate amendment to the British North America Act. As I
have said, the British House of Commons is
completely controlled by socialists, who declare that they are going to bring in a new
heaven and a new earth for the masses of
England. Whose voice do you think they
would hear when the amending bill came
before them, the voice of the elected representatives in the other place or the voice of
the members of the House of Lords of
Canada?
Yes, I should be very much concerned to
see this bill defeated on any basis that could
justify the charge that this Senate stands as
a reactionary power to frustrate the elected
representatives in expressing what they believe
to be the will of the majority of the people
in Canada. The 129 members in the other
house who voted in favour of the bill did not
come from any one section; they came from
all parts of the country. The leader of the
C.C.F. and every member of his party supported the bill.
Leaving that thought in your minds, bonourable senators, I want to come to what I
believe to be a more important issue. Why
is it that the celebration of the first of July
has fallen into disuse? I have been in Ottawa
on more than one Dominion Day, but never
in any of our cities have I noticed less activity
in celebrating that particular day than here
in the capital of the dominion. The celebration of a national holiday as an indication
of the regard we have for history is a great
event; but to forget all about the national
holiday on its every anniversary, and then to
get into a condition of national disagreement,
and call upon one to repudiate the action of
the louse of Commons because of some of
the reasons which have been given, is hardly
in line with logic and the importance of this
matter.
In the records I find that the first time
Dominion Day was celebrated as a holiday
was in 1869. This resulted from a proclamation issued by the Right Honourable Charles
Stanley Viscount Monck, Baron Monck of
Ballytrammon, in association with John A.
Macdonald, Minister of Justice, and Hector
L. Langevin, Secretary of State. The proclamation reads as follows:
Whereas by Royal Proclamation dated at
Windsor Castle on the 22nd day of May. in the
year of Our Lord, 1867, Her Most Gracious
Majesty did ordain, declare, and command, that

Brunswick should form ýand be one dominion
under the name of Canada;

And whereas the Anniversary of the formation
of the Dominion of Canada falls upon Wednesday, the lst day of July next ensuing;
And Whereas it is meet and proper that the
said Anniversany should be observed and kept;
Now Know Ye, that I, Charles Stanley Viscount Monck, Governor General of Canada, do

hereby proclaim and appoint Wednesday, the

first day of July next, as the day on which the
anniversary of the formation of-the Dominion
of Canada be duly celebrated. And I do hereby
enjoin and call upon all Her Majesty's loving
subjects throughout Canada to join in the due
and proper celebration of the said anniversary

on the first day of July next.
That

proclamation

did

not

appoint

a

national holiday, but selected one day, the
first of July, as the occasion on which to
celebrate an event in history. From 1869
until 1879 no proclamation concerning a
national holiday was issued by the Dominion
Government, and as pointed out by the mover

of the six-months hoist, any celebrations that
took place did so by virtue of provincial
proclamations.
When the bill of 1879 went to the House of
Commons it did not receive as much attention
as the bill now before us bas received. I have

heard the criticism that the Prime Minister
did not speak on that bill. There were a number of the Fathers of Confederation in the
government and in the bouse at that time.
Sir John A. Macdonald was one. The bill was

treated as a private member's bill coming from
the Senate. The debate was most perfunctory,
there was no division and, according to
Hansard, not one member of the government
gave it even the blessing of recognition. Why
was that?
The Fathers

of Confederation

had

very

much the same job on their bands that we
have upon ours today. They were confronted
by the problem of making confederation
work. We have a similar challenge facing us
today. The recent conference held in this
chamber gave evidence of that challenge
when the representatives of our provincial
governments, and of our great cities in which
nearly five million people now live, walked

out because of failure to agree on the basis
of taxation, living standards for the Canadian
people, and the sources of revenue to be
made available to governments of provinces
and cities responsible for health and education.
We have good reason to concern ourselves
about the name of the day commemorating
our national birth. But anyone who brings
forward for settlement at this time an issue
that-is going to add to discord, or disunity,
or who does anything tiat will prevent the
continuation of the kind of unity which so

recently saved us

from universal disaster, is

making no contribution to our history, our
present or our future.

It scems to me that we sbould net overlook
world conditions in 1867. The problcms of
that day werc very similar to the problems of
today. Do net forget that betwcen 1859 and
'1865, wben the representatives of the British
colonies et North America were cnnvening,
the wbiole world was in a state ef turmoil.
The worst war in bistory was grinding te its
brutal and bloody close in the once British
celonies that bad signed a declaratien ot
independence. Ia France. Napoleen III was
on the throne, the tyranny ef dictatnrsbip had
returned and the ideals wbieh provoked the
French revolution hiad disappeared. At that
time Victor Hugo was an exile frem France
and the singing et the Marseillaise was punishable by death. With sncb world conditions it
is little wonder that the French peep!e In
Canada felt themsclves abandoned. But bhey
had ne wish te return te the France et
Napoleon III.
In England the great aristocracy and the
upper middle classes wcre battling against
reform, and looking upon the United States
with its universal franchise as a threat te the
preperty-owning classes. Wittkc's bistory et
Canada tells us that many of those belonging
te the upper classes in England were willing
te see Canada ceded te the United States.
Goldwyn Smith tells us in bis memeirs that
Gladstone bad written te him stating that
hie would be willing te bave Canada ceded te
the North, if the South was allewed te go
free.
It was in that atmospbere thatour fathers

repudiating the -action of the buse of
Commons, thereby giving material to persons
eager to ereate disunity, we can work out
some basis of compromise between this
honourable body and the one occupied by the
elected representatives of the people.
Now I corne to the bill itself. Section 4
provides for the repeal of the Dominion Day
-Act of 1927. That statute repealed the act of
1886, which in turn repealed the act of 1879.
In the act which this bill would repeal,
Dominion Day is establisbed as an entity. The
significance of that has apparently been overlooked by the draftsman. I find with regard
te holidays that as late as 1935 there was
an amendment t.o the Interpretation Act. That
Act, as honourable senators know, is the basic
act for the interpretation of certain words and
expressions in the fields of legislation and
jurisprudence. Paragraph Il of section 37 of
the ýact xvas amendcd in 1935 by chapter 6 of
the statutes of that year. In its amended
form the paragraphi reads:
(11) 'holiday' includes Sundays, New Year's
Day, the Epiphany. Good Friday, the Ascension.
Ail Saints' Day, Conception Day. Easter Monday, Ash Wednesday, Christmas Day. the birthday or the day fixed by proclamation for the
celebration of the birthday of the reigning
sovereign, Victoria Day, Dominion Day, the
first Monday in September. designated Labour
Day, Ilemembrance Day, and ýany day appointed
by proclamation for a general fast or thanksgiving.
I find no provi-'ion in this bill te amend the
-Interpretagtion
Act. Now, let me bring this to
your attention again. Our statutes havec net
been revised since 1927, they are very badly
indexed. and to make a list of the statutes in
which Dominion Day is specifically referred to,
not as a national holiday, not as a holiday at
aIl, but as Dominion Day, would take a great
deal of research work. It appears not only in
the Bis of Exchange Act and the Banking
Act, but also in the Civil Serv ire Act. I
woiîld not be sure, but 1 believe section 45
of the Civil Serv ire Art, in prox iding for
certain bhidays. includes Dominion Day in
the list. If this bill were te pass, it would be
necessary te amend every statute that contains the word "Dominion Day." I do net

But have we the powpr to make that amendment applicable te provincial statutes?
Hon. Mr. DUFF: No.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Every province bas
its own Interpretation Act, and there is a geod
deal of provincial legislatien, botb public and
private, in which Dominion Day is rcferred te.
But let me take yeu ex en further than the
provincial legislatures. "Dominion Day," as
thte legal description of our national holiday,
bas gene into many civic ordinances througheut the dominion. Let me ask a practical
qtuestion of the members of this bouse. To
make the change suggestcd might involve
private individuals. Hew many contracts are
there today in eperatien across this dominion
invelving Dominion Day concessions? Every
one of those centracts is based upon the
acceptance of Dominion Day as a legal entity
having a legal meaning in our dominion, provincial and civie laws.
Let me go along with you in asking myself
this question: Have I, as a senator, the right
te judge the action of the elected representatives in the other place on issues where they
are just as compotent te express the will of
the people as we are? Theý answer te that
question is vory simple-I do net think I have

draw an arnentiment which would satisfy even
those who voted for this bill in the other
bouse.
But I de know this. 1 believe I came here
ivith one respensibility abeve all others, and
that is te prevent, as far as my limited abilitics go, the passing of legislation that would

MAY 16, 1946
add to the appalling confusion that already
exists through the long delayed revision of
our statutes.
I was interested in reading the sentiment
of Sir Joly de Lotbiniere, who became Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia and was
probably one of the most loved, most
respected and most revered of any that ever
held that high office. He described confederation in somewhat facetious terms as a
very elongated, very thinly held together
proposition, and he suggested that because of
its visionary, cloudy, vague atmosphere and
its elongation to the Pacific Coast the rainbow
would be a good emblem for it. But if we
in this house pass legislation that would
throw our whole statutory provisions into the
kind of chaos that this simple little bill would
create, then I think we have found a solution
for the emblem that should be on our Canadian flag. We should havé a good picture of
"Confusion Corner" or "Confusion Centre" as
they call it down here, put on the flag and
let it go at that.
But I thought this matter was serious, so
I went to the very capable and brilliant representative of the Bar that the Senate has at its
service as legal adviser. I placed this bill
before him, and the position of Dominion Day
in our dominion and provincial statutes and
civic ordinances, and then I put to him this
plain simple question: Can the Senate accept
the bill in its present form? His answer was
0.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: He is quite right.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It can be amended,
though.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: That is another
responsibility. Of course it can be amended.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Would the honourable
senator give the reason for the negative
answer?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I argued that if this
bill were passed it would destroy the term
"Dominion Day" as a legal entity in our

statutes, and to discontinue it as a legal entity
you would have to change "Dominion Day" to
"Canada Day" in all dominion statutes and

orders in coùncil and in all provincial statutes
and civic ordinances. This bill would effect,
as I say, a complete change not merely of
the name of the day we celebrate, but of the
contractual relations of the whole country
in respect to the term "Dominion Day" as a
legal entit.y.
As I say, the bill could be amended here,
but I do not know whether the members of
the other bouse ever considered these
implications.

201

Hon. Mr. DUFF: No, they did not.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: If they did and they
want to go through with them, then I think it
is up to the other place to so declare.

I do

not think it is up to us to assume that they
want us to make up their minds for them.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators, I
suggest that the honourable gentleman is out
of order when he mentions the vote on this
bill in another place and quotes and identifies
members. We have had too much of this in
the past, and for the future I think it would
be well to refrain from continuing the
practice.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I have been
following the remarks of the honourable
senator from Vancouver-Burrard, and so far
I find he has kept within the rules of the
Senate. Our rules do not permit honourable
senators to refer to the way in which members
have voted in the other house, but this bill
has received so much attention in the newspapers that I do not think it can be discussed
properly without some reference to what has
taken place elsewhere.
Hon. Mr. McGEER:ý Thank you very much,
Mr. Speaker.
In conclusion may I say that I do not
know of any procedure for a conference between the two houses, similar to that which
obtains in Washington.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, there is a procedure.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: But I do think that
during the week-end adjournment it might be
possible for members of this house to meet
representatives from the other place with a
view to coming to some understanding.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: The honourable member for Grandville -(Sir Thomas Chapais) suggested that the name "Confederation Day"
would be more acceptable to Quebec than
"Dominion Day." I believe that we in other
parts of Canada have some responsibility in
the matter of reaching a state of unity with
our French Canadian brethren.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman permit an interjection? It has been
the practice when we in this house do not
like a bill to send a message to the other
place saying that we are rejectig the bill,
and asking for a conference. They eithèr
accede to our request or refuse it. If they
accept, the Senate appoints a committee of
managers to meet with representatives from

262

SENATE

the other place, and they get together and
try to iron out the difficulties. This procedure has been adopted twice in my experience.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: To my mind the
great future of Canada is to be found in the
tourist trade. We have in Quebec and in the
French people a touch of the old world. I
know of no grander section of our dominionand I am not forgetting the grandeur of the
Rocky Mountains-than I encountered in my
travels through Gaspé. I am told that even
that magnificent scene, where the mountains
reach down into the mighty Atlantic, is not
to be compared with the beauty of the
scenery in the Lake St. John country and
many other parts of Quebec as yet completely
unexplored.
I have flown over northern
Quebec to see a picture of the thousands of
lakes spread before me.
We have before us a bill, but we have
more than that. We have a pattern that we
should like to believe will become the pattern
for all the races of the world., Our two races
each have their faults and weaknesses; but
I am sure that if we strike a balance, we will
find that in the people of each race there is
far more to be praised, loved and appreciated
by the other than there is to be hated and
despised.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Our fathers dreamt
of the day when the two races could live
together. Is this not the time to seek the
road of sympathetic tolerance and good will?
In my varied career I once acted as counsel
for the province of British Columbia in an
application to the Board of Railway Commissioners for the removal of what we thought
was a very vicious discrimination against the
people of that province. Because the railway
had to cross the mountains to get from the
prairies to the Pacifie coast we had to pay
wbat was called the mountain differential. We
said that in our opinion the mountains were
common to confederation, and we did not sec
why we should suffer that penalty. The
problem was intensified a little when our
friends from the maritimes came to Ottawa to
get a bill passed because of another geographie
disadvantage involving a difference in the
mileage between Montreal and Saint John and
Halifax and the mileage between Montreal
and New York. The Dominion Government passed the Maritime Freight Rates Act
fixing an arbitrary rate at less than cost, and
taxed the whole of Canada-including British
Columbia, which already was suffering by
reason of a geographical disadvantage-in
order to benefit Montreal, Saint John and
Halifax.
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Why Montreal?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: At the time I speak of
the Canadian Pacifie Railway was operating
almost as a branch line from Calgary to Vancouver to meet the boats from the Orient that
carried passengers and silks. We said: "Why
cannot grain be shipped to the Pacifie coast at
the same rate as to Fort William? Our port is
open the year round, and boats do not have
to be tied up for five months." The objection to our proposal was the mountain grades.
Then Mackenzie and Mann came along and
built a road through the Yellowhead Pass,
where there were no mountain grades, but the
mountain differential continued.
The two distinguished representatives of
the board who heard the case were the late
Mr. Justice McKeown, formerly Chief Justice
of the Supreme Court of New Brunswick, and
the late Honourable Frank Oliver. They
decided in my favour. Three other members
of the board who did not hear the evidence
in the case announced to the publie that they
would repudiate the decision of the sitting
tribunal. With that invitation the railway
appealed. There were then five members of
the appeal board and one vacancy, and the
government stepped in and appointed a sixth
member. I came from British Columbia to
appear before a court, three of whose members had declared their intention of voting
against me. Two had already voted in my
favour, and one was an unknown quantity.
The three members of the board who wevre
against me were all from Ontario. The new
member was not only from Quebec, but-of
all places-from Montreal, where all the power
exists. However, when the day of final judgment came the gallant representative from
the city of Montreal-a French Canadian who
afterwards became Speaker of this house, the
Honourable Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Vien
for the rights of British Columbia.
-voted
The board divided three to three, with the
result that grain poured through to the Pacifie
Ocean and on into the markets of the world.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: May I say that it is
not easy to forget an experience of that kind.
My relations with the people of the province
of Quebec have taught me that the French
Canadian is not only an asset to Canada but
to the British Empire and the freedom-loving
peoples of the world. I hope the day is not
far distant when we will come to revere the
memory of the fathers of this nationHon. Mr. DUFF: Sir Wilfrid Laurier.

Senate is an independent body, and that what

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: And if the time should

one eye on the records of the House of Gommons to see how the members have voted there
before we cast our vote-then 1 say to honourable senators that we have become nothing.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Neither do I accede tc,

members represent the opinion of the people
of this country better than we do. I doubt
if many of the members of the other house
who voted on the bill had consulted their
eonstituents.
We hear it said inib house over and over
tis
again that one of the chief funetions of the
Senate is to give the people of Canada a
chance to think twýice. This bill was passed
se hurriedly that I do nlot think the members
of the House of Gommons gave the people
a chance to think even once. In the interval
between the passage of the bill over there
and the discussion in our chamber there has
been an opportunity for the registration of
public opinion. That public opinion has been
registered ini the press is evident, and if the
size of my mail is any indication, it has been
registered by many protesta from city coun-

cils, women's organizations and clubs aIl over
the country. Therefore I think that, when it
cornes to deciding on this bill, the position of
the members of this chamber is quite as good
as, or perhaps better than that of the members
in the uther place.
I am sorry te differ so sharply with the
member frorn Vancouver-Burrard, but I feel
strongly that we have a perfect right to gauge
public opinion by what has happened, and
what has heen reflected in the press since
this bill was passed in the other place. I believe that we should base our votes upon the
judgrnent we form now, and not upon what
'has happened over there.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Aside altogether frorn
considerations of tradition, history and sentiment, which were so ahly presented in this
house by the honourable senator frorn Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris) and the
honourable senator frorn Lunenburg (Hon.
Mr. Duif), I arn opposed to this bill for
another reason which I think is one of the
chief reasons in the minds of many. 1 arn a
Conservative, and perhaps what sorne rnîght
caîl a "dyed-in-the-wool Conservative", but
I arn not opposed to the bill simply because it
means a change.- I arn definitely opposed to
the name that is suggested-"-ýCanada Day."
Sorne of rny reasons for this have already
been expressed by the honourable senator
from Sorel (Hon. Mr. David), the honourable
senator from The Laurentides (Hon. Mr.
Bouchard) and the honourable senator frorn
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig). These honourable gentlemen said that to those who live
ini Canada and love ite every day is Canada
Day. To that view I fully subscribe. For
our national holiday we want a name that
has sorne special significance.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) pointed out how
mnappropriate would be a change in the narne
of the national holiday of the United States
from "Independence Day" to "Arnerica Day".
Having some Irish blood in rny veins, I happened to think of St. Patrick's Day. I arn
quite sure that if it were possible for St.
Patrick to corne back to Ireland today, a
great many people there, because of deep
religious convictions or for some other reason,
would flot. even be on speaking ternas wftb
him.' Yet noa one would seriously suggest
changing the narne of Ireland's national day
on that account, for down through the years
the day has becorne associated with a wealth
of tradition and sentiment. And, I repeat, we
ini this country want for our national day a
tiame that has special sîgnificance.

NAVIGABLE

WATERS' PROTECTION
BILL

SECOND READING

ROBERTSON
WISHART McL.
Hon.
moved the second reading of Bill 9, an act
to amend the Navigable Waters' Protection
Act.
Hon. Mr. FALLIS.

He said: Honourable senators, I have asked
the honourable senator from Thunder Bay
(Hon. Mr. Paterson) to explain the bill.
PATERSON:
McL.
NORMAN
Hon.
Honourable senators, the amendments proposed
in Bill 9 is to substitute, in subsection 2 of
section 5 of the Navigable Waters' Protection
Act, the words "one thousand nine hundred
and thirty eight" for the words "one thousand
nine hundred and eighteen".
The section as it stands at present reads:
The Governor in Council may approve of
works constructed, or in process of construction,
on the first day of June, one thousand nine
hundred and eighteen, subject to the provisions
of section seven hereof, and such approval shall
have the same effect as approval of works to be
constructed.
Section 7 reads:
The local authority, company or person proposing to construct any work in navigable waters,
for which no sufficient sanction otherwise exists,
may deposit the plans thereof and a description
of the proposed site with the Minister of Public
Works, and a duplicate of each in the office of
the registrar of deeds for the district, county or
province in which such work is proposed to be
constructed, and may apply to the Governor in
Council for approval thereof.
The Navigable Waters' Protection Act was
passed in 1886 for reasons of security and
defence purposes, to ensure that there were no
obstacles or impediments to navigation in
navigable waters. The act has not been
amended very often since 1886, but on a few
occasions parliament has approved the change
of the date in subsection 2 of section 5.
Since 1918 certain works have been undertaken without authority, and the department
is unable to legalize them under the act as
it stands. I understand that a general case
that night come to the attention of the department is one in which someone, through
ignorance, puts up some works without applying for approval of the site or the plans, and
later on the works are transferred to other
parties who request approval of the site and
works. The Governor in Council cannot give
approval of these works, because subsection
2 of section 5 fixes June 1, 1918, as the date
on which the Governor in Council may approve of works constructed or in process of

developed by a man named Wilson, about
1923 or 1924. Later on the works were sold

the Gatineau Power Company. -When this
company applied to, the department it was

this case would be met.
The sole object of the bill is to change
the date from June 1, 1918, to June 1, 1938.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
can the honourable gentleman explain why
the act is to he brought up only to 1938? I
should think his argument would apply just
as strongly to any works huit since 1938. If
the bill is passed in its present form, any works
buit since then would be under the same
disability that the bill seeks to remove with
respect to works buit between '1918 and
1938. It seems to me that while we are
amending the act we may as well bring it up
to date, and not leave a gap over the hast
seven or eight years.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON- A similar question
was put to the Minister in another place. Hie
was asked why the date has been set at
June 1, 1938; why flot bring it up to date?
The Minister explained that probably this is
an arbitrary date. Years ago, in 1926 or
1927, when the act was amended the date was
fixed at 1918. Now it is being moved ûp,
and the Minister behieves that bas been
going on since 1886. The officiais of the
dcpartment think June 1, 1938, would be a
proper date. I think that question could he
better answered in committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERT90N moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications.
The motion was agreed to.
FEEDING STUFFS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 64, an Act to amend the
Feeding Stuifs Act, 1937.
Hie said: Honourable senators, I wilh ask
the honourable gentleman from St. Jean
Baptiste (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) to explain the
bill.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable sena tors, the purpose of this short bill is to amend
the Feeding Stuifs Act of 1937. It has been
the practice in some parts of Canada to offer
for sale feed in sacks or bags without indicating the weight of the contents. The
amendment provides for the bagging or
packaging of whole grains at standard content

265

weights, and in this way will afford some protection to purchasers. Certain exemptions arc
provided for so as flot to interfere wîth dealings between farmers.
Section 2 amends section 14 of the Act by
adding the following paragraph:
(dd) Prescribing and limiting the vitamin
claims tisat may 'be made for any feeding stuff
or any ingredients or constituents thereof.
It has been the practice of the manufacturers to dlaim that their products contain. more
vitamins than are really necessary according
to expert opinion.
The amendment wil
enable the Minister and his officiais to regulate the vitamin dlaims.
The present vitamin regulations apply only
to articles which are primarily vitamin A and
D supplements, such as cod liver oul or other
feeding oils. There is a need and demand to
regulate other vitamin products, and also
to limit dlaims to those vitamins and potencies which feeding authorities recognize as
necessary supplements to ordinary rations.
There is a growing tendency in the marketing
of multiple vitamin products to make dlaims
which are misleading to the average feeder,
inasmuch as some of the vitamins are
adequately supplied without such supplements, or the potencies are insufficient to
serve the needed purposes. This is to safeguard the farmer who is purchasing agamnst
representations which are not in accordance
with the facts.
I think this will enable honourable members to appreciate the purpose of the bull.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shahl this
bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Next sitting.
YUJKON PLACER MINING BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 62, an Act to amend the Yukon
Placer. Mining Act.
H1e said: I would ask the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) to, explain
this bill.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
the Yukon Placer Mining Act is chapter 216
of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927. This
bill is for the purpose of amending it in two
particulars.
The first ameiàdmcnt is to give the Governor in Council power to make regulations for
the exemption of members of the armed forces
from the provisions of the act respecting forfeiture for non-performance of work, and so

forth, on dlaims held by them at the time of
their enlistment. This exemption was formerly
granted by authority of the Oider in Counicil
passed under the War Measures Act.
The other amendment is necessary by reason
of the improvement in transportation facilities in the Yukon Territory. Gold, whether
derived from placer operations or quartz mining, is subject to a royalty. This amendment
will strengthen the hands of the police in
preventing the smuggling of gold out of the
territory. Penalties are provided for violations
of the law.
Subsection 4 of section 83 (a) contains a
provision which may require some explanation
when the bill goes to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce. This subsection provides that any peace officer who suspects that
a person intends to take gold out of the
country without paying royalty may search
such person without a warrant. Honourable
members will readily appreciate the difficulty
a peace officer might have in going fifty or a
hundred miles to get a search warrant . 0f
course on his return he would find the suspected person had disappeared.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: 1 do net think any of
us will question the first part of the bill, which
extends to mon discharged from the services
freedom from assessrnent work and aszssment
duties on thoir mining dlaims duiring their
period of ',er,,ice and for one year thiereafter.
Witb respect to the subscetion j errnitting

the suspect w ould be far away. Furthermore,
new methodýý of transportation, the airpiane
and that sort of thing, now enable people to

opinion the bill proposes the only practical
way of meeting the situation.
The motion was agreed to, and tPe bill was
read the second time.

YUKON QUARTZ MINING BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 61, an act to amend the Yukon
Quartz Mining Act.
H1e said: Honourable senators, I would ask
the honourable senator from Churchill to
explain this bill.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
this bill lias to do with quartz mining, and
is in some respects a companion measure to
the Yukon Placer Mining Bill which I explained a few moments ago. Like that bill,
it authorizes the Governor in Council to
make regulations

exempting members of the

armed forces from the forfeiture provisions
of the act.
There are also one or two further amendments of some importance. Under the act,
as it stands, a prospector may go oct into unknown territory and stake a dlaim.
Aiso,
if be satisfies the recorder as to certain
matters, he is allowed to act as attorney for
two other individuals, and to stake a dlaim
for eacb of them. This imposes a considerable handicap on the development of dlaims.
A prospector may he hundreds of miles from
the recorder's office wlien bie finds a prospect

lias te return and record his location, and he
is not allowed to file on another location for
twenty days. If in the meantime word lias

gone around, others may stake dlaims immediately adjoining Pis. I tbink it is reasonable to believe that this practice handicaps
tlevelopment.
It is proposed to amend the act so that a
prospector wbo finds a strike of ore, as it is
called, may immediately locate-for bimacif,
or under power of attorney for others-eight
dlaims along that strike. I think it is reasonable te expect that this will Pelp in tPe securing of capital for developmnent.

permitted to stake up ta eight dlaims for
himself, or for others.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That represents an
increase.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That increase is proposed for the purposes which I have Just
stated.
There are a few amendments ta subsequent
sections which bring those sections into line
with the proposed changes.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I wish ta endorse what the honourable senator fromn Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) has said
with respect to this bill. 1 believe the situation ta be a trifle worse than he has described
it. For instance, a prospecter who stakes one
dlaim for hirnself and who wishes to stake
dlaims for two other persans by power of
attorney, must make an affidavit that hie paid
the travelling costs of those persans ta the
location. I arn advised that had it flot beon
for the loniency shawn by the recorder, the
act would have been entirely unworkablo in
the Yukon. Certainly three dlaims are flot
of much use in quartz mining, particularly in
that far-flung country where undertakings are
exponsive and the prospecter must have a
sufficient area ta at least promise the dovolopment of a large mine. 1 believe that this bill
has been introduced at the request of the
prospectors in the Yukon territory.
In my opinion the bill should not be referred
ta a cammittee, because it involves only the
question of whether we are going ta give the
prospectors the right to stake dlaims. on a
practical basis, and with soine hope of finding
a mine.
The motion was agroed ta and the bill was
read the second time.
The Han. the SPEAKER: Wben shall the
bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. McRAE: Now.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Next sitting.
CANADA DAY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBÂTE
CONTINUEr)

The Senate resumed from Tbursday, May
16, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Foster for the second readine of
Bill 8, an act respecting Canada Day.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senatars, I should like ta pay tribute to
the honourable senator for Rigaud (Hon. Mr.

Dupuis) for the kind way in which hie introduced bis remarks on this measure twa or
three days ago. He said:
I shahl endeavour to approach the subjeet in a
friendly mannor, and with the groatest respect
for the opinions of others, even though thoso
opinions are repugnant ta my understanding of
policy in this country.
That, honourable senators, is the spirit in
which we should approach ail questions of
national importance. I hope that the same
toleranco will be extended ta me in the few
imperfect remarks which. I propose to make
this evening, and that- I shahl be able to
emulate the spirit in which. my honDurable
friend began his address. I say that particularly because I wish ta refer ta something that
was said last Thursday hy the honourable
gentleman from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
MeGoter). Ho made references ta certain
opinions expressod in anather place, and there
was some sharp criticism of bis remarks. His
Honour the Speaker ruled them ta be in
order, and while I agree with the criticism
I think tho Speaker's ruling pcrhaps ends the
discussion. There was one remark, however,
with which I feel I ought ta take issue. It
will hc found in the Senate lisard, on page
289:
If I were the f athor of this bill in the other
place, and it were killed bore. 1 would mave ta
have the Senate made an eIoctiv;e assemhly.
May I say at once that that does not frighten
me in the least.
Some Han. SENATORS: Hear, heur.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No doubt there are
reasons on bath sides--certainly there would
be arguments âdvanced on bath sides-af the
question whether or net the Sonate should ho
made an elective assembly, or even whether
it should be abolished. That would ho a
matter of public concern, ta be brouglit forward, as should ahl public questions, in the
interests of the Dominion of Canada; and I
take objection ta any suggestion that my vote
here shaîl ho influenced by any consideration
that if I vote one way the Sonate wilh be
abolished or made elective, and that if I vote
the other way I might somehow protect my
position. I think we in the Senate should ho
particuharly careful in remarks of that kind.
Were a praposal ta abolish the Sonate or ta
make it elective being really considered by the
people of Canada, we would probably stand
aside and say ta them, "Do whatever you
think wise in this measure, wîtbout any consideration for us." Our personal interests
would not play a part in their decision.
Having made that reservation-and I feel
sure the honourable senator wilh agree with
what I have said-I approaclh the bill itself.
And let me say hore, lest because of the

SENATE
remarks I shall make there be any misunderstanding of my position, that I intend to vote
against this bill. I take that position because
if we are to change the name of this holiday, which has become embedded in the
memory and in the language of all our people individually, I think there had better
be first a period of advocacy, so that the
change, if it is to be made, shall have
the backing of a considerable section of
public opinion. That is an advantage which
the bill does not now possess, unless it be in
the French-speaking sections of our country,
as to which I cannot speak with any degree
of authority. I have found that, largely
because of the way it has been advanced, the
proposed change is very unpopular in the
province of Ontario. Perhaps only slight
indications of public opinion come to anyone,
but my own mail has been preponderantly
against the bill. Some few people speak for
it, but for the most part my friends and
correspondents are opposed to it; and I
notice that it is almost unanimously opposed
in the press.
There may be reasons for that, entirely
aside from the merits or demerits of the
proposal. In the first place, I would call the
attention of the sponsors of the bill to the
very sudden way in which it was sprung
upon the people of my province. Without
any prior advocacy, without even knowledge
by most people that such a change was in
contemplation, the bill came as a complete
surprise to the province of Ontario; and that
surprise was intensified by the almost indecent
haste with which the bill was sent forward in
another place, where it was given the first
and second readings at a single sitting, in one
day. I realize that that is entirely aside from
the merits or demerits of the proposal, but I
submit to honourable senators that it is
sufficient ground for rejection of the bill in
this chamber, in order that those advocating
the change may have an opportunity of
explaining it to people in other provinces than
their own, and generally to their fell'owcitizens, with a view to securing the concurrence of at least those people who might be
expected to support a measure which undoubtedly was intended to promote the Canadian
spirit. For that reason I suggest that this
house might very well consider a period of
delay for the bill, and that a delay of one,
two or even three years might be salutary
and in order.
But while I intend to vote for this measure
of delay, so there may be further explanation
and discussion, I am not able to find in the bill
that degree of sinister purpose implied by some
of the remarks of those who oppose it; neither
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

can I sec anything sinister in the intention of
those who have presented it. I myself prefer
to discuss a measure of this nature strictly on
its merits, without animus or suspicion. That
goes almost without saying.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) stated that nanes
and memories are closely associated, and he
saw something wrong in the revocation of the
consecration of the narne of a holiday which
was adopted in 1879-one year after he was
born. Well, it seems that he and I were born
in the same year. So I too am old enough to
sympathize with those who attach a sentimental value to things, that are old, because
they have become used to them and like them.
If there is such a sentimental value attached
to Dominion Day, then, honourable senators,
I suggest it should be respected.
The honourable senator also said that the
burden of proof rests heavily upon those who
propose the change. That argument of course
is sound. On the other hand, I submit there is
a limit to how far we should permit our sympathetic attachment to things, just because
they are old, to influence us against change.
Far too many consecrated absurdities have
held their place in the world. only because the
adult has silenced the objections of the child.
This attitude, if maintained, would pretty well
abolish progress. I once heard a citizen say
that because he hated change of all kinds he
could not bear to see cobwebs swept out of
corners. To my mind, he was an ideal conservative.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: A man or a woman?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Oh, a man.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: I thought so.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Of course. An inordinate deference to sentimental attachments
to the old and outmoded would stall progress
and put the mossbacks in control. So there is
a very definite limit on how far we should go
in eliiiging to things that have gone by. The
honourable senator from Lunenburg (Hon. Mr.
Duff), who is smiling at me from across the
way, says that he cannot see any reason for
this change.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Well, neither can I.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is why I shall
vote against the bill. There is no real need.
no urgency for immediate action, and every
reason why we should give time for thought
and consideration in an effort to bring about
greater unanimity among our own people with
regard to the bill.

MAY 20, 1946
But when the honourable senator from
Lunenburg says that this bill would knock
out the supports from under the house-well,
I cannot go that far with him. Nor can I agree
with people, more English than the King of
England, who find in every constitutional
change which we propose some sinister plot to
cut the cords which bind Canada to the British
Empire. We have made all our constitutional
progress in the face of colonially-minded
people of that kind. Notwithstanding the
tremendous contributions which we made in
the course of the last war, when, goodness
knows, we paid with blood and treasure to
cement the bonds of empire, there are still
those who fear that this domestic measure to
merely change the name of a holiday will
"bust up" the British Empire. It seems to me,
honourable members, that the great British
commonwealth of nations is built of sterner
stuff than to be influenced by small things of
this kind.
I believe in the association of the British
commonwealth of nations, the first successful
league of nations in the history of the world,
a league of nations whose members have
found it possible to get along without undue
quarrelling: True, at times there have been
clashes of opinion, but these have always been
resolved by consideration and discussion, and
in a friendly and sympathetic spirit. It is a
grand association of friendly nations in which
we play a part. We are bound together not by
rules of law, but rather by sympathetic understanding and good will.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: My father's family
was English, my mother's Irish. That is a
good mixture, is it not? I myself am of the
fourth generation of those who have called
Canada home. So I feel that I am qualified
to speak as a Canadian-not perhaps with the
long vista of years that lie behind some of my
Canadian fellow-citizens, but with ancestral
background sufficient at least to justify me in
saying that I am above all things a Canadian.
In that capacity I am free to admit that we
in Canada owe much te the British race.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The traditions of
constitutional
government,
of
biblical
morality, of a great literature, of industrial
and commercial development, are among the
blessings which we have received from our
British forefathers. But, honourable senators,
I should like respectfully to point out that
we should distinguish between what we owe
to the generations of the past and what those
of this generation who live in Canada owe

269

to that section of this generation which still
remains in England. The things that I have
mentioned are our common inheritance from
the past, to which we in Canada are as much
entitled, and to which I personally am as
much entitled, as are our cousins who still
live in England. To the generations of the
past we owe a debt of gratitude never to be
repaid, and which we acknowledge with
affectionate regard and respect. In this there
can be no accounting. But as between the
two sections of the present generation it is
quite another matter. Here too there can be
no ledger account as between us, nor is one
desirable. There would be many, many entries
on both aides of such a ledger, and it would
serve no real purpose, in fact it would be
objectionable, and I for one would net be
greatly interested in whatever balance the
books might show. Bût, on the other hand,
after what I have seen of two great wars and
several minor ones, I am not prepared to admit
today that the balance is against us. I am
ready to cry quits and to acknowledge- that
each owes to the other a debt of sympathetie
understanding, of friendly co-operation and
mutual respect-nothing else. So I suggest
that dragging into a debate, here and in the
press, on a purely domestic question of small
moment, the changing of the mere name of
a holiday, what we owe.to England, is out of
place and, to say the least, not at all helpful.
Now, the proposal to change the nane from
Dominion Day to Canada Day is, I feel, an
assertion of Canadianism. That is what lies
belind it. In that assertion I find some
grounds for sympathy. I like it because I
am a Canadian-and an aggressive Canadian
at that. For a quarrelsome or an arrogant
national spirit I have no sympathy. It is not
desirable in Canada any more than it is desirable elsewhere. The world should be growing
out of exaggerated national loyalties, and certainly out of international jealousies; and, in
my judgment, should be moving towards
world goverrment and the rule of law. That
is the direction in which we in Canada should
be moving. We should be developing a
broader loyalty towards the whole human race
in support of a world government as the only
possible means by which we can prevent a
recurrence of the wars that have devastated
this world in the past. I have no use, and I
think you will agree with me, honourable
senators, for the bellicose spirit of jealous,
narrow-minded and quarrelsome nationalities
that have embruiled ti'ia wurld in war after
war as far back as recorded history.
I do not wish Canadianism to take that
form or anything similar to it. I should like
to see us in Canada developing a still more

'70

SENATE

generous communal spirit among ourselves,
and above all I should like to see my fellow
citizens gradually outgrowing that inferiority
complex which we have inherited from
colonial -days. I prefer the assertion of our
rights and our dignity of nationhood. For this
reason I would be inclined to agree with the
honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis) who suggested that we strike "Dominion" out of some of our statutes. I would
rather like to see it struck out of the British
North America Act. I would, as 1e suggested, substitute for it the word "nation".
Instead of saying that the former provinces
shall form "one dominion under the name of
Canada", I should like to substitute the words,
"one nation under the name of Canada".
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have in my hand
a resolution prepared by that excellent organization, the Independent Order of the Daughters of the Empire.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The Imperial Order of
the Daughters of the Empire.
Hon. Mr. McRAE: They are both.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I beg your pardon.
They may be more imperial than they are
independent; however, I give them greetings
and my respects. The resolution is addressed
to "all members of the Senate" and paragraph
5 reads as follows:
Whereas the term dominion clearly indicates
the status of Canada as a free, self-governing
nation among the other dominions of the British
commonwealth of nations,
I call attention of honourable senators to the
fact that they speak of Canada as a selfgoverning nation-and I emphasize the word
"nation"-which of course it is. But does the
term "dominion" mean a self-governing and
altogether autonomous nation? While I was
considering that question I picked up the
dictionary that lies on my secretary's desk.
It is called "The Winston Dictionary", published by the John C. Winston Company of
Philadelphia, and is on the desks of many
thousands of secretaries in the United States,
Canada and elsewhere. I looked up the word
"dominion" and found the same definition
that was quoted by the honourable senator
from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis). It gives
this meaning:
Dominion: a territory or a country with a
high degree of local authority, but subject to
the control of another government; as, the Dominion of Canada.
Gentlemen, that may not be a correct definition of the word "dominion".
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Change the dictionary.
Rlon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Perhaps it is a good
idea when you do not like a book to get
it is not
another one; but -nfortunately,
possible to obliterate the many thousands of
copies of that dictionary which occupy space
on the desks and in the homes of people all
over the United States, Canada and elsewhere. Moreover, this book is not exclusive
in its interpretation of the word "dominion".
Webster's dictionary gives this definition:
-- a country considered as subject; as the dominions of a king.
I draw attention to the word "subject". If
a country is called a dominion there must be
someone who lolds dominion over it. The
word is open to misunderstanding and misinterpretation by all the varying peoples of the
world. Funk and Wagnall's dictionary defines
the word "dominion" as follows:
A country under a particular government;
often in the plural; as the Papal dominions.
lu none of these definitions is there the
thought of a nation, autonomous and free;
but rather a nation-as in the first definition
I gave-with a high degree of autonomy but
of someone
subject to the domination
else. So, gentlemen, I do not like the word
"dominion" because it is not thoroughly
expressive of conditions as they are in
Canada today.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) said the word
dominion was used because it was descriptive
of the country being born. It is quite true
that the word was highly descriptive of Canada
in 1867. But, gentlemen, if it rightly described
the constitution we enjoyed at that time, it eaunot correctly describe the constitution we have
today, because the one is far different from the
other. I think the people of Canada have
tolerated the use of the word dominion because
they have failed to realize the constitutional
progress that bas been made since Confederation.
If honourable senators will bear with me I
shall mention some of the outstanding points
in the progress we have made during the last
seventy or eighty years. When the British
North America Act was adopted it did not
give to Canada the complete local, domestic
or external autonomy which is enjoyed today.
In the first instance, the Act of Confederation
was an act of the Imperial Parliament, which
retained the right of amendment, and even
the right of abolition of the act, should the
Imperial Parliament sec fit. The Parliament
of Canada set up by the British North
America Act was, in the very nature of things,
subordinate to the parliament by which it had
been created.

MAY 20, 194
In the second place, the Colonial Laws
Validity Act was i force at that time, and
laws passed hy the Imperial Parliament which
were intended to apply to Canada remained
in force, or came into force when they were
enacted. Laws passed hy our dominion and
provincial parliaments, if held by the courts
to be repugnant-that was the word usedto Imperial legislation were, under the Colonial Laws Validity Act, held to be invalid.
At that time the Parliament of Canada was
a very secondary legislative hall, and its
acts were subject to a superier power across
the sea.
In the third instance, the Governor-General
was appointed by the Crown on the advice,
flot of his Canadian ministers but of the
British Government. The Queen and her
representatives were given the power of veto
over Canadian legislation-a power which was
exercised. The Canadian parliament at that
time was indeed an inferior parliament, subject to the supervision of authorities abroad.
When confederation was accomplished
Canada had no treaty-making powers. Her
foreign relations were reserved as the right
of the British Foreign Office in London; and
even in negotiations in which Canada's interests were involved, the discussions were carried
on by Imperial statesmen, although on some
occasions they did have the grace to permit
a Canadian representative to accompany them,
provided he knew his place and kept his mouth
shut. Gentlemen, we have travelled a long,
long way siiice then.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian
armed forces was at that time appointed by
the government
in London, and was
empowered to deal with the administration
of military aiffairs in Canada. And for this
the Canadian taxpayer was called upon te
pay. Canada's highest court of appeal at that
time, both in criminal and civil jurisdictions,
was appointed by the Chancellor in Great
Britain. This is true today, only because we
have voluntarily tolerated such a situation.
But the jurisdiction of that court has been
considerably curtailed; 1 should net be surprised if in a very few years the venerable
wigs were knocked off entirely.
Up until the present moment the flag of
Canada has been-I hope it will not long
remain-the combined Jacks of England,
Scotland and Ireland, with ne suggestion of
Canada.
Finally, the national anthem of Canada was
"God Save The King"-of England.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The King of Canada
as well.
63268-19

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The King of Canada
now. Today, we sing with whole-souled
loyalty, the national anthem of "God Save
The King"~ because we are singing God save
the King of Canada as well as God save the
King of the Empire at large.
Seme Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The King of whom
we sing in our national anthem, and for whose
life and prosperity we pray, is the King of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: That is quite right.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The same individual may also be the King of England, but we
now sing praises te the King of Canada, and
net as we once did to the King cf England.
Canada, by a countless series cf self-respecting assertions cf the kind that one will find in
this bill, has împroved that situation until she
is a thoroughly greunded nation in her own
right, able te look everybody in the face and
te extend te England and te ail the rest cf the
dominions of the British Commonwealth the
hand cf leyalty, welcome, fellewship and
equality.,
Hon. Mr. HORNER: We are able te do
that because we did the other things.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That may be se.
And just here may I go along with the honourable gentleman. I think it is highly te the
credit cf this Dominion cf Canada, and equally
to the credit cf the statesmanship cf these who
sat in authority in Westminster, that the development which I have indicated has been
brought about by peaceful means. No shet
bas been fired between us, and as a matter cf
fact very little animus has been shown at any
tixne; but by friendly co-eperatien and understanding we have gradually develeped from the
status cf a Dominien, as we were in 1867, until
we have emerged today in the status cf a
nation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I ask the henourable
gentleman a question? Do we lack anything
cf nationheod as ccmpared with that, say cf
the United States?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: D.o we now lak anything cf nationhoed?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: In my judgment we
do not. We are free and autonomous.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Then we, like the United
States, can aniend our constitution?

HunBUi wMiqTO

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: We ought to be able
to do so, and in fact we can. We can amend
our constitution, and we do it regularly: not
in form, but in substance and in fact. A resolution is passed by our two houses of parliament; it goes across the ocean and as a matter
of form it is agreed to by the Imperial Parliament. That has been done so far without
question. If any such resolution in some way
infringed the rights of the provinces, the
British statesmen then might demur and ask
us to reconsider. So far they have never donc
so, and any restrictions upon our autonomy in
that regard are theoretical and not practical.
We are a free-and independent, if you like
to use the word, although it has implications
that are unnecessary-a free, autonomous,
grown-up, adult nation.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I sympathize with
those who have broug.ht forward this measure,
because it is their hope to bring our phraseology into keeping with facts as they have
developed. I sympathize with their purpose,
and I fancy that if they will keep on discussing
it, ironing out difficulties and objections, they
will in due season have their way.
I was about to speak of that development which took place following the passing
of the British North America Act, with its
very marked limitations upon Canada's status
as a nation. In 1867 Canada was nat a nation,
but a dominion. Our statesmen, by countless
acts of self-respecting assertion, have gradually, peacefully and wisely developed our
status to the point where it is today. Sir
Wilfrid Laurier played his part when, at the
time of the Queen's Jubilee, he conducted
negotiations between Canada and France, for
the first time in our history. Sir Robert
Borden certainly played bis part when he
insisted upon putting Canada's name to the
Treaty of Versailles. Mr. King has undoubtedly played his part in a thousand different
ways, too recent to specify particularly. And,
finally, the situation culminated in that great
charter of Canadian liberty and self-respect
which was passed at the Imperial Conference
of 1926, under the chairmanship of Lord
Balfour, in which the component parts of the
Commonwealth were declared to be:
communities within the British
-autonomous
Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate
one to the other in any aspect of their domestic
or external affairs, though united by a common
allegiance to the Crown and freely associated as
members of the British Commonwealth of
Nations.
That is the charter of our land. It is fine
phraseology, which should be memorized by
every child who is educated in a Canadian
school. Let every child be taught love of
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

country and respect and admiration for the
strength, the breadth and the deeds of this
nation. I am a Canadian. I am not an
aggressive Canadian in the sense of being
quarrelsome with or objectionable to other
peoples, for I would be friendly with them all.
I am glad that we are discarding that inferiority which is the heritage of a colonial status,
and I should like to sec us realizing more
fully in the future than we have in the past
the dignity of our position as a nation.
So I sympathize thoroughly with those who
have proposed this measure; but I say ta them
that in view of the rapidity with which it has
been brought forward, the handling which it
has received in one of our halls of parliament,
and under these circumstances its unpopularity
in the province from which I come, it would
be better and wiser for us as a legislature to
bring about at least some period of delay.
For that reason I propose to vote against the
bill.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: At the outset of his
remarks he said he was against this measure,
whose object is to change the name of our
national holiday from "Dominion Day" to
"Canada Day." Yet he has left me under the
impression that he is very much in favour of
all those changes which have taken place since
1867, and which he has been enumerating for
the last half hour. I cannot reconcile his
approval of all those changes with his opposition to the change of one word.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: That is not a question; that is the subject of a long speech.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: As the honourable
gentleman says, that was the subject of my
speech. While I sympathize with the proposed
change and sec the reasons that have been
advanced for it, I am of the impression that
we who wish to make progress in matters
Canadian should hold our hand at the moment
until a greater advocacy has carried the day.
In the course of my remarks I have said
many things which I think should be repeated
in the province of Ontario, so that when this
measure comes before us a second time-as it
will, and I hope in perhaps a slightly different
form-it may be carried unanimously.
Hon. GUSTAVE LACASSE: Honourable
senators, to ease the minds of my colleagues I
will say that I intend ta hold the floor for
only about fifteen minutes this evening, and
then adjourn the debate until tomorrow.
An Hon. SENATOR: Go ahead.

MAY 20, 1946
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: I could bold the
floor for about five hours, if I were allowed,
but I do flot want to impose myself on thebouse at length right now.
Hon. Mr.
tonigbt.

HORNER:

Go

rigbt

ahead

Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: I arn just indicating
in an indirect way how much more can be said
in faveur of the bill than so far has been said
agaiflst it.
Evidently, honourable senators, since the
proposai to change one single word in the
statutes of Canada is causing such a commotion on this otberwise beautiful and very
serene bill of parliament, not enough oil was
spread over the angry waves of our stormy
seas during the many weeks of debate on
oleomargine. I irccall that in the first comments published in many Canadian newspapers upon the debate on this issue in another
p lace, there occurred such expressions as "a
tempest in a teapot"ý-that was not very new,
but rather worn out; 1 mean the expression,
not the pot-"'nothing but piffle," and "a silly
bill," which last terni bas since been glorified
in this bouse. Wby is a so-called "bagatelle"
now causing sucb a sensational and noisy discussion? I arn confident that my humble
remarks will answer that question, if flot tonight, tomorrow.
When this bill No. 8 reacbed the Senate,
after its mysterious wanderings between the
two bouses, its fate looked very gloomy indeed. Nobody seemed over-anxious to pick
up the orpban chîld left on our door-step,
althougb it had been ricbly wrapped in an
imposing majority before being brouglit here
in the tbick of night. 1 myseif was almost
convinced, riglit then and there, that we rmigbt
neyer see the dawn of "Canada Day." Fortunately, a good Sarnaritan went to, the rescue
of the freezing cbild, picked it up tenderly,
pressed it to his fatherly bosom and placed
it wbere it belonged. That good man was
our honourable colleague from Saint John
(Hon. Mr. Foster), wbo neyer before, I arn
sure, bad justified bis naine to such a glorious
extent.
Some Hon. SENATOR.S: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: But how fared his
adopted son frorn then on? That I shahl
endeavour to describe as briefly as possibleif not tonight, then tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Neyer put off until
tornorrow wbat you can do today.
An Hon. SENATOR: The night is quite
Young.
63268-I9J

273

Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: 0f course, we cannot
ahl "say it with sugar", like my bonourable
friend from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaihiancourt) but I wihl honestly try-to refrain from
using harsh words to express my indignation
over the rutbless treatment to which, at times,
the poor little one was subjected. I shahl not
follow the example of some bonourable memnbers and quote from the Sacred Book, for
fear that my words sbouhd be taken for Gospel
truth-a presumption that migbt not be justified in this Gothic chamber.
I said a moment ago that this bill bad ail
tbe appearance of a still-born baby wben it
came to us. My bonourable friend frorn
Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) volunteered to
allay my apprehiension and ailuded pathetically to the fate of certain captured persons
in Europe who are accused of war crimes.
He said:
The reports say they will most certainly be
given a fair trial . . . and also that they most
certainly will be shot.
May I suggest to my legal friend the folhowing inscription over the lofty entrance of
certain courts-and jeven houses of parliament:
Know ye who enter this abode that this
tribunal is impartial, but that, because of its
human frailty, or deep-rooted prejudices, it is
sometimes not quite impartial. Ye therefore
who are already flirting with the executioner's
axe, trust your luck more than your lawyer. ý
In other woids, it is the "morituri te saluttainus" of ancient Roman days. I hope the
most distinguishied member of the Canadian
Bar does not su, far despair of human justice
and fair trial. If bie does, I plead guilty. of
contempt of court on bis bebaîf. Irrespective
of it ail, however, I do not feel today as pessimistie as I then did over the possible "dawn
of Canada Day."
I now leave it to honourable members to
express their opinion as to, whether I shouhd
proceed or not.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Before I move
adjournment of the debate I should like to,
clarify an aspect of the bill because it will
apply to wbat bas been stated by my honourable friend fromn Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) and while the expression is fresh
in everybody's memory I may as well tackle it.
,Even before my honourable friend referred
to the suddenness and haste, made more
emphatic by adding indecent, witb which the
measure was carried in another place, much
along the saine lines had ahready been said
in this debate. So far as suddenness and haste
are concerned, may j with the indulgence of

SENATE

a letter he wrote on that very issue? Before
quoting the letter I want to make it clear to
all concerned that although I am not a lawyer
I claim to know enough about parliamentary
procedure to pronounce that this is not a
private bill; it is a public bill. According to
parliamentary rules and practice there are
three kinds of bills-government bills., private
members' public bills, and private bills sponsored by private members. Am I right or
am I wrong? I submit that this is a public
bill, moved, presented and sponsored by a
private member. It is absolutely wrong to
call it, either in the press or in the house,
a private bill. I want to make that plain. It
is emphasized in this letter which appeared
in Saturday Night of April 27 last. I think
it is important that it be placed on Hansard
in order to answer the question at issue. This
is the letter:
I was highly surprised at the heat and the irrelevancies that permeated your (S.N. April 13)
article entitled "Let's Keep Dominion Day."
It is not really my intention of discussing
the merits or the demerits of Bill No. 7, an Act
respecting Canada Day, presented by Mr. Philéas
Côté, M.P. for Matapédia-Matane, P.Q., but I
would like, however, to discuss and rectify some
of the comments that you wrote about this
question.
You make the following statement: "One of
these times was when we learned that the House
of Commons after an hour or two of debate and
without a wor-d of previous notice has decided
to change the name of Dominion Day to Canada
Day." The facts are as follows: The promoter
of this bill had to follow all the necessary proceedings on public bills, which are covered by
standing order 69 of Beauchesne's Parliamentary
Rules & Forms, second edition, which reads as
follows: "Every bill is introduced upon motion
for leave, specifying the title of the bill; or upon
motion to appoint a committee to prepare and
bring it in. Citation 736-Every member who
wishes to introduce a bill must give eight hours'
notice, which appears in the Votes and Proceedings and on the Orders of the Day."
This was fully done and in fact its introduction was placed on the Votes and Proceedings at
the very beginning of this session.
I would direct the attention of honourable
members to those words, "at the very beginning of this session."
It had its first reading on March 27 and its
second
third readings on April 2, so that all
the necessary notices that are required were
fully complied with. As for its deliberations, it
took nearly a full day of the time of the bouse,
so no one could argue that it was rushed through.
And you write as follows: "Is it preciseiy democratie to set about the job by sneaking in private
billsAgain "private bills", which is wrong.
-to delete the official uses of the terms one by
one?" The writer should know that the bill was
not a private bill, but a public bill presented
by a private member, and so that this point will
be well understood, I will cite citation 741 of
S.O. 69 of Beauchesne. "A public bill is introduced as a measure of public policy in which the
Hou. Mr. LACASSE.

land

whole community is interested and originates on
the motion of some member of the house in
which the bill is introduced."
In the second last paragraph, you seem to
make the wish that this bill will not be passed
by the Sen.ate. The Senate bas "a gorgeous
opportunity to insist that this business shall not
be rushed through by a snap vote,-This apparently will not take place here.
-in total defiance of one of the most vital rules
of parliamentary procedure," that "only in the
case of the most urgent emergency is a bill put
through all three readings at one session." This
is the most startling statement of the whole
article. I don't know of any such parliamentary
procedure, and I am positive that the writer
could not show it to me either. So that such
procedure will be fully understood I will quote
S.0. 73 of Beauchesne, which fully covers that
argument: "Every bill shail receive three several
readings on different days, previously to being
passed. On urgent or extraordinary occasions,
a bill may be read twice or thrice, or advanced
two or more stages in one day. Citation 749It is occasionally the custom to pass bills through
their different stages at one and the same sitting.
That course, however, is never taken except in
cases of extreme urgency and with the general
assent of the bouse. It is for the bouse to declare whether there is such urgency as to require
the rapid passage of a measure; and whenever
the sense of the bouse is to take more than one
stage on the same day, the Speaker bas permitted it to be done.
I must repeat that all the necessary precautions have been taken, and the parliamentary
rules and forms have been strictly followed. Any
other actions would have been strongly and diligently dealt with by the members in the House
of Commons and would not have been allowed to
be proceeded with.
Your editorials and articles are generally so
accurate, that I'm sure you would not want to
see the inaccuracies that I just mentioned not
being rectified.

FEEDING STUFFS BILL

lion. Mir. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of Bill 61, an Act to amend the Yukon
Quartz Mining Act.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On the order:
Third reading of Bill 64, an Act to aiend the
Feeding Stuifs Aet, 1937.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Ilonourable senators will recall that we gavc second reading
to this bill yesterday. Since thon the Law
Clerlc lias sent me a memorandum saaing lie
thinks that some of the phraseology in the
bill might ho improved. Therefore, witb
beave, I would move that the bill be nut
now read a third time but that it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce. At the meeting of that committee
tomorrow morning there wiil be ani opportunity to consider the Law Clerk's suggestions. Perhaps someone from thc department
will ho present as well.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: Honourablc senators,
may 1 asic the bionourable leader of the govcrnment if this bll miglît not ho more suitably rcferred to the Standing Commiittcc on
Natural Resourees? It secms to me thiat that
cummittce should be given some work to do.
1 know a similar suggestion was made somne
years ago wben the Riglit Honourable Mr.
Meighien was leading the Sonate, andilhe
agreed to it at once. There may ho something
un this bill doaling witb commerce, and if so
the appropriate counmittee would no doubt ho
the one mentioned by the honourable leader.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The Committee on
Natural Resources is very busy at the present
time, conducting the inquiry into metalliferous mines. The bill bas to do not with the
character of feeding stuffs, but with packaging
and labeliing.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I knew thiat the
Commnittee on Naturel Resources xvas very
busy, and I thought action on the bill would
ho facilitated by a reference to the Banking
and Commerce Committee. which is meeting
tomorrow morning. The bill is apparently a
border-lino one that could be approprýately
referred to, eitber of the committees montioned, but unless there is serious objection
1 should like to have the reference to tbe
Banking and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. HARDY: In view nf wbat the
bonourable leader lias said, I tbink it is quito
right that the reference ho to that committee.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

CANADA DAY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterd'ay the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Foster for the second reading of Bill 8, an Act
respecting Canada Day.
Hon. G. LACASSE: Last night I concentrated most of my remarks with respect to this
bill on a description of the my5teri.ous Odyssey
of the bill which is at long last before us, and
which almost failed to reach our shores. I
then made it abundantly clear that this is a
public bill and that all concerned, including
the press, had been given ample time to study
all its aspects and to educate publie opinion
according to.their respective views regarding
it. Yes, there was ample time for "a period of
advocacy," such as suggested by my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck).
This afternoon I propose to deal with the
various reactions, as I observed and recorded
them, whic'h this bill, since its rather enthusiastic endorsation by the elective branch of the
Parliament of Canada, has provoked on the
part of this chamber, on the part of the public,
and in the press of Canada. I hope that in
so doing I shall convince the house, and even
my honburable friend from Toronto-Trinity,
that this measure is not quite as unpopular as
we have been told. I shall emphasize no more
than is necessary the poor spirit of hospitality
exhibited by this house when the bill reached
us in its normal course, and I shall refrain
from describing the "silly discussion"-to use
a term honourable members are now fully
conversant with-which took place on that
occasion.
Leaving that first skirmish behind, I shall
now try to analyse and sum up all the argu-

ments advanced by the speakers who have
expressed opposition to the name "Canada
Day" and I shall endeavour to reply to each
of them as effectively as possible. Before proceeding with my summary, I wish to extend
my compliments to those who have unreservedly favoured the bill. I have in mmd
particularly my honourable friend from Saint
John (Hon. Mr. Foster). One cannot but
admire his courageous and patriotic stand on
this matter; and I respectfully add that few
of us are as qualified as he is, from the standpoint of personal sorrow, to discuss this issue.
I would emphasize that all the honourable
gentlemen who spoke in favour of the bill
clearly and definitely stated their views and
the way they intend to vote. This cannot be
said of most of the speakers who, more or less
reluctantly, are opposed to the measure. It is
plain to see that most of them do not know
on which leg to stand.
We heard first from our honourable friend
from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr. Farris). I
am sorry I was away when he spoke, but
my absence was qu.ite justified since I was
attending a ceremony which was much more
symbolic of unity than the exhibition this
house is now giving-the wedding of my eldest
daughter.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: All honourable senators will agree that the honourable gentleman
is a lawyer and a debater of outstanding
ability; they will recall also that he sometimes excels in the art of cutting a bill to
pieces, and then voting for it.
We heard from our honourable friend from
Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Duff)Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: -who attacked the
bill from all possible angles and with all the
earnestness of a native son of Canada. Though
I listened to his remarks attentively, I may
say with all due respect that I failed to discover any connection between the adoption
of the name "Canada Day" and the safety of
the British Crown or the danger of Communism. On that score I should like to refer
the honourable gentleman to the very apt
replies of his "fellow-sinners", the honourable
senators from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
MeGeer) and Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck). This is where consistency in the
argument begins-or ends before it begins.
We then heard from the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) for whom I have always
had great respect and a certain admirationthe more so now, since, in the speech he

Z1ý

SENATE

delivered, he showed more caution and ability
than even an admiral displays in avoiding the
explosive mines that infest his uncharted
course. May I say to the honourable gentleman, however, that on an issue as important
as the one we are now discussing, one expects
more than an after-dinner speech from a party
leader in this house. We are proud to be
Canadians, he said. Of course we are, and I
challenge him to vote against the bill, if he
meant what he said. But the fact is that we
do not yet know how he is going to vote, for
his concluding remarks were to this effect: I
do not want to vote for the bill, and I do not
want to hurt the feelings of many of my bonourable friends by voting against it. Is there
anything clear and definite about that? That
is the brand of leadership which the honourable leader is giving to his followers in this
house.
As to the most uncalled for remarks of my
honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) I shail say very little, because here
again one of his "fellow-sinners", who presumably intends to vote against the bill, has
already replied in a very clever, though indirect, manner, by an eloquent eulogy to the
outstanding contributions of the French
Canadian to the public life of Canada. He
could have added that if the number of
French Canadian soldiers were calculated on
the basis of enlistments throughout the nine
provinces of Canada-which for some mvsterious reason was never done-the total would
compare most favourably with the figure for
any other racial group in the country. In
passing may I draw the attention of my honourable friend from Parkdale to the too-easilyforgotten fact that this bill was seconded in
the other place by a member who represents a
constituency very close to his own senatorial
division, in the heart of Ontario; and that it
is jointly sponsored in this house, not by two
senators from Quebec, but by one from New
Brunswick and one from his own province of
Ontario.
Our thunderous friend from VancouverBurrard (Hon. Mr. McGreer) also spoke. It
is always a pleasure to listen to him. The
honourable gentleman excels, probably because be is an outstanding lawyer and is
used to the ways of the courtroom, in bending
his logic to meet the necessities of the moment.
After having made a very forceful plea in
favour of the bill on the basis of the overwhelming majority it received from the
elected representatives of the people, he
smartly turned about and from the statutes
of Canada dug out new arguments to justify
more or less effectively his eventual opposition to the measure.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

I never dare say anything bad of what "falls"
from the eloquent lips of a lady, such as the
sympathetic senator from Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Fallis); but I sharply differ with her
view that the press is always a true reflection
of public opinion. Honourable senators know
that I am somewhat familiar with "newspapering." In the publishing game as well as in
Parliament, it often happens that followers
lead and leaders foilow. I must give credit
to the honourable lady for clearly stating her
opposition to the bill.
She deserves our
admiration for many reasons, but particuarly
because she was one of the few, if not the only
one who, in opposing the bill, clearly stated
the intention of voting against it.
I come now to our solemn and unctuous
friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon.
Mr.
Roebuck).
I must confess that this time,
which in all fairness to him I hasten to say
is an exception, his arguments fell desperately
short of the mark. In fact, I could net possibly make a better speech in support of
"Canada Day" than he himself did last night.
The removal of two or three sentences from
his address, or five at the most, is all that
would be required to accomplish the miracle.
I will go further and say that his action would
be more consistent with what he said if he
decided to vote for the bill. I replied last
night to his criticism that the bill had been
brought forward in the other house hastily.
What I shall say in a moment will, I hope,
meet his argument as to the alleged general
unpopularity of the measure.
So much for the arguments used against the
bill, which were few in number and, it seems
to me, very weak indeed. Having analysed
the Senate's reaction, in so far as it bas been
expressed in opposition to the bill, I will now
proceed to study the reaction of the public,
as expressed in conversation or by written
communication. J have received but two letters voicing objection to the proposed change.
As other letters have been read in this debate,
I should like to quote these. The first is from
the Business and Professional Women's Club
of Windsor, Ontario. No street address is
given, but I am generous enougb to feel that
the letter is authentic, and J sent a reply,
addressed to Windsor. If the club failed to
receive it, the echoes from this debate will
prove that at least I paid some attention to
the letter. With it was enclosed a resolution,
reading as follows:
Resolution 'passed at the business meeting,
April 16, 1946.
Whereas the name "Dominion of Canada" was
chosen by the Fathers of Confederation and,
Whereas the words "Dominion of" were pur-

posely placed in the name of our country, and,

MAY 21, 1946

7

'Whereas the'omission of the word "Dominion"~
entirely removes the lofty significance and origin
of the name-Psalm 72-8, "He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river
unto the ends of the earth."
Therefore be it resolved that the name "Dominion Day" be continued as the name of this
national holiday established to commemorate
the confederation of the Dominion of Canada.

There is my reply to the National Executive
of the Association of Canadian Clubs-supplied
to me by somne of their friends. I thank them
for the accoriimodation. Who d'oes hot kn.ow

I arn waiting for applause from among those
who are opposed to the bill. They seemn to
be lacking in the enthusiasm which they have
displayed on other occasions.
The next letter is a funny one. At least,
I will make it funny, with ail due respect for
those who addressed it to, me. It cornes fromn
the Association of Canadian Clubs of Canada,
at Ottawa. Honourable members will understand why 1 emphasize the word "Canadian".
I suppose everyý member of the Senate received a copy.

"Drink Canada Dry"?

Some hon. SENATORS:

No.

Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It reads as follows:
At a meeting of the 'National Executive of
the Association of Canadian Clubs, held in
Ottawa last week, the question of changing the
name of Dominion Day to Canada day was discussed and the following resolution was passed,
namely:
"That ancient landmarks should not be removed without considera-tion. A step of that
nature should not be taken as a Bill in the name
of a private member without notice to the
public, and there has been no manifest desire
of the public throughout Canada to have the
name changed. Dominion Day was chosen for
historic and spiritual reasons and it has a
spiritual and national significance which the
Fathers of Confederation foresaw when they
chose it."
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Who signed that?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It is sign'ed by Lois

W*heeler, National Secretary.
I would have been less surprised to, receive
such a letter from the Sons of England or the
Daughters of tire Emýpire. From themn it would
have shown consistency with their ideals. To
demonstrate the inconsistency of the stand
taken by the National Executive -of the Association of Canadian Clubs, 1 dare ask: Why
do they not cahl their organization "dominion
clubs"? 1 wonder if it ever occurred to the
patriotic and loyally inspired members of that
organization that the title "Canadian Club"
sounds much like the widely-advertised, trade
name of a most popular beverage? This, by
the way, is an indirect reply to the following
wise-.crack in the editorial page of the usually
more serious Ottawa Journal:
"Canada Day" sounds much hike the widelyadvertised trade name of a certain sof t drink.
63268-20

the name "Canadian Club"?
Hon. Mr. ASSELTINE: Ras the honourable memnber ever heard of the advertisement
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Sure, I have. Mixed

with something else, Canadian Club for instance, it is after ahl an example of unity.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. LAC ASSE:- I have referred to the
reaction to this bill on the part of this chamaber and on the part of the public. I now corne
to the reaction in the press. This is a very
important point. I do not want te, bore
honourable senators with long quotations, but
I think they are essential to prove to ahl concerned, particularhy to those who dlaim that
the measure is most unpopular, that if there
was one occasion when they were wrong this
ns it. Somýe of those who have opposed the
bill and have expressed their reasons for s0
doing in the course of this debate have based
their stand more or less entirely on the reaction of the press. They contend that the
press is a true reflection of public opinion.
Differing as I do very sharply with this last
contention, I pick up their challenge on their
chosen ground and, with the permission of tbe
Senate, will endeavour to prove that the press
of Canada is far from being unanimous in
voicing its opposition to this bill.
While my material is coming from thé
library I will take the opportunity of telling
a story týo justify the point I am making.
Once upon a time in one of the largest cities
in Canada a man offered himself for election
as mayor, and all five daily newspapers of the
city were unanimoqsly against him. A true
reflection of public opinion, you say. Or was
it? To prove that it was not, I may say that
he was elected by an overwhelming mai ority.
I think my honourable friend fromn Alma
(Hon. Mr. Baîhantyne) knows the personage
I arn referrring to.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Very well.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: The same thing happened to Roosevelt in the hast presidential
ehection.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: On the night of bis
ehection the man I have referred to was
paraded tbrough the streets of Montreal-I
have named the city. He spoke from the
office steps of each of the newspapers which
liad opposed him, thanking thern for their

EIVISED mEnI

280

SENATE

"iwarm support"; and, rather bluntlyý, he
addcd, "I thank you, my dear friends, because
had I been supported by you I don't think I
would have been elected." This shows that
in many cases the press does flot truly reflect
public opinion, particularly in what we eall
"1one-paper" towns. 1 wishi to make it plain
that I arn not referriog here to Kingston or to
Lethbridge, where two honourable senators
publish newspapers; but in many other onepaper towns public opinion is simply dictated
to by the newspaper publishers, who seem to
have adopted as their slogan, "Believe or
die." That is one of many reasons why it is
healthy for Canada te have a Senate.
I do flot intend to read long newspaper
editorials, although the newspaper quotatien
placed on record by one of my honourable
frieods was the main part of his speech,
On April 13, 1946, the Montreal Standardand it is not a French language newspapercontained this editorial:
With the change from Dominion Day to Canada-Day as the namne for our July 1 celebration,
not many Canadians will be greatly concerned.
What should conceriu them, however, is to know
that this country is offlcially Canada and te
makze that name mor-e widely known around the
world.
The British North America Act declares that
"the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick shahl form and he one Dominion under
the namne of Canada ...
ami througheut the
Act and its many amendinents the country is
referred to simply as "Canada."
The Great
Seal of the country centains the word "Canada"
and no reference to "dominion."
These f acts would have littie importance were
it net that Cana<la's growiiig stature has made
her naine more widely kno-wn. Throughout
Europe. wherevcr Canadian troops have been
stationed, their shoulder patelies with the word
"Canada" on them, the saine naine emblazeneci
on Canadian Arm.y vehicles, lias coîne to mean
sometliing to people. Surely it sheuld mean as
much te Cana(lians at home, and to the Members
of Parliament w-ho î'epresent them!
My second quetatien is from a newspaper
published in the very city of my honourable
friend from Vancouver South (Hon. Mr.
Fari-is), and it shows that there public opinion
against the bill is hy ne means unanimous.
The Vancouver News-Herald of April 8, 1946,
carried an editorial from which I quote the
following extracts:
The change would he ail te the good. There is
ne particular reaseîî for emphiasizing "dominien"
status en our major national hioliday , new that
we are a ce-equal parteer of the British coinmonwealth -.
The fact that the move te change "Dominion
Day" te "Canada Day" carried by a majerity of
123 te 62 in the House of Conîmons shows that
Canada, at last is gox-erned mainly by representatives whese first loyalty is te Canada
But it is a logical change, and one whichi *'
is
bound te cerne in time.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE.

I have several more editorials which I wish
te bring to the attention of honourable senators, but as the honouýable leader of the house
bas asked me te adjourn the debate te enable
members to attend a caucus this afternoon,
I shaîl postpone the reading of these editorials
te the next sitting of the house.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Lacasse the debate
was adjourned.

CITIZENSHIP BILL

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second

Hle said: I have asked the honourable
senator fromn Toronto (Hon. Mr. gRayden) to
explain this bill.
Hon, S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators,
this bill deals with
63268-20À

citizensliip,

nationality,

M8

naturalization and the status of aliens in
Canada. A casual readmng of the bill does
not, I think, convey the real meaning of
what we are seeking to do at this time in
establishing a definite rank of citizenship to
be extended to those whom we regard as
worthy to become citizens of this country.
Citizenship cannot he defined by metes and
bounds, any real conception of citizenship
must have in it something of the spirit. -May
I, therefore, take a moment to present what I
conceive to be the spirit of citizenship, and the
regard which we should have for citizenship in
Canada, quite apart from the qualifications,
limitations and conditions with which, we
should surround the granting of that right to
people who come to our shores? There has
been wide opportunity for discussion of thîs
bill throughout the country, and there appears
to be a reasonably unanimous opinion that it
is about time that Canada set a standard of
citizenship such as might reasonably be expected of hier as one of the ranking nations in
the world today. Why it was not done sooner,
I do not know. Why it was not done shortly
after the Statute of Westminster, as I think it
reasonably and logically should have been
done, I arn not in a position to say. However,
better late than neyer, and we have finally got
around to doing it now. In a word, my conception of citizenship is pride of country; it is
the objective that the people of a country have
over and above their personal and partisan
views upon domestie issues; it is a sort of
badge or label, a very prized possession, by
which we mark those whom we regard as being
sufficiently înspired with pride and love of
country to consider their country and its welfare above ahl else.
May I quote a brief passage which. I think
expresses that idea of love of country clearly

and concisely? It is an extract from a famous
speech that a famous man by the name of
Burke made in the British House of Coin.mens when speaking on the question of con-

ciliation with America.

Though these words

were first uttered in 1775, I think they still are
a good description of what it is that constitutes
real citizenship. This is what Burke said:
Do you imagine then, that it. us the land tai
which raises your revenue? That it la the annual
vote in the committee of supply whieh gives you

In oCher words, citizenship is a great inspirationa] quality which should be a focal point
for ail the cnergy, earncstness, courage and
industry of the peuple of a country.
After these few preiiminary remarks, may I
say that this bill seeks te croate some basic
and clear conception of what Canadian citizenship shall be. The purpose of the bill is to
ereate a sort of badge whici pecople may use
for -the purpose of ccystallizing tlheir love of
country. Many of the provisions of this bill
are not new, but are contained in varions
sections of other statutes, w'Lcre they wiii
continue to haveo effeet untilthiis bill becomes
law. 0f the fortv-sev en sections in the Liil,
at least eightecn correspond substantiallvy with
sections of the Naturalization Act. The bill
aiso centains provisions t-hat are now te bc
found in flic Immigration Act, and possibiy in
,thc Canadian Natienals Act. The N.aturalizatien Act prox idcs that aiiens who corne to
Canada and compiy with prescribed conditions

Hon. Mc. LEGER: Section 26 says that a

MAY 22, 1946

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is right. But
a British subject is not necessarily a Canadian
citizen.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is what I want to
get at.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Under this bill a
Canadian citizen is a British subject; but in
reverse it does not follow that a British
subject is necessarily a Canadian citizen.
Under this bill a British subject does not
become a Canadian citizen until he has complied with certain requirements. It is an
interesting question to raise, and I am not
yet satisfied with the answer I have given.
Those born in Canada prior to the enactnent
of this bill have acquired citizenship by right
of birth. You may say, "I was born, raised
and educated and I have conducted my. business in Canada. What more does it give me
now to call myself a Canadiari citizen?" To
the person who approaches the question with
that materialistic view it is very difficult to
make any convincing answer. But surely there
is something in this quality of citizenship, of
being able under our law to call ourselves
Canadian citizens, and of facing the people
of every country in the world with the proud
declaration: "We are a nation; we have our
distinct nationality and our distinct citizenship." Now, it may be asked, what does it
mean in dollars and cents? I do not suppose
it means anything.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Will my honourable
friend excuse a question? He bas said that if
this bill is passed, as not doubt it will be,
we shall be termed Canadian citizens. He
has also stated that as Canadian citizens we
are British subjects. Under the Statute of
Westminster we became an independent, selfgoverning nation. After this bill is passed are
we still to be considered British subjects?
What does that mean?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Today the King of
Great Britain and Ireland is also the King of
Canada. My conception of the terni "British
subject" is that we are subjects of the king,
as that designation is used now.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: We are subjects of the
King of Canada. Does that make us British
subjects?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Surely.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: My friend is sticking
at words; I can take those words in one leap.

The King of Great Britain and Ireland is also
the King of Canada, and we have seen fit to
preserve the designation of British subject
which has come down to us. It is a well-known
designation and common throughout the
length and breadth of the British Commonwealth of Nations:- If some people do not like
it and prefer another, I am not in a position
to express any opinion on that. I am telling
honourable members now what the bill provides, I am explaining why it does so, and
I am expressing my own views in support of
the bill.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: I do not wish to be
classed among those who object to being called
British subjects. That is not what I have in
mind at all. As a Canadian citizen, a member of a self-governing autonomous nation,
because the King of Great Britain and IreIand is also King of Canada must I be termed
a British subject? As a citizen of Canada,
what obligation am I under to Great Britain,
and to being termed a British subject? Dô
I make myself clear?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I enjoy answering
these questions so far as I am able to. I do
not believe you are under any obligation.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Why should we be
called British subjects?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: You were born
that way.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: All this bill says is
that a Canadian citizen is a British subject.
You ask me why. My answer is that all the
people of the British Commonwealth of
Nations have heretofore been known as
British subjects.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: They have not lost
what they already have.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If this bill provided
that Canadian citizens would cease to be
British subjects I am sure there would be
many more voices raised than the voice of the
honourable senator. But he is entitled to ask
the question. I say the designation British
subject is something we have enjoyed, and
certainly I do not feel any weight on my
shoulders in continuing to carry it, as well as
the proposed designation of Canadian citizen.
I am one of those who feel that we should
not periodically raid the places where we
preserve our national monuments and say:
They have been up long enough. Let us tear
them down to make way for newer and more
recent models.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

284

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: My view has been,
and I still hold it, that it is a wholesome
thing for nations as well as individuals to
mark great events in their history by milestones along the way, and to preserve those
monuments.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not want to
interrupt my honourable friend, but I should
like to clear up a point in my mind and perhaps in the minds of some other members.
When you are spoken of as a British subject,
it means you are a subject of the King of
Canada; you have no obligation to the
British Government?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. It is the continuance of an existing designation. It does not
mean that the Government of the United
Kingdom bas any authority or control over
a citizen of Canada-nor indeed of Australia
or of any other of the self-governing
Dominions.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: That is what I say. I
want to go on record as not objecting to
being classed as a British subject-far from it.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I thought I should
first deal with the description of "British subject," because a great deal of attention bas
been focussed upon this provision. It was
necessary for me to find out that a British
subject who bas acquired Canadian domicile
will on the enactment of this bill become a
A British subject after
Canadian citizen.
one year's continuous residence in Canada
may become a Canadian citizen by doing certain things. He must apply directly to the
minister--that is the Secretary of Statedeclaring bis wish to become a Canadian
citizen. Then he must satisfy the other
requirements, the principal ones being that,
as well as having some education, he shall
have an understanding of the privileges and
responsibilities of citizenship; that he shall
take the oath of allegiance; that he shall
satisfy the residential requirement, which
means residence in Canada for four years
out of the six years immediately preceding
bis application. In other words, in order that
a British subject may become qualified for
citizenship, five years' residence is still necessary, in the same way that five years' residence is necessary before, under the provisions
of the Immigration Act, a British subject
ceases to be liable to deportation for any of
the causes specified in that statute. So you
have a correlation between the two statutes.
Hon. Mr. WHITE: But that does not
place the British subject in a more favour·able position than any other immigrant
coming to Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
I am glad my
honourable friend raised that question, because I intended to deal with it next. If the
honourable gentleman will read the bill he
will find that it does provide for a more
favourable position.
Under section 10, subsection 1, an alien
coming to Canada must satisfy certain requirements. Instead of going through the
simple procedure of making an application
to the minister, as a British subject may do,
the alien must make an application to the
court. He must also satisfy the other requirements. I may say that under this bill
it is more difficult for an alien to become a
Canadian citizen than under the Naturalization Act. Under that act an alien could
satisfy the residential qualifications by living
for four out of the five years in any of the
countries of the British Empire. Under the
present bill bis residence must be in Canada.
The difference is this. Under the Naturalization Act an alien who resided for four
years in any part of the British Empire and
one year in Canada could satisfy the residential qualifications. whereas, under this bill
be must for four of the last six years hava
resided in Canada. If be satisfies that requirement bis application is beard by the court
some three months liter, and if the court
approves the application it is conveyed to
the minister who m"iy, if he cees fit, grant
a certificate. May I definitely say that this
bill takes nothing away from the British
subject.
His position is better than that
of an alien, the position of whom under this
bill is more difficult than under the Naturalization Act.
I thought honourable senators might be interested in the position of women under this
measure. I can safely say that it goes further
than any provision in other countries respecting women. For instance, a non-Canadian
woman who marries a Canadian may, under
the provisions of this bill. become a Canadian
citizen after a residence of one year and upon
application for a certificate of citizenship. At
the present time a non-Canadian woman who
is married to a Canadian-for instance a
soldier-may upon application secure a certificate of Canadian citizenship immediately.
After the passage of this measure a Canadian
woman who marries a non-Canadian retains
her Canadian citizenship, even if she does
nothing about it and takes no action to that
end. If she marries a person who for some
of the reasons stated in the bill ceases to be
a Canadian citizen, she can by some positive
act within six months renounce ber citizenship.
There is provision generally which enables
women who marry non-Canadians to renounce

MAY 22, 1946
their citizenship, and also under certain circumstances and upon application to the minister, to regain or recapture it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If an alien woman
marries a Canadian-a British subject--does
she then become a British subject?
Hon. Mr. HiAYDEN: After the passage of
this bill an alien woman who marries a
Canadian could after one year apply for and
obtain a certificate -of Canadian citizenship.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Does she become a
Britishn sub.iect immediately upon marrying
a Canadian?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. This is a Canadian citizenship bill and does not deal with
the question of British subjects. She would
only become a Britishn subi ect after she biecame a ýCanadian citizen.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Does an alien wbo
marries a Canadian woman have to go through
the samne procedure as any other alien in
order to obtain citizenship?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Is the honourable
gentleman speaking of a situation wbere the
husband is an alien?
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Then he would definitely have to follow the saine procedure.
Hon. Mr. DuTREMBLAY: Under the Englisin law would a Canadian citizen retain the
advantages whicb hie has previously enjoyed?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: A Canadian citizen is
a British subject, and therefore when hie is
travelling anywbere in the British Empire
be enjoys nîl the rights of a British subject,
and further, lie bas ahl the rigints of bis own
nationality.
May I say, honourable senators, that I think.
we have jumped into the middle of this bill,
and I should now like to get back to my
explanation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG : May I' ask one more
question? An American citizen wbo marries
a Canadian woman does not, of course, lose
bis citizenship; but does she become, an
American citizen if she so wishes?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: A Canadian woman
marrying an American citizen-assuming they
live in the United States-would not lose ber
Canadian citizenship unless she took some
positive action towards that end. In those
circumstances, under the law of the United
States she would assume the nationality of
ber husband; but aine would have the riglit

285

to make a declaration of retention of Canadian nationality, and could do whatever is
necessary under the law of that country to
disassociate herself from its nationality.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: When the bill goes to
committee it would be interesting to compare
the advantages given to a Canadian citizen
in England and in foreign countries with the
advantages that we give to a Britisher in
Canada. However, I do flot wisb to interrupt
the honourable senator at this time, and suggest that hie should deal with that question at
a later date.'%
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is quite a large
question and I would not attempt to answer
it now. It seems to me that the subI ects
most discussed are the status of a British
subi ect under this bill, and the status of an
alien after becoming a Canadian. citizen. In
this connection I cali attention to Sections 37
and 38 of the bill. Section 38 makes provision
for teaching alien applicants for Canadian
citizenship something of the high responsibilities they assume and the privileges they seoure
through becoming Canadian citizens. I tbink
that is a step in the right direction. Section 39
provîdes that the court proceedings upon the
admission of an alien to Canadian citizenship
and the administering of the oath of ailegiance, shall be attended with appropriate
ceremonies.
There is'ariother provision which I arn sure
will cause honourable senators to feel that they
are gaining some support for a view widely
I refer to, the
expressed in th-is chamber.
discretionary powers vested in the minister.
Honourable senators have a.t various timee
discussed in a ýcritical way the wide discretionary powers of ministers. Under this bill
there is a reversai as regards the position of
the minister. When a judge bas heard an
application for certificate of citizenship, and
bas approved of it, the minister m-ay still
exercise discretion as to whether or not the
certificate should be granted; but by section 14
of the bill, where Vihe ýminister entertains a
doubt as to. the propriety of granting a certificate after it has been approved, it. is his function then to refer the case back to the court
for re-hearing, and the decision of the court
on re.hearing shahl be final andL conclusive. In
other words, the minister bas divested himself
of the discre.tionary power that is found in
other legisiation, and the responsibility is
placed upon the court to investigate any additional information that is available before
making a decision that is final.- Holding the
views that I do with respect to the wide discretîonary powers exercised by ministers, 1

286

SENATE

could not help calling the attention of honourable senators to the fact that this bill takes a
step in the right direction.
As I have said, there are seven parts in this
bill. I have dealt with Part I, which has to do
with natural-born Canadian citizens, and Part
II, respecting Canadian citizens other than
natural-born. I would point out here that
according to section 3, if any person w'ho is a
Canadian citizen under this new law is required
to declare his national status, it will be sufficient for him to declare that he is a Canadian
citizen.
The section reads:
Where a person is required to state or declare
his national status, any person who is a Canadian citizen under this Act shall state or declare
himself to be a Canadian citizen and his statement or declaration to that effect shall be a good
and sufficient compliance with such requirement.
So after this bill is passed, any person who
correctly describes himself as a Canadian citizen will not be told that he has to make a
further declaration as to ancestry or racial
origin.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That section would not
necessarily apply to a person who had come
from a foreign country, would it? There might
be an insistence that be declare his racial
origin.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No one could insist
upon that. Any person who can correctly
declare hirnself to be a Canadian citizen under
this legislation, need make no further declaration of national status.
Hon. Mr. EULER: We know that, but
other people may not.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do not think any
further declaration could be demanded.
I come now to Part III, which deals with
grounds upon which a person may lose his
Canadian citizenship. I think the most interesting section in this part is section 21, which
gives the Governor in Council power to revoke
Canadian citizenship in certain circumstances.
Subsection 1 of that section says:
The Governor in Couneil may order that any
person other than a natural-born Canadian citizen shall cease to be a Canadian citizen if, upon
a report from the Minister, he is satisfied that
the said person either
(a) has, during any war in whieh Canada is
or has been engaged, unlawfully traded or communicated with the enemy or with a subject of
an enemy state or hasd been engaged in or associated with any business which to his knowledge
is carried on in such manner as to assist the
enemy in such war.
Mon. Mr. HAYDEN.

-

Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Is there an appeal from
that order?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No.
Paragraph (d) of that subsection provides
that the Governor in Council may revoke
Canadian citizenship of any person other than
a natural-born Canadian who:
if out of Canada, bas shown himself by act or
speech to be disaffected or disloyal to His
Majesty, or, if in Canada, has been convicted of
treason or sedition by a court of competent
jurisdiction.

any such question would be more appropriately considered in committee.

Io not intend to enter into any discussion
today on the reasons for the enactment of
various orders in council, for I arn attempting to do nothing more than explain the
principle of this bill.
Before leaving Part III, may I call attention to section 25, which says:
Where a person ceases to be a Canadian citizen or a British subject, he shall not thereby be
discharged froin any obligation, duty or liability
in respect of any act or thing done or omitted
before he ceased to be a Canadian citizen or a
British subject.
Part IV has to do with the status of
Canadian citizens and recognition of British
subjects. I bave already pointed out that, as
provided in section 26, a Canadian citizen is
a British subject.
Part V treats of the status of aliens. Section 29, subsection 1, states that an alien may
acquire, hold and dispose of property just as
a natural-born Canadian may. But under
subsection 2 an alien is subject to certain
disabilities. For instance, he cannot vote, and,
except as regards property, he is not entitled
to the rights or privileges of a British subject.
Under section 30 an alien is made triable in
the courts of the land in the same manner as
a natural-born Canadian.
Part VI is headed "Procedure and Evidence."
Most of the provisions in this part, which runs

MAY 22, 1946
from sections 31 to 38, inclusive, correspond
to existing provisions in the Naturalization
Act.
The final sections of the bill, in Part VII,
are general. Section 39 specifles certain matters with respect to whîch the Governor in
Council may make regulations for administering the aet. Section 45 provides for the
repeal of the Naturalization Act and the
Ganadiaù Nationals Act.
I did not deal with the Canadian Nationals
Act, because it does nlot seem to be very
important now. Its purpose, I think, was
the creation of a sort of substitute for the
status of Canadian citîzenship that this bil
sccks to establish. The status of "Canadian
national" was cstablished to meet the need
for one that could be comprehendcd by the
representatives of other countries at meetings
of the League of Nations and other international organizations. Subsection 2 of section
45 preserves the rîghts acquired by people
who corne within the definition of "naturalborn British subject", "naturalized British
subject" and "Canadian national" in the two
acts that are to be repealed. And section 46
says:
Notwithstýnding the repeal of the Naturalization Act and the Canadian Nationals Act, this
Act is flot to be eonstrued or interpreted as deprivinq any person who je a Canadian national,
a British subject or an alien as deflned in the
said Acts or in any other law in force in Canada
of the national status he possesses at the time of
the coming into force of this Act.
I should have mentioned that the births of
children born abroad of Canadian parents are
required to be registercd with the nearest
Canadia.n trade commissioner, diplomatic
office or consul, or with the minister at
Ottawa, within a perîod of two ycars. The
purpose of that is to facilitate in later years
the issuing of certificates of citizenship to
Canadians born outside the country. As hionourable senators know, appointrnent to positions mn the public service and with many
large companies and other institutions in this
country is dependent upon proof that the
applicant is a Canadian citizen or a British
subjeet.
1 have tricd in a general way to give a
broad picture of this bill. My remarks have
been somewhat at random, and because I
attcmpted to answer questions when asked,
regardless of the part of the bill te which
they applied, the explanation has lacked that
continuity which it otherwise might have had.
The bill eannot be said to contain much that
is absolutely new. It is rather a sort of revision and consolidation of existing legîslation
for the purpose of creating the status of Canadian citizenship.

In closing, may I repeat what I said at the
outset, that if we study this bill simply to
sec whether it is constitutionally sound,
whcthcr it does not unduly damage the rights
of minorities, and -whether sectional intercsts
are prese.rved, I do net think we shaîl bc
giving it ahl the consideration it deserves. In
my opinion, thîs is a case wherc we should
have regard to more than the dry bones of
the law. If wc cannot look at the bill from
a higher and nobler point of vicw than that,
we shahl miss the greater part of its significance.
In our approach to this subi ct we should
not lose sight of the spirit that actuatcd the
people of Canada in various gencrations preceding ours. Many of the advantages wc
now enjoy were obtained only after long and
arduous efforts under adverse conditions.
Responsikle government, for instance, was not
achieved until there had been a strugglc
which lasted many years and which could
not have been carried on had the people lacked
vision, courage and perseverance. Confederatien was not a sudden conception, but the
resuit of a process of evolution. In the course
of time and of further evolution we becarne a
nation, with our status set forth in the Statute
of Westminster. Something more tban the
cold, calculating spirit of material ambition
must have been responsible for the sacrifices
that- werc made for the sake of certain ideals.
Some people becarne proscribcd and only
escaped death by leaving the country, and
others lost their lives. What was it that urged
on* the Canadians of those days but pride of
country and the desire We bring about greater
unity arnong the people and a hîgher state of
national development?
That is the sort of thing that goes to make
up this very intangible spirit of eitizenship
that I arn trying to deseribe. I think it is
good for a country and for its people to be
imbued with that spirit. In the United States
it is emphasized to the extent of setting aside
a day in the ycar -on which the people rededicate themselves in cerernonies aIl over
the country with the significant deelaration,
"I am an Arnerican." We might follow that
practice in Canada with the declaration, "I
am a Canadian," and follow it up with the
question "Why arn I a Canadian?" If we did
that sincerely, I believe wc should be able to
work out a solution for many of the problerns
that seem, to disunite rather than unite us
at the present time. If we could only build
up thut common denominator upon which, no
matter what our political views, we could
focus evcry ounce of energy and every
thouglit for the devcloprnent of this country
of ours, it rnight give us greater ability to

SENATE
function as a united whole in our relationship
with the rest of the world. That I am satisfied
is the inspiration that lies behind this bill, and
behind the favourable consideration which it
has received throughout the length and breadth
of Canada.
Here may I ba permitted to quote D'Arcy
MeGee, one of the political leaders who
played a prominent part in bringing about
confederation, and whose eloquence was such
as to sway the people and compel their support of the proposal? He might be described
as a new Canadian at that time, yet he had
already become so enthused and so consecrated
to the country of his adoption that in 1860, in
the legislature of Lower Canada, he said:
I look to the future of my adopted country
with hope though not without anxiety. I sec
in the not remote distance one great nationality
bound like the shield of Achilles by the blue
rim of ocean. I see it quartered into many
communities each disposing of its internal affairs
but all bound together by free institutions, free
intercourse and free commerce. I see a generation of industrious, contented moral men. free
in name and in fact, men capable of maintaining
in peace and in war a constitution worthy of
such a country.

That was' his conception of what Canada
meant. We have progressed a long way since
those days, but there is still much to be done
in the way of developing national unity if this
great nation is to function 100 per cent.
In conclusion I read the words in which the
present Prime Minister in 1925 described his
conception of what this country should be.
A Canada single in aiin and purpose, utilizing
for the good of all what properly is the inheritance of all.
As we have gone along the road we have
progressively made gains and advances in our
political and national life, and I submit that
the setting up of a distinct Canadian citizenship is definitely a real objective gain, because
it provides a focal point upon which we can
direct the energies, the attention, the ability
and the courage of our people, and around
which we can gather and unite many different
and divergent viewpoints. 1 believe therefore
that the bill is essentially a very good thing
for Canada.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I gather from what
the honourable senator has said that a British
subject after one year in Canada bas for all
practical purposes whatever rights a Canadian
citizen has-that is, he can vote, seek public
office, and enter the public service. If so, may
I ask if these privileges are reciprocal throughout the British Empire?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Under the provisions
of the Immigration Act that British subject,
until he bas been five years in Canada, can be
deported; a Canadian citizen cannot be.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: But are these privileges
reciprocal throughout the British Empire?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That I cannot answer.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: If no other
senator wishes to speak at this time, I should
like to congratulate the honourable member
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) on the very
lucid and comprehensive manner in which he
bas explained this bill-and in so doing I know
I shall be expressing the views of all honourable senators.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Those who have
read the bill-and I believe that includes all
of us-reached the conclusion, confirmed by
the honourable senator, that we were Canadian citizens and British subjects long before
this bill was introduced, and will still remain
so after it is eventually enacted. We are
proud indeed at all times to say we are Canadian citizens, and we are equally proud to say
we are British subjects. I am very glad indeed
that under the bill we are to be allowed exactly the same status as we now enjoy. There
are certain commendable features of the bill
in regard to aliens who may desire to become
Canadian citizens. Altogether, speaking as a
private member, I find no objection to the
bill, and once more I wish to heartily congratulate my friend on the very able manner
in which he as explained the measure.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, the question is on the second reading of
this bill. Is it your pleasure to concur?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carriedi
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, it is not a suitable
bill for the Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour. I did not speak on the bill,
but there are some features of it on which I
should like to have further information. I
refer particularly to those _provisions dealing
with the status of women. I think the United
States and one or two of the South American
republics are the only countries where a similar law applies. In my opinion the bill should
go to the Standing Committee on Banking

may find it necessary to put to them in

CANADA

DAY BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Foster for the second reading of Bill 8, an Act
respecting Canada Day.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, before the honourable member from
Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) resumes his speech,
I would direct attention to our, rules. It
will be recalled that last Thursday when the
honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard
(Hon. Mr. MeGeer) was speaking the honourable member from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger)
called attention to an infraction of the rule
against references being made to what had
taken place in the other chamber of parliament. At the time I was of the opinion that,
because of the attention the bill had received
in the newspapers, some latitude should be
allowed in the application of not only this
rule but also the rule governing the reading
of newspaper editorials and comments. During the course of this debate an aiple number of press extracts have been read into
Hansard, and honourable members are now
fully conversant with current public opinion
with regard to the measure. This being so,
I would ask honourable members to confine
their remarks to the bill itself, and to refrain
from quoting any further newspaper editorials
and comments.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.

289

The Hon. the SPEAKER: In this conneemay cite
senators, I
tion, honourable
Bourinot:
It is also irregular to read extracts from
newspapers or documents referring te debates
in the house in the same session. In making
extracts a member must be careful to confine
himself to those which are pertinent to the
question; it is not regular te quote a whole
essay or pamphlet cf a general character.
Neither is it regular for a member toread a
paper which lie is asking the House to order to
be produced. Nor is it in order to read articles
in newspapers, letters or other communications,
whether printed or written, emanating from
persons outside the House, and referring to, or
commenting on, or denying anything said by a
member, or expressing any opinion reflecting on
proceedings within the House.
The rule in regard to reading newspaper
articles should be observed. Short, direct
extracts from newspapers niay be necessary
to round out a speech, but to place on Hansard
copious newspaper editorials and comments
expressing opinions of persons not members of
parliament cannot be considered good practice and certainly is not in accordance with the
rules of the Senate.
With regard to making reference te incidents which occur between the two branches
of parliament there is a very important rule.
This rule is not to be found in our rule
book, but it is generally conceded in the
British parliament and in our own, that such
references do not tend to increase the
amenities that should exist between the two
branches of parliament. I would therefore
ask honourable senators who may speak in
this debate to keep that rule in mind and te
try not to go beyond what is considered
proper.
Hon. Mr. G. LACASSE: Honourable members. I believe the ruling which his honour
the Speaker has just made has some relation
te the "sins" which I have already committed
and to those which I was about to commit.
I cheerfully bow to the ruling of the Chair
because I do not need newspaper editorials
to prove the soundness of my argument. In
view of the fact, however, that a previous
speaker has been allowed te build his whole
3peech on a long newspaper editorial, I think
[ should at least be permitted to give the
names of a certain number of newspapers
without quoting the language used in their
editorials. That would be quite sufficient as
far as the proof of my case is concerned.
It would appear that the size and the
number of books which I have on my desk
have frightened some honourable members
in this chamber; but may I say that it never
was my intention te read any of them from
cover te cover-to have done se would have
bored me as much as the house. I am very

290

SENATE

glad that my speech bas been eut into two
or three slices-or instalments, as we say in
business-because it gives the house a chance
to have short recesses and to digest each
portion of it more quietly.
Honourable members will recall that I was
quoting precisely from the press, before i
adjourned the debate for a second time
yesterday. I quoted short excerpts, but not
long editorials as already had been donc by
somebody else. I used only two extracts
in my previous remarks, and have about a
dozen or more left. But I will not challenge
the ruling of His Honour the Speaker, for
whom I have the utmost respect. My
quotation from an editorial in the Montreal
Standard of April 13 is already on the record,
as is my excerpt from the Vancouver News
Herald of April 8. I had intended today
to read from the Richmond Hil. Liberal of
April 11, but, abiding by the ruling just
enunciated, I shall refrain from doing sa.
However I wish to put the name of the
paper on the record so that honourable
senators may, if they wish, refer to the article
of that date. I call to your attention the
fact that this is an Ontario newspaper.
I should also have liked to read an extract
from the Lethbridge Herald, of April 15.
which is a newspaper well known to this
bouse because one of our members is directing its destiny.
I wish the members of the bouse to be fair
enough under the circumstances to take for
granted that the editorials to which I refer
are sympathetic to my case, and absolutely
authentie.
Another paper from which I would have
quoted is the Toronto Daily Star-another
Ontario newspaper. I intended also to quote
from the Montreal Daily Star, which is a
Quebec newspaper but of English expression,
and I have never heard that it was of Liberal
disposition. Another paper whose name I
should like ta place on the record is the
Newmarket Era and Express. That is another
Ontario newspaper, if you please-even there
they seem to be getting away with it.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Might I say
to my honourable friend that the paper he
bas just mentioned, and the one quoted from
by the honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) are under the same
ownership.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I did not know that;
we do get all kinds of information here. I
was aware of two papers which were in the
same hands, but I did not know of a third
one.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE.

I have another newspaper containing a very
interesting quotation, but honourable members, because of the ruling by his honour, are
deprived of the enjoyment of listening to it.
Apparently one cannot do with newspapers
what one is free to do with the Bible.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I admit, of course,
that the Bible should have a moral priority.
I should have liked to read from the St.
Vital Lance-a Manitoba newspaper, if you
please. Another one from Ontario is the
Huntsville Forester. I am almost ashamed
of my own province. I have an article here
from the Vancouver Sunday Sun, and one
from the Quebec Chronicle and Telegrapha Quebec paper but rather conservative, and
of English expression. I have not mentioned
all the newspapers I have before me, but that
ought to be sufficient. I suggest that those
who are interested might take the names of
the newspapers mentioned and their dates and
check me up to ascertain whether or not I
am honest in my interpretations.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Are they for or against
us?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Apparently his honour
will have to allow me to quote from them
to make my position clear to my honourable
friend. I mentioned earlier in my remarks
that all the papers I was referring to faveur
the bill, and I have already asked honourable
senators to take that for granted, there being
nothing else that I could do about it, under
the circumstances.
Honourable senators will appreciate that the
articles referred to were taken from newspapers published in almost every province in
Canada, which ought to demonstrate and
prove that the substitution of "Canada Day"
for "Dominion Day" would be more popular
throughout the whole country than one might
be led to believe-even in Ontario, whose
premier went to the extent of calling this
bill "an insult to the intelligence of the people
of Canada". Bear that in mind, honourable
senators, before registering your votes for or
against this contemplated amendment to, or
repeal of, the Dominion Day Act, if you are
still of the opinion that the attitude of parliament as expressed by words and deeds should
be a true reflection of the wish and will of
the people they serve in a democratie country
such as Canada.
Having dealt as thoroughly as I could with
the multi-coloured and far-from-harmonious,
if not altogether contradictory, reactions of
those who individually or collectively opposed
the substitution of the name "Canada Day"
for "Dominion Day," I must now, to be logical

MAY 22, 1946
and honest, state my reasons for supporting
this measure. I favour the adoption of the
name "Canada Day" as the new designation of
our national holiday for the three following
reasons: First, there is at present throughout
the country an overwhelming movement
towards a truer expression of genuine Canadianism in every way;-Secondly, the word
"dominion" bas become a misnomer and an
anachronisrn which reminds us of colonial
days;-Thirdly, because of the consequences,
immediate and remote, that would follow the
non-adoption of the bill now before us.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Is the honourable gentleman looking at the clock?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Even skippers have
to look at clocks once in a while.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Just to change the watch.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Nobody will deny
that Canada, because of her gradual evolution towards full nationhood during recent
years, and because of her newly acquired prestige through her exceptionally generous contribution towards the winning of the war, now
occupies a world position that she never had
before. All Canadians are fully conscious of
that fact. Should there be some here and
there who forget it, their heavy tax bills will
soon remind them of it. Fame and glory
have their ransom, but is it not legitimate that
full advantage be taken of them? In other
words, do we not deserve at last to fly our
own colours and to call ourselves by our
own name?
I do therefore take strong exception to keeping the word "dominion" tagged to the name
of my fatherland. The word is nothing but
an unnecessary appendage and a misnomer.
I am satisfied that such a feeling is general
throughout Canada, and particularly among
those who went abroad to stem the bloody tide
of tyranny and to fight on common battle
fields. Should some honourable senators doubt
my words I shall tell them, if they permit,
two short anecdotes which are quite illuminating, and which will rest their minds as well
as my own. As honourable senators know,
the complement of a Canadian corvette was
60 men. On a certain occasion when one of
our corvettes was in an English port the crew
went ashore and proceeded to a night club,
where they participated in the dancing and
other recreation provided. When the time
came to close the place the orchestra, according to practice, played "God Save the King."
Everyone stood at attention and sang the
solemn anthem. When the last echoes of the
song subsided, one of our Canadian sailors
asked the orchestra: "Would you please play
'O Canada' for us?" That request was bluntly

291

turned down, and, as our boys would not take
that rejection "on the chin," they reacted
violently and the place was wrecked. For the
enlightenment of some honourable senators,
I wish to point out that among that crew
there was but one French-Canadian, and he is
the one who told me the story.
In the second incident I was one of the
actors. On my last trip home I happened to
be sitting in the train with two Englishspeaking Canadian soldiers who had just
returned from overseas and were on the way
to-their homes in Essex county. One of them,
without any question from me, made this
spontaneous remark: "Senator, within ten
years from now we will be on our own."
That came from the lips of a Canadian boy
who had been overseas for five years in the
fight-against tyranny and for the maintenance
of the British commonwealth and all that it
represents. I asked him what he meant by his
remark, and he replied: "I mean that then
we will run our own business, without any
interference from outside."
I am not
inventing those words, nor am I quoting them
here to provoke anyone. I simply want to
prove my contention that there is in the
country a thirst and a hunger for a greater
manifestation of true Canadianism.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if we do not run our
own business now?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: We are still appealing to the Privy Council in England to settle
our disputes. And I would ask if the United
States sends abroad to get a Governor General. That issue was raised here years agoI happened to be in the bouse on the occasion
-when there was a debate as to whether the
time had not come for Canada to getHon. Mr. HORNER: Honourable senators,
I rise on a point of order. Is the honourable
senator not entirely out of order? Is he discussing the merits of this bill? He is telling
stories, which may be interesting to him but
have nothing to do with the bill.
Hon. Mr. -LACASSE: Mr. Speaker, I
respectfully ask you if I have said anything
that I should withdraw. I will cheerfully
abide by your ruling.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I feel the honourable senator will do his best to keep within
the rules.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Yes, honourable
senators, that irresistible manifestation of a
truly national conscience on the part of all
Canadians is more and more evident everywhere, and it will soon become irrepressible,
whether- honourable senators -like it or not.

292

SENATE

It is permeating everywhere, and nothing will
stop it. I noticed an expression of it even
during our recent debate on oleomargarine,
when an honourable gentleman was concluding his remarks against the bill sponsored by
my honourable friend from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler).
Hon. Mr. HAIG: A point of order. I submit that the honourable gentleman cannot
refer to a former debate of this session.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The point is well
taken. The honourable gentleman is out of
order.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: This is what he saidThe Hon. the SPEAKER: I think the honourable gentleman should confine himself to
the subject-matter of this debate and not refer
to what was said on another matter.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Do I take it, Mr.
Speaker, that we are not allowed to quote
from the press and from opinions expressed in
this house when they are directly connected
with the subject we are discussing at present?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The reading of
editorials is not in order. References to another debate of the present session should not
be made. A point of order has been raised by
the honourable leader of the opposition (Hon.
Mr. Haig), and I would ask my honourable
friend to keep within the rules. I know he is
adroit enough to do that and still make his
point.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Surely the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) will agree
that I should be allowed one minute to prove
the relevancy of the remark I wish to quote.
I just want to say that in the debate on oleomargarineHon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend has
apparently missed my point. He cannot refer
to a former debate of this session.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The bill to legalize
oleomargarine was killed in this house. The
Senate did as it liked, and rejected it. Why
bring up something that was said in that
debate?
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Here is the remark.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What my honourable
friend is now saying has no connection with
what we are discussing.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Knowing my honourable friend as I do, I am sure he will be generous enough to allow me one single minute
to justify my quotation. Here is the remark:
You will be niore Canadian if you defer the
adoption of this billHon. Mr. LACASSE.

to legalize oleomargarine. That more or less
irrelevant conclusion was betraying none the
less a state of mind and a patriotic fervour
which should not pass unnoticed.
As I stated before, the word "dominion"
has, in my humble judgment, become a misnomer and an anachronism under present
conditions, because it is to me a label of subserviency, irrespective of whatever may be
said to the contrary. I am not going to quote
definitions taken from various dictionariesI shall guard against quotations from now on
-to prove my point. My honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
given us one sufficiently clear and eloquent to
satisfy everybody. And is it not truc that,
after all-and more so today than ever before
-words have the meaning that the people

grammar or former interpretations?
world is travelling at a terrific pace nowadays,
even in that respect. We do not even take the
time any more to write in full the names of
industrial firms, professional associations or
gdvernment organizations. Thus we have the
C.I.L. here, the AMLFAN there and the
UNRRA elsewhere, and so on. So flurried
and so busy is our present generation that I
should not be surprised to read tomorrow in
our sports programme for the first of July
"C.D.", instead of "Canada Day."
Why should that word "dominion" precede
the name of Canada on the maps of the
I fail to sec that any qualifying
world?
words are used before the names of other
countries, as, for instance, (The kingdom of)
England, (The fourth republic of) France, or
(Les cantons fédérés de) Suisse. Why should
we not henceforth read, at least on our Canadian maps, "Canada" without any cumbersome, useless and untrue identification?
As to the consequences of the non-approval
of this proposed liberation from that untrue
symbol of outside domination, one is foremost in my mind. In this debate more than
one honourable senator has deplored the fact
that our national holiday, whether it be called
"Dominion Day", "Confederation Day" or
anything else, is not celebrated as it should be
celebrated throughout the land. How unfortunate and how true! But why? Because
of a lack of national education and of systematic co-operation along that line. Has not
the time arrived to remedy that condition?
Why then should a gallant initiative on the
part of our members of parliament be opposed
and wrecked by those who single out that
very deficiency? That is beyond my comprehension. It would rather seem that any
move to stimulate the patriotism of our
people, and especially of the youth of the
Give the
country, should be encouraged.

MAY 22, 1946
Canadian people slogans, flags and symbols
that truly correspond to their' national pride
and civic ideals, and give their national holiday a more fitting name, and you will stimulate rather than impede the expansion of a
truer Canadianisin.
I predict that a turning down of "Canada
Day" would be a very severe blow to the
legitimate pride and lofty aspirations of al
true Canadians, as exprelssed by the great
mai ority of their representatives elsewhere.
Lt would be indeed a very poor way of asserting ourselves as newly conflrmed citizens of a
country which has such a giorious record and
such tremendous responsibilities in respending
to the anxious expectations of what I believe
te be the mai ority of my fellow-Canadians.
Here is rny conclusion, honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I arn sorry to have
kept my honourabie friend frdma Saskatchewan
se long listening to me, but many a turne
have we extended to hum the saine patient
courtesy. Before concludiog I will say in al
sincerity that I apologize for whatever remarks I may have made which soe cf my
might consider a littie toc
colleagues
stinging. Whatever should be withdrawn I
withdraw by making a bianket apology.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS.: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LACASSF.: I helieve that nothing
1 said was irrelevant on any count, even
though it might have been a littie brutal-as
always is the truth, accerding te the great
moralists.
Deeply impressed by the popular reaction
that foiiowed the presentation of this bill,
and confirmed in the views I already held by
the able speeches delivered by rny henourable
friends frein Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
MeGeer) and froin Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) whose eloquent contributions
persuaded me that 1 was right in the flrst
place, I cannet bring myseif te believe that
it would be a crime or a sacrilege te place
on our Canadian calendars, in the littie
square marked July lat, the three-syllable
word which during the war was carried and
paraded in shining brass on the proud
shoulders of our gallant boys and girls te the
four corners cf the world. Is it possible that
a narne which, because cf the hercism of our
sons and daughters, gained se much respect
and admiration everywhere abread in those
six tragic and fateful years, shouid net at
iast be recognized and appropriateiy giorifled
by the citizens cf the country it designates, as
provided for in this hill? My answer to that
question is an ernphatic "No," and I shahl
indeed make it my solemn duty te support this

bill by my vote with the saine honesty cf
purpose and the sarne patrietic pride with
which I support it by words. Yes, honourabie
senators, let us make it Canada Day!
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, we have had quite a long discussion on
this bill, and it wouid seem that enough has
been said te enlighten us before we vote.
But this measure is more important than some
people think, and as honeurable senaters may
have noticed whiie iistening te some cf the
speeches delivered, there is always something
more te be said on the matter.
Lt was befltting that the flrst oppesition te
the bill sbould cerne fromn one cf the representatives cf the province cf British Columhbia. As we aIl know, the bill creating the
statutory holiday caiied "Dominion Day"
was presented by a senater from that province,
honourabie Dr. Carrai!. I arn sure that every
member was impressed by the splendid address
deiivered by the honourable senator frein Vancouver. Loquacity, or what in French we cahi
"bagout" is easy. But reai elequence-clearness cf exposition, seundness cf argument-is
aitogether different, and I arn glad to pay MY
compliments te the honourabie gentleman for
bis hucid presentatien cf the arguments against
the bill.
1 wish also te pay rny comnpiments te the
honourabie senator frein Peterborough (Hon.
Mrs. Failis). She stated that honeurable members shouid net be governed by outsîde influence. The Senate is net te be coerced. "We
will do our work, and fulfil our duty witb
courage and dignity." These are the wcrds
with which. I conciuded a speech last session.
I repeat thein today.
The honeurable senator froin Vancouver
South (Hon. Mr. Farris) referrcd at sorne
length te the preamble cf the Dominion Day
bill as presented bere, in 1879, but in my
opinion he referred tee briefly te what was
reported in the Debates cf the Senate on the
bill. Since seme persans desire te change haws
passed years and years age, it rnay prove a
good thing te refer te the discussion which
took place then between men who had taken
part in bringing together the colonies cf British
North Arnerica te ferin what became known as
the Dominien cf Canada. The discussion then
was rather -sentimental. You ail know that
confederation, culminating in the British
Nerth Arnerica Act, was net easily secured.
I wouid net fer a mernent dare lecture
hencurabie senators on the bitter eiectoral
campaigo whiich Look place at the tiîue. In
1879, although twelve years had elapsed since
cenfederatien. passions had not yet died down.
The few citations I arn gcing to make will
prove that we should net be surprised that the

SENATE
discussion taking place now is in fact very
similar to the one that took place then. Men
disappear, but the ideas they have sown
remain to germinate, and after years of unseen
growth again appear in full view as a new
crop; but if carefully studied this crop will be
found to be the same as the old one, with the
same good qualities but also with the same
defects.
The honourable senator from Vancouver
South stated that he was born just one year
before the Dominion Day bill; the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) went one better by saying that he
also was born the same year. Would honourable members be .interested to learn that for
me not only was the Dominion Day celebration bf 1879 the first one I participated in as
a youngster, but that 1879 was also the year
I started to go to school. I have a good
recollection of the ceremonies of that lst of
July. We young boys could not understand
the merits of the speeches delivered but we
greatly admired the silk bats and long coats
of the speakers.
The honourable gentleman from Vancouver
South quoted a few words said by the sponsor
of the bill at that time. I would supplement
the quotation with this paragraph:
J have always loved the dominion dearly. I
helped to bind it together, and I have worked
since with all the energy I possessed by vote and
voice to consolidate it. While they have in
Lower Canada and other provinces of the dominion nany saints; days anrd boliday s, I
'bink we sbould have one day which should be
>bserved throughout the dominion as the anaiversary of confederation. I think we ought to
:ass this bill, particularly at this time when
-he dominion. like the mighty empire of Rome,
is so large that it is alvays in rebellion in some
part of it. British Columbia is irritated and
restive. and now is the time to legislate for a
complete crystallization of the factions of the
dominion into one harmonions whole. I have
no desire to make a spread-eagle speech. but I
speak my own feelings. claiming to be a patriotic
Canadian descended from a race of patriotic
Canadians-one of the oldest families in Canada.
Another senator, honourable Mr. Campbell,
said:
No one. by feeling and exertion, is better entitled than my honourable friend to propose that
the anniversary of confederation be a public
holiday. Some years since, when a -Amilar
measure was before parliament in this house.
the government thought that it was best that it
should not become law then. There was a good
deal of uneasy feeling at the time in some of
the provinces of the dominion, and it was
thought that to make Dominion Day a conmpulsory holiday, as it were, would be distasteful
to the community. and that it would, instead of
pronoting a kindly sentiment, give rise to a
feeling of irritation in those portions of the
dominion where that uneasiness prevailed. I
hope that the feeling of dissatisfaction bas
passed away in all the provinces. I think it
has, and if we are now more united than we
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

were then, and are ready to observe the anniversary of the formation of the dominion as a day
of which we are proud, as a day which we think
marks an event which has contributed to the
prosperity of the country, it seems to me that
this bill should pass.
Had this feeling of dissatisfaction passed?
Let us hear from Honourable Senator Cornwall:
Since then British Columbia bas invariably
done all that she undertook to do; but the
Dominion of Canada, although eight years have
since elapsed, has not carried out ber part of the
solemn obligations by which she bound lierself,
and I am forced to hold the unwelcome opinion
that confederation is at present only nominal
instead of real. I confess that, holding such a
view, I cannot lend myself to setting aside any
particular day to commemorate an event which
bas not yet occurred. In saying this I do not
wish the house to doubt for a moment my
earnest loyalty both to the dominion and confederation.
The discussion was continued by Honourable
Senator Miller, who said:
Even with that explanation, I should like to
know whether it is true that the local legislature
of British Columbia is at the present time
threatening secession; and, if so, why it is that
a representative of that province is a suitable
mover of such a bill as this? I presune thàt
these reports which we see in the press can have
no foundation in fact. I sincerely hope that
they have not, but J think that my bonourable

friend should be in a position to give the house,
before the bill bas been read a second time,
some satisfactory information with regard to
what bas appeared in the newspapers about a
local agitation of that kind in the province from
which he comes.
The answer came as in a duel. This is
the "riposte".
I do not think that it comes with a good grace
from any gentleman who represents Nova Scotia
to question the loyalty of the representatives of
British Columbia. The honourable gentleman
from Richmond does not observe, on aIl occasions, becoming reticence. It is true thmat the
local government of British Columbia, a small
body of rmen, following up a previous resolution
of a former government, did unwisely put in the
Speech fron the Throne words for which, if I
had been in the Governor's place. I would have
put them in jail. They were words which should
not have been used. I am certain that there
are enough Canadians, apart fromn other loyal
subjects of the Empire, in that country, to hold
it wit hooks of steel to the Dominion. I was
one of those who made the terms of union. and
I shmall do my utnost to hold these provinces
together as one dominion extending from ocean
to ocean.
lion. Mr. Dever:
As a representative of
New Brunswick, I feel it my duty to say that
since confederation bas been carried in that
province. I have seen nothing that would lead
01e to suppose that Dominion Day was not a
statutory holiday. Every year by a majority
of the people it bas been kept sacredly; the
stores have been closed. and business bas been
suspended, with very few exceptions. Nothing,
I am sure. would give greater satisfaction to the
people of New Brunswick, than to feel that it
was looked upon as a national holiday.
These citations, honourable senators, show
that if passions had not died, they were under

MAY 22, 1946
MAY 22, 1946
control. Senators at that time were true
patriots, loving their country and working for
its development. We today are anirnated by
the same patriotisma, and if we are sometimes
divided in our opinionis, there is no reason to
show bitterness.
Now I corne to one opinion which, ini my
estimation, carried more weight than some
expressed before.
Honourable Mr. Girard
spoke as follows:
Although the bill does flot appear important
in itself, it is by no means a trifling matter. I
would have no objection to vote for it if it were
a goverilment measure. It seems to me that to
establish holidays in anry country is a prerogative of the Crown, and the responisibility of
doing so should rest with the goverument. I do
flot, think that this bill should have been intro.duced in this bouse except as a government
measure. I f eel as much as, anyone else the
neessty of observing the let of July as a public
holiday. I rejoice at the succ-ess of confederation,
and believe that there should be legisiation to
make Dominion Day a public holiday, but until
it comes in a legitimate way before parliament
I feel it my duty to vote against it.
That argument, forceful as it was then, bas
more real force today, if honourable senators
pay attention to what bas been said here and
in another place. We heard the honourable
senator frorn Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) state
that the present bill does not go far enough
and that the word "Dominion" should disappear from aIl statutes, including the Statute
of Westminster-even from the prayers opening
our sittings. I would argue that if we are
coming to that point, the issue, assumes so
much importance that it should flot be left to
a private member to formulate such a policy.
The government should take the responsibility.
It is not my habit to trespass on the patience
of this honourable bouse. I will not add to the
arguments of the honourable senator from
Vancouver South against the bhill. It will be
sufficient for me to say that I amn in agreement with him on the points hie raised. But
there is one particular phase I wisb to dwehl
upon, the word "dominion", what it means
and what it represents. Most of the supporters of the bill dlaim that the word "dominion" means inferiority, domination 'by superior
and exterior authority; at least as a souvenir
fromn the past. Two definitions were cited by
the honourable senator from Rigaud, and one
mias repeated by the honourahie senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). He
said that "dominion"~ means:
The rigbt of absolute possession and use;
ownership; a country under a particular government-as Canada has been under British dominion since 1867-same as domination.
I wish honourable senators to note the interjection made bSF the honourable ýsenator_-"as
Canada bas been under British dominion since
18G7"ý-because I am going f0 quote the

295

295

definition of the word "dominion" as given in
the Oxford dictionary:
Dominion: Lordship, sovereignty, control; domains of feudal lord, territory of sovereign or.
government. (Dominion of Canada, name given
to C.anadian colonies united 1867; Dominion of
N'ew Zealana, title given 1907) ; Law: right of
possession.

True, "Dominion" was the naine given to
united colonies in 1867,
something made superior.

but already with
I arn referring to,

a true representative government.
I come now to the other definition wbich
bas heen repeated by the honourable senator

from Toronto-Trinity.
Dominion: a territory or a country with a

bigh degree of local autbority, but subject, to
the control of anotber government.

Indeed, and this is taken from a dictionary
edited and publisbcd in 1940, nine years after
the Statute of Westminster had definitely
stated in section 4 that:
No .act of parliamnent of the United Kingdom
passed after the commencement of this act shah]
extend, or be deemed to extend, to a dominion
as part of the law of that dominion, unless it
is expressly declared in that act that that dominion bas requested, and consented to the enactmnent thereof.
Section 11 reads:
Notwitbstanding anything in the Interpretation Act, 1889, the expression "colony" shaîl not,
in any act of the Parliament of tbe United
Kingdom passed after the commencement of this
Act, include a dominion or ýany province or
state f orming part of a dominion.
What autbority will you give to a dictionary wbich does not take cognizance of notable
facts changing the definition of words? Which
do you prefer, the inaccurate dîctionary or
the statute which clearly states the meaning of the words used to assure your status
as a free nation?
Let us read from Webster's dictionary:
Dominion: Sovereign or supreme authority;
the power of governing and controlling; independent right of possession, use, and control;
sovereignty; supremacy. That wbich is subject
to sovereignty or control. The estate or domain
of a feudal lord. Territory governed, or over
which authority is exercised; the tract, district,
or country, considered as subject; as, the dominions of a king. Dominion bas no technical
meaning as used in the namnes "Dominion of
Canada" and "Dominion of New Zeeland;" but
the name is popuharhy taken as imphying a higher
polîtical status than the terni cohony.
To the people of New Zeahand the Prime
Minister in 1907 said,
To-day your island home attains the prouder

titie of dominion.

Dominion means: sovereignty, control, rule,
autbority, jurisdiction.

honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr.
Dupuis) is very fond, it seems, of definitians
frain dictianaries. H1e wauld prefer the words
"enation" or "sister nation" ta the word
"dominion." I would refer him ta Webster,
whoro he would read among other definitions
that "nation" means:
The hody of inhabitants of a country united
under a single government, whether dependent
or independent; a people united politically.
My bonourahie friond will note the words
depondent or independont.
Beforo I conclu(le my remsrks, I shauld like

made is that tho word has fia proper translation in French. Well, the French odition of
our statutes have given one. It is not ethical,
it is said. If so, I will flot argue the point;
bot honourahle sonators whbo know the French
languago are aware of the very large numbor
of English words wxhieh or languago bias
absorbed. Then why ilot enrich aur language
witb the word "dominion"-a naine noble
froin its sources, a naine meaning sovereignty

UNEMPLOYMENT

INSURANCE

BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
readmng of Bill L5, an Act to amend the
Unemployment Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable members, I would
ask the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to, explain this bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before he does so, I wish
Heretofore I have always
to intervene.
received through the mail a copy of each of
the bis which appear on our order paper. I
do not know who is responsibie for the omission, but I did' not get a copy of this bill. The
bill has been piaced on some files, but flot
on others. The honourable senator from
Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) very
kindly lent me his copy haif an hour ago,
and of course I have not yet been able to
peruse it thoroughly. I am quite willing that
the hi]l should be proceeded with. I arn sure
the honourabie leader will not oh] ect if the
debate ié adjourned.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: 1 have ascertained that
copies are now on some of the files, but three
times yesterday I made inquiry and was
informed that the bill had not reached the
distribution office. Only five minutes ago I
sent a messenger there for a copy, but none
had yet been received. I am not hlaming the
honourable leader of the government, he is
not responsible; but when a hill is introduced and given first reading copies should
be distrihuted immediately. It is virtually
impossible for one to follow the explanation
intelligently uniess one has seen the bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am sorry -for
the inconvenience caused some honourable
senators. I made inquiries this morning and
was advised that the hil] had been distributed,
but apparently it failed to reach ail bonourable members. I will take steps to sec that a
similar failure does not occur again. If the
house is agreeable, I think the honourable
senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen)
might proceed with his explanation of the
bill.
Hon. ADRIAN K. HUGESSEN: I can
quite appreciate the objections raised by two
honourable senators by reason of the nondistribution of the bill, for it is an important
and complicated measure consisting of
twenty-eight pages, and will require, careful
study.
Before I go into the details of the hill
itself, the house might like to have some sort
of general picture and a few statisties in relation to what may be termed the over-al
condition of unemployment insuranoe in this

SENATE
country at the present time. It will be recalled that the Unemployment Insurance Act
was passed in 1940 and was amended in 1943.
It came into force on the lst of July, 1941,
and bas thus been in effeet for nearly five
years.
Hnnourable senators are, I know.
familiar with the basic structure of the act,
and they will pardon me if I go over it
somnewhat briefly.
The act sets up an Unemplayment Insurance Commission with headquarters at
Ottawa. This commission, which administers
the aet, is responsible to the Governor in
Council.
It consists of three whole-time.
fully-paid members, one of them represents
the employers and one the employees, whih'
the third being the chairman, is neutral, I
suppose. The act also sets up an Advisory
Unemployment Insurance Committee-an unpaid committee which has various important
duties assigned to it, including those of reporting annuýally to, the Governor in Council
as to the financial condition and actuarial
solvency of the fund, of investigating possible
extensions of unemployment insurance to
further classes of employees, and of considering adjustments in the contributions
made by employers and employees. It is important. I think. to realize that this is
essentially an insurance scheme. and in order
to retain its quality as such it is necessairv
that at ail times the fund be actuariall.v
soiind, which is thc reason for the sctting up
of the advisory committee and for the func.
tions entrusted to it.
The act aiso sets up an employment service
for Canada, which bas opened offices in ail!
the principal centres throughout the countrI.
In coonection wjth that service the act provides for a national employment committep.
consisting of representatives of employers
and of employees in equal proportion, sud
for the appointmcnt of similarly constituted
svegional committees in different amcas of the
country.
Generally speaking. the act covers those
who are engaged in what one might caîl industrial employment, and includes not only aIl
employers, but aIl employees eamning wages
up to $2,400 a year. The contributions of
employers and employees are made to what
is called the Unemployment Insurance Fund.
That, as I say, is made up of contributions by
employers and employees.
The latter contribute on a slid-ing scale based upon earnings.
The slidîng scale will be found in the second
sehedule to the act. The employees, graduated according to their wages, are classified
from No. 0 to No. 7 inclusive. Class 0, for
instance, envers employces earning less than
90 cents a day, or who are under sixteen years
of age. The contribution for them is at the
Hon. Mr. HEUGESSffN.

rate of 18 cents a week, and is paid entirely
by the employer. Then you come to class 1,
employees earning $5.40 but less than $7.50 a
week. Here the contribution of the employer
is 21 cents and of the employee 12 centsand so on, to the highest paid employees,
clasa 7, earning $26 or more in a week, where
the employer contributes 27 cents and the
empioyee 36 cents a week. The rates were
roughly designed se that the contributions by
employers as a class and by employees as a
class sbould be about equal. To the fond so
contributed by employers and empinyees, the
goveroment adds one-fifth, and the total
forrus the Unempînyment Insurance Fund.
The government aiso pays the cost of
administration.
Wben an insured person bas the misfortune
to be unemployed he becomes entitled to
receive, subi ect to compliance with the requirements of the act, a weekly benefit, the
amouint of wbicb depends uipon bis contribution to tbe fund. Tbe rates of tbe weekly
benefit will be found at page 7 of tbe bill.
Honourable senators will sec tbat, depending
upon the rate of contribution, tbe weekly
benefit payable is divided into two sections,
one being the benefit payable to a person
witb.out dependents, and the other, on a
slightly hig-her scale, tbat payable to persons
%vithdependents. Tbus, an uncmployed person
in the bigbiest class, and having dependents,
receives a xxeekly benefit at the rate of $14.40.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is tbere any cbange there?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I will come to that
point in a few moments. The duration of the
benefit is roughly one-fifth of the time during
wbich a man was employed and was contributing to tbe fund. For instance, if he had
been employed for a period of five years, and
at the end of tbat time had the misfortune to
become unemployed-assuming he had contributed to tbe fund and that he had dependents
-lie would be entitled to a weekly benefit of
$14.40, payable tbrougbout the whole of the
followipg year.
I do not wish to weary tbe bouse with
figures, but I think it would be interesting to
state a few of the highlights of tbe position
which bas been reached. The figures I arn
about to give are as of Marcb 31 last. On
tlîat date tbe number of employees covered
by tbis act was 2,294,460. If honourable
gentlemen care to do a little calculating, they
will sec that that figure comprises almost
one-flfth of our total population. It should
further be borne in mmnd tbat a very considerable number of these 2,000,000 odd persons
have one or more dependents, which shows
tbat a very large portion of our population
bas a vital interest in the unempînyment
insurance schemne.

MAY 23, 1946

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The honourable
leader wishes to know how much bas been
contributed by the employee, the employer,
and the government.
Hon. Mr. HIJGESSEN: 1 was about to ask
permission of the house to place on Hansard
certain statistical tables which I think will
give the honourable leader opposite exactly
the information be desires. The first table is
a statement of revenue of the Unemployment
Insurance Fund for the period from July 1,
1941, to March 31, 1946, showing the contributions made in each year by employers,
employees and the government, with a total
contribution of over $356,000,000.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Is the honourable
member referring to the year 1945?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I arn speaking as
of March 31, 1946. The amount of the fund
at that date la round figures was $317,240,000,
which represents almost 3150 for every insured
person. The total benefits paid up to march 31
last were $39,425,000.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman at this point tell us how the fund
bas been operating since we have run into a
little unemployment?
Hon. Mr. HUGESS EN:- I arn about to

provision?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: There is no change
in the scherne.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I understood the hionourable senator to say that other ernployees
and classes were being added in this scherne.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Not in this scherne.
As I go along with rny remarks I will explain
how they corne in.
The third table goes ino a little rnore detail, and gives the nurnber af persans receiving
benefits and the arnaunts paid ta thern for the
years 1942 ta 1945, inclusive, and for the first
quarter ai 1946. The figures are first given
for Canada as a whole, andI then they are
broken down by provinces. If any honourable
senatar is particularly interested in bis own
province hie will find the details in this third
table, which I now crave permission ta file.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Does the table give
tat aIs?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It gives the total for
Canada, and then it breaks the figures down
aecording, ta the provinces.

Now may 1 make a specific answer ta the
question by the honourable leader opposite?
I take his question ta be: fias the fund at all
times and in every month haýd a surplus af incorne over expenditure, particularly in the last
few months? This is the answer: Last March
was the first rnonth in which the benefit paymonts exceeded the amount of contributions
to the fund. The excess of benefits over psyments in that month was about $1,500,000.
Honourable senators will realize that the
month of Mareb was a time when there was
cons iderable.unemployrnent, largely seasonal,
and perhaps ta sorne extent of a technologies]
character arising from the closing down of war
industries and the reconversion ta peacetime
activities. I arn advised that for the rnonth
of April the fund was again in balance, andI
that the reccipts exceded the expenditures.
Hon. Mr. EULER: How much is in the fund
now?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: A total of $317,248,000.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Could the honourable
senator give an estimute as ta the number of

There is one more table that I should like
ta file. It is a short one, and gives fram the
commencement of the act to March lest the
ratio of the contribution of the ernployees ta
that of the employers. This table is rather
interesting because, as I have stated, the payments were based on the theory that the contributions by the ernployer and by the emHon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

ployee would be about equal. However during
the pnst five years, as a resuit ai the increasing
wage scale in industry, more and more
employees have been earning higher wages and
contributing more than their employers. In
July, 1941, tbe ernployees subscribed 50-5 per
cent, and the employers 49-5 per cent; but
by March of this year a position had been

MAY 23, 1946
reached in which the employees were paying
54-3 per cent and the employers 45-7 per
cent of the fund.
I shall now file the table.

I referred earlier in my remarks to the
Unemployment Insurance Advisory Committee. That committee, 1 arn informed, is
now studying proposals of three different kinds.
The first is to adjust the rates of contribution as between the employer and the employee, with a view to restoring the relative
contributions to the 50-50 basis upon which
the seheme was originally set up. The second
step which the committee is considering is
that of creating a new class of employee, in
addition to those now covered in the second
schedule. I said a moment ago that at the
present time the highest-class employee is the
one earning $26 or more per week, and whose
employer contributes 27 cents while hoe contributes 36 cents. It is now suggested that
an eighth class should be incorporated, coverîng persons earning $34 a week or more.
Hon. Mr. EULERh: The government's
proportion remains the sanie?
Hon. Mr. HUGESS EN: The government's
proportion romains the samne. It is always
one-fifth of the total contribution cf employer8 and employees.
The third question now under study by the
committee is whether it would not be possible
to increase the weekly rates of benefits to
persons with dependents. The presenit rates
are shown on page 7 of the bill. Apparontly
the committee have reached the conclusion
that this insurance schemo can be kept
actuarily sound and yet permit a slight increase in the prosont rates of theso benofits.
Anothor subject that I wanted to touch
upon is the classes of omployment covored
by the sehemo. I think wo ail agroe as a
matter of goneral policy that it is advisablo
to extend the benefits of unemploymont insurance as widely as possible. I may say
here, paronthotically, that in England, for instance, whore the experionce with unemployment insurance has been much longer tlian
.ours, they have ultimately and by degrees
succeedod in oxtonding ooverage to practically
overy class of the community, including
agricultural labourers, domestie servants, and

301

so on, who are now oxcludod fromn our sceme.
Part II of the first sehedule of our act of 1941
eontamned a list of what were called exceptod
omployments--that is employments not covered by the seheme. It was quito long and
included employment in agriculture and
forestry, fishing, lumbering and logging,
transportation by water or by air, domostic
service and various other classifications.
Honourablo senators will recaîl that the
amending act of 1943 extonded the coverage
in two ways. First, it extendod the maximum
wage of persons covered by unemployment
insuranco from $2,000 to $2,400 a year; and
secondly, it brought under the act a wholo
class of employees whýo are paid, not by the
year but by the hour, day ýor week, or by
mileage, as railroad employoes are, regardless
of whether the remuneration of any of these
persons exeeeds $2,400.
Furthormore, section 86 of the act provides
that after investigation by the advisory comnmittoo and on the genoral rocommendation of
that committee and of the commission, the
Governor in Council may extend the provisions of the act to any of the employments
specifiod as excepted employmonts in part II
of the first sehedule. In 1945 that was done in
two cases after investigation. The act was
extended to tho business of transportation by
air and to professional nurses. In that yea r it
was extended also, in theory, to lumbering and
logging. I say "in theory", hecause it has not
yet been extended in fact to that industry.
I amn advised that the different seasonal and
climatic conditions under which the industry
is carried on in various parts of the country
mako the administrative problcma extremely
difficult. For some timo the question has been
undor study, and it is expected that the act
will shortly be mado applicable to tho industry in the province of British Columbia.
Perhaps at this point I should refer to section 19 of the bill, which would amend part II
of the first schedule so as to mako, cloar that
the provisions of the act may be extended to
part of an industry in one section of the country and not necessarily to the wholo industry
throughout tho country. If this amendmont
is adopted it will be possible to introduce
tho scherne that has been devisod for logging
and lumboring in British Columbia. I arn
advised also that it is hoped to oxtond the
provisions of the act to transportation by
water on our Atlantic coast. The extension is
advisable because tho manning pooîs for
marine seamen are shortly to close. Spocial
techniques will be roquired to bandle the contributions and dlaims of men engaged in this
particular omployment, and also it will be
necessary to have a rociprocal arrangement

302

SENATE

with other governments as respects trans-ocean
shipping. I would refer honourable senators
to section 26 of the bill, which seeks to amend
part I of the first schedule so as to permit
the making of agreements in cases where men
are employed in transportation by sea between
Canada and some other country or countries.
After this lengthy preamble, for which I
apologize to the house, I proceed to a short
consideration of the principal provisions of
the bill itself. A good many of the changes
are of a purely administrative character, providing merely for rearrangement and clarification, and involving no basic change of
principle. Honourable senators will observe
that section 5 extends from page 3 to page 13
of the bill. The object of this long section is
to repeal sections 27 to 40 of the present act
and to substitute a similar number of other
sections, considerably rearranged and clarified
but importing no great departure in principle from the existing sections.
There are three changes which honourable
members might be interested to know about.
One is in the proposed new section 29, subsection 1, paragraph (b), subparagraph (ii),
on page 5. That permits a person who is in
receipt of unemployment insurance benefit
to earn up to $1.50 a day from part-time
employment without prejudicing his benefit
rights. The former limit was one dollar.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know of industries in
a certain province where the men and women
employed are mostly from the rural parts.
How in the world can the unemployment
officials keep track of what those people are
earning?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Of course, the
honourable senator will realize that this is
the case of a person in receipt of the weekly
unemployment insurance benefit. He has to
come in every week and make a declaration,
and so forth. I do not know how the fund is
administered.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Cheques are sent by mail.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am not aware of
that. I assume that payment depends upon a
sworn declaration. I understand the commission has local inspectors who check up on
these things all the time.
The second change is in section 31, at page 6.
As I said before, people with dependents are
entitled to benefits at a slightly higher rate
than those without dependents. Subsection
2 (d) extends the definition of a person with
a dependent to include:
A person who maintains a self-contained
domestic establishment and supports therein a
wholly dependent person connected by blood
relationship, marriage or adoption.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

If I remember rightly, a similar provision
was inserted in the Income Tax Act a year
or two ago.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The third change
is that the table of rates of benefits, which
formerly were tucked away in a schedule at
the very tail-end, has now been transposed to
the body of the act, page 7-where I submit
it ought to be.
The next important change to which I
think honourable members should pay some
attention will be found in the new section on
page 21. It amends section 88 of the act, which
deals with the setting up of the employment
service for Canada, and provides that "in
respect of the administration of that service"
-that is the employment service-"the commission shall be responsible to the minister."
That raises rather an interesting administrative problem, because it places the commission
in a position where it serves two masters.
With regard to the fund and the insurance
provisions and the regulations thereunder, it
still remains what one migbt call an autonomous body, subject only to the Governor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is that fund, which I
now understand amounts to about $300,000,000, entirely under the control of the commission, or does it go into the Consolidated
Revenue Fund and remain as a credit to the
commission, or is it invested in government
bonds?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I understand the
fund is entirely in the control of the commission and is invested in government bonds.
In fact the unemployment insurance fund was
a very fruitful source of subscriptions to the
different war loans.
Under this proposed amendment the commission will still remain, its own master in
respect of its insurance functions; but in respect of the employment service it will become
responsible to the Minister of Labour. The
explanation is that the employment service,
while it is useful and indeed essential to any
proper scheme of unemployment insurance, is
not necessarily confined to that function; in
fact it was used during the war, and has been
since, for many other purposes than those
related strictly to unemployment insurance. As
honourable members know, it was used. during
the war for National Selective Service. It is being used today for the reinstatement of veterans
in civil employment and in connection with
their vocational training. So much is this the
case that if you turn to the estimates for the
current year you will find the government has

M%/AY 23. 1946
recognized that to the extent of 60 per cent
the cost of the employment service should be
charged, flot against the Unemployment Insurance Commission but against other branches
of government work. Again, I thin'k it will be
readily recognized that under present conditions in this country, with the acclaimed policy
of ail parties "full employrnent for ail", an
ernployment service fils a lot more functions
than merely being an adjunet to a scheme of
unemployment insurance. I arn inforrned with
respect to, this proposed duality of function,
that a similar situation exists in the United
Kingdom, in the United States and in New
Zealand.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: If I understand correctly,
the duality of the systemn does not disappear.
It means only that the Unemployment Insurance Commission, instead of beîng responsible
to the Governor in Council, will, with respect
to the employrnent part of its activities, be
responsible to the minister. Therefore the
comission wilI continue to have a dual
responsibility, one in respect of unemployrnent
insiirance, and the other in respect of employment. Is that correct?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My bonourable
friend bas put it far more clearly than I could
myself.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I arn leading to another
question on which, I should like to have
information. The point has been raised in
Montreal by various groups interested either
from the standpoint of employers or employees.
that there is no reason why 250,000 unemployed should be drawing so heavily on unemployment insurance, and that there appears to
be a lack of co-ordination between the employment and the, insurance ends of the commission's activities. They feel that when a man
applies for unernployment insurance he should
immediately be directed to a job. If hie applies
to the insurance branch the officiais should
say: "You are not entitled to, insurance. You
are a painter. Here is a job for a painlter";
or 'You are a carpenter. Here is a job for n
carpenter." By more widely separating the
responsibilities of the commission which will
now be accountable partly to the Governor
in Council and partly to the Minister of
Labour are we not creating a greater chasm
between these two very important branches
of the administration?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That is one of the
quýestions whicb honourable senators will have
to study very carefully when they corne to
c onsider the bill in cornmittee. I can quite
appreciate the force of my honourable friend's
suggestion. I arn just trying to point out
63268-21

303

these principal provisions of the bill that I
think will engage our attention wben we corne
to deal with the details.
Hon. Mr HAIG: 0f course during a strike
there is no unemployment insurance. I arn
told that wben the truck-drivers for the
National Breweries in Montreal went on strike
other men were employed and the strikers
lost their jobs. Are those displaced men now
entitled to unernployrnent insurance.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: This is a long and
very teehnical measure. I think I could find
the answer for my honourable friend in the
material before me but I must confess that
without looking through it I arn not in a
position to answer hirn with any reasonable
degree of accuracy. But that again is a question which can he very properly asked of
officers of the department when we corne to
consider the bill in comrnittee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Suppose I am a carpenter
and unernployed and I arn offered a job at
sorne other place-not in Winnipeg but say
in Vancouver, what about it then?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: You ought to be satisfied at Vancouver!
Hon. Mr HAIG: I would not be satisfied,
I know that, for I should hate to leave Winnipeg to go to Vancouver. Could the commission compel me to take a job there?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No. There again
I cannot answer with any great degree of
accuracy, but I do know there is a -provision
in the act by which the commission can
advance funds to a man in that position to
enable him to travel to another place where
hie may find a suitable job.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We will ask the officers
of the commission about that.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. VIEiN: I appreciate that this is
not the proper time to discuss details of the
bill, but is the character of the bill such as to
enable the committee to go into the questions
that have been raised both by the honourable
leader opposite and by me? I think the question I raised clearly falis under section 20. As
to the question of the honourable leader
opposite, shahl we have an opportunity to deal
with it in cornmittee?
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is what the coinmittee is for.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: That, of course, is
an inquiry which the honourable leader on
this side can answer bètter than I can. But
my understanding of the usually rather free
and easy procedure of our standing commit-

EKVIBfl IDITIOSf

3M4

SENATE

tees is that a departrnental officer who appears
before a cornrittee can be asked any questions deaiing with the administration of his
department, even though it does flot fail
directly within the ambit of the particular
bill under discussion.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I might point
out to honourable senators that this is a government measure, and as far as 1 arn concerned I hope it wili have most careful
scrutiny in committee. In view of what the
honourable leader opposite bas said, I should
like to take this opportunity of stating that
while I arn anxious to get the bill to coinrnittee, 1 arn quite w'iihing to abide by bis
sug-gestion that ail reasonable time be allowed
for discus~sion at this stage, consistent witb
our making as much progress as possible.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: My point was directed to
the wveii rccognized rule that wvben wve are in
commitic we mnust discuss the specifie item
before the chair.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It is rny intention,
whcn the bill is given second reading, to suggest that it be referred to tbe Standing Coinmittee on Immigration and Labour, not to
Cornmittee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I agree, but if we are to
have a complete survey of the situation, I
think we should have before us in committee
not oniy this bill but the Unemployment
Insurance Act of 1940, wbicb it purports to
amend. This is absoiutely necessary because
of the many interlocking questions arising out
of these amendments and their effeet on the
whole structure of tbe act.
lon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I should tbink, offbaud, that anytbiug of that kind would be
properly witbin tbe purview of the standing
committee.
Hon. Mr. COPP: There is no doubt about
that.
Hou. Mr. HUGESSEN: I wish now to
direct attention to the section dealing witb
powers of the commission to make regulations.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Wbat section is that?
Hou. Mr. HUGESSE-N: Section 21. at pages
22 and 23. sets out the ncw section 92, which
it is iutendcd to incorporate in the act. This
new section confprs the power te make regulations (oncerning a great number
of tbings.*
Most of these provisions are copied out of
the old act; but sorne new powers are sougbt
for the making of regulations. I think two
of them desorve tihe partieular attention of
thjis bouse. 1 refer to paragraphs (o) and (p)
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

at the bottorn of page 23. 1 shall read tbern
s0 that the bouse will appreciate their importance. They read as follows:
(o) requiring every person wbo bas engaged
an em-io ee, who ascertains that hie requires or
will require to engage an employee or who aseertains that an employee bas lef t or will be leaving bis employment, subjeet te preseribed conditions, to uotify tIhe employment service organized
under Part III of this Act, of sueh f act and to
supply prescribed incidentai information in such
manner and witbin sucb time as may be prescribed;
(p) requiring every person seeking employment to notify the emplnymeut service of sucb
fact and to suppi y prescribed incidentai information in such mauner aud witlsin such time as
niay be prescribed;
Those paragrapbs empower the commission
to require every employer and empînyeo te
inforus the commission of big intentions
with respect to employmeut. I suggest that
when we corne to look at the bill in detail
Isonourable senators will wish to consider
the granting of those powers very scriously.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hou. Mr. HUGESSEN: On the other baud
it should ho borne in mind tîsat if we are
committcd to a policy of full empioyment-and ail parties in this country are-it would
secmn uecessary, in order to permit of full
employment, that the goverument agency
cbarged with tise duty of gettiug information
about empioyment througbout the country
should bave the power to colleet tîsat information as quickly and as expeditiously as
possible. May I say that tIse International
Labour Confereuce held in Philadeiphia in
1944 recommended that government sbould
empower their ernployment services to require information of this kind from employers
and employees.
1 do not say that in an
attempt to influence the opinion of any
honourable senators; I sirnply make the
assertion for wbat it may be wortb. and perbaps as some justification for the matter
being submittcd to this bouse for consideration,
Section 23, which creates the now section
104, is one sxbicb I tbink honourable senators
will approve witbout demur. It provides that
the records regarding rates of pay supplied
to the commission by' employers and employees shall be secret, and shail not be
disclosed te anybody. That is similar to a
provision contained in the Income Tax Act.
I amn advised that a number of unauthorized
persous, such as collection agoucies, and wives
whose hsusbauds have disappeared, have at
times attempted te obtain information from
the commission. This section makes it quite,
clear that information as to employmeut shahl
be secret as betwe en the indix idual and thc
commission.

MAY 23, 1946
One further provision of the bill on whieh
I should like to say a few words is part V,
commencing at page 25, under the general
heading of "Veterans". Sections 105 to 108
inclusive originally appeared in the postdischarge order in council, and then were
brought into the Veterans Rehabilitation Act.
They are now being taken out of that act
and placed in the Unemployment Insurance
Act where they realiy belong. They deal
with the rights of veterans with respect to
unemployment insurance.
I shall give honourable senators a brief
outline of the righits of veterans with respect
to unemployment insurance. A man or woman
who during the recent war ivas on active service with the Canadian forces, the British
forces or, under certain conditions, the forces
of an a]lied country, and who returns to
Canada and enters insurable employment and
continues in such employment for a period of
at Ieast fifteen weeks within the first year, is
entitled to be treated as if he or she had been
under the provisions of this act from the day
of enlistment, or the first of July, 1941,
whichever is the eariier. Here is an example:
A man enlists for active service on the first
day of January, 1942, is discharged on the
first of January, 1946, after four years of
service; he enters insurable employment on
the first of February, and continues in that
employment until the end of April. lie then
has had fifteen weeks' work, which automatically entitles him to be treated as if he
had been employed and subjeet to the provisions of this act since the day of his enlistment, the first of January, 1942, and the
government thereupon pays into the Unemployment Insurance Fund the total amount of
the contributions which he and his employer
would have paid had he actuafly been s0
employed since the date of his enlistment.
I arn rather proud of the fact that we in
this country have done so much more for the
veteran of the late war than was done for the
veteran of the previous war. I recali very well
coming back at the end of the last war and
joining the Great War Veterans Associationwhich very soon ran on the rocks because
it got into the hands of irresponsible people
who raised the cry that every returned veteran
of the war should receive a $2,000 gratuity
from the country. The cry raised by these
irresponsible people was: "Give us our $2,000."
There was some justification for that cry, for
the enlisted men who had gone overseas had
lost a good many of the rights and privileges
which their fellows at the next bench or in
the same factory had enjoyed by reason of
staying at home and continuing to work. As I
say, to that extent there was justification for
62268-21J

305

the cry that the veteran should get a cash
bonus to make up to him what he had lost
because of his military service. In this bill we
are doing almost that very thing. In effeet we
are saying to the veteran: It does not mat ter
that you left your employment and served with
the overseas forces of the Crown, because as
far. as unemployment insurance is concerned,
and provided you are emnployed steadily for
fifteen weeks, we are going to put you in the
position you would have been in had you not
internipted your employment by military service. I believe that is a position which every
honourable senator will gladly endorse.
lion. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Does that provision apply to men called up under the
National Resources Mobilization Act?
lIon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It applies to every
man who was on active service in the Canadian
forces, and would include men called up under
the Mobilization Act who went on active service. It is interesting to note- that up to the
end of March- this year 50,958 veterans have
become entitled, to the advantages of this provision, and that their portion of the unemployment insurance fund has heen paid by the
government under the conditions which I have
just outlined,.
I repeat what I said at the outset of my remarks, that after the debate on the second
reading is concluded I intend to move that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Immigration and Labour. Now it only remains for me to apologize to the house for
having taken so long in, explaining the bill.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig the debate wau
adjourned.

It will be observed that the bill for the most
part is composed of sehedules describing the
houndaries of a number of parks. I have prepared in manuscript form as accurately as I can
a concise explanation of what the bill proposes.
The purpose of the bill is to adjust the

boundaries of six national parks in Canada.
AIl the properties which are being addod by
this bill to the various parks have been owned
by the Crown for some years. It is 110w

withdrawal, to make a declaration that such

respecting the return of property would apply
more particularly to the provinces of Alberta,
Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
May 1 deal first with Banff National Park,
which is roferrod to in the bill. This park
was first surveyed in 1940 by the Surveyor
Goneral. The boundaries set out in sebedule A
to the bill follow the description in that survec'v. Two small parcels of land not formerly
wvithin the boundaries of the park are now
încluded. Title to on1e parcel situated niear the
easterni gateway of tlîe park was donated by
[hr province of Alberta, anI the other parcel,
wvith the consent of tie province. was included
%vithinthe park. May 1 add that Iis piece

for tho purpose of protccting the park fromn

The description set out in schodule A follows
the official survey mnade hy the Surveyor
General. Here reforenco should ho made to
the Banff-WindermOrO road agreemont. in
which the province of British Columbia agreed
to grant a five-mile strip on each sîde of the
rond, with the proviso that time crests of the
Mountains shall constitute the boundarios of
the area. The survey by the Surveyor Genoral
fixes the position of the crests, and the
description of the park as set out in the
sehiedule is 11ow in nocordance with the intention of the agreement. 0f course the outside
houindaries of the five-mile strips do iiot coincide with the position of the crcsts, and consequently it is necossary to provide that areas
added to the park como undcî the Parks Act,
and the areas beyond the crests are no longer
requircd for park purposos.
There is a change in the hoiundaries of
Riding Mountain National Park in Manitoba.

MOTION

DAY BILL

FOR SECOND READINO-DEBATE
'CONTINUED

The Senate resumned irom yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion af Hon. Mr.
Foster for the second reading ai Bill 8, an Act
respecting Canada Day.
Hon. C. E. FERLAND: Honourable senators, the abject of this bill, the short title ai
which is " The Canada Day Act," is the substitution of "Canada Day" for "Dominion Day»
as the name of aur national holiday an the
first ai July. The cýame "Dominion Day" was
first autharized by the Dominion Day Act of
1879, whieh was reproduced in the Revised
Statutes ai 1927.
I shall unhesitatingly support this bill, with
ail due respect for those honourable senators
who have opposed it in eloquent. and able
speeches. The celebration ai "Canada Day" on
the first ai July would recail ta aur minds the
birth ai confederation and' aur graduai development ta the statua ai a nation.
To those wha have suggested they do nat
like the present name ai the holiday, but
would prefer something other than "Canada
Day," I would point ont that the second
reading ai a bill involves an.ly its principhe.
This bill couhd be amended in committee or on
the thîrd reading. Sa iar -as I am concernedi, I
wouhd support the suggested ohange in the
namne ta "Coniederation Day," or ta "National
Day," for aur country is now a nation.
What we celebrate on the first ai July is
not the name "Dominion," but the great event
ai the union ai the provinces into a confederation. In other words, it is the birth ai aur
constitution, ai aur coniederation, ai aur

307

nation. The word "dominion" lias acquired a
colonial significance iii our history. In differern
periods Canada has been given different names.
At the beginning of aur history she wa.s a
French eolony. Under the Treaty of Paris she
Later on the
became an English colony.
country was divided inb the provinces of
Upper and Lower Canada, whieh were reunited by the Union, Act of 18-10. Then the
name "Dominion" was given by the British
North America Act of 1867.
Under the name "Dominion"~ our country
was stili a British colony, subjeet to the
domination of the British government. To
find out what were the aima and will of parliament at the time of the adoption of the
Dominion Day Act, in 1879, let us read the
42 Victoria,
of that statute,
preamble
chapter 47:Whereas it was on the first day of July that
the Provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick became one Dominion, under the
naine of Canada; and whereas Rupert's Land
and the Xorth-Western Territory, and the Province of British Columnbia became part of the
Dominion in the manth of July, and Prince
Edward Island becamie part of the Dominion on
the first *day of July; and whereas it is expedient that such important events should be
cammemorated; Theref are Her Majesty, by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate and
House of Commons af Canada, enacts as iollows:
1. Througbout the Dominion of Canada in
each and every year. the first day of July, not
being a Sunday, shall be a legal holiday, and
shall he kept and observed as sucb, under the
name of "Dominion Day."
At the London Conference of December,
1866, there was a slight and friendly dispute
between the British authorities and the Canadian delegates aver the name ta bc chosen for
Canada. Sir John A. Macdonald and the
ather Canadian delegates objected strongly ta
the prapased name of "Colany of Canada,"
and they suggested the "Kingdam of Canada."
In their resolutians they asked that the
provinces of Canada be united federally into
a canfedieratian; but that word is not incorporated in the British North America Act,
which uses instead the word "Union." The
name "Kingdom" was nat acceptable ta the
British statesmen-and 1 do nat blame them
-because they feared it would hurt the tender
susceptibilities of aur neigbbour ta the sou th;
and the expression "Dominion of Canada"
was finally accepted and incorporated in tbe
British North America Act.
It bas ta be remembered that at the time
of coniederation there were in the United
States some anti-Britisb elements and trouble
makers who were pauring ail on the fire started
by the Fenians and others. "We must take
Canada by ail means. by furce if she will not
came willingly," the New York Herald stated

jV'5

SENATE

on April 11, 18135. The Frencli-Canadians at
the time of the passing of the British North
Anmerica Act accepted confedieration without
cnithusiasm, indeed withi suspicion and fear,
as iînplicd in the slogans: "A change is necessar 'v and unavoidable." "We must accept confedi ration or face annexation by the United
States." It was far better that the FrenchCanadian minority should continue to enjoy
their esntial rights-rights attached f0 person
and family their religion, their language, their
civil code. their freedom in the domain of
education and the autonomy of thicir prov incial legîsiature.
I ask honourable senators, is it not truc that
French-Canadians. wxhethcr statesmen or private citizens, have nlways been loyal te the
Crown and faithful to confederation, preferring always British institutions te those of the
Unitcd States? British institutiuons have always bcen one of the main sources of our
prosperity, and our guarantee of peace and
sccurity.
We have heen told in this debate thaf
"Dominion" is a historie namne cho'.cu for goed
reasenis. and that if is net customaî'y te change
a Christian name. But "Dominion" is net a
Christian namne.
The honourable senator
from Vancouveci South (Hon. Mr. Farris)
suggested that tlîe name "D)ominion" was dlerix cd from the Bible, and in support of tlh lic
citcd psalm 72, verse 8: "He shall have
dominion from sea te sea frem the river te the
end ef the world." It is te 1)0 notcd that our
cent cf arms bears the phrase "A mari usque
ad miar-e"-i 0 EnglNi.i ''roii sca te sca". I do
net question the henourable gentleman's citation. But let uie s:îy te hueii tlîat "d ;ninion"
as uscd in the Bible means domination. We
find the word in several ef the beooks of the
Old and the Neiw Testamients:
And a mighity King shaîl stand up. that shaîl

-Psalmn XIV, 2.
.Whether tlîey be thîrones. or doiîînons. or
priniîcpaIities, or poix crs.-Colossianis 1, 16.
Some bonotirable senators who have spoken
in faveur of the bill read definitions frem
dictionaries; to the cffcf thaf "dominion"~
means a self-geverning state, subjeef te a gevernment ether than its own. I will net labour
the point. But there is ne doubt that in ifs
plural ferîn the word is dcfined in most of the
French and English dictionaries as nieaning
the British pessessions overseas. Wce are net
a British possession, but a nation associated
wifh the ether nations of the B3ritish Commonwealth ef Nations, and ef equal status with
them.

On that point we are aIl in agreement, and
I shahl net take the time ef the Senate te discuss our national statua. I need only say that
I am xvehl satisfied with the interpretatien
given by ail hionourable senators who have preceded me in this debate. The othier night the

3. The expression "colony" shall mean any
part of Her Majesty's dominions exclusive of
the British Islands, and of British India, and
where parts of such dominions are under both
a central and a local legislature, all parts under
the central legislature shall, for the purpose
of this definition, be deemed to be one colony.

Now, honourable senators, after listening
attentively to all the arguments advanced
against the bill I find they are to the effect
that the word "dominion" has acquired a new
significance under the Statute of Westminster.
The following clause is cited in support of
that view:
In this Act the expression "dominion" means
any of the following dominions, that is to say,
the Dominion of Canadaand so forth.
The only change, if any, is to the effect
that the term dominions now means and
includes the British countries overseas which
were not named dominions-for instance, the
Commonwealth of Australia, the Union of
South Africa, and so on. But let me add, in
the Statute of Westminster there is no other
definition of the word dominion. We must
name things appropriately-a child is a child;
a colony is a colony; a dominion is a dominion
-and we are a nation.
Now honourable senators, whatever may be
the significance of the great word "dominion,"
with all its traditions and memories, I would
submit with the greatest respect, that the
main purpose of this bill is not to change a
name which has been improperly chosen to
commemorate the events of the birth of our
confederation. The main aim of the bill is
to improve the conditions under which our
national holiday on the first of July is celebrated, to increase the popularity of that
holiday and to unite all Canadians in one
common sentiment in their commemoration
of the great events surrounding the birth of
our constitution and confederation. Canada,
with all its achievements, traditions and
evolutions is proud of its ascent from the
rank of a humble colony to that of a selfgoverning dominion, and thence to the status
of a nation-an international power allied
with the othet great nations of the British
commonwealth and working in co-operation
with the powerful United States of America
ta preserve peace and world security and
bring about a common prosperity.
It has been observed, honourable senators,
that our national

holiday is not celebrated

with enough enthusiasm in some sections of
the country. The old law does not even
declare that the first of July shall be a
national holiday. Under our statutes we have
two names for our first of July holiday. In
the English statutes it is called "Dominion

Day"; in the French Statutes of 1879, "le
jour anniversaire de la Confederation." For
that reason I do not agree with those who say
that the word "dominion" is a symbol of
unity, a word that unites the Canadian people
on the national holiday. The same duality
of expressions is to be found in the Revised
Statutes of 1886. It also occurs in the Interpretation Acts of the Revised Statutes of
1906 and 1927, and in the Special Interpretation Act of 1935. It has been said that the
word "dominion" is an English word for
which there is no parallel in the French
language. Why should we not adopt a word
that would have the same meaning in both
languages?
Honourable senators, before concluding let
me refer to the obsolete argument based on
the fear of weakening the ties that bind us to
the Mother Country. There is no substance
to that argument. The Canadian people have
remained British to the core with but little
in the way of legal ties since the so-called
Balfour Declaration of 1926, or at least since the
Statute of Westminster of 1931. Is it not true
that the ties that bind us to the Briish Crown
and Briish institutions are stronger today than
ever before? Our ties of friendship and memories of our political, social and historical
association with the British people must
remain in the minds of our people and become
part of our traditions and sentiments, the
subject of our common interest and our
national pride and faith.
We have been told for the last fifteen years
that Canada is a nation, but there may be
some people who do not believe it. It is a
nation without a flag of its own, without the
characteristics that are to be found in a free
nation. But let us act as a free nation; let us
remove the colonial label from our national
holiday and make our people more united by
celebrating Canada Day on the first of July.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Horner the debate
was adjourned.

t0 fthc Capo Breton Highlands National Park.
The Govcrnmcnt of Nova Scotia is desirous
and rcady to grant land to enlarge this park,
which is regarded as une of fthc mosf important
and picturesque in the whole Dominion.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: If seerns to me
that the buundaries of almost every other
national park are being extended by this bill.
Truc, the total area addcd is not large-a little
more than 23,000 acres, I think-but the important fact is fliat something is bcing donc to
improve each of the parks affected. The Nova
Scutia park, fbough, is not even mentioncd in
the bill, and it would appear to me that the
Minister of Mines and Resources is running
truc f0 form in that, improvements are being
made for fthc rest of the country whule the
Maritime Provinces are being ignored. Considering that thec province of Nova Scotia bias
expressd ifs willingness to pay for a grant of
land, I do of sec any reason in the world wby
flic Cape Breton Park is not deaît wifh. I
have nu more to say about the matter, except
to add that this conduef lias not beco unnoticcd by at lcast sorne peuple from Nova

of Nova Scotia is desirous of expropriating
some land, paying for it and making a gift
of it to the Dominion Government. But,
running true to forma, the department has
ignored this offer.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Does the honourabie senator know whether the Government of Nova
Scotia bas put itself on record to this effect
-with the Department of Mines and Resources?
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: What is the area of the
parcel that the province desires to grant?
lIon. Mr. MacLENNAN: I do not know
tbe exact area, but it is small in comparison
with the present area, of the park.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: While of course I
agree thoroughly with the descriptive eloquence of the honourable senator fromn
Margarce Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennaný) as to
,Cape Breton Highlands National Park, and
share bis belicf that it is without doubt the
most beautiful of our national parks, I arn
not in a position to answer the specifie question
he bas raised as to why tbe department has
not seen fit to accede to the requjes. of the
goveroment of Nova Scotia for 'an extension
of the park boundaries. I have no knowledge
of tbe matter, but I can assure the bonourable
gentleman that if he is agrecable to the bill
being given third reading, I wihl endeavour to
secure the required information for the benefit
of himself and of the bouse generalhy.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourabie senators, I amn advised that no further progress
has been made in the other place on the
interim supply bill, but it is hoped that the
bill will be ready for us early this evening.

I would therefore suggest that His Honour

interim supply. It will be recalled tbat the
total estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47
amount to $2,769,349,815.66.
One-sixth of
this sum bas already been voted. That onesixth was intended te cover two montbs'
supply, that is for the montbs of April and
May, but in fact it does not work out exactly
that way, because the financial requirements
for the first part of tbe year are nlot divisible
into equai rnonthly arnounts.
0f the total estimates the scm
of
$1,202,652,841.26 is authorized by statute; the
balance of $1,566,696X94.40 mnust bc voted by
parliament.
Section 2 provides for .S136,598,972.86,' being
one-twelfth of the main estimates. Section 3
provides for $2,327,018.33, or one-twelfth of
the items set forth in Scheile A, tetalling
$27,924,220. Section 4 provides for $64,91 1,397.66,
or one-sixtb et tue several items set forth in
Scbediîle B. totalling $389,468,386. The total
interim supply is therefore $203,8372388.85.
Schedule B comprises mainly expenditurcs
of $283.170.171 for the armed forces, and
$89.900.000 for recons-truction and supply.
I might point eut that. as bonocrable ntembers will readîly appreciate, the expenditurc
for tue arnied forces in the early part of the
year is very mci heavier titin it iveuld be
on the ordinaî'y mûnihly basis.
Titis aise
applies to reconstruction and supplv, wiîerc
tue main expenditure is for liquida'ti'on and
termination of ceîîtracts.
Needless te say, lionourable senators. if you
s-e fit te pass tue bill, any questions whiciî
may arise witli respect te the main estunrates
ivill of course ho quite in eider wbcn the final
supply bill is placed before titis lieuse.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: ilonourable senators, it is not my intention to deiay the bouse
for more titan a fcw moments. I do not intend
to object now to the items mentioned by the
honourable leader of tue goveroment, but I
reserve the rigbt te do se whcn the general
estimates cerne deîvn.
May I take this opportunity of making a
suggestion te the goveranent? It is my
opinion that parliarnent sbould meet early
in Jancary every year, and that there is ne
justification for cornmencing a session in the
middle of March. Members wiîo corne from a
distance find it a bardslîip te be here during
the summer months, w-len weather conditions
in this part of Canada arc most uncomfortable.
I know of many parts of the country wbere
the summier weather is mcch more pleasant
than it is in Ottawa.
I do net tltink ne should be asked te vote
estimates for more than one or two rnonths
until we know tue source fromn whicha the
Hon. Mr. ROBIERTSON-

money will corne. We have already voted
one-sixtiî of the year's estimates and now we
are asked to vote a similar arnounit. If the
members of parliament outside of the government are going to exercise any real control
over expenditures. the goeonnient should not
only bring down its estimates but shouldi idieate its sources of revenue. Nobody can judge
of the wisdom of expenditures unless they
know the basis upon wbicb the money to meet
them is to be raised. Thexe are some people
who run wild and incur obligations witbout
knowing wbere tbey are going to get the money
from to meet them, but that is not the cornmon practice in everyday 111e.
On more tlîan one occasion I have objected
on behaif of the people of my province, and
I object now, to the controls which certain
government officiais exercise in defiance of
parliarncnt, tfnd which they refuse te remet e.
The statement of the Minister of Finance
that lie controls, is no answer te this objection,
because from a practical standpoint the policies are made by people outside of the government altogether. We have drifted into a position from which it is bard to escape.
If the budg-et were brought dlown in February or MarcFh we would have an opportcnity,
before voting a dollar of supply, to sec where
the monvy tvas corning from. We cocld tben
go over the items, and if there were aniy we
did not like, eut tbey would go.
lion. Mr. MURDOCK: Does thc bonourable gentleman scggest tbat we bave the

Tbose days are past and we are back to

across the border to the United States, or

we want to produce goods in this country
we have got to cut taxes. The voting of
money before we know what the taxes are
going to be is wrong in principle, and I object to this procedure. However, since the
public service must be carried on, I will vote
for the bill, but under protest. I hope that
the next session of parliament wi]l be called

will flot postpone the budget until nearly the

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
23, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Robertson for the second reading
of Bihl L5, an Act to amend the Unemphoyment Insurance Act.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: flonourable senstors, I am not rising in opposition to this bill;
indeed, I think a good deal can be said for
some of the amendments it proposes. I an)
flot able to give in detail the effect of each
of the amendments, but I think the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) did that pretty well when he
explained the bill hast Thursday. He indicated that the principal amendments were
three in number: 1, to, place the administration of the employment service under the
Minister of Labour; 2, to increase from $1
to $1.50 a day the imit which may be earned
by a person on unempinyment relief; and 3,
to make compulsory the reporting of information concerning employment. I certainly do
not disagree with amendments 2 or 3. No. 3
will of course entail ciuite a bit of additionah
work, but it will help to give a better idea
of the unemployment situation.
What I want to deal with is something
more fundamental. As originally drafted, the
set was to be administered by a commission
independent of the government. Those of us
who were members of this house whien that
measure wvas before us will remember that
there was considerable objection to the
appointment of a body which was outside the
control of the government, and a good many
of us suggested that the real test would corne
when unemployment hecame serious. There
bas been no real test since 1941, because there
were more jobs than people to fill them, and
naturahly the fond accumulated a considerable reserve. But as I asked the honourable
senator from Inkerman hast week, 1 %'ant to
know what bas happened since January,
1946. Up to that point there had been vcry
hittle unemphoyment in the strict sense of the
term. The war with Germany terminated
in May of hast year and the war with Japan
in August. Then the soldiers began returning
home, but there was a certain amount of
reconstruction work, and unemphoyment rcahhy

should not bave te psy a tax, in my opinion.
If a man working with a -real estate firm loses
bis position or wisbes to change bis job, it
depends largely upon bis own endeavours
whether he gets employ'ment mith another flrm.
If you coeclucted a real estate office and wanted
a man, it would net help much to have the
Unempîcymeet Insurance Commission send a
man to you. You wouldi want a person in whom
you could place confidence, for the business is
a peculiar kind of business. In that respect it
is like law aed the insurance business. I objeet
to the principle which requires these people te
make unemployment insurance contributions,
though I do say that it is better than. what we
are doing ie regard te old age pensions an<l
children's allowances.
I arn pleased that the administration cf part
cf the act is being brouglit under the Department cf Labour. During several y.ears there
bas been a tendency in Canada te put thc
administration cf laws un-der commissions.
Take the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
You cannet get at them at aIl; yet if there
is a shortage cf moeey, the people have te
pay the piper. Se I arn glad te note a change
from the praetice cf recent years, and te sec a
partial return te the eIder practicP cf havieg
laws administered by people xvho can be lield
accountable.
I think the proposed ameedmnents will improve the law. I would bave preferred it if the
bill had genýe farther and placel the whole act
und;er a department cf government, whicb
would then have been beld responsible for the
entire administration. No brains are required
by a commission that simply collects se many
millions cf dollars and invests tbem in gevernment honds--which is the only security the
commission dices invest in. I have notbieg
against the commission personally aed arn
not criticizing it. Se far as I know, it bas
carried on satisfa.ctorily, but my point is that
a commission is not needed at all. Apart from
that point, I am quite willing that tbe bill
should pass anýd go te committee.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable senators,
I bave a f ew remarks te make with regaýd to
tbis rather important piece of legîsiation. First
I wish te compliment the bonourable senator
from. Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) upon
the way he explained the bill after second
reading bad been moved. In bis explanation
be toucbed on most of tbe important features
of the Unemployment Insurance Act, and
he did this in sucb a splendid way that I
tbink we are all indebted te bim.
The Unemployment Insurance Act is modern legislation. The act bas been in force for
some five years, and it is only natural that
it should be amended se, as te be brought up

315

to date and in line with the experience we
have gained over that period. I think al]
wilI agree that the act was put into force at a
was
Employment
time.
very opportune
increasing and pay-rolls were expanding. Both
employment and pay-rolls kept on expanding
during the whole period of the war, se that a
considerable fund was buit up without a corresponding drain upon it, and after benefits
of S39,425,155.81 had been paid there was a
net revenue of $317,240,660.34. 1 think we al]
realize that the last five years were rather
easy on the insurance fund, but there are
signs that careful handling and intelligent
administration will be needed in the future
in order that the fund may fulfil the purposes
for whicb it was intended. It will be noted
that in the month enidîng March 31, 1946, the
persons comrnencing benefit on initial dlaim
numbered 1,56,180, and that for the month
thereý was a deficit of $1,569,858.60. This would
look as though the outgo of the fund is
catching up with the intake, and it is for.
tunate indeed that we have had the experience
of five years' full employment.
There bas been some discussion about
unemployment, in this bouse and in various
parts of the country. We are told that in
Mardi unemployment was a bit abnormal,
due to the confusion of reconversion and tbe
seasonal unemployment that prevails in many
Canadian industries at that time of year. I
think it can fairly bc said that unempîcyment
insurance may have contributed somewhat to
the statistical number of unexnployed in
Canada. I know from experience that this is
truc. The principle of unemployment insurance is that it provides a contributed fund
which is pooled for the purpose of relieving
those who are unemployed. And that purpose
sbould be kept in mmnd.
Botb unemployment insurance and family
allowances belp to remove from unemployment some of the disastrous features of other
days. Sometimes people will go on unemployrnent insurance when tbey sbould flnd
another job. Under the Unemployment insurance Act, section 27, a person must, among
otber tbings, prove that he is unable to obtain
suitable employment; and it seems te, me that
for the proper functioning of this valuable
piece of legisiation considerable attention
should be given te wbat is "suitable" employment. The new section 40 which appears
in the bill deals with disqualification for
neglecting the opportunity to work or failure
to attend a course of instruction. Subsection
2 of this section reads:
For the purposes of tbis section, employinent
shall be deemed not te be suitable employment
for a elaimiant if it is
(a) empîcyment arising in consequence of a
stoppage of wokdue to a labour dispute;

ý;l4jSENATE
(b) employment in bis usual occupation at a
lower rate of wvages, or- on condlitions less favourable than those observcd by agreement between
employers and employees, or failing any such
agreement, than those recegnized by good cruployers; or
(c) employment of a kind other thon employnient in lis usual occ.upation at a ]nwer rate of
ivages, or on conditions less favourable than
those which lie might reasoiiably expert to obtain, having regard to those xvhich hie habitually
obtained in bis usual occupation, or would bave
obtaincd Iîad hoe continued to be employ ed.
Next is what I ronsider the important part
of the section, because. as I bave said, thon'
should be a definition of what is "suitable"
employment. This is subscction 3:
Notivithstanding paragraph (c) of subsection
two of this section, ofter a lobse of such an
interval from tbe date on which an insured
person becomnes uncmploycd as, in the circumstances of the case, is reasonable. employment
shall not be deemed to be not suitab1e by reason
0n13 that it is employnient of a kind other than
eniplo3 ment in the usual occupation of tue iiisured person, if it is cmployment at a rate of
wages not lower and on conditions not, lcss
favourable than those observoîl by agreement
betweon employccs anti etaployers or, failing any
sucli agreemnîct, thon those recognizod by good

that by the prepesed amendment the xînempioyment service wiii ho piaced under the
Minister ef Labour.
The efficers of the
departmnent knew the personnel in any industry who are un the tide going out ur tuming
in. I thînk it is very desirable that the
employment service sheuld ho hnndied by
this commission.
The additional duties of the commission
are set forth in subsection 4 of section 20 in
these werds:
The Commission shall assume and carry eut
such ether duties and .'esponsibilities as the
Governor iii Council, oit the recomnnendation
of the MNinister, may require frein trne te time
and, in respect of snch o thier duties and respunsibilities, shall be responsible te the Minister.
That is, the government is reaiiy assuming
the responsibility of providing employment
se for as lies within its pewer.
My heneurabie friend aIse referred te the
extension of the daiiy rate of benefit te certain persons with dî'pendents. It is in paragraph (d) of section 31, subsectien 1, and
incindes:

fire, but I hope I may not need insurance benefits. The man out of employment is the unfortunate man. So everybody pays unemployment insurance and the unfortunate man
reaps the benefit. At the same time ail who
contribute are putting themselves in a position where, if they lose their jobs, they will
get the benefit of unemployment insurance. I
have seen many boys leave banks or insurance companies thinking to improve their
positions, but a'fter a while I have been sorry
to see them unemployed. It always seemed
to me to be a mistake to exclude the socalled "safe" industries from the act.
Reference has been made to the extension
of the Unemployment Insurance Act to
lumbering and logging. The different seasonal and climatie conditions under which the
industry carries on in various parts of the
country make the administrative problem
extremely difficult. In the Maritime Provinces
farmers work in the lumber camps during
the winter. For many years the question
of whether or not this industry should come
under the workmen's compensation legislation
was a bone of contention, some maintaining
that its inclusion would impose a burden
on the board and on the industry. It may be
that in some of the provinces lumbering is
on such a permanent scale that it could be
brought under the Unemployment Insurance
Act, but in other provinces it may not be
desirable to do so. I think it is well that
the provisions of the act should be extended
piecemeal and applied only where the necessity
is indicated.
We are told that special privileges are given

I was interested in the remarks of the leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) to the effect that
in this country we were drifting into a condition of control by bureaucrats, and that

to returned soldiers. That is true. Many of
these men are returning to our plants. The
honourable gentleman from Inkerman stated
that the fund is on an actuarial basis, so that
if the benefits of the act were extended too
freely the fund might be impaired from an

actuarial standpoint.
making a contribution to the fund for the
purpose of assistang those who have returned
after fighting in defence of their country, and
they have received benefits without impairing
the fund.
There is a provision in the act which
increases from a dollar to a dollar and a half
a day the amount an unemployed person
may earn and still be permitted to draw on
the fund. That provision might work both
ways. It might be an incentive to a man to
do some work; on the other hand, it is pretty
hard to prove how much a day is earned by
farmers or their sons, and I can visualize
a situation in which a man upon leaving the
factory could go and work on the farm and
at the same time draw unemployment insurance benefits.

purpose for which it was intended. While it is
necessary to make drastie provisions to pre-

they were doing things they should not do. I
take the stand that when a responsible senator makes an accusation of that kind he

should, in fairness to the civil service, be more
specific. But I do not think the honourable
gentleman intended it in that way.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes I did, and I will
give names if you want me to do so.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I think it would be
better to make the accusation in that way.
The honourable gentleman thought we were
taking the management of unemployment
insurance out of the hands of the commission.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: We are putting it into
the hands of the minister.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: We are putting certain
features of it into the hands of a responsible
minister, but I should not like to see the
unemployment insurance fund made a matter
of political control. I think it should have an
actuarial set-up and its management should be

independent and for the protection of ail
classes of people who contribute to it. The
Unemployment Insurance Act is a fine piece of
legislation, and I have no doubt that in the
future it will be used extensively. But in aIl
legislation which provides for the pooling of
money we must remember that the fund must
be guarded so that the money will go to the

vent malingering under the act, I think we

all agree that the man who is unfortunate
enough to be unemployed should be cushioned
by the state so that he can carry on, and that
every industry that is able to pay should contribute its share to the fund.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I should like to pay tribute to
this remarkable piece of legislation. It is with
some satisfaction that I recollect that I was a

member of the committee in another place
which considered this legislation before it was
enacted in 1940, to come into effect in June,
1941. The act has thoroughly justified the
hope that we entertained for it at that time.

I am inclined to agree with the views expressed by the leader opposite, rather than
with those of my friend from Queen's Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley), with respect to the
abolition of the commission. Commissions, as
I have said before, are the most irresponsible

SENATE
and least responsive form of democratic government which we possess in this country. I
faveur-to use the words of the honourable
gentleman-"political control."
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Responsible political
contrul.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Why should political
control be irresponsible? I would put as much
confidence in a minister cf the Crown, irrespective of the party te which he belonged, as
ie some individual selected and appointeci by
order in counicil. I would put as much confidence in the Minister of Labour, who has te
justify bis acts and reply in the house te the
questions put by the opposition, as 1 would
in some person wbo could serve a purpose and
hide behind anonymity. So if in these proposed amendments there is a tendency towards
the abolition of the commission, I arn in faveur
of it.
I do net agree with the bonourable senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr, IHaig) whien he
criticizes the provisions of the act which require people ie more stable ferms cf employment than others te make contributions. That
question was argued at some lengtb before the
committee in anothor place before the act was
adopted. The bankers appearcd before that
committee, and representations Ivere made on
bebaif of their employees. It was said that
because bank clerks occupied a very assured
position and the turnover in personnel ivas very
slight as compared with other forms of empinyment, it was unfair that they should have
to contribute as much as those in more procarieus kinds of ompîcyment. Our ansvor was:
If bank clcrks have assured employment,' they
are lucky and should net refuse te make somo
contribution towards a fund for the protection
cf people whoso empîcymont is less stable.
Furthormorc, it was pointod eut at that time
that it was utterly impossible te draw a line
botween one type cf empicyment and anothor,
and te say: We will beave this cne eut hocause it is assured, and incitide ibiat one be-aci.e
it is precarieus. The wholc net justifies itseIlf

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I include both public
and separate sehools. Such institutions are the
guardians cf our ceuntry's future.

millirin people were enjoying the protection
afforded by this act, and ne one could: definitely say that ho was beyond the possibility
of becoming unempleyed. Between the 31st of
J'uly, 1941, whon the set came inte force, and
tbe 31st cf August, 1915, whieh is the latost
date for whicb I have figures, there was deposited in the insurance fond S310,000,O00. Out
cf that sum xxe have païd insurance dlaims
amecnting te about $10,500,000, se that at the
presenit time we have as a backlog of insurance

This is humanitarian legislation cf the

w i-est type. I arn giad te sec that mieds are
at work upon it te impreve it. I have net

Hon. G. G. McGEER: Honourable seitators, 1 think thiere is a good deal te ho said
for, those people who centribute te the unernploymeet insurance fund and have little hope
cf getting any benefit, since they are net
Iikely te become ueemployed. I have in mind
net bank clerks or otiier classes cf empîcyees

being laid off. He pays into the fond continuously. He belungs te, tîmat grcup cernpendiously described as the lucky cnes xvbo
should ho willing te centribute te the wellbcing cf tlioir less fortunate brothers. That
is a fine sentiment, but it dees seem te me
that this wliole programme, w'ith aIl its magnificent fentures, w'ould hc greatly strengtbened if there were added te it a provision that
wbee* a man reaches retiring age, whether
that ho 60 or 65, hoe shaîl ho entitled te participate in a retiring allewanco. That would
ho a basis for the development of a sound and
practical contributory eld age pension scheme.
My ewn view is that the ameedment which
transferred
jurisdiction

MAY 27, 1946
is wide enough to include a provision for
retirement allowances or compensation for
old age. That may or may not be a correct
opinion, and it may be necessary to arnend
the contributory feature further. Certainly a
contributory old age pension scheme is long
overdue, and if it were included in the benefits
flowing from this measure there would be
much more justice in the exactions now imposed upo;n that group of industrious workers
who are the backbone of ail successful businesses within the insured classes. Aise, it
wculd make the benefits far wider and the
burdens less onerous.
This type of legisiation is in keeping with
the times. 1 do flot think we should overestimate the fact that during the last few years
of intensive employment we have accumulated
a very large sur-plus. Wc have also accumulated a tremendous industrial capacity and a
new army of trained industrial workers. That
fact in itself has imposed a new responsibility
to expand external trade and internaI consurnption, and it carrnes with it the risk of increased
unernploy ment in the event of collapse. It is
in such a collapse, or the possibility of
it, that our qociety faces its greatest danger.
Whatc ver else may be said of the lessons we
have learned from this war, ne one can deny
that we on this continent, in both Canada
and the United States, have achicved the
capacity to prodiice with comparative case an
abundance of ail that we need, not mcrely of
the necessities of life, but of thc many comforts and conveniences which go to make up
a mucb higher standard of living than we
ever before enjoyed. That lesson is not something which can be brushed aside with indifference, for it carnies a new responsibility and
a greater difficulty into the field of goverfiment. The distribution of abundance prcsents
society and governmcnt with prohlcmns far
greater, not only in number but in complexity,
than cver develop in periods of scarcity.
I arn somewhat concerned about the problem
mentioned tcnigbt by the honourable leader
of the opposition (Hon. Mr. Haig)-that cf
working out a price which wiil give the farmer
a fair rcturn for the food hie 'produces and
yet ba low enough that the chiidren of the
poorest in the city can get the nutrition they
need. It is a vcry easy thing to sit at home
and drink milk, but it is another thing to go
out morning and evening, seven days in the
week. and milk cows. We are ail comfortable
as we sit beside a grate with a coal fire, but
it ia not so comfortable to go down into the
bowels of the earth and dig out the coal. In
an age cf abundance it becomes the responaibility cf the goverfiment te sec that the
production cf the ncccssitics cf life, whether on

the farm or in the mine, is attractive to the
producers, and that food and fuel are available at pricea that consumers in the cities
and other communities can pay.
D.uring the war men, women and, children
went te wurk, and family incarnes increaaed
enormously. The only people wbc suffered
any measure cf hardship were the wo-men
who had te look after their families whiie
their husbandîs were overseas. When wages
were flowing in a stream the like of which we
had neyer known -before, we helped the farmer
te produce by giving him a bonus which hcld
down the price for thc consumnera in the cities.
Now aur soldiera have returned from overseas,
and young men who served in the forces for
several years are bringing up families. Ail cf
a sudden we find the gcvernment witbdrawing
the bonus that was used te keep down the
price cf rnilk during the war, and now the
retûrned seldier, with his young family, has to
carry a burden that we thougbt was tee hcavy
for the highly paid industrial worker during
the years cf wartime wages. We are reverting
ta the samne kind cf thinking that brougbt us
into the appalling disaster of the hungry and
workless thirties, wben in this great nation of
Canada, with ail. its wealtb, we saw our youth
straggling acrosa the countryside, weary and
wanting food, and unable ta find anything to
do in a land where millions of jobs were
crying to be donc. The bonourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mn. Haig) tonight condemned
the bonus on miik, wbicb gave an incentive
to the farmer ta produce, and made it possible
for the cbiidren of our land to receive the
nourisbrnent se essential ta their develcpment. If tbat kind cf tbinking ever again
dominates in the Dominion cf Canada, then
tbe troubles we suffened during the bungry
thirties will be as notbing ta the wave of disaster tbat will sweep ever tbe land in tbe wake
of a depression brought about by such a
pbilosopby.
This kind cf legislation is long overdue in
Canada. The act bas been in openation only
a fcw ycars. The fact tbat this bill cornes
before us with such a volume of amendments
should commend it te us.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: I sbould like te hear
the honeunable senaton's opinion as te %hether

CANADA DAY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINO-DEBATE
CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, May
23, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Foster for the second reading of
Bill S, an Act respecting Canada Day.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourabýle senators.
I desire to say a few words on this bill, but
I can assure Ris Honour the Speaker that in
doing so I shall not transgress the rides of the
Senate by reading either my own remarks or
newspaper articles and comments.
I wish te congratulate the boneurable
senator for Riga.ud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) wbo
sp oke in favour of the bill. I -understand that
he is a lawyer, and if 1 had a doubtful case 1
should be very glad, to secure bis services, for
it seemed te me he acquitted himself very
well in presenting what I consider a bad case.
I would also congratuhate a colleague from
my own province, the honourable senator from
Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte), on bis convinc.
ing speech against the bill.
I wish to discuss this bill from an angle thalias flot been considered by any of those wbo
have preceded me in thia debate. It is true
that in the older parts of Canada the people
would regard any attempt to change the naine
of our national holiday as qiuite an undertaking. And this feeling, I am convinced, aise
pervades the people of the more recently
settled provinces. I have watched the western
provinces grow. Following the building of the
railroads, villages sprang up every ten miles
or so, scbools were built, and the population,
drawn largely from ail parts of the world, soon
became good Canadýian citizens. The first duty
of the school teachers was to impress on their
pupils the significance of Dominion Day, and
throughout the scbools of Saskatchewan the
lst of July is ceiebrated as the anniversary of
the day when the Dominion of Canada was
horn.
Therefore, te change the name cf
Dominion Day weuld be, te say the ieast,
very confusing.
I can assure the honourable senator from
Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. MoGeer) that
in my part cf the country we do celebrate
Dominion Day. The celebration may have
been considered tame on some occasions, because I have been asked, to make a few
remarks. I believe that Ottawa's Dominion
Day celebrations are net what they would be
if the honourable senator from Vancouver-

full and time would net permit.

The honourahle senater from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) gave the definition of tho word "dominion" fronî an Anit'can

wxhat the Americans think. They like te poke
a little fun at us. For instance, a geegraphy

Canada as a narrow strip of Land north of the

Hon. JEAN MARIE DESSUREAULT:
Honourable senators, se much has already been
said regarding the Canada Day bill that 1 (do
net wish to unduly prolong the debate. The
honourable scnators who have already spoken
have presented bnth sides of the argument so
well that I can say very little without repeating what they have said. Frankly, 1 have net
rnany new arguments to present in support of
the hill, but 1 should like, briefly, to give my
viewpoint on this much-discussed and controversial question.
I do flot sec why there should be se much
opposition in this hionourable chamber to
rhanging the designation "Dominion Day" to
"Canada Day", or some other appropriate and
genera]b -acicopted naine. Personally 1 arn in
favour of the change because I believe the title
'Dominion Day" does not conivey the true
ýýignificance of our national holiday. It reminds one too much of the old days when
Canada w-as merely a British colony. I feel
that Catnada, like othor free counitries should
now have a historical national holiday which
is its vcry own.

It is interesting to note that there is ne
proper French translation for "Dominion Day,"
wheroas the w'ord "'confe<doration" lias iclentically the samo rneaning in French as in Engii.
Further, the chiidren in the schools of Quehec

MAY 28, 1946

States, "Confederation Day" as the name of
our national holiday would be somewhat similar to "Independence Day," the name of their
national holiday, the 4th of July, when they
commemorate their declaration of independence.
I respect the opinion of all honourable
members who have either supported the bill
or opposed it, but I appeal to their good
spirit to accept an honourable compromise
rather than kill the bill, which has received the
assent of a large majority in the other house.
I cannot agree that this bill, though sponsored
by a French-Canadian member of the other
place, is a French-Canadian bill, for after long
discussion it has been approved by a great
majority of English-speaking Canadians.
As the representative in this honourable
house of the people of Quebec City, who are
largely French Canadians, I think I know
them and can express their feelings; and I
am confident in saying that they are just as
loyal as any other Canadians, regardless of
origin, and that they do not like the name
Dominion," which can be interpreted as
signifying domination. They want only equity
and equality and do not seek to rule over
others, and I think they are entitled to expect
and receive the full co-operation of others
which will help to bring about the achievement of unity in this country of ours.
For these reasons I hope all honourable
members will support the bill on second
reading, after which I undertake to move or
support an amendment proposing "Confederation Day" as an honourable compromise with
those who object to "Canada Day."
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT (Translation): Honourable senators. may I be permitted to add a few words in French about
this famed "Canada Day" bill? I shall net
discuss the advantage of using the word
"Canada" instead of the word "Dominion",
nor the reason why the name "Dominion
Day" was given to the legal holiday of July
lst. Hearing all the speeches delivered on this
bill, I had, at times, the impression of being
in attendance at a sitting of the U.N.O. in
New York, where all the United Nations met
and were, in the end, less united than ever.
This also . happened in the case of the
Paris conference of the foreign ministers of
the four greatest and, most powerful, nations of
the world, who met in order to ensure the
fullest freedom to all peoples of the world but
parted without having been able to reach any
agreement.
If this Canada of ours is to be truly strong
and powerful, she must acquire a patriotic
spirit such that each and every one among us
may become convinced that we have some ob-

ject in view, that we are not indulging in mere
banter, that we are endeavouring to build up
a strong and prosperous nation. Let us stop
this bandying of words and devote our attention to action and facts.
Years ago, Confederation came into being.
Twelve years later, some thought was given
to the establishment of a national holiday.
Unfortunately, instead of being called "Confederation Day" it was given the name of
"Dominion Day", and we are told that this
name must be preserved, because it commemorates something which was donc at that
time. That is true, and I respect the views of
those who hold that opinion. Since then,
however, our country has progressed; the
Statute of Westminster, granting us independence, has received imperial sanction; we
may henceforth appoint diplomatie representatives to any country in the world, and
we are free to sign our own treaties, as an
independent nation.
From confederation to this day, Canada has
fought the wars of 1914-18 and 1939-45, doing
perhaps more than she should and more than
she could. It thus seems to me that we are
known throughout the entire world under the
name of "Canada."
Seeing that we have achieved such unity by
working for this Canada of ours, why not give
to confederation, on the lst of July, its real
and true meaning? We will bring to life in
our time the dreams of our fathers. To my
mind, the rallying cry of all Canadians should
be on our lips on the lst of July, because we
are all Canadians, and we should sing not only
of past glories, but of present doings and
future hopes, crying out with one soul and one
voice: "O Canada, my beloved country!"
It is most fitting that we sbould wish to
commemorate our forefathers. Can one find
a better word than "Canada" to honour the
memory of all the ancestors of Canada? That
name was bestowed on our country from the
outset and therefore stands for all of its
people. Let us net pass up the splendid
opportunity provided by the July lst comof
sense
this
develop
to
memoration
patriotism, this feeling of attachment for our
country; -let us celebrate "Canada Day," and
be content with rejoicing in the Canadian
spirit rather than in the spirit of a dominion,
as was suggested a few years ago.
Canada, whether spoken in French or
English, remains the same. To us, the word
"Canada" represents not only a country by
adoption but the land of our birth, the background of our development, the resting place
where tomorrow we shall be happy to take
our last sleep, blessing and loving this name
which has a meaning for us since it stands

In the main these briefs dealt with those
aspects of the dominion tax systei which impose hardship as being, in the opinion of their
proponents, inimical to a healthy economie
development of this country and to certain
rights of the individual. Some of the briefs
have suggested remedies or alternative courses
of action which might be taken by the government to remove the objects of criticism.
Having considered the objections, criticisms
and remedies stressed by the varions organizations heard, it has been thought fit to prepare
a report embodying certain conclusions and
setting forth certain possible courses of action
which night commend themselves as suitable
means of reaching a nuiber of the objectives
for which your committee was set up.
Before considering hypothetical suggestions
relating to any reorganization of the tax
administration or a redraft of the law itself,
it is necessary to consider briefly the factors
in the field of dominion taxation wbich appear
to underlie the criticisms voiced by the witnesses. Briefly, public dissatisfaction appears
to concern itself with three broad general heads.
1. There is dissatisfaction with the appeal
procedure as now found in the Income War
Tax Act and with the lack of facilities afforded
taxpayers to have cases decided ranidly and
objectively. Co-existing with this feeling is the
more technical and less widely held objection
to the use of ministerial or administrative discretion and to the absolute authority of the
administration in nany matters of substantive
importance.
As exemplifying the widespread discretionary
jurisdiction now granted to the Minister of
STational Revenue, representations have been
made which categorize the fields of administrative and iinisterial discretion under the following heads:
A. Administrative and punitive powers;
B. Powers which make the minister the judge
of reasonableness or equity;
C. Powers which ceonstitute the minister the
judge of the facts;
D. Powers to grant or refuse exemption and
allowances;
E. Power to approve a pension fund or plan.
For a detailed analysis of the number and
degree of discretionary powers accorded to the
Minister of National Revenue, see Appendix A.
2. Secondly, a portion of the criticism which
has been received deals with the phraseology of
the statute itself. There appears to be a growing feeling among economists, lawyers and accouintants throughout Canada that the language
of the present dominion Income War Tax Act
is no longer capable of permitting the legislation
to fill its proper place in the vastly changed
economic structure of the country in the face
of concepts of profit and necessary expenditures

which now exist when compared with those
whose presence helped to shape the original
statute in 1917.
3. The third head under which criticism
falls is that pertaining to the administrative
framework of the Taxation Division itself. Most
of these objections are directed to the low
salaries paid, delays within the Department,
in assessing and the disposition of individual
cases, and to the inability of the public to obtain
the varions inter-office administrative directives
that are issued to the district offices by the
Deputy Minister at frequent intervals.
It is our proposal, therefore, that the report
be submitted in threc parts, each part dealing
with remedies applicable to the thrce main
phases of the criticisms received. While this
part of the report will be chiefly confined to
the criticisms and proposed remedies relating
to appeal procedure and the exercise of
ministerial discretion, it is felt by your committee that certain of the suggestions and
recommendations made with respect to matters
which properly fall into categories 2 and 3
above are of such prime importance that they
should be noted briefly at this stage. As much
as possible. the suggested solutions are drawn
from the briefs presented to us. In a sumbstantial measure, however, the contents of this
report also necessarily reflect the conclusions of
the committee.
Almost without exception the witnesses who
appeared before your committee urgently advocated a complote revision of the taxing
statute to the end that not only may clarity
and coherence be achieved but that its provisions be brought into conformity with modern
business practice. With this suggestion your
committee is in complete accord.
Specific examples cited as illustrative of the
need are the present limitative forms of sections
6(1) (a) and 16 of the Income War Tax Act.
It is suggested that section 6(1) (a) ba amended
to conform with modern accounting practice.
While your committee does not put forward at
this time a concrete suggestion in legislative
form, it is suggested that the general principles
underlying the proposal which was made by
Lord Macmillan who presided over the Income
Tax Codification Committee appointed in 1926
in England be given serions consideration. This
recomniendation reads as follows:
"The amount of the profits of a business shall
be computed in accordance wi.th the ordinary
commercial principles applicable to the computation of the profits of that business."
Moreover, at the present time, there would
appear to be no provision in the Income War
Tax Act which would allow the taxpayer as
a matter of. right to maintain his acconnts and
report his profits on an accrual basis. While the
taxing authorities have in most cases recognized
this to be a practical necessity for the efficient
conduct of modern business, it is recommended
that the statute be amended to give clear
statutory authority for such practice.
It is also recommended that section 16 should
be so amended as to clearly define a liability
which shall be certain and subject to accurate
computation arising out of certain alterations
in corporate capital structure already referred
to in tha.t section. For example, a measure of
the liability might be the monetary gain to
shareholders occasioned by any capital reorganization or share split whichl increased

liecomes important t-o consider the juniediction

MAY 28, 1946
of this court as granted to it in matters of
income taxation by Section 66 of the Income
War Tax Act.
Section 66 reads as follows:
"Subject to the provisions of this Act, the
Exchequer Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions
that may arise in connection with any assessment made under this Act and in delivering
judgment may make any order as to payment
of any tax, interest or penalty or as to costs
as to the said court may seem right and
proper."
An ancillary power of the court in conneetion with the disposition of an appeal by a taxpayer is found in section 65, subsection (2)
where it is stated that
"The court may refer the matter back ta
the minister for further consideration".
It will be noted from the above that under
the express language of the statute an appeal
is stated to be from an assessment only. This
has been confirmed on a number of occasions
by the Exchequer Court of Canada and the
inference is clear that there is no direct appeal
from the exercise of the minister's discretion
per se. The only method by which a taxpayer
can attack or even question the exercise of
ministerial discretion under the law as presently
constituted is by means of taking an appeal to
the Exchequer Court and urging that the court
consider the exercise of discretion as one of
the factors in the assessment which is appealed
against.
The practical effect of such an appeal involving discretion may be judged by the fact that
the leading decisions of the courts in Canada
and the United Kingdom in this connection
disclose that a court may only interfere with
the exercise of a discretionary power where it
appears that:1. The discretion has not really been
exercised.
2. It has not been exercised honestly and
fairly.

3. The person exercising the discretion was
influenced by extraneous and irrelevant facts.
4. The decision was based on principles incorrect in law. Important Canadian cases in this
connection are: Pioneer Laundry and Dry
Cleaners Limited, v. Minister of National
Revenue, (1940) A.C. 127; Pioneer Laundry
and Dry Cleaners Limited v. Minister of
National Revenue, (1942) Canada Tax Cases
201; the King v. Noxzema Chemical Company
of Canada Limited, (1942) Canada Tax Cases
21; Nicholson v. Minister of National Revenue,
(1945) Canada Tax Cases 263, and Wrights'
Canadian Ropes Limited v. Minister of
National Revenue, (1945) Canada Tax Cases
177; (1946) Canada Tax Cases 73.
Accordingly, it is now well established in law
that, iføthe court determines, by applying the
canons of the proper exercise of iinisterial
discretion, that such discretion bas not been
properly used, it may only state that the assessment bas been erroneously or wrongly levied
and refer the matter back to the Minister of
National Revenue under subsection (2) of section 65. In no case may the court adjudicate
upon or substitute its own opinion for the disIf the
cretionary opinion of the minister.
element of discretionary consideration in the
assessment bas satisfied all the tests of legal
propriety as above set forth, then, assuming
the assessment to be otherwise in order, the

court may not interfere in any way with the
conclusions of the minister or the issue of the
assessment. If, however, discretion bas been
imnproperly exercised in the light of the established legal principles all that the court may
do is to refer the assessment back to' the
minister to he considered again.
Thus, under the present statute and the case
law, there does not appear to be an instance
where the court eau review the actual substance
of the iminister's discretion, even if improperly
exercised, or substitute its opinion for the
minister's, if it so desires.
Suggested Remedies

Your committee bas been greatly impressed
by the urgency of the criticisn directed at the
appeal provisions as presently existing in the
taxing statutes and the lack of an independent
tribunal to which the taxpayer may appeal la
the first instance when dissatisfied with his
assessment. The effective bar to a successful
appeal to the Exchequer Court of Canada under
the present law in cases where the taxpayer is
dissatisfied with the exercise of discretionary
powers bas already been pointed out.
The Deputy Minister af National Revenue
for Taxation, who in the initial hearings of the
committee gave evidence touching on varions
aspects of the administration of the taxing
statutes, appeared again at the request of the
committee after the other witnesses had been
heard, and presented his views as to the advisability of establishing a Board of Tax Apreals.
In this connection, he expressed himself as
being in favour of establishing a board whici
would operate as a court of first instance to
hear appeals from assessments on questions of
law only. In so far as appeals from. assessments
which originated fron the exercise of ministerial or administrative discretion were concerned, however, he indicated that he was not
in favour of superimposing an appeal board ta
consider or review the exercise of discretion as
to its substance. He indicated, however, that
it might be possible to establish a committee
which would act in an advisory capacity to
the ininister and to which the taxnayer or the
minister might refer questions arising from the
exercise of discretion for consideration and
advice. This committee, he thought, would
fonction in a somewhat similar manner to the
Board of Referees as described in Section 13
of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, but should
not be independent of the Minister of National
Revenue.

It was suggested by the deputy minister that
should a matter of discretion arise with which
the taxpayer was dissatisfied, he might apply
to the minister to have the application of the
discretionary power reviewed by this advisory

body and that the taxpayer should be permuitted
to makie al] necessary renresentations thereto.
Mr. Elliott indicated, however, that the findings
of the board or committee should, in essence he
advisory only and that should the Minister of
National Revenue desire to adhere to a conclusion differing with the findings of the board.
no further review or appeal should he provided

but that, as is the case under the presently
enacted legislation, the decision of the minister

in respect thereto should be final and conclusive.

Your committee bas given consideration to
these submissions of the deputy minister and
bas concladed that they represent a direct conflict of opinion with the suggestions aIvanced

by other witnesses in briefs and exaninations,
with which suggestions vour comnmittce agrees
in principle as will be hereafter shown.

referred to the board, the following documents
should be forwarded by the minister to the
registrar of the board:
A. The income tax return of the appellant,
if any, for the period under review.
B. The Notice of Intention to Assess.
C. The Notice of Assessment.
D. The Notice of Appeal.
E. All other documents and papers relative
to the assessment under appeal.
It is recommended that the appellant be
required to furnish security for costs to the
satisfaction of the board in a sum of not more
than $10 when the amount in dispute is less
than $200 and not more than $25 when the
amount in issue is in excess of $200. The
matter should then be deemed to be an issue
before the said board ready for hearing provided however that if it be deemed advisable
by the board or a member thereof that pleadings be filed an order may issue directing the
parties to file pleadings.
Within 15 days from the receipt by the board
of sall the aforementioned documents and papers
relative ta the assessment, the board should
notify the Minister of National Revenue and
the appellant of a date for hearing. After the
appeal has been set down for hearing, as above
provided, any fact or statutory provision not
set out in the said Notice of Objection or
Notice of Appeal may be pleaded or referred
to in such manner and upon such terms as the
board or any member thereof may direct.
Either party to the appeal might appear in
person or by his agent. All hearings of the
board should be held in camera, unless the
parties otherwise agree.
Rules of procedure relating to the conduct
of the hearings should be those as may be
issued from time to time by the Board of Tax
Appeals.
Following the hearing and consideration of
the appeal by the board, it is recommended that
the decision and the reasons in support of it
should be given in writing and made publie,
and that copies be forwarded to the Minister
of National Revenue and to the appellant.
Such decision would be conclusive in its datermination of the issue before the board and
binding on both parties.
It is recomnmended that provision should be
made for an appeal from the decision of the
Board of Tax Appeals to the Exchequer Court
of Canada similar to the presently existing
right of appeal te that court from the decision
of the minister. Accordingly, if either the
Minister of National Revenue or the taxpayer
is dissatisfied with the decision of the Board
of Tax Appeals, an appeal would lie from its
decision to the Exchequer Court. The party
launching such an appeal should be required,
within thirty days of the date of mailing of the
board's decision, to file a Notice of Appeal with
the Registrar of the board who would thereupon transmit the record of the proceedings to
the Exchequer Court. For a specifie suggestion as to the form which the legislation may
take in setting up the Board of Tax Appeals
see Appendix B.
It is felt by your committe that if a Board
of Tax Appeals is established as indicated
above, three principal objections raised by the
majority of witnesses, as already described, will
be suitably met.
1. The taxpayer will be provided with a
speedy and inexpensive tribunal to which he
nay take all disputes arising from assessments

329

including questions of fact, of law and of the
exercise of ministerial or administrative discretion, and he will be assured of an impartial
and considered adjudication in the course of
which the Board may substitute its opinion on
all matters for that of the Minister of National
Revenue, or of any administrative tribunal
whose decision bas entered into the making of
the assessment.
2. By the fact that the decision of the
board will have considered and, if necessary,
varied or confirmed the exercise of discretionary power, the flexibility of the statute
will remain unimpaired since the necessity to
remove entirely the discretionary authority
now contained therein will be somewhat modified while the administering officials acting for
the Minister of National Revenue will be
afforded guides of increasing usefulness as a
body of jurisprudence is established relating
to the proper exercise of such discretion in
a variety of instances.
3. The accumulation of a body of precedent
through publication of the decisions and their
supporting reasons of the Board of Tax
Appeals, which decisions will in many cases
inevitably be the result of contestations arising
out of the application of departmental directives and rulings, will tend to diminish the
force of and the need for such rulings within
the department. In addition thereto, this body
of precedent will assist in the clarification of
many sections of the taxing statutes now
obscure for want of official interpretation
and will in turn diminish to some extent the
need to redraft portions of the statutes since
those sections, which are now charged with
ambiguity by the public and administering
officials, will perforce obtain certainty, if not
clarity, from the application to them of the
decisions of the Board.
The whole respectfully submitted.
W. D. EULER,
Chairman.

EVISED EDITION

336

SENATE

Hon. Mr. EULER: It has a very large
membership, I understand. The first witness
and also the last, but by no means the least,
was Mr. C. Fraser Elliott, Deputy Minister of
National Revenue for Taxation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I shall perhaps refer to
Mr. Elliott later on, but here I wish to say
that I think the committee was greatly impressed-certainly I was-with his intimate
knowledge of the affairs of the department.
His evidence was given freely and was intensely informative and interesting to all
members' of the committee.
Almost all the briefs presented to us were
reasonably concise and .clear, and more or
less to the point. I say "more or less to the
point" because some of them made representations with regard to policy and the
incidence of taxation, with which our committee was not empowered to deal. Many
others were excellent and irreproachable in this
respect. We usually were aware of what was
in the briefs, as they were submitted to us
prior to the date of presentation to the
committee, and the witnesses were told that
we could net deal with any recommendation
respecting policy. It was, however, impossible
to withdraw from the briefs any parts not
coming within the terms of our reference, so
we accepted them in their entirety. Generally
speaking, they were very helpful.
The
gentlemen who presented them submitted
themselves willingly to the questions of not
only Mr. Stikeman, but also of the members
of the committee. One might have expected
that a committee with so many able lawyers
on it would have subjected witnesses to some
embarrassing cross-examination, but I am
happy to say that was net done and that
everyone who appeared before us was treated
with every courtesy.
The representations contained in the briefs
and made by the witnesses are pretty well reflected in the report before us today. As is
known to all members of the committee and
to all others who have had time to read the
report, its outstanding feature is a recommendation for the establishment of a Board
of Tax Appeals, to which any taxpayer could
appeal against his assessment. It is recommended further that the procedure for bringing appeals should be made easy and inexpensive.
The present law provides an
appeal to the Exchequer Court, but, regardless of the amount of tax involved, the apellant is required to make a deposit or guarantee
of $400 as security for costs. The proposal
is that, if the Board of Tax Appeals is established, the appellant in a case involving less
Hon. Mr. EULER.

than $200 shall be required to put up net
more than $10 as security, and that where
more than $200 is at issue the deposit shall
not be greater than $25.
The most important recommendation as respects the proposed board is that its decisions
shall be final and binding upon the minister
and the department in all matters, including
the exercise of discretion. It is of course
recommended that there should be provision
for an appeal from the board's decision, by
either the minister or the taxpayer, to the Exchequer Court. The present act gives the
minister very wide discretionary powers, a
feature of the law which was criticized by
many of the organizations that appeared before us. The proposal
is that the board,
which would be appointed by the government, shall consist of seven members, or
more, if thought advisable; that three members of the board, the chairman, the vicechairman and one other shall be lawyers of
ten years' standing; that two shall be professional accountants of ten years' standing;
and two shall be drawn from the general body
of taxpayers, whether they be business men
or otherwise. It is also proposed that two of
the seven shall be bilingual; and that all
should be appointed for ten years at salaries
which will make it possible for the government to obtain men fully qualified for the
work they will have to undertake.
I have said that it is proposed to make it
more convenient for taxpayers to appeai
assessments with which they are dissatisfied.
In the receommendation provision is made that
panels of three members of the committee
may go to all parts of the country to hear
appeals. This will make it much more convenient for the taxpayer than is now the
case.
I said a moment ago that the decisions of
this appeal board should be final. This perhaps is not quite correct. We propose that
tihey should be final se far as the discretion
of the department is concerned, but of course
the taxpayer or the minister would still have
the right of appeal to the Exchequer Court,
and beyond that te the Supreme Court of
Canada.
At our final meeting yesterday, a member
of the committee suggested that a short-eut
be taken from the appeal board direct to the
Supreme Court of Canada, but this suggestion was too late to receive full consideration.
Perhaps honourable senators may wish to
discuss that proposal.
I should add here that while our committee
was unanimous that there should be no
authority exercised by the minister or his
deputy over the board itself, Mr. Elliott, the
deputy minister administering the act, was

MAY 29, 1946
not in agreement with us. He felt that while
there might well be an appeal board, its
decisions should still be subject to the
approval of the minister. However, the members of the committee remained unanimous in
their support of the recommendation as it
stands, and judging from the representations
made by the various organizations that
appeared before us, I believe all our suggestions and recommendations will meet the
approval of the great body of them and of
the people generally.
As I intimated yesterday, what is before
us now is Part One of the final report. There
will be two other parts. I do not intend to
go into the details of these, but perhaps some
other members of the committee may desire
to do so. Generally speaking, one is intended
to meet the criticism that the present act
is very obscure, uncertain and out of date,
and that it no longer reflects the practices of
modern business. The other will deal with
details of the administration-the making of
assessments, and the low salaries of the
departmental staff, which have caused many
of the officials to go to more remunerative
positions outside.
There is one other item which I think will
be of some interest to honourable senators. It
was felt that the rate of interest charged on
overdue taxes was higher than it reasonably
should be and that it could very well be
reduced to 4 per cent.
I do not propose, honourable senators, to
go any further into particulars of the report.
As I said before, it speaks for itself. Let me
add once more that this is a unanimous report.
It is the outcome of the most careful thought
and examination by an exceedingly able and
conscientious committee, and will, I hope,
receive from the government that, careful
consideration which the labours of the committee surely justify and deserve.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not intend to delay the louse at
any great length. I heartily concur in the
kind references which the chairman of the
committe made to the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), who
for initiating this investigation deserves the
thanks of not only his fellow-members but
also the government of the day and all
income tax payers.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The members of the committee were very happy in the choice of their
chairman.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
63268-23à

Hon. Mr. HAIG: It was a happy choice
from several standpoints. His good judgment
would, of course, be shown on any occasion,
but the committee also had the benefit of his
long experience in the administration of the
Income Tax Act and as a member of the government. He has told the louse, and I agree
with him, that there was no partisan spirit
shown at any stage of the committee's proceedings. It was agreed at the outset that the
committee would deal not with questions of
policy but only with those of procedure-that
is, how the act should be redrafted and what
should be done with respect to ministerial discretion and appeals from that discretion. We
stuck te that agreement, and when certain delegations presented briefs that dealt with questions of policy, we pointed out that these were
outside our terms of reference, and then allowed them to proceed with the presentation.
This report is really the first light on the
question of income tax that I have seen in the
last fifteen years. I want to pay my meed of
praise to the Deputy Minister of National
Revenue. Mr. Elliott is a very- able man, and
he has done great service in his department.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But the volume of income
tax business has become so great that one man
cannot keep up with it. It puts too great a
responsibility on Mr. Elliott to require him to
exercise the more than one hundred discretions
which the act grants to the minister. Our
recommendation takes nothing from the minister or his deputy. We are simply saying to
a taxpayer who is aggrieved by the Income
Tax Department's assessment: "Your appeal
will be heard by an independent board of three
or more persons, who will meet you in your
city and give you full opportunity of stating
your case." I can picture taxpayers appearing
before this proposed appeal board in Vancouver, Edmonton, Saskatoon, Calgary, Winnipeg, Toronto, Quebec, Halifax, Fredericton,
Saint John, Charlottetown or any other centre
in the dominion, and the board taking up each
case in turn and talking it over with the aggrieved man or woman. The very fact that
there is friendly discussion will help make the
taxpayer satisfied with whatever disposition
the board may make of his appeal. It is pretty
"lame-duck" procedure to write down to
Ottawa aid receive an official refusal, no matter how kindly its wording may be. A letter
cannot give much warmth to the word "no";
but "no" can be said by a tribunal in a way
that does not hurt the feelings of the aggrieved
person. During world war No. 1, and again
during world war No. 2, it was my experience
that when any man objbeting to his call-up
appeared before the military tribunal, and

338

SENATE

they talked it over with him before rejecting
his appeal, be felt much better satisfied than
if fe had merely received a letter to the same
effect.
The cost of appeals under the present income
tax law is so high and the procedure so complicated that taxpayers who are dissati§fied
with the decision of the Income Tax department give up and resent the act itself. We
have got to pay our income tax, and the rate
of taxation is a matter of government policy.
But every taxpayer wants to know that he
is paying what he ought to pay, not what he
feels he ought not to pay. It is easy enough
for us to get the idea that government officials
are not giving us proper consideration. I
believe the proposed board will remove that
sense of grievance. It may be urged that
setting up a board of seven members will cost
a lot of money. But it must be borne in mind
that we are dealing with a departrnent that
collects about a billion dollars every year,
and that an annual expenditure of $70,000,
$80,000 or even $100,000 is a comparatively
small item compared to the satisfaction which
our taxpayers will derive from having their
appeals considered by an independent tribunal.
I am heartily in agreement with the opinion
of the other members of the committee that
the witnesses presented their briefs and
answered all our questions in a most satisfactory manner. They all came there feeling
that we would listen to them sympathetically,
and they were not disappointed. But when
they got through they found that, while they
knew their subject thoroughly, the committee
knew at least something about it, too. I
believe without exception they went away
well satisfied that they had been given full
opportunity to put their cases before the
committee in fairness to themselves and the
country, and convinced that whatever conclusions the committee might reach would be
in the national interest.
I repeat that I am heartily in accord with
the report. With all due deference, I say that
the government of the day, or any future
government, would be wise to study this report very seriously. It may be said that by
providing this measure of appeal we remove
some authority from the minister and put it
into the hands of another body. But that is
in keeping with our whole judicial system. We
are adopting a court of record.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) is not a lawyer-which may
be to his advantage-but those of us who are
members of the legal profession know that
the adoption of this recommendation would
provide a record of appe.als and judgments
rendered from which a code of law might be
Hon. Mr. HAIG.

built up for the benefit of the ordinary practitioners across the country. They would at
least be able to tell the people what the law
Is.
The honourable member from Waterloo in
his remarks perhaps inadvertently overlooked
mentioning a young man who came to us, at
his own expense, from the Income Tax Department of the United States government.
He was very helpful, and we owe a debt of
gratitude to his government for allowing him
to come and give us the benefit of his experience. I was surprised to hear him say that
upon the establishment in his country of a
tax appeal court and a code of law, the
number of appeals suddenly dropped off.
I wish to congratulate the honourable member from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) for
having introduced this subje'ct, and the honourable member from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) upon the manner in which lie presided
over the committee, and the fine service he
rendered to the Sonate and to the people of
Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I would move the
adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Before the debate is
adjourned may I ask the chairman a question?
I have looked over the list of those who made
representations before the committee and
should like to know if any individual or group
presented a brief or made a submission contrary to the recommendation that there should
be the right of appeal from the minister's
discretion.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Honourable senators.
my memory is not perfect, but I cannot recall
that the representative of any business or
group of individuals who appeared before us
was opposed to the recommendations now
contained in our report.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I did not wish
include the deputy minister.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The deputy minister was
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I said that the deputy
minister was opposed to the recommendation,
in that be favoured an appeal board which
would be in the nature of an advisory body
and whose decisions would be subject to the
approval or disapproval of the minister. I
may not have made that point clear in my
earlier remarks.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Apart from the position
taken by the deputy minister there was no
opposition?
Hon. Mr. EULER: No.

the adoption of a part of the final report of
a very important committee of this bouse,
and one which bas received considerable public ity. I agree with ail that bas been said
concerning the committee. In my opinion tbe

more capable of doing the job than anyone
else in this house.

YUKON PLACER MINING BILL
REFERRED BACK TO COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendments made by the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 62,
an Act to amend tbe Yukon Placer Mining
Act.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators I move concurrence in the amendments.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
I understood tbat it was tbe wisb of the committee to strike out the word "sucb" in botb
places wbere it appeared at line 24 of the
bill. From the report it appears tbat the
word "sncb" is to be deleted in only one
place.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It was decided hy
the committee that the word "sucb" should
be struck out ini both places.

330

Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
tbere is one otber feature of tbis bill to wbicb
I should like honourable senators to give some
consideration before the report is adopted.
There seems today to be a growing tendency
to give police authorities, particularly the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police, drastic and
arbitrary powers over persons and property.
I arn quite sure tbat our people do not like
these measures, and I say without besitation
that 1 dislike tbem very much. They remind
one entirely too much of the practices in force
in some of the totalitarian countries. Recently
we saw in another place what proved to be an
abortive attempt to place some sort of legislative restriction upon the power of the state
to take 'from the individual rights wbicb he
bas always enjoyed under our demnocratie
systern and whuu.h are actually part and parcel
of our demnocratic beritage. If the present
trend continues I arn convinoed tbat sooner or
later thîs parliament will be obliged to, take
steps to place legislative fetters on tbe powers
of police in this regard.
Wben I was in attendance before the Banking and Commerce Committee yesterday I
voiced, perbaps quite inadequately, my objection to the provisions of subsection 4 of section
2 of this bill. I voiced the criticism at tbat
time tbat no police officer-not even an officer
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Policeshould be given the right of search of any
person, merely on the ground of suspicion,
without a warrant issued by some judicial
authority. Honourable senators will notice that
subsection 4 gives that authority to any peace
officer. It says:
Wbere any peace officer bas reason to suspect
that any person bas committed or is about to
commit an offence described in section eigbtytbree or lias in bis possession or in bis belongings any gold in respect of which the royalty
imposed by section eigbty-tbree lias not been
paid, sucb peace officer cnay witbout warrant
searcli sucli person and his belongings and any
articles believed to be bis belongings and may
seize any gold found upon sucb person or in sucb
belongings.
And subsection 6 provides that for the purpose
of this section the meaning of the expression
"ýpeace officer" is as defined in section two of
the Criminal Code. Included in that definition
is a constable, a sheriff's officer or a process
server.
The bonourable gentlemen of the Banking
and Commerce Committee did not see fit to
entertain my objection, and conscquently I
do not intend to press it unduly todýay. However, one other feature of the bill bas occurred
to me since I was before the committee, and 1

SENATE

consider it of such major importance as to
justify my taking a few minutes' time to
discuss it today.
I acknowledge that before appearing in the
Banking and Commerce Committee I had not
seen the bill and was not too well prepared
to discuss it. However, I feel very strongly
about matters of this kind which extend these
arbitrary powers to the police, and when I
came from the committee it occurred to me
that there must be some similar provision
regarding the right of search in the Customs
Act. Consequently, I undertook to see what
that piece of legislation had to say on this
particular subject.
The Customs Act is Chapter 42 of the
Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927. Sections 153
and 154 of that Act deal with the searching
of persons, and with leave of the Senate I
should like to read them. Section 153 is as
iollows:
Any officer, or person by hii authorized thereunto, may search any person on board any vessel
or boat within any port in Canada, or on or in
any vessel, boat or vehicle entering Canada by
land or inland navigation, or any person who
bas landed or got out of such vessel, boat or
vehicle, or who bas come into Canada from a
foreign country in any manner or way, if the
officer or person so searching bas reasonable
cause to suppose that the person searched bas
goods subject to entry at the Custons, or prohibited goods, secreted about his person.
Section 154 reads as follows:
Before any person can be searched, such person
may require the officer to take him before some
police magistrate or justice of the peace, or
before the collector or chief officer at the port
or place, who shall, if be secs no reasonable
cause for search, discharge such person, but, if
otherwise, be shall direct such person to be
searched:
I should like to draw particular attention
'o the following words contained in this
section:
Provided that if such person is a fenale she
sball be searched by a feinale, and any such
magistrate, justice of the peace or collector
may, if there is no fernale appointed for such
purpose, enploy and authorize a suitable feumale
person to act in any particular case or cases.
2. Every officer required to take any person
before a police magistrate, justice of the peace,
or chief officer as aforesaid, shall do so with all
reasonable despatch.
Honourable senators will notice the wide
difference between the provisions of sections
153 and 154 of the Customs Act and those
which appear in subsection 4 of section 2 of
the bill now being reported upon. May I
remind you that the term "peace officer"
includes even a process server, any sheriff's
officer or constable. These men may search
any person, including a woman.
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I interrupt
the honourable gentleman for a moment? It
is unfortunate that he was not at the committee the day this was discussed.
He was at the
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
committee.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I was there yesterday.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: When this was
dealt with the first day it was stated that in
some remote parts of the country there
would be no magistrate or justice of the
peace available within probably four hundred
miles of places where planes fly out, and
that police officers could not always comply
with a requirement to get authorization
before searching suspected persons.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I regret that I was
not present at the meeting at which that
point was discussed, but it seems to me that
the answer is simple. If this bill contained
provisions such as are in the Customs Act,
any person wbom a police officer proposed to
search could decide whether or not be would
submit to examination on the spot or demand
to be taken before a magistrate or justice of
the peace. If the nearest magistrate or justice of the peace was two, three or four
iundred miles away, it would bo for the suspected person to determine whether he wanted
to be transported that distance.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: At whose expense?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I do not intend to deal
with that, for it is irrelevant to the point I
wish to make. In answer to a question put
to him in the committee yesterday the Honourable the Minister of Mines and Resources
stated, as I understood him, that the appointment of stipendiary magistrates and justices
of the peace in the Yukon and Northwest
Territories is a matter wholly within his
jurisdiction. My suggestion is that it would
not be at all out of the way to appoint a
sufficient number of such officers to ensure
that at least one would always be available
in circumstances of the kind contemplated by
this bill.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wherever a plane
miglt land?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I suggest to the bonourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) that planes ordinarily land, not
on barren wastes, but at or near centres of
population,
from which
goods may be
exported.
The complaint that I rose to make-and I
shall be surprised if the honourable senator
froum Parkdale does not support me-is that
this bill purports to vest in any police officer,

MAY 29, 1946
sheriff's officer, or process server the right to
search any woman merely upon his own suspicion that she may be in possession of gold.
Since parliament saw fit to insist that any
woman suspected of a breach of the Customs
Act may be searched only by a woman, I
suggest that there should be at least a similar
provision in the Yukon Placer Mining Act.
That is all I am asking, and I shall be
shocked if the honourable senator from Parkdale does not support me on this.
I am quite satisfied in my own mind that
this point never occurred to the Honourable
the Minister of Mines and Resources. I am
quite sure that it never occurred to honourable members of our Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, including the
honourable senator from Parkdale. I therefore think the bill should be referred back to
the committee for consideration of that feature,
and I have no apologies for drawing it to
the attention of honourable senators.
I would move, seconded by the honourable
(Hon. Mrs.
senator from Peterborough
Fallis), that the amendments made by the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to Bill 62, an Act to amend the
Yukon Placer Mining Act, be not now concurred in, but that the bill be referred back
to the said committee for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I was the Acting Chairman of the Banking and Commerce Committee yesterday when
this matter was considered, and I think the
house should know that both the minister
and the honourable member for the Yukon in
another place appeared before the committee
and specifically stated that it now is, and
for some years has been, the practice to employ a woman to conduct searches of suspected
women. I have no objection whatever to the
bill going back to the committee in order
that, if it is thought desirable, the practice
may be authorized by a specific provision. I
simply want to inform honourable members
of what the practice is now and has been
for many years.
The motion, in amendment, of Hon. Mr.
Bench was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

PRIVATE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. CRERAR moved the second readag of Bill 17, an Act respecting the Canadian
tndemnity Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the Canadian
Indemnity Company was incorporated in 1916,
and has its head office in the city of Winnipeg.
The purpose of the amendment contained in
section 1 of the present bill is to authorize
the company to divide its present shares of
$100 par value into shares of $10 each. Honourable senators are no doubt aware that other
companies seek and are granted similar powers.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Why is that necessary?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It is for the purpose
of giving the shares a wider distribution.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The same as under the
Bank Act.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I think the banks
were obliged to do it by an amendment to
the Bank Act.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
the explanatory notes to the bill contain these
words:
-shall be divided into shares of $100 each or,
if the special act so provides, into shares of $5
each or any multiple thereof but not exceeding
$100 each.

I have not the statute before me, but it would
seem from the explanation that the company
already has the power which is now sought.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I do not think the
powers provided for by the act referred to in
the explanatory notes have been operative.
While my information is far from complete, I
understand that the company seeks an amendment to limit the value of the shares to $10
for all time.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I understand it now.
At the present time the company bas power
to fix the value of the shares at $10, but now
it wants to restriet it to that amount.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I believe that is the
explanation, but I offer it with some reservation.
Section 2 of the bill provides for the extension of the sphere in which the company may
do business. It is now limited to fire, hail
and guarantee insurance.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Has the bill been
approved by the Superintendent of Insurance?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:
standing.

That is my under-

Hon. Mr. LEGER: The company is asking
for an increase in its capital to $1,000,000.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I understand it has
power to do so now.
I move the second reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Crerar, the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS
TAXATION
FINAL REPORT OF COMMITTEE-PART ONE
-CONCURRED
IN

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Euler for concurrence in the First Part of the
final report of the Special Committee of the
Senate appointed to examine into the provisions
and workings of the Income War Tax Act and
The Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, and to
formulate recommendations for the improvement, clarification and simplification of the
methods of assessment, collection of taxes
thereunder and the provisions of the said Acts
by redrafting them, if necessary, and to report
thereon.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, I desire to take this opportunity of
thanking the chairman of the committee, the
honourable gentleman from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler), and the honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig), for the kind remarks

MAY 30, 1946
they made about me yesterday in this debate.
I may say that if I deserve any words of
praise, it is not for having introduced the
motion ta set up the special committee, but
for having selected such capable members ta
serve on it. I am sure that if it had been
possible ta have a larger committee, many
other honourable members could have made
a great contribution ta the work.
In introducing the motion for the appointment of the committee, I felt there was need
for study of the Income War Tax Act and
the Excess Profits Tax Act. The Income War
Tax Act is an old piece of legislation, having
been first enacted in 1917. Its structure was
copied largely from the British act, which had
been in force for many years and was under
study in Britain at that very time. I believe
the British statute was consolidated in 1918,
and has since been studied by a Royal Commission and revised. Our own act had never
been the subject of any particular examination by a committee or any other body under
parliamentary authorization. I therefore felt
that a committee of the Senate could serve
the country by conducting an inquiry into
the provisions of the act and giving representative bodies and individuals across the country
a chance ta express their opinions about the
statute, its workability, and the means by
which it might be improved. It would not
be proper for me ta omit mention of the
great contribution that was made by those
representative bodies and individuals who
appeared before the committee. I am sure
that without their assistance the committee
could not have done the work it did, nor
could it, without the legal advice and other
help received from persons in its employ,
have brought in the present report.
It seems ta me that one thing we have
learned fron the work undertaken by the
committee is that representative bodies should
be heard before amendments are made
to taxing statutes. In the Department of
National Revenue and the Department of
Finance there are officers who have had long
experience in dealing with taxation matters;
but, with all respect ta these men, I would
point out that they do not have the benefit
of the practical day-to-day contact with business which is enjoyed by people engaged in
professional and business activities. It seems ta
me that those who administer this legislation, as well as those charged with the responsibility of amending it, could be greatly
assisted by listening ta representations made
from the outside.
At first our Income War Tax Act worked
well and the people were satisfied with it.
This was simply because it was a new piece
63268-24

of legislation, administered by a man of long
experience in the field-I refer ta the Deputy
Minister of National Revenue for Taxationthe assessments were made on a fair basis,
and the rates were so low that they did not
impose a heavy burden on business or seriously affect the economy of the country. But
once it became necessary ta raise large sums
of money by way of taxation, as it did during
the war, some of the weaknesses in the act
began to show up. One of those weaknesses
was the ambiguity of certain sections which
could not be interpreted without the assistance
of the Department of National Revenue. As
a result of our experience of the last three or
four years we have learned that it is necessary
ta have a more scientific approach ta the
problem of taxation in this country. I am
sure everyone will agree that taxation is essential, and that the income tax method of raising
money is a proper one-probably the cheapest
and best in the long run; but that this
method should not be resorted ta in such a
way as ta interfere with production or the
general economic development of the country.
The committee was not authorized ta make
any study of tax rates, and I submit it would
have been highly improper for it ta suggest
what rates should be applied. It confined
itself more or less to procedural and administrative matters, methods of making assessments, and so on, and ta a consideration of the
complaints and criticisms expressed before it.
During the hearings, one of the great sources
of dissatisfaction which became apparent was
the delay in getting some final determination
of the questions that from time ta time arise
under the act. That is ta say, there is a great
delay before the final assessment is made. This
delay is mainly attributable ta the greatly increased volume of tax business brought about
by amendments ta our legislation, and ta the
insufficiency of the staff which has ta cope with
the changed conditions. Despite these disadvantages, the Income Tax Division, according to the evidence adduced before us, has on
the whole done a very good job in keeping
abreast of the additional work.
Income tax procedure is fairly familiar ta
the public, and I am sure all honourable members are thoroughly conversant with it, but it
may be of interest ta trace briefly what takes
place after the income tax payer files his return at the local office. There it is examined,
and if any question arises which the local inspector does not feel competent ta deal with,
he refers it ta the department at Ottawa for
final decision. Some of the returns are simple,
others are complicated. The number of returns made is very large, and the problems
which arise with regard ta many of them

which they indicated their willingness to

this difficuit question.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I have very littie to add to what has
already been said, and said so wèll, by the
members of the special committee who have
spoken to the house on the subject of this
first report. I should like to add my small
meed of praise to what bas been said about
the work of our most excellent chairman, the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler), and to say a word in commendation
of the honourable senator who inspired the
discussion of this subject and was responsible
for the setting up of the committee. 1 should
also like to pay tribute to the numerous
witnesses who appeared before us and gave
most interesting and valuable testimony.
As my honourable friend has just said the
principal recommendation of this first interim
report is that there be set up an independent
board of tax appeals, designed to provide a
cheap and expeditious method by which assessments can be reviewed, and also by wbîch the
very large number of discretions which the
minister is empowered to exercise under the
act can be reviewed and, if necessary, overruled.
It should be emphasized, honourable senators, that neither in the~ proceedings of the
committee nor in the report wbich has been
placed before you is there intended to be any
refiection on or criticism of the Income Tax
Division. I think I speak for ail members
of the committee when I say that after hearing the evidence we reached the conclusion
that the department is admirably administered.
Honourable senators will realize what an
enormous job has been thrust upon the shoulders of the Income Tax Division. In time of
war it bas been not only an enormous job,
but a constantly expanding one, and the function performed was particularly essential in
providing the funds necessary to enable, the
country to carry on hostilities. That had to
ho done not on.ly under conditions of strain
peculiar to war, but with a depleted staff
and in the face of other very difficult circumstances. The committee reacbed the conclusion that tbe volume of work and responsibility bas become almost too great for the
present administrative machinery.
The Income Tax Division, a sub-division of
the Departmeuit of National Revenue, headed
by one deputy minister, is cbarged with the
duty of collecting approximately a billion andi
a haîf dollars a year. Its functions are these:
It bas to determine the amount due by every

individual taxpayer, of whom at the present
time there are more than one million; it must
exercise as best it may the more than one
hundred discretionary powers conferred upon
the minister by the me orne Tax Act; it is
required to deal with and attempt to settle
the innumerable disputes and differences of
opinion wbich arise between the department
and the taxpayers; and generally, it bas to
collect the tax. Under these circumstances,
ho-nourable senators, the wonder is not that
the complaints bave been so many, but that
tbey have been su few.
The principal recommendation of the first
part of our report is tbat the government
should set up an independent board of tax
appeals witb power to review assessments
wbieh are complained of, and also, if it sees
fit, to review and vary tbe discretion exercised
by the minister under the Income War Tax
Act. Honourable senators sb-ould not imagine
that in proposing such a body as this the
committee is sugge,4ting any startling departure from precedent. On the contrary, the
establishmnent of a board of tax appeals follows tbe precedents set by otber countries.
May 1 give a few examples? In Australia
there bas been for many years a body known
as the Board of Review, which is completely
independent of the Minister of Finance and
bas powers similar to those suggested for
the new body in Canada. In South Africa
there is an independent tribunal known as tbe
Special Court, wbicb bas power to review
and, if necessary, override the decisions of tbe
minister. In the United States there bas
been for twenty years or more a body, ornginally known as the United States Court of
Tax Appeals, and now known as tbe Tax
Court of the United States. That body also
bas tbe power to decide upon appeals from
assessments made and discretions exercised
by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue.
Tbe United Kingdom, whose experience
witb income tax administration goes mucb
fartber back than that of any of tbe other
countries I bave referred to, bas developed
a rather complex system, into which it is not
necessary tbat I should go at tbe'moment.
I would, however, ref or to one important
feature of tbat system, namely, that the assessing of taxes, the hearing of appeals from
assessments, and the collection of taxes, are
done hy tbree separate and distinct bodies
instead of by one branch of tbe government,
as in Canada. In tbe United Kingdom the
discretionary powers are not nearly as numerous as in tbis country. That is largely hecause
tbe Englîsb acts and tbe large numbor of
rules and regulations made under tbem go
into a great deal more detail than our own

346

SENATE

act does, and specify what the tax is to be
in various instances which we have made
subject to ministerial discretion.
Another
important feature is that where discretionary
powers are given in England they are exercisable by one or other of two bodies, known
as the General Commissioners and the Special
Commissioners, both of which are entirely
independent of the Board of Inland Revenue,
which collects the tax.
As the honourable chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Euler) stated yesterday
afternoon, Mr. Elliott, the Deputy Minister
of National Revenue for Taxation, expressed
himself at the last meeting of the committee,
as not being opposed to a board of tax appeals.
He thought, however, that it should be, not
an independent body with power to override
rulings of the minister, but an advisory board
which could hear appeals from taxpayers and
adivse the minister, on whom should rest the
responsibility for the final decision. That is
in accordance with the procedure followed in
New Zealand since 1939. In that country
appeals by taxpayers are made not to an
independent board, but to a special committee consisting of the Commissioner of Taxes,
the Solicitor General and the Secretary of the
Treasury.
The committee makes recommendations to the Minister of Finance, but
the ultimate authority still resides in him.
I think it can be fairly said that we have
this much common ground. Everybody is
agreed that there should be an entity or body,
outside of departmental officials, to whom a
taxpayer who feels aggrieved can take his case.
Whether that entity should be independent,
with power to override decisions of the department, as in the United States, Australia and
South Africa, and as suggested in the report
before us, or whether it should be simply- an
advisory body, with the ultimate authority
left to the minister, as in New Zealand, and
as suggested for Canada by the Deputy Minister of National Revenue for Taxation, is a
question of government policy. In view of
the numerous responsible representations made
to the committee, and the report based upon
them, I find it difficult to believe that the
government will not take some action along
one or other of those lines.
The root of the trouble, I think, is in the
fact that everything is done in the one department, including the exercise of numerous
diseretionary powers whieh often vitally affect
the amount a taxpayer is called upon to pay.
The act as it stands does give an appeal to
the minister, but that again is an appeal
within the department itself.
I repeat, I greatly admire the work of the
Income Tax Division, and I think we all are
Hion. Mr. HUGESSEN.

convinced that in the overwhelming majority
of cases it exercises its really great powers
wisely and justly. But, where the only appeal
on questions of fact lies within the department
itself, the public has got it into its head,
rightly or wrongly, that the official who makes
the original assessment and the official who
decides the appeal is one and the same, and
that it is expecting too much of human nature
that a man should reverse his own opinion. I
say "rightly or wrongly," and I say that advisedly, because I think the public is wrong
in its belief as to how the department actually
works. But where you are faced with a situation .of this kind, honourable senators, I submit
it is time to call into play a very old and wise
rule of government: that not only is it important that a law should be just; it is equally
important that the public should realize that
the law is just. That, to my mind, points to
the defect in the administration of the Income
Tax Division. Your committee believes it has
suggested a cure for this defect in the proposed establishment of an independent tribunal
to which the income tax payer who feels himself aggrieved can appeal. By appealing to
the tribunal he will have his day in court, and
whether he wins or ]oses, he will be satisfied.
For these reasons, honourable senators, I
favour the committee's report.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, may J, as a member of the committee. say a few words with regard to this
report? First J should like to associate myself
with the previous speakers wbo have commended the committee's very capable chairman (Hon. Mr. Euler), the mover of the
original resolution (Hon. Mr. Campbell), who
bad the vision to see tbat in the interest of our
general economy it was necessary to have an
inquiry into the country's tax structure, the
members wbo attended the committee's meetings in an earnest and painstaking endeavour
to carry on the work assigned to it, and the
various individuals and representatives of
organizations who appeared and gave the
committee the benefit of their experience and
views.
I wish to refer to a matter that has not been
directly mentioned today. Our taxing statutes,
the Income War Tax Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act, provide for the exercise of ministerial discretion in considerably more than
one hundred instances, and the persons who
appeared before us were critical, not of the
honesty or sincerity of the officials who make
assessments, but of the results flowing from
the discretionary powers. Such a vast number
of tax returns come into the department that
it is impossible to deal with them on the personal basis upon which alone any statute

MAY 30, 1946
conferring such wide discretionary powers could
properly function. Our taxing acts are very
flexible, in this respect differing greatly from
those of the United States and the United
Kingdom, and the question facing us was how
to control the exercise of the discretionary
powers in the best interest of the public.
Should we or should we not create a set of
rigid tax provisions from which every person
could spell out his own liability? I think the
general feeling was that there is great virtue
in a flexible taxing statute, because it leaves
an area within which the taxpayer and the
minister can evolve some compromise which
will do justice to the department responsible
for collecting revenue and at the same time
will enable the taxpayer to contribute his share
of taxes without having to discontinue operations. So far as I am concerned, I would at all
times strongly support a flexible taxing statute
which would provide for a field of compromise,
rather than a rigid statute which might work
great hardship in very deserving cases.
I think it was the feeling of the committee,
as it certainly was of the wi.tnesses who came
before it, that, in order tW preserve the desired
flexibility while ensuring the utmost possible
equity in the administration of the law, there
should be some means for reviewing the exercise of the numerous discretionary powers.
The committee accepted the recommendations
of a majority of the witnesses that the reviewing should be done by an independent board,
altogether outside the Department of National
Revenue, which collects the tax. To such a
board the taxpayer could appeal whenever he
felt that the discretion had been improperly
applied as against him.
To my mind, the argument in favour of the
establishment of an independent board of tax
appeals is unanswerable. Since the minister
is the source of so many different powers-the power to demand a return, the power to
demand payment of a tax, based upon his interpretation of the statute, the power to exercise discretion in so many instances that are
not subject te review in a court of law--surely
it is only just that there should be sone independent body to whom the taxpayer may
appeal when he considers himself unfairly
taxed.
The committee will be making two further
reports, about which I shall say nothing at
this time, although some indication has been
given t the house as to the matters with
which they will deal.
In closing, may I suggest that the stenographie report of the hearings before the
committee, including the briefs and the examination of witnesses who presented them,
constitutes a very important documentary

record; and later on I should like to see a proposal made-I may make it myself-for preserving the whole report in some way, possibly
by embodying it in the records of this house.
It contains a valuable assemblage of facts and
informed opinion, derived from the business,
industrial and professional life of Canada,
and I think it should at all times be kept
readily available to all who have anything to
do with deciding what taxes shall be levied
on our people in future.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. A. D. McRAE: Honourable senators,
I also, as a member of the committee, wish
to say that I fully agree with the references
that have been made to our very able chairman (Hon. Mr. Euler), and the honourable
gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), who introduced the motion to set up
the committee. I want to go a step further,
and call the attention of the house and the
country to the great services rendered by
the committee members who belong to the
legal profession, without whose knowledge
and advice it would have been impossible for
us to make this thorough and complete report. I might remark here that the conmittee was unaimous in recommending that
a Board of Tax Appeals be established.
As a member of the committee, I attended
most of the meetings, and I feel that the
house may not appreciate the great amount of
time spent in collecting the evidence on which
this report is based. The committee was
organized some months ago, and at its
numerous meetings many long and informative briefs were presented. These briefs illustrated the working of the income tax legislation and urged the necessity of amending it
in relation to ministerial discretion and other
matters. The consideration of that evidence
and the preparation of this report proved to
be a very heavy task indeed. As I have
already said, without the assistance of the
legal members, I believe it would have been
impossible for the committee to have discharged its duties so satisfactorily.
Hon. J. J. KINLEY: Honourable members, when the honourable senator from
Waterloo (Hon. .Mr. Euler) moved adoption
of the report of the committee I thought his
action was rather unusual, for only a few
minutes previously I had for the first time
seen the subject-matter of the report as it
appears in the minutes of the proceedings of
the Senate.
This committee met from time t time
during last session and this. and heard many
witnesses and had lengthy discussions with
them. The result is this very full report, and

SENATE
I do not think it is fair to the members of
this house or in conformity with the rules to
move its adoption at this early stage.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is just the
procedure preliminary to debate on the report.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That may be so, but
it seems te me that if you are to listen
intelligently to the debate you must know
something of the subject-matter. We have
had no time to read the contents of the report,
so how can we listen intelligently to the
debate? I must say that one honourable
senator moved adjournment of the debate,
and that I think rectified the situation.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It was open to any
honourable senator to do so.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The discussion today
has been splendid. I think the members who
have spoken have given a very fair account,
and have done it in such a way as to convey
to every member some idea of what went on
in the committee. However, I was struck
with the unanimity of the whole thing. I suppose the chairman thought that because of
that unanimity he could move adoption of
the report, and it would go through without
very much discussion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: He hoped the government would accept the recommendations contained in the report.
Hon. Mr. EULER: May I interrupt my
honourable friend? Surely he knows the mere
moving of a motion to concur in a report is
no indication that it must go through without
members debating it fully, if they wish, as
the honourable gentleman is doing now.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I know that the report
of any committee should be before the members, presumably prior to its discussionHon. Mr. EULER: In this chamber.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Yes. The unanimity
even extended to the opposition. The leader
of the opposition rushed into the debate and
said how unanimous the whole thing was. He
led me to believe that there was not very
much in the report.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Have you any objection to the report itself?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Order. I must
point out that the procedure followed is correct. A motion for the adoption of the report
of a special or a standing committee requires
one day's notice. That notice was given at
the time of the presentation of the report.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I think, Mr. Speaker,
it is common knowledge that few members
are conversant with what the report contains.
I spoke to one senator today and he asked
me, "What is in it?"
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If he does not know,
that is his own fault.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: If His Honour the
Speaker says the procedure is regular, all
right; but I do not think it is. That is all
I wish to say on that.
Now, from the unanimity that exists, and
the fact that nobody is complaining at all, I
do not think the report is one that is framed
for the purpose of being helpful to the administration. It seems to me there was too much
unanimity in everything that went on.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: After all, there is not
very much in the report. The committee
recommend the formation of an appeal board.
Well, that was not unanimous. In that they
had a difference, because the deputy minister
objected to the control of income tax affairs
being put in the hands of the proposed board.
Hon. Mr. EULER: He was not a member
of the committee.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: He gave evidence before the committee.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I said members of the
committee were unanimous. The deputy
minister in charge of the Income Tax Division
of the Department of National Revenue was
not a member of the committee.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The deputy minister
objected to that feature of the report, which
was the big item in it. When you consider
that the collection of taxes and the placing
of the burden of taxation rests on two departments-the Finance Department and the
Department of National Rvenue-it seems te
me you should not take away from them
verv mucli of their power to collect the
moneys for which they are responsible.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
other countries.

They

in

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: They do not do so in
Britain. The honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) made a splendid
speech in whieh he said that in the United
States they have a tax appeal board. We in
this country can appeal from the ruling of
the minister to the Exchequer Court, and then
to the Supreme Court of Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Net on discretion.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I have not very much
faith in an appeal board at the top being

MAY 30, 1946
very accessible to the common people. I
would say they should have assistance further
down the line. If we had in the Income Tax
department something similar to what they
have in the Labour Department and in the
Workmen's Compensation Board, that is,
representatives to look after the interests of
those affected, the people would benefit and
things would be speeded up. We should have
regional inspectors of the income tax to look
after the interests of the taxpayers and give
them information and advice.
This proposed board, according to the estimate given in detail, would cost from $75,000
to $100,000 a year. I am told it will more
likely cost half a million dollars a year by
the time the board is organized and the members are given the necessary technical advisers, clerical assistance and everything else
they may require. Certainly it will be more
expensive than the estimate given.
The deputy minister, we are told, says the
board should act in an advisory capacity; on
the other hand, the report indicates that it
should be an independent board with judicial
powers. We have been told in this house and
in the country that we are under the control
of bureaucrats, and that the representatives
of the people have very little power. Well.
you cannot have it both ways: you must
either trust the elected representatives of the
people or put power in the hands of the intelligentsia, who will deal out justice as they
see fit. For my part, in a democracy I should
like to go as far as I can to give power to
the responsible representatives of the people,
because in this way the people can exercise
their power effectively whenever they want
to do so.
The chairman of the committee suggested
that the interest rate paid by the taxpayers
who are delinquent is too high, and that it
should be 4 per cent. If I know anything
about interest rates, this will be equivalent to
putting the Income Tax department in the
money-lending class. Many a taxpayer would
be glad to let his income tax stand if he
could get the money for 4 per cent. That is
one of the two or three recommendationsthat
come out of this committee.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I should like the
honourable member to read the report about
the rate of interest. I think he has misinterpreted the recommendation.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I only saw the report
for a few minutes today.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It has been in the
minutes of the Senate for forty-eight hours.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Is it not 4 per cent
for delinquents?

Hon. Mr. EULER: I do not remember my
exact words in regard to that, but the recommendation is in the report itself, if the honourable member will only take the trouble
to read it.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Well it was 4 per
cent. The point at issue is just the price of
the money, that is all, and the price is out
of line with what the people of this country
can borrow money for today. This being so,
it would be an incentive to people to delay
paying their income tax.
Now, certain principles of the income tax
are important. For instance, when the war
started we were told the income tax should be
such that nobody would get rich out of the
war. That was a legitimate thought and a
good way of starting. But there was a provision that individuals or companies, before
becoming liable to the excess profits tax,
could earn as much as they earned in pre-war
years. Many companies and corporations
earned a lot before the war, and they were still
permitted to earn a lot during the war before
getting into excess profits. I trust this is
outmoded now. On any review of the income
tax legislation this should be taken into consideration. I am told that people believe the
time has come when it should be put under
severe scrutiny by those responsible for our
income tax.
I am not going to delay the Senate very
long today.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Thank you for the
compliment, my dear friend.
I believe that seven members on an appeal
board would be too many. In my opinion what
would be required is a good lawyer, a good
accountant and a business administrator-three
in all. If we are to have a board of this kind
in Canada, it should be considered carefully
and not hastily established.
My honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) said that there were two features with respect to the law: first, it should
be a just law, and secondly, the people should
realize its justice. The world today, including
Canada, is in a state of considerable impatience, and more than anything else we need
stability of thought. We are told that the
war is over but that the seas are turbulent
because of the storms of war. To rock the
boat, or to give the impression of doing so, is
not good for the welfare of the country at this
time. We have pressure groups on every hand
telling us what should be done. However, by
comparison, especially in financial matters, we
know that Canada holds the admiration of the

SENATE
world. Countries which desire a successful
after-war economy are copying the things we
do. We know that our country is facing a
very great problem in the raising of money to
carry on its economy; it is beyond the
imagination of other days. When the people
of Canada compare their position with that of
other countries, they will be convinced that
our laws are just and that we have the freest
country in the world and the most abundant
life. Our laws, including those affecting income
tax, are not .perfect, because they are the
product of the mind of man; but they are the
result of long experience and intelligence and
are successfully administered.
If there is any one body expressing public
opinion in this country that should be stable
and give the people direction of thought and
confidence to work together, it is the Senate
of Canada. Honourable senators are experienced and. intelligent men who have come
through many days of political life. When we
bring down a report it should contain words
of wisdom. It is well to praise a little the
things that are good.
Honourable senators, I am not prepared to
speak further on this report, and as it deals
with a very important subject I should like
to adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I second the motion.
Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, I should like to appeal from the
request of the honourable senator from Nova
Scotia for the adjournment of the debate. I
do not know whether the question is debatable
or not, but I should like to be permitted to say
a few words.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion for concurrence in the final report of the Special
Committee appointed to examine into the
provisions and workings of the Income War
Tax Act and the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940.
The honourable senator from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) now moves the adjournment of the debate, seconded by the honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon.
Mr. McGeer). Those in favour of the motion
to adjourn the debate will please say "content."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those opposed
will say not content.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Not content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In my opinion
the "not contents" have it.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY.

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
I shall not detain the house long with what I
have to say. As a matter of fact, until the
honourable senator from Lunenburg spoke a
few minutes ago, i.t was my intention to say
nothing.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: May I correct the honourable gentleman?
My designation is
Queen's-Lunenburg.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, when I was interrupted I was about to
sayHon. Mr. KINLEY: The honourable gentleman was not interrupted; he was corrected.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The observations of
the honourable gentleman from Queen'sLunenburg, made by way of disparagement of
the report, appear to me to be the result of a
mistaken zeal for what ho describes as the
"present administration." I think it is only fair
to honourable senators to reveal at this time
a fact that is not particularly secret, namely,
that in all likelihood this special committee to
investigate income tax would have been
brought into existence a year earlier than it
was had it not been for consideration shown
by those interested in the subject for the Minister of Finance, who was about to bring in
his budget at the time, and who requested that
the investigation be left over until the subsequent session. The budget speech delivered
by the Minister of Finance in the other place
contained a definite statement which I would
commend to my honourable friend. The Minister said that he looked forward to a complete
revision of the Income Tax Act to enable it
to meet changed conditions in the country resulting from the problems of war.
It seems to me that the disparaging observations made by the senator who has just resumed his seat with respect to the work of the
committee and its report are entirely misplaced, due I think to a mistaken zeal on behalf of his fellow citizen from Nova Scotia,
the Minister of Finance.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: He can look after himself.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I would say to the
honourable senator that if he knew the relations which have existed between members
of this chamber and the Minister of Finance,
his fears would be entirely allayed. We have
received the greatest consideration and cooperation from his department in connection
with the establishment and operation of the
committee which was, as I have said, formed
a year later than it otherwise would have been
if we had not observed entirely the wishes of
the Minister of Finance.

MAY 30, 1946
Having disposed of the grounds for objection to the report, as a layman member of
the committee who contributed very little to
its deliberations, I should simply like to say
that I am quite willing to endorse all that
was said by the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae) about the value
of the contribution made by the legal profession as represented on the committee. It
bas occured to me many times, despite the
rather conciliatory tone of my friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen), that what
went on in that committee was pretty much
a case of fighting the devil with his own tools,
for in my opinion, to have one legal mind
pitted against another is the best way to
obtain results for the general good of the
community.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Being acquainted
with the very able and versatile faculties of
the deputy minister who represented the
Income Tax branch before the committee, I
was interested to see the way in which members of his own profession who faced him
across the table elicited from him a good deal
of very useful information.
In my opinion the real value of the hearings before this special committee is shown
in the proposal of a simplified process of
levying income tax in Canada, for it will tend
to bring the rank and file of the people closer
to the government as represented by the tax
collecting machine. That is very desirable
because of the inescapable fact that for a
long period all classes of people in this country are destined to bear heavy taxation, and
the more favourable the impression left upon
the public mind by the federal tax-collecting
agencies, the better it will be for Canada as
a whole.
I am satisfied that if my honourable friend
from Queen's-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley)
would take a little more time to study the
provisions of the report he would see in it
an unmistakable desire to make the people
of Canada part and parcel of our system of
government so far as solving our very difficult
financial and economic problems is concerned.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Wishart McL. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, as a private member of the
Senate and also one of the members of the
government, I do not think I should be expected
to voice my personal views as to the merits of
the report, lest they be interpreted as those of
the government. As the report has not yet
been concurred in by the Senate, and of
course has not been considered by the administration, I am not in a position to speak for

351

the government. This comment applies, of
course, to any criticism of the report in whole
or in part, as it.would, of necessity, apply to
criticism of any future report by a special
committee on some phase of government
policy.
On the other hand, honourable senators, I
should like to say a word of appreciation of
the spirit which prompted the inquiry, and of
the painstaking work done by members of
the committee in their endeavour to serve the
country. The mover of the original resolution (Hon. Mr. Campbell) did me the honour
of making me a member of the committee.
I am afraid that the multiplicity of my duties
made it impossible for me to attend the meetings of the committee as regularly as I should
have liked, or to give to its work the personal
attention that I otherwise should have given.
This perhaps raises a question as to the wisdom
of including me among the members of any
future committee. To the chairman of tbe
committee (Hon. Mr. Euler) may I say that
I compliment you, sir, and those associated
with you for giving of your time and effort in
conducting this inquiry and endeavouring to
make-and, I believe, making-a very great
contribution to the information now before
the government with respect to this very
important question. I repeat, that in the
circumstances I feel the wisest thing for me
to do is to refrain from expressing either commendation or criticism of the report, since
anything I might say would be only my personal view, and it might be misinterpreted.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
it may be that I have misunderstood the
honouiable gentleman, but it appears to me
there is an impression which should be corrected. This committee has not recommended
an increase in the rate of interest charged to
taxpayers. On the contrary, the committee
has found the rate too high, and has recommended that it be lowered to 4 per cent.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Can my honourable
friend borrow money at 4 per cent?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: No; but the government bas charged 5 per cent.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Eight per cent.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Eight per cent. The
committee felt that rate was too high, and
has recommended that in future the government should charge 4 per cent simple interest.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: There is no misunderstanding as to that, and nothing to correct.
It is a matter of opinion. My opinion is that
the 4 per cent rate will put the Income Tax
Division in the money-lending business.

;i5z

SENATE

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does the honourable
gentleman not think that 4 per cent is pretty
high, when the government delays assessments as long as four years, during which time
you cannot find out what your liability is?
Hon. G. G. MeGEER: Honourable senators,
I desire to join with those who have expressed
appreciation of the splendid work done by
this committee. The report in itself is an
example of the usefulness of the Senate in
protecting and advancing the interests of the
people.
I seconded the motion for adjournment of
the debate. because I felt that the report was
of much importance to the community at
large and that unless there was some special
reason for its adoption today it could well
stand over for further consideration. I regard it as of such importance as to deserve
consideration by the Senate in Committee of
the Whole. clause by clause.
The report probably contains a good deal
that could be clarified to everyone's advantage. Let me point out one section as an
illustration of that. At the bottom of page
366 of the Senate Hansard there is this
statement:
The taxpayer will be provided with a speedy
and inexpensive tribunal to which he may take
all disputes arising from assessments including
luestionîs of fact . . .
I think one of the factors of our tax problem
is the time involved in settling the amount of
taxes to be paid. The committee's recommendation that an appeal tribunal be established, and a time limit be fixed within which
appeals may be heard, is an excellent one.
But in dealing with the proposed procedure for
appeals the report says, as set out in paragraph 13 on page 369 of Hansard:
If the minister or the taxpayer is dissatisfied
with the findings of the board he shall within 30
lays from the receipt of the decison of the board
île a Notice of Intention to Appeal to the
Exchequer Court of Canada .
I presume that in such matters there would
ontinue to be appeals from the Exchequer
-ourt to the Supreme Court of Canada, and
)n to the Privy Council. We have gone a
,onsiderable distance in limiting criminal
ippeals to our own Supreme Court of Canada,
[ for one am inclined to the opinion that
ippeals from the Board of Tax Appeals should
'ne limited and restricted. and that in the
majority of instances the board itself should
be the final court. I appreciate and understand the virtue and value of appeals in
general matters of law, but questions as to
what amount of taxes shall be paid are, it
seems to me, in another category.
Speed, finality and uniformity in tax decisions are more important, I believe, than
63268-24j

in those processes by which ultimate justice
is determined in the refinement of the law.
Let me point out that an appeal carried on
through our courts might require several
years for final determination. If the appeal
had to do with a general question of fact, the
whole business community concerned with
that type of question would be subjected to
delayed assessments. In fact, it might well
happen that an entire procedure, based upon
a finding of the board, would be upset years
later by a decision of the Privy Council. I for
one should like to know why the members of
the committee, who no doubt gave this matter
consideration, were not prepared to recommend some speedier method for final determination of tax cases than the rather
cumbersome appeal procedure to which our
Canadian laws are subject. I would vote
against so wide-open a form of appeal as the
committee recommends, although in the main
I endorse and approve of the committee's
work and the purposes of the report.
I do not soe why there should be se much
hurry about the adoption of this first part of
the report.
It may be that the parts to
follow will hinge on this. I cannot believe
that the mere adoption of the report today is
going te affect any action of the government
or of honourable members in another place.
I think that what would probably affect them
more than anything else is such a discussion
Pere as would arouse an expression of public
approval of the Senate's course and of the
committee's recommendations. I do think the
report would carry far more weight if it were
not rushed through too hurriedly.
Hon. J. W. De B. FARRIS. Honourable
senators, I had not intended to speak in this
debate. I am afraid that I do not merit the
compliments which my honourable colleague
from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. MeRae) paid a
little earlier this afternoon to the committee
members who belong to the legal profession.
as for one reason and another I did not attend
as many meetings of the committee as I should
have attended. However, I made one contribution. The committee's recommendations as
te discretionary powers arise out of a couple
of cases that were decided some two years
after they were heard in the Exchequer Court.
I argued those cases and lost both of them,
thus raising issues that still have to be
considered.
My honourable friend from Queens-Lunenburg (Hon. Mr. Kinley) bas asked for delay
in the adoption of the report, on the ground,
I take it, that he as net had a chance to
study it. If T may say se, without being in
any way disrespectful, I think he as proved
his case.

MAY 30, 1946
The contentious issue in the report so far is
the subject of appeals from the exercise of
discretion by the minister. As far as a new
board of appeal is concerned, I think the
deputy minister was in complete agreement.
But the real problem that confronted us all
was the discretion of the minister. On that
subject my honourable friend did not have
anything to say so far as I could follow him.
Apparently he objected to the constitution of
a board of seven members. As I understand
the report, it is intended to have two divisions,
each of three members, sitting at the same
time. These divisions will no doubt draw up
itineraries and sit at many places where there
are litigants who could not possibly afford the
time or money to come to Ottawa.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Is that provided for
in the report?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: How many members
will sit outside Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Three.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: On the other hand, it
may be necessary for the full board of seven
to sit on some exceedingly important cases.
The same course is followed in the Privy
Council.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: And in the United
States Supreme Court.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: In minor cases the
Privy Council. is divided into two courts
sitting with a quorum of three; but on grave
constitutional issues or other very important
cases there is a larger court. As my honourable friend says, a similar course is followed
in the United States.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Would the honourable senator kindly refer me to the section
of the proposed act which provides for two
divisions of the board?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: My honourable friend
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) bas
kindly given me the section. It will be found
on page 236 of the Senate Minutes of Proceedings. It is section 14, and reads as follows:
The Board of Tax Appeals may with the approval of the Governor in Council make al]
necessary rules and regulations respecting,
(a) the sittings of the board and divisions
thereof throughout Canada.
(b) the practice and procedure in all matters
of business to be dealt with before the board.
(c) the apportionment of the work of the
board among its members, the allocation of members to divisions and the assignment of divisions
to sit at hearings,
(d) the publication of the decisions of the
board

353

(e) generally, the carrying on of the work of
the board, the management of its internal affairs
and the duties of its officers and employees,
(f) any other matter or thing deemed necessary in the performance of the function of the
board as a court of tax appeals.
There is another provision here which definitely fixes the quorum as three.
I was dealing more particularly at the
moment with the address of the honourable
gentleman who spoke immediately before the
honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard. I
find it a little difficult to understand what he
had to say as to leaving matters to members of
parliament. After all, this question falls within
the duties of members of parliament when it
cornes to consideration of the forrm of legislation; but what follows from the legislation,
either as it is now or as it will be if these
proposals are accepted, is a matter of administration, and it was never intended that the
duties of administration should fall on members of parliament.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: But the minister is
responsible to parliament.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: That is true; and the
officials are responsible to the minister.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The minister's discretion is the question at issue.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: The minister's discretion is exercised by him in his capacity as an
administrator, not as a member of parliament. I know of no principle which says that
because he is responsible to parliament, that
is a ground for extending the discretion which
should be imposed upon him. The whole
question to be considered in that relation is:
What is the most effective form of administration? This committee is of opinion, and it is
my belief that it is almost the unanimous
opinion of the people of Canada, that in the
administration of an act like this it is not a
wise principle to leave unrestricted discretion
in a ministerSome Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: -particularly when the
problems are so complex, and the duties so
onerous that he does not exercise his own discretion in one case out of a hundred, but
simply follows the recommendation made by
some under official.
My honourable friend urged the idea of
stability of thought and spoke of "rocking the
boat". Again I fail to find what application
that has to what we are discussing. Stability
of thought is always ensured by intelligent
consideration by parliament and committees

354

SENATE

of parliament as to how you can improve
legislation and its administration in the interests of the people.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Quite so.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: There is no factor of
"rocking the boat" in that. It seems to me
that my honourable friend's suggestion is the
only rocking of the boat there is in the whole
question. He said something about the profit
corporations have been making. I was not
able to follow his remarks in that respect.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: My friend wants to
be fair, I am sure. I was speaking of the
principle of the excess profits tax, which applies
mostly to corporations. I was net speaking
slightingly of corporations at all.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: I do not know precisely
what my honourable friend said, so I cannot
answer him. But I must say that what I did
hear of his remarks had no relation to the
recommendations of this committee which we
now have under consideration.
Let me say a word to my honourable colleague from Vancouver-Burrard regarding
this question of time on appeals. In the first
place, i would point out that after the minister makes the assessment there is a right of
appeal by the dissatisfied taxpayer to the
minister. That is the first step. To me it
has always seemed the most futile and the
most unnecessary step in the whole proceeding.
Surely the minister or his officials should give
proper consideration to the assessment before
it is made.
An Hon. SENATOR: There is no doubt
about that.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Most of the time
wasted today is the time between the minister's first decision, which is known as the
assessment, and the minister's second decision,
when be confirms his first-because he nearly
always does confirm it. That will be done
away with and the time used up today in
appealing to the minister from the minister's
decision will be used up in an appeal from the
assessment of the minister to this tax court
of appeal. As I recollect, the time is definitely limited to thirty days. So there will be
an effective reduction in the time of appeals
in that connection. That, I think, my honDurable friend will agree, is in itseif a definite
improvement.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The appeal from the
minister to the minister has gone.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes. It is now an
appeal from the minister to the court. Not
only is that so, but it is going to take considerably less time than the old system.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: Thirty days does not
mean very much when you are on the way to
the Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Let us consider that
remark. My friend has suggested that an appeal to the tax board should be final. I think
that would be a great mistake. I have never
yet known what might be termed a court of
first instance, such as this tax appeal court
would be, that was not inclined to be unduly
arbitrary if there was no appeal above it. I
think you would find yourselves back in a lot
of the troubles you are in now if in important
matters these boards knew there was no appeal from their decisions.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: We have found that
se under the Farmers Creditors' Arrangement
Act.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: If there was no appeal,
there would not be as much consistency in the
jurisprudence emanating from that court as
there would be if its members knew that sitting over them always there was an appellate
court. Let me point out to my honourable
friend that it is not correct to imagine that all
these tax cases will go to appeal. We know
that in ordinary practice in the courts it is
only exceptional cases that reach the Privy
Council. Take the Supreme Court of Canada,
although that court is sitting in appeal on
cases from all the superior courts in the nine
provinces, there are only a limited number of
appeals.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: On questions of law.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Yes; and sometimes on
questions of law and fact.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Only rarely on questions of fact.
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: Not so very rarely
either. What I am pointing out is that the
cases that come up for appeal are exceedingly
limited once you have got a uniform jurisprudence established, as in a court of appeal.
My friend has said, and I agree with him, that
the things needed are speed, uniformity and
finality. He might have added-and to be
sure that the court will not be too arbitrary.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question just there? There
is a difference between this appeal and the
appeal, for instance, from the decision of the
Board of Transport Commissioners. Some
times that board will sit in two sections. If
one of the parties to a dispute is dissatisfied
with the decision, be can appeal to the full
board. Questions of discriminatory rates and
services are, i a way, similar to questions that
come up in respect of taxation. The only appeal from the full Board of Transport Con-

MAY 30, 1946
missioners is to the Privy Council, plus an
appeai ta the Supreme Court of Canada on a
question af law. Here, if I read carreetly the
sections of the praposed aet, there is a riglit of
appeal on questions bath of fact and of iaw
ta the Exchequer Court, then ta the Supreme
Court af Canada, and eventualiy ta the Privy
Council. Is there any Teason why the same
procedure under whichThe Hon. the SPEAKER: The honaurable
gentleman is out of arder. He lias aIready
spoken in the debate
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I wanted to ask the
question.
Han. Mr. FARRIS: Honourable senators,
I arn not going ta answer in detail, because
I think my honourable friend is now discussing
a matter, somewhat belatedly. in the form of
a question. I would remind him that this
committee was appointed and functioned last
session; it was reappointed and functioned
again this session, and if my friend had in
mind any details of that kind, it is unfortunate that he did not give the committee the
benefit of thein.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Would that exciude
me from giving themn here?
Hon. Mr. FARRIS: No; but it reduces the
justification for giving thern now, because we
are today discussing the general principies of
the matter and not the details, and any diversion from the essentiais of these proposais ta
their varying details only weakens the force
of any recommendation the Senate rnay make.
Everything that rny honourable friend has
referred to was discussed back and forth in
the sessions, and considered and studied for
practicaliy two years. I say that if my honourable friend really had seriaus objections of
this kind he might well have devoted an hour
or so of bis turne ta giving the committee the
benefit of bis ideas.
Honourabie senators, I arn of the opinion
that this matter should be disposed of now
along the lines of the essentials contained in
the recommendations. These essentiais are:
First, that an appeai board should be created;
second, that it shouid have power ta deal with
iaw and with facts; third, that it should have
power to deal with discretions exercised by
the rninister; and iast, that there should be,
as in ail our juridicâl proceedings a further
appeal ta a higlier court.
Honourable senators, there is a good reason
why we shouid dispose of this matter now.
The budget is ta corne down very shortlyalthough we rnight get along if it did not
corne down at aIl.

Saine Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh
Hon. Mr. FARRIS,: I understand that at
the present session of pariiament the
minister wili propose legisiation relative ta
the suggestions that we have been discussing.
It is highly essentiai that the recommendations
of this committee, the subjeet of which has
in fact been before the Senate for two
sessions, shouid be endorsed and passed along
for the benefit of the governinent and the
legisiation that is now in the rnaking.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
The motion for concurrence in the repart
was agreed ta.

follows:

The committee have in obedience to the order
of reference of the 2nd May, 1946, examined

357

into the economic value of Metalliferous Mines
in Canada.
In the course of its inquiry the committee
has heard briefs submitted by:
The Ontario Mining Association;
The Western Quebec Mining Association;
The Toronto Stock Exchange;
The Mid-West Metal Mining Association;
The Prospectors and Developers Association,
and
The British Columbia and Yukon Chamber
of Mines.
The following witnesses were also heard:
Mr. Sidney Norman, Special Writer, The
Toronto Globe and Mail;
Mr. A. W. Hawkey, Chemist, Royal Canadian
Mint;
Dr. W. C. Clark, Deputy Minister of Finance;
Dr. Charles Camsell, C.M.G., former Deputy
Minister of Mines and Resources, and
Mr. W. H. Losee, Director of the Industrial
Census, Dominion Bureau of Statisties.
Although the scope of the order of reference
provided for an examination into the economie
value of metalliferoús mines in Canada, no
representations were hubmitted on behalf of
the base metal mines or any silver mining
interests. Accordingly this report is confined
to dealing with the submissions made before
the Committee on behalf of the gold mining
industry of Canada.
Reference, however, is made briefly to the
position of the base metals and silver. They
enjoy open world markets, and to that extent
are different from gold, which bas a fixed price.
It should be pointed out, too, that the production of all metals in Canada in the period of
1907 to 1944 inclusive amounted to approximately $6,000,000,000. During this period the
value of the production of gold amounted to
approximately $2,500,000,000. The importance
of the contribution in peace and in war of the
base metal mines to Canada cannot be too
much stressed. However, in this report, since
the submissions made and the evidence given
to the committee dealt with the position of the
gold mining industry, attention will be directed
particularly to the position and importance and
problems of that industry.
During the war years, due to inereasing costs
of labour, essential materials and equipment
and the restrictive regulations in respect
thereof, the maximum annual production of the
gold mines in Canada was reduced. At the
present time these higher costs for supplies,
equipment and labour threaten soon to exhaust
the narrow margin of average profit earnéd
according to the statements filed on behalf of
the gold mining interests of Ontario and Quebee
for the year 1944. In 1944 the profit per ton
on ore milled had fallen to $1.94 per ton in
Ontario, and during the same period, according
to the Department of Mines for the province
of Quebec, the net surplus earned per ton of
ore produced in Western Quebee was 62 cents
per ton. It will be seen, therefore, that rising
costs, together with the fixed price for gold,
are closing the gap between the cost of produeing gold and the price realized to the extent
that the margin of profit is making it more
and more unprofitable to mine low grade ores.
In these circumstances the picture for the gold
mining industry, at this time, is not a happy
one. Any further increase in costs will convert
into waste rock. so far as gold production is
concerned, more of the ore reserves presently
reckoned as of value to the producing mines
and will, at the same time, reduce the tonnage

SENATE

358

of available ores for new mines to the extent
that the increasing costs make it unprofitable
to mine lower grade or marginal ores.
In addition, during the war ore reserves of
producing gold mines were decreased in order
to maintain some measure of profitable production. Development work was also drastically
eurtailed due to shortage of labour and materials.
Both of these items, namely, maintenance of substantial ore reserves and the opening up of new
sources of ore by continuons development, are
essential to give assurance of continued profitable operation in the best interests of the particular shareholders, as well as the industry
generally and the country.
A considerable amount of exploration work,
including diamond drilling, was carried on in the
different mining areas during the war years.
There are many properties today moving
towards the position of producing mines, but
substantially increased costs of all labour, materials and equipment, as well as the heavy
impost of corporate taxation on producing mines,
make the task of bringing new mines into production very difficult.
Most prospective new mines have expended
their capital in the exploration and development of their properties and in proving up the
commercial value of their ore. Very often the
last stage of providing a mill has to be financed
on borrowed money. At this time the increased
costs and the rates of corporate income taxation
are such that low grade ores cannot be profitably
milled and the prospective life of many of the
new mines is not such as to merit the additional
capital required for the development of the
property.
There must also be added to these considerations in relation to the new mines, the fixed
price for gold which prevents the recovery by
the mine from its production of the increased
costs of operations

and taxes through an

in-

creased price for the product.
Both producing mines and new mines are faced
with a definite shortening of their mining life
through such a burden of increased costs and
taxes. which makes unprofitable the mining of
marginal ores.
The gold mining industry of Canada is one of

our most substantial industries. In 1941 it produced over $200,000,000. It has no marketing
problem. Most of this money is spent in Canada
for labour, supplies and equipment, with consequent indirect employment in almost every line
of endeavour.
The economic value to Canada of this gold
mining industry is two-fold. It provides a large
field for employment and the earning of income

directly in the prospecting, exploring and developing necessary in the search for and the proving
of mines, and in the operations

of producing

mines and indirectly in the production of materials, equipment and supplies required in such
operations.
Secondly, it provides a continuing

source of a strategic mineral for adjustment of
our international trade balances, and for implementing our agreements in relation to international trade, all of which is of immeasurable

value to Canada. To illustrate the economic
value of the gold mining industry to Canada
reference is made to one or two statements filed
in the brief of the Ontario Mining Association
which is copied into the proceedings of the com-

mittee.

For instance, in the year 1941 Ontario

Hon. Mr. DONNELLY.

produced about $123,000,000 worth of gold. This
$123,000,000 was paid out or utilized for the
following purposes:
$42,000,000
Wages ......................
6,000,000
Fuel and power ...............
14,000,000
Supplies ......................
2,000,000
Freight and refining, etc. ......
7,000,000
Depreciation of plant .........
.14,000,000
.......................
Taxes
35,000,000
Dividends to shareholders ...
3,000,000
Surplus......................
The purchase of mining sud milling equipment
and general supplies included in these figures
covered such items as lumber and timber of ai
kinds in the amount of approximately $2,850,g
000, electri. power approximately $4,500,000, explosives approximately $4,700,000, and numerous
other items, including building materials, cars
and locomotives, electrical equipment, varins
types of machinery, tools and chemicals. The
item of freight amounted to approximately
$2,500,000.
It was estimated by the witnesses who ape miner
peared before your committee that
working in the gold mines supported and provided work for at least four other persons in
Canada. This will serve, in a general way, to
give some outîjue in skeleton of the extent and
importance of the operations of the gold mines
of Canada to the industrial and agricultural
ofue
reancial of the country.
and f
The population of the varions mining areas
contributes substantially to tee support of the
farming industry in these mining areas. Te
farmi g industry in t e varions provinces of
Canada where mininrg operations are carried
on benefits generally through the requirements
of te mining population wbich is a large consumer of agricultural products. ln addition, t e
continued production of gold contributes rauch
to the international stability of Canada in ber
trade and currency relations witliother countries.
Lack of understanding of the position and
economie value of the gold miningpincdus
Canada would appear to be a major cause o t e
present situation of this indcstry.
As a matter of settled government policy
tliere is no frcee market for gold. The government taes the entire nnai production of the
goid mines of Canada. Since tEls gold production is utilized for the general advantage of
Canada in the adjnstment of international trade
balances, and to aid in Cansda's participation in
the field of international trade relations, your
Committee subits tbat tEe importance of thEs
industry merits such action as will pýrovide for
a profitable operation and 80 maintain and expand tEe operations of this industry lu Canada.
It tahes more tman a Midas toucb to recover
gold from the ground. ahe public who provide
tbe flnancing necessary to carry a property
through to production require some assurance of
profitable operation to justify their provision of
rîslc capital.
The percentage of mining properties tbat
develop into producing mines is very small in
relation t tEe number of snc properties prosOntarin

gained in employment of labour and through
consumption of supplies and equipment necessary to such efforts.
It should hardi y be necessary to add that
new mines from the moment of commencement
of production are wasting assets.
Iu the opinion of the committee the valne
of this industry to our Canadian economy is
s0 great that it is recommended that steps be
now taken to assure not oniy the maintenance
of the industry on a profitable basis, but its
continued development and expansion. To this
end your committee submits the following
recommendations for your earnest consideration
and, if approved, for such action as may be
necessary by the proper authorîties to impiement such recommandations.
Part I
In respect of new mines, it is recommended
that, (a) the provisions of Part 13 of the
Income War Tax Act, Section 89 of the said
Act (which ceased te have any affect after
December 31, 1942) be ra-enacted so that new
mines hereafter corming into production shahl be
exempt from corporation incoma tax for the
first three fiscal periods following the commencement of production and in addition the
rate of corporation income tax for the naxt
two fiscal periods be 50 per cent of the rate
then applicable generally to corporations;
(b) That the run-in or tuning-up pariod of
six months be continued as in the p ast, in which
no corporation income tax shaîýl be payable,
preceding commencement of production for purposes of the exemption recommended in pagraph (a) hereof, in order that the mîlIlinK
operations may be f ully tested and the sta
and workmen efflciently trained. It should be
pointed out that during the time when Section
89 of the Income War Tax Act was in force
this mun-in or tuning-up period was allowed and
recognized as a matter of administrative practice and no corporation income tax was assessed
for such period;
(c) A depletion allowance of 50 per cent for
the exhaustion of the mine shall be allowed to
be deductad before determining the amount
Your
which shal lie subjeet to income tax.
committee, in the light of the submissions made
by those who appeared and presented briefs,
has reached the conclusion that the present
allowance of 33Jý per cent is too iow and that
the depietion allowance should be restored to
50 per cent which was the rate allowed prier
to 1934.
(d) Depreciation be fnot required to be
charged during the period of exemption provided in paragraph (a) hareof at a greater
amount than the annual earnings of the
corporation.
Part II
In respect of producin
mi.nes your committee recommends that t h e deletion allowance of 50 per cent provide under paragraph
(c) of Part I, in respect of new mines, be also
ailowed to producing mines.
Part IlI-General
Your committee further racommends that the
minting charges for goid minted for the industry be the actual cost of such minting only.
Your committee further recommends, for tie
goverumental
consideration of the proper
authority based on'the representations made
before this cuummittee, that the services of the
Department of Mines apd Resources be ex-

panded in the înterest of the gold mini industry of Canada for the purpose of providing for
geological surveys and aerial mapping.
AUl which is respectfully submitted.
H1e said: Honourahie senators, at this stage
it would of course be out of order for me to
discuss the report. I should like to say, however, that tlie evidence from varjous mining
associations lias greatly impressed me witli
the relative importance of the prosparity of
the mining industry of Canada to the economic prosperity of the country in general, and
I think therefore that the report should lie
given the widest publicity possible.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Wlien sliall the
report lie considjered?

REDISTRIBUTION
MOTION

POSTPONED

On the motion:
That whereas by the British North America
Act, 1867 it is provided that in respect of
representation in the House of Commons the
Province of Quebec shall have the fixed number
of sixty-five membersAnd whereas the said Act provides that there
shall be assigned to each of the other provinces
such a number of members as will bear the
same proportion to the number of its population as the number sixty-five bears to the
number of the population of Quebec;
And whereas the said Act provides for the
readjustment of representation on the completion of each decennial census, and that on
any such readjustinent the number of members
for a province shall not be reduced unless the
proportion which the number of the population
of the province bore to the number of the
aggregate population of Canada at the then
last preceding readjustmient of the number of
members for the province is ascertained at the
then latest census to be diminished by one
twentieth part or upwards;
And whereas the effect of the aforesaid provisions bas not been satisfactory in that proportionate representation of the provinces
according to population bas not been maintained;
And whereas it is considered that a more
equitable apportionment of members to the
various provinces could be effected if readjustment were made on the basis of the population
of all the provinces taken as a whole:A humble address be presented to fis Majesty
The King in the following words:To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracions Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament
assemnbled, humbly approach Your Majesty,
praying that You may graciously be pleased
to cause a measure to be laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom to be expressed
as follows:
An Act to provide for the readjustment of
representation in the House of Commons of
Canada on the basis of the population of
Canada:
Whereas the Senate and House of Commons
of Canada in Parliament assembled have submitted an address to His Majesty praying that
His Majesty nay graciously be pleased to cause
a Bill to be laid before tbe Parliament of the
United Kingdom for the enactment of the provisions hereinafter set forth;
Be it therefore enacted by the King's Most
Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and
consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Comumons, in this present Parliament
assembled. and by the authority of the same
as follows:
1. Section fifty-one of the British North
America Act. 1867, is bereby repealed and the
following substituted therefor:
51. (1) The number of members of the
House of Commons shall be Two hundred and
fifty-five and the representation of the provinces therein shall forthwith upon the coming
into force of this section and thereafter on the
completion of eacb decennial census be readjusted by* such authority. in such manner, and
from such time as the Parliament of Canada
from tine to time provides, subject and according to the following Rules:
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

1. Subject as hereinafter provided, there shall
be assigned to each of the provinces a number
of members computed by dividing the total
population of the provinces by Two hundred
and fifty-four and by dividing the population
of each province by the quotient so obtained,
disregarding, except as hereinafter in this section provided, the remnainder, if any, after the
said process of division.
2. If the total number of members assigned
to all the provinces pursuant to Rule One is
less than Two hundred and fifty-four, additional members shall be assigned to the provinces (one to a province) havng remainders in
the computation under Rule One commencing
with the province having the largest remainder
and continuing with the other provinces in the
order of the magnitude of their respective
remainders until the total number of members
assigned is Two hundred and fifty-four.
3. Notwithstanding anything in this section,
if upon the completion of a computation under
Rules One and Two, the number of members to
be assigned to a province is less than the
number of senators representing the said province, Rules One and Two shall cease to apply
in respect of the said province, and there shall
ie assigned to the said province a number of
members equal to the said number of senators.
4. In the event that Rules One and Two
cease to apply in respect of a province then,
for the purpose of computing the number of
members to be assigned to the provinces in
respect of which Rules One and Two continue
to apply, the total population of the provinces
shsall be reduced by the number of the population of the province in respect of which
Rules One and Two have ceased to apply and
the number Two hundred and fifty-four shall
be reduced by the number of members assigned
to such province pursuant to Rule Three.
5. Such readjustment shall not take effect
until the Termination of the then existing
Parliament.
(2)
The Yukon Territory as constituted by
Chapter forty-one of the Statutes of Canada,
1901, together with any part of Canada not
comprised within a province which may from
time to time be included therein by the Parliament of Canada for the purposes of representation in Parliament, shall be entitled to one
member.
2. This Act may be cited as the British North
America Act, 1946, and the British North
America Arts, 1867 to 1943, the British North
America Act. 1907 and this Act may be cited
together as the British North America Acts,
1867 to 1946.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I am asking that this motion stand.
As honourable senators know, it was presented
here concurrently with a similar one in another place. There is nothing to prevent us
considering the subject matter of the motion,
but since it primarily concerns the other
house, I believe it would be good judgment
on our part not to proceed with it here until
it bas been disposed of in the other place. I
regret tiat the motion bas remained on the
order paper so long, but I had no way of
knowing what length of time would be required

JUNE 19, 1946
for its consideration in the other place; consequently, I ask the indulgence of the Senate in
perm-itting the order to stand.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
Honourable
senators, I quite agree with the views expressed
by the honourable leader of the government.
The matter is one that pertains to the other
house more than to this house, and from every
standpoint I think it is better to allow the
motion to stand.
The motion stands.
LITERATURE

PRIZE FOR CANADIAN
AUTHORS

a

MOTION

Hon. ATHANASE DAVID moved:
That this House express the wish that it
may please the Government of Canada to
acknowledge the importance of literature in
the life of a nation by fostering the production
of literary, scientific, economic and social works
in this country and creating a prize in literature; and that each year, a jury selected by the
Government shall grant this prize to Canadian
authors submitting the most meritorious works.
He said (Translation): Honourable senators, doubtless you will understand that it
would be far easier for me to use my mother
tongue in discussing the subject with whieh I
want to deal today. Genuine courtesy, however, requires that I should submit my
observations in the English language, since I
am aware that many of you could not follow
me if I spoke French.
(Text)
Honourable senators, during
the past
twenty-five years the world has been in a
state of turmoil; two wars have depressed and
dispersed the very flower of youth. In 1939
and the years following, as in 1914, youth, with
its great ideals, and representing the best of
every nation, went to the battlefields and
engaged in the fight. Therefore we may calculate that from the intellectual and spiritual
point of view two generations have fallen into
oblivion. By this I mean that the talents
received by these generations at birth could
not be placed at the disposal of their home
lands or of the world at large. Some of these
young people were writers of ability; others
might have shed great light in the countries
where they lived. But they are gone. To them
goes the remembrance of older men, and a
younger generation hopes that we will do our
utmost to replace this lost talent by encouraging a new intellectual
and spiritual
development.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: We of a certain age must
thank Him who gave us life in the later part
of the nineteenth century for permitting us in

361

our youth to know the real and plenteous
enjoyment of life. We were living in peace;
no evil ideas were spread abroad; family life
still existed and we were happy. I need not
say to honourable senators, many of whom
have had more experience than I, that the
youth of the country today is not the same
as it was and does not have the same full
enjoyment of life that we had years ago.
Mindful of all these things, and especially
of those who went across the ocean to fight
for an ideal, whatever it may have been, there
comes te my mind a thought which his honour
the Speaker may regard as beyond the scope
of my discussion, but which I consider it my
duty to present. It is this: the flag of.a country is the flag of those who have made such a
symbel possible. Had not the youth of this
country crossed the ocean and fought for us,
there would be no discussion of a national flag
in Canada today; one displaying neither the
maple leaf nor the Union Jack would have
been imposed upon us.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID. Theirs is the voice that
should be listened to; theirs the sentiment
that is expressed-the voice and sentiment of
those who did what we older ones could not
do. They went abroad to defend the flag that
we are going to have in Canada.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: I do not favour the
creation of a military caste in Canada, but I
sincerely believe in my mind and heart that
the members of the three branches of the
armed services who crossed the ocean and
fought for this country should be asked what
they think our flag should be. This suggestion
I leave to you to reflect and meditate upon.
As you all know, because of the flag they
carried our invading troops were always taken
for English soldiers. They had to explain
that they were Canadians. This was unfair
to them and unfair to Canada. They did their
utmost, and the many who are buried over
there claim for those who yet live the
privilege of at least indicating that they have
preserved for us the right to choose a flag.
I need not tell honourable senators that
material power and economic strength are not
sufficient to make a country great. What
remains of ancient Greece or Rome, or of
the masterpieces of architecture that students
from all over the world used te go to see and
admire? But these ancient civilizations also
had their literature, and if Italy and Greece
were completely obliterated from the surface
of the earth, as long as the world remains
Greece and Rome would be remembered

SENATE
through their writers. There was a difference
in the intellectual growth of these two great
civilizations of the past. Greece first attained
the very summit of intellectuality before ever
thinking of conquest; Rome, by conquest, acquired possessions, wealth and power. But
the day came when the heads of the Roman
Empire realized that all these things had not
made Rome a great nation. What did they
do then? They brought from Greece writers,
orators and philosophers to teach the children
in the Roman schools how national greatness
might be achieved.
There are four great centuries of antiquity
which, because of the literary geniuses they
produced, will never fall into oblivion, namely,
the centuries of Pericles, Augustus, Leo X and
Louis XIV. A little later I shall suggest, with
due respect for all who may differ in opinion,
that there are two more which should be
added to this list. But first let me say that
Pericles, by whose name the century in which
he lived is known to us today, would have
been as completely forgotten as are the names
of many other Greek conquerors had it not
been for such men as Aeschylus, Sophocles,
Euripides, Plato, Socrates, Aristophanes and
the great sculptor Phidias. They lived in the
most brilliant epoch of Hellenie literature and
arts, an epoch that personified the Greek
genius in its most varied qualities.
Why is there a period in history known as
the Augustan age? Rome had many other
emperors besides Augustus, and some of them
like Julius Caesar, were great conquerors.
Fheir trail of conquest led across the then
cnown world. Britain was one of the countries they invaded, and evidences of their
military works are still to be seen there in
various roads and bridges. But are the names
of the conquerors themselves mentioned today? As a general rule, no. Then why is the
name of Augustus so outstanding that it is
used to denote his age? Why is he regarded as
one of the greatest personalities in history?
Because, owing to his practical encouragement
of literature and the arts, the Romans of his
time achieved their highest intellectual development. The names of Horace, Virgil, Ovid,
Terence, Tibullus, Propertius and Titus Livius
come to one's mind. Thanks to the artists,
he reconstructed Rome; he found her built of
bricks, but he left her gleaming in marble.
Pope Leo X, with a fund that was provided
in a certain way of which we all have heard,
built what is I suppose the greatest church in
the world, St. Peter's of Rome, an irresistible
attraction for many thousands of pilgrims and
tourists every year. But even that great
accomplishment would not be sufficient ta give
Leo X the high position that he holds in
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

world history. No. His chief claim to glory
arises from the fact that the age in which he
lived was the age of Machiavelli, Ariosto, Pico
della Mirandola, Bramante, Raphael, Michael
Angelo, da Vinci, Corregio, Titian and Andrea
del Sarto. Leo X gave his protection to the
arts, to literature and science, and I think it
will be generally admitted that he deserves
to have his name applied to one of the most
brilliant periods in human annals.
Now I come to what France and, may I
say, the world generally regard as the greatest
century of all time-the century of Louis XIV.
I shall merely recall to honourable members
some of the distinguished mån of that period,
whose names I know are familiar to all.
There were the poets, Corneille, Racine, Molière, Regnard, Boileau, LaFontaine. The outstanding orators were Bossuet, Massillon,
Bourdalone and Fénelon. Among the philosophers were Descartes, Pascal, LaRochefoucauld, LaBruyère, Malabranche, Fontenelle.
The oustanding scientists were Fernat, Papin
and Chardin. Among the artists were Poussin,
Lebrun, Mignard, Puget, the two Mansards,
Lenotre and Lulli. There was also the great
jurist Montesquieu.
Here is a century so
glorious that it may well be added to those I
have already mentioned. It extended from
about the middle of the 17th century into the
middle of the 18th century.
I think it will not be disputed that occasionally a man is so richly endowed by nature that,
figuratively speaking, he immortalizes his period. Such a genius as Shakespeare immortalized the century during which he lived and
wrote. The end of the 16th century and the
beginning of the 17th were dominated by the
great Elizabeth, whose reign and life have perplexed the minds of historians. Notwithstanding the great achievements of the statesmen
and soldiers of the magnificent queen, I do not
hesitate to call her reign the Shakespeare century. All countries of the world have acknowledged and consecrated the genius of Shakespeare. France was one of the first of the
countries of Europe ta acknowledge his glory
by erecting the monument we admire on
Boulevard Haussman at the corner of Avenue
de Messine, the sculptor of which, if I remember correctly, was Fournier. I should like to
give you Victor Hugo's tribute to Shakespeare, but before doing so I must beg your
indulgence in regard to my translation, for it
is difficult to preserve the spirit of the author
in another tongue. He said:
The place Shakespeare occupies is among the
most sublime of the élite of absolute geniuses
who, from time to time increased by a newcomer, crown civilization and focus their tremendous light on the whole of humanity.

JUNE 19, 1946
And he adds:
Othello, Falstaff, Ophelia, Hamlet, are still
living.
To those immortal characters I would add
Shylock. Truly, they will live forever.
Honourable members, I am confident, will
not be surprised when I recall the Victorian
period as complementary to that of the great
Tudor queen. I do not for a moment overlook
the important scientific discoveries and their
application during the reign of Queen Victoria. Who could forget the signal service
rendered to humanity by Lister, or the industrial revolution that followed the introduction
of steam-driven machinery? But marvellous
as were the applications of the scientific
research of her more than sixty years' reign,
I am inclined to doubt whether they throw
nearly as much lustre on that period as do
the works of the writers, poets, thinkers, and
historians that distinguish the years from
1837 to the beginning of the twentieth century. Among the poets I need only recall to
you the familiar names of Tennyson, Browning, Matthew Arnold, Swinburne, William
Morris. Who among honourable members has
not read and enjoyed the works of Dickens,
Thackeray, Charlotte and Emily Bronté,
George Eliot? And I venture to say that our
political thinking has been influenced, whether
we realize it or not, by the writings of John
Stuart Mill and Spencer. Outstanding historians of the period were Macaulay, Buckle,
Froude and Freeman; and two of the foremost scientists were Huxley and Tyndall.
Macaulay in his History of England emphasizes the importance of literature to any country that desires greatness. After stating that
the separation of England from Normandy
when John became king was the beginning of
the history of England, lie adds:
Then was formed that language, less musical
indeed than the language of the south, but in
force, in richness, in aptitude for all the highest
purposes of the poet, the philosopher and the
orator, inferior to the tongue of Greece alone.
Then, too, appeared the first dawn of that noble
literature, the most splendid and the most
durable of the many glories of England.
It is needless for me to stress that Macaulay
places literary achievement above all others.
Do you not believe, honourable members,
that what is true of England must be true of
any country? And surely therefore it must
be true of Canada.
De Bonald, the French writer, said that
"literature is the expression of society".
Therefore any literary manifestation is the
expression of the social status of the people
where it is made. My conclusion will be that
literature is the most beautiful expression of
humanity, and therefore, of civilization.

Honourable senators, when I decided to
present this motion, I did so only after mature
consideration and with hesitation and perplexity, because I know the magnitude of the
problems now before the two houses of
parliament. I came to the conclusion that
as we are going through a period of reconstruction, reconversion and re-adaptation there
is a class of people who should not be forgotten, a class which represents the moulders
of the minds and mentalities of the Canadian
people-the writers. Give me good writers
and good readers and I will give you a good
country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Let us encourage the
writers of our country who have the qualities
of heart and soul to educate our people,
otherwise their ideas will flow away. This
expression on my part may appear to some
to be an explosion of idealism. I am not
ashamed to confess 'that I have been an
idealist all my life, and I pray that I will
remain so to my last day. An idealist is the
most practical man in the world. Idealism
is the only quality a man will keep against
everyone and everything; he cannot be dispossessed of it as he can of wealth. When
you have an ideal you go through life enjoying every minute; your mind is always open
and is not absorbed in materialistic thoughts.
On the quality of idealism I should like to
seek the support of George Duhamel, one of
the most brilliant French writers of today.
He has this to say:
In a period when one may have to change his
occupation from one day to another, it is more
than ever necessary to have solid and robust
foundations. Therefore more than ever must
sehools train men able to resist the divagations
of actual civilization. My experience teaches
me the vanity of what we call "connaissances
utiles." What is more useful is the knowledge
of "connaissances inutiles," because these are
eternal while the useful things may become ohsolete from one hour to the other.
This is an answer to those who sometimes
smile at the efforts of writers, essayists and
philosophers. They have a smile which seems
to say: "You poor dreamer, what will you
do in life?" The answer is: "You are not
happy; that is why you are sarcastic." The
writer will answer by his writings, not his
speech.
Material wealth may be destroyed, but
never the ideal that animates a man or a
country. While listening to my remarks some
honourable gentlemen may think I despise
wealth and believe that a country should not
be rich. That belief is very far from my
mind. We need wealth, provided it is not
enjoyed in an egotistical way and is of some
benefit to others. Of all the men in history

SENATE
Croesus was perhaps the most wealthy, but
I challenge anyone to tell me what he did
in life other than amass wealth. How different it is when money is possessed by men like
Rockefeller, who founded the Rockefeller Institute, and by Carnegie, who created libraries
It may not be

within the memory of some, but it is nevertheless true that John D. Rockefeller rebuilt
the Palace of Versailles in Paris at a cost of
$2,000,000. Needless te say, in France the name
of John D. Rockefeller is greatly honoured
and respected. Curtis will long be remembered
by reason of his institute of music; Guggenheim will bc remembered because of his
scholarships. May I recall a Canadian, now
dead for many years. whose name comes to
our lips when we go by railway from Ottawa
to Montreal.
I refer to Macdonald who
created the Macdonald College of Agriculture
and tc Mechanies' Institute of McGill University. It is good that men who accomplish
their duty and make good to their communities should know that the great public
is appreciative. J. W. McConnell will long be
rernembered because of his largesse and the
great donations he has made to McGill University. Morris Wilson, who died just a few
weeks ago. will be remembered for the foundation he established at McGill. Then there
comes to my memory one who for many
years was your colleague, honourable senators
-Marcellin Wilson, who will long be remembered by the students of Canada, for having
erected the Canadian students' house in
Montsouris near Paris.
In the collection "Canada and Its Provinces", Volume XII, page 533, I find this
statement:
But Canada is awakening and there is a growing national sentiment that demands national
expression.
When Canadians have learned that money
making is not the most important thing in life,
native writers will then have a fit audience in
their homeland.
I now come directly to the motion which
reads as follows:
That this House express the wish that it
may please the Government of Canada to
acknowledge the importance of literature in the
life of a nation by fostering the production of
literary, scientific, economie and social works in
this country and creating a prize in literature;
and that each year, a jury selected by the Government shall grant this prize to Canadian
authors submitting the most meritorious works.
The thought that no country can be great
without literature was acknowledged in the
province of Quebec in 1922, when the government of that time created the literary prize
of the province of Quebec. Ever since a jury
has been appointed every year to judge the
Hon. Mr. DAVID.

best books written during the year, and there
is an award of $5,000. I do not know what the
practice is now, but in years past the prize
was divided equally between English-speaking
authors and those of French descent. You
may ask me what the results have been.
No longer ago than April of this year an
article written by W. E. Greening appeared
in Saturday Night under the title "Quebee
I do
publishers now have world markets."
not wish to trespass too much on your time,
honourable senators. but I think certain parts
of this article should be placed before you.
It says:
Few persons in English-speaking Canada or in
the United States, outside of the professional
book trade, are aware of the very great progress
that has been made by book publishing in French
Canada since the outbreak of the second World
War. Prior to 1939 publishing in the province
of Quebec was in an exceedingly anaemic state.
French-speaking Canada was a literary colony
of France just as English-speaking Canada is

still a literary dependency of Great Britain and
the United States.
There may be some exaggeration in that
last statement.
Most of the books in French sold in Quebec
were either published in France or were reprints
of French works by Montreal dealers. Little
effort was made to encourage or publicize native
French-Canadian literary talent. Success was
exceedingly difficult for the French-Canadian
author froin the financial standpoint unless he
was able to build up a reputation and market
for his works in France.
The writer goes on to give a list of publishing companies established in Quebec in recent
years. Then as to the increase in sales of
books he makes a statement which is worth
quoting:
Before the war, one thousand copies was considered a good sale for the average book published in Montreal. Today editions run into
five, six and sometimes eight thousand copies.
The output of French books produced in Canada
between 1940 and 1944 reached a total of fifty
million volumes and 1,500 titles, including novels,
biographies, books on current events, history,
philosophy, children's books, educational books,
etc. These are not startling figures judged by
British or American standards, but they are impressive when one takes into account the small
and scattered population of Canada and the
noribund state of publishing there prior to the
war.
In his concluding paragraph he says:
This is also having a stimulating effect on the
growth of French-Canadian literature. For the
first time in the history of French Canada,
French-Canadian writers are finding a really
sympathetic interest in their work among local
publishers and a steadily expanding home
market among an intelligent and discriminating
reading publie which is displaying a real interest
in books on the current Canadian scene. During
the next decade this may be the beginning of a
literary, musical and artistic renaissance which
will enable Canada to take her rightful cultural
place among the nations of the western hemisphere.

JUNE 19, 1946
Since the Quebec prize has had a result far
exceeding our greatest hopes, do honourable
members not believe that a more valuable
prize given by the Government of Canadait would not be proper for me to suggest what
its value should be-would stimulate the
ambition and initiative of writers throughout
the country? England has long had and still
has a Poet Laureate. Is it not possible that
some day Canada may bestow this honoured
title upon one of her sons or daughters? I
have heard it said that what is proposed in
my motion has never been donc in any
country. Why should Canada not be the first
to do it? Why not set a good example? If
we admit that literature is essential to national
greatness, let us be the first country to
acknowledge it in this practical way.
It may be asked for what kind of works a
prize should be offered. Any literary matter
by a Canadian should be eligible, whether
fiction, philosophy, essays, history, biography,
natural history, or any work dealing with
economics, high politics, sociology, science,
and so on. How would the jury be chosen by
the government? Except within the last three
or four months we have not had an academy
in the province of Quebec, but there is a
nation-wide institution known as the Royal
Society of Canada. It would be a simple
matter to 'have the French and English
branches of the jury selected from members
of this society who are authorities on books of
the classes to be considered. In Quebec announcement is made a year in advance of the
classes of books that will be eligible for the
prize. One year they may be novels and
essays, and, the next year, philosophy, science
and history, and so on, the idea being to have
all branches of literature dealt with over a
certain period.
Let me recapitulate in a few words. We must
remember that literature and the arts are the
real and durable foundation of national
greatness. Certain countries that flourished
in the past would have been entirely forgotten
and never spoken of today were it not that
their literary and artistie productions are a
great asset to humanity. Let us draw example
from them and not be satisfied with mere
material wealth and power. The greatness of
a nation resides in the minds of its people.
Unless it finds expression in the written word
it will, like a tracing on the sand, be effaced
by the first gust of wind or wave of the
ocean and pass into oblivion.
I will close by quoting from a report of the
Canadian Writers' Foundation these words by
Wilfrid Eggleston, Honorary Secretary:
The creative energy that flows in artistic
channels bas characteristies peculiarly its own.

36f

In its highest manifestation it can confer more
glory upon a nation than any other form of
human activity. But in the lifetime of the
literary artist, even the man of high genius,
neglect and the poverty it engenders are the
fate he not infrequently encounters. In his
ambition to lay up provision for posterity he
bas not prepared his way for his own dechning
days. His temporary successes breed only temporary returns, and if his aims were merely
mercenary he would have reserved his energies
for some more lucrative if less congenial task.
We may be thankful that a few Canadians have
chosen the harder way, for it is through their
efforts that Canada will ultimately find an bonoured place upon the intellectual map of the
world.
The motion was agreed to.

CANADA DAY BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE

CONTINIED
The Senate resumed from Tuesday, May 28,
the adjourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Foster for the second reading of Bill 8,
an Act respecting Canada Day.
Hon. L. M. GOUIN: Honourable senators,
after listening to so many good speeches concerning the most appropriate name for our
national holiday, it is difficult for me to add
any new and useful contribution. The subject
seems to have been almost exhausted, for it
has been treated very fully by those who are
in favour of the bill as well as by those who
oppose it. Yet, though the debate on the
motion before us has lasted many weeks, I
consider it my duty to make a few remarks.
I want them to be moderate in tone, but at
the same time to be a clear and frank statement of my opinion.
In certain quarters this bill has aroused not
only opposition but even bitter hostility. Some
people seem to have been shocked by the
fact that legislation has been introduced for
the purpose of substituting the title "Canada
Day" for "Dominion Day". Some over-zealous
Imperialists apparently regard this not only

366

SENATE

as disloyalty, but almost as sacrilege. Do those
kind souls, sincere as they are, really believe
that the Imperial tie will be weakened if
Canadian patriotism becomes stronger and
more conscious? I wish to assure all my fellow citizens that I do not see anything
revolutionary in the terms of the bill. I am
absolutely certain that Canada will not cease
to be a voluntary and loyal member of the
British Commonwealth of Nations if July lst
comes to be celebrated as Canada Day. There
is no danger for the Empire if the free and
courageous people of this wonderful land of
ours choose through their parliament to insist
upon the fact that Canada, within the commonwealth, is now an independent nation in
the fullest sense of those two words. The
Statute of Westminster is the crowning point
of our constitutional evolution, and according
to the spirit and the letter of this magna
carta of our rights we are fully justified in
affirming our complete equality with any other
member of the Imperial firm formerly known
as John Bull and Company.
A source of constant misunderstanding
results from the fact that some so-called
Canadians appear to be unable to realize that
their loyalty is due first and exclusively to
Canada, not to any other country. We find
the same confusion when we are supposed to
celebrate our national holiday. In Quebec
June 24, the fcast of St. Jean Baptiste is
officially called "Fete Nationale," and is a
provincial legal holiday. Like all those of
French extraction, I believe that Frenchspeaking Canadians are very clearly entitled
to mark by an appropriate celebration the
feast of their patron saint. We understand
equally well that the heavenly protectors of
other racial elements are also honoured, like
St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, St. David,
and so on. But very sincerely we say to all
true Canadians, whatever may be their origin
or their faith: Let us all unite on July lst
and celebrate the anniversary of the birth of
the Canadian nation.
Let us be quite frank about it-from Nova
Scotia to British Columbia, from coast to
coast, sufficient importance has not been
attached to the celebration of July lst. It
is the feast of everybody; but it seems also
to be the feast of nobody in particular. There
is a general spirit of indifference or apathy,
which I deeply deplore. On May 24 we have
Empire Day, which many in my province
persist in calling "la Fête de la Reine"-the
Queen's birthday-as a tribute to the cherished memory of Queen Victoria, and on June
14 we have the King's birthday. Thus when
we reach July 1st we have celebrated the
Empire and the King. Then, in my native
province at the end of June we have "Nos
Hon. Mr. GOUIN.

feux de la St. Jean d'été"-our fires of the
summer feast of St. John, a tradition which
dates back many centuries. When the dawn
of July lst arrives-I am sorry to have to
say it-the day does not seem to appeal
very much to anybody from the Atlantic to
the Pacific. In some regions when our good
fellow citizens nourish any alleged grievance
against our federal system, July lst not only
leaves them indifferent, but is almost tinged
with a shade of disillusion or frustration, and
thus has a tendency to become a day of
recrimination against the dominion.
I am convinced that the real purpose of the
promoters of the bill and of those who support
it is to stimulate Canadians to show a universal appreciation of the anniversary of the
founding of Canada as it is today extending
from sea to sea-"a mari usque ad mare." This
is an excellent purpose, and those who uphold
it have acted like good and loyal patriots, even
if some of us do not approve the course which
they have suggested. For myself I agree that
they hav. acted like truc Canadians, and I
give them my fullest support. I believe that
the word "dominion", good as it may have
been, has become somewhat out-moded. Since
1867 we have moved so far that this term
now implies something quite different from
its original sense. It seems to me to have
become a vestige of colonial days. Originally
as taken from the Bible, according to the generally accepted story of its origin, the word
"dominion"--or "dominium" in our latin version-simply meant possession. Eighty years
ago British North America was a British possession enjoying internal self-government, but
subject to some restrictions and being in no
way an international entity. We have moved
forward a good deal since that time. The
founders of confederation, quite prematurely
I 'think, used the French word "puissance"-literally power-to translate the term "dominion."
But in 1867 Canada was not at all a "power",
not even a subordinate "power" in international or in constitutional law. We entered
the world scene only at the end of World War
I, thanks to the blood so generously shed by
our Canadian heroes, and thanks also to the
courage and enlightened patriotism of our
public men who devoted their lives to the
achievement of our national autonomy. Finally, in 1931, with the Statute of Westminster
every trace of dependence disappeared. We
could not possibly be freer than we are today,
and we can rightly be called the "Kingdom of
Canada", as was the desire-the unfulfilled
desire-of some of the Fathers of Confederation.
By retaining the name "Dominion Day" for
July lst we display, I believe, an inferiority

JUNE 19; 1946
complex. There is no legal deflinition of the
word "dominion." It is untranslatable and
very difficult for not only foreigners but for
our own people in general to understand. How
can we create a real, sincere and ardent popular
enthusiasm for a holiday which is christened
or baptized with an almost unintelligible appellation? My views on this point are quite
definite, and I trust that they may not offend
those who think otherwise. They are entitled
to their opinions. For myself, I have the
right to express my own convictions. I really
have at heart the promotion of a clearer conception of Canadian patriotism and a greater
degree of national unity. We must make sure
that all men and women of good will in Canada
work effectively, hand in hand, for the indivisible consolidation of the various elements that
make up our nation. We must unite to prevent any tendency towards disintegration.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: We must help everything which makes for greater internal unity
with due respect for all legitimate and distinctive rights. Every unifying force helps to
strengthen our country. According to the good
old maxim, union is strength. Our divisions
weaken the nation as a whole. A nation must
be composed of citizens who are able to live
and work together, and who can reconcile in a
brotherly way their differences of opinion. I
am the first to admit that time is an essential
element of national integration. Time is a
great remedy 1
Let us examine the situation in this house
and in the country at large on the "Canada
Day" issue. Speeches pro and con on this
question have been delivered in another place
as well as here; dozens of articles have been
published in the press: On occasions the promoters of the bill have been congratulated with
great enthusiasm; at other times the measure
has been denounced as silly and designed to
please certain undesirable elements. Under
those circumstances it must be admitted that
we are very far from having reached any
degree of reasonable unanimity on the legislation now before us. If we want our national
holiday to become a truly national one, we
must try to agree as far as possible.
If the bill is voted on this week or next
week, I hope it will be given second reading.
I hope very sincerely that eventually the bill
will be passed and assented to. But from a
patriotic point of view, looking from every
possible angle at this problem, which is one
of great importance and significance, I ask
myself these questions: In all frankness, what
will be the result? Will the purpose that we
have in view be achieved? Will we have a
63268-25

367

more united Canada if next year we celebrate
"Canada Day" instead of "Dominion Day"?
Will all Canadians in the future have a fuller
appreciation of their rights and duties as citizens of this wonderful land of ours?
May I pause to say that not enough attention is paid to the subject of citizenship in
our schools, colleges and universities.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: This is serious even in
the case of native-born Canadians; but it
becomes much more serious when we are dealing with immigrants. Naturalization is a purely
legal and mechanical process. We turn out so
many new citzens in so many hours or minutes,
according to the rapidity with which the
presiding judge works. In Montreal the applicant for citizenship is taken first to the cellar
of the court house. He is received by a most
sympathetic clerk, an intelligent and devoted
civil servant, but whose quarters are dark
and uninspiring, and look very much like
a cell. After some months the applicant
pays a second visit to that gloomy place, and
is then taken before one of our magistrates.
After a few minutes he comes out of the
court room a new man; lie is no longer a
foreigner, for lie has become a British subject-a Canadian. But nothing whatever has
been done to impress this newly-born fellow
with a sense of pride in his Canadian citizenship.
For many years I have worked with a committee to promote education in citizenship,
but up to dite very little progress has been
made. This problem deserves our most serious
consideration. Would it not be very appropriate and perfectly logical to have on the
lst of July a ceremony welcoming into our
Canadian family those who have been granted
Canadian citizenship, thus inculcating into
their minds an appreciation of their new dignity and a full understanding of their privileges
and obligations?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: Education in citizenship concerns not only the federal authorities.
Education in general falls to the jurisdiction
of the provinces. It is only by real and effective co-operation and concerted action between
the dominion and each province that a sound
Canadian patriotism can be developed and
stimulated.
The lst of July should be not only a legal
holiday, but it should be declared our national
holiday. There is no enactment in our legislation which makes such a declaration. There
is considerable divergence of opinion concerning the best name for our national holiday,

but I am sure that all Caandians from the

to British

Columbia love

country and are most anxious that one day in
every year be set aside as a national holiday.
I am not an expert in parliamentary procedure, but I make the suggestion with some
hesitation that the bill in its present form is
not complete. I believe a vital point will be
missed if the lst of July is not declared to be
our national holiday. I believe the question
should be referred to a special committee of
this house. I do not offer any formal resolutionHon. Mr. DUFF: Why not?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: -but before resuming
my seat I wish to leave with you, honourable
senators, especially those who are more conversant with technical matters than myself,
the suggestion that it would seem advisable to
study the desirability of appointing a cornmittee of this lieuse to report on the following matters: first, the declaration of July 1 as
a national holiday in Canada; second, the
most appropriate name for this national holiday, whether it be "Dominion Day," "Canada
Dur," "Confederation Day" or any other name.
I like the word "Canada", but I am a good
loser.
lion.
Mr.
)AVID:
The
honourable
senator las just tuggested that the lst of
July be declared a national holiday. Why not
say the "nationa'l holiday"?
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: That is my idea. It
should be cur national holiday for all Canada.
The tirid subject for consideration would
be the taking of steps to bring about consultation betweon the federal authorities and
the provincial govcrnments on the matter of
education in citizenship. particularly for the
due observance of our national holiday. The
fourth point would be the welcoming on our
national
holiday of recentlyv naturcalized
citizens.
I suggest that the committee should proceed as speedily as possible. in order ta avoid
the disappointment that would result if this
question were left in abeyance at the end of
the present session, though I would rather
face such disappointment than give the impression that we are trying te force our views
upon those who have a feeling of reverence
for the word "dominion". I believe thut in
such a serious matter as this we mîust make
sure that we apply the right remedy, in the
right way and at the right time.
In my opinion the bill does not go far
enough. To others it seems to go too far. I
am anxious that it should cover the points I
have di-cussed. I sincerelv hope some honourable senators will be able to give definite

and concrete form to the suggestions I have

and more self-conscious.
Our Canadian
patriotism is every day taking a more definite
and precise formn.
A living organism must

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Honourable senators,
having already spoken on this motion I cannot speak again. I am perhaps only interrupting my honourable friend from De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gouin), for I am not sure
that he has finished his speech. So far he has
made an excellent speech, with most of which
I agree, but I am disappointed that lie did
not go further with his suggestion that the
bill should be referred to a committee. In
spite of my views on the bill I should like
to sec it sent to a committee, and I hope

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE

BILL

WITHDRAWN

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, pursuant to the notice

That leave be granted to withdraw the Bill
L5, an Act to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act, 1940.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
withdrawn.
PRIVATE BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. T. A. CRERAR moved the second
reading of Bill J7, an Act respecting the Canadian Fire Insurance Company.
He said: Honourable senators, the Canadian Fire Insurance Company was incorporated upwards of fifty years ago, under a
Manitoba charter, and bas its head office in
the city of Winnipeg. In 1897 it secured a
Dominion charter with a capitalization of
$500,000, divided into shares of S100 each. In
1904 its charter was amended, and the capitalization was reduced to $250,000, divided into
shares of $50 par value. At the same time
powcr was given to the company to increase
its capital to $1,000,000, provided that holders
of two-thirds in value of the outstanding
shares approved. The company has continued
unoder that charter up to the present time.
The amendments proposed by this bill cover
two points: first, they authorize the company
to increase the classes of insurance in which
it engages, as set forth in section 2; and
second, to subdivide its shares into shares of
$10 each.
I understand that the Superintendent 'of
Insurance approves of the bill, except that he
questions the wisdom of the company having
power to subdivide its shares. That, however,
is largely a question of policy, and can be
dealt with when the measure is before the
Committee on Banking and Commerce. Personally I think the power asked for is a
reasonable one. Its purpose is to give a
wider distribution to the shares, and in that
respect it follows the principle adopted in the
last revision of the Bank Act, whereby the
banks were not only empowered, but, in a
sense, directed to subdivide the par value of
their shares to ensure their wider distribution
among the general public.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. CRERAR moved that the bill be
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.

MOTION

FOR

DAY BILL

SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate re-umed from Wednesday. June
19. the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Foster for the second reading of
Bill 8, an Act respecting Canada Day.
Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators, when this bill came to the Senate from
the other place it was net my intention tu
take part in the discussion on it. I viewed
the matter with an entirely open mind. and
had I been consulted beforehand as to whether
it was wise to present the bill at this timewhich of course I was not-I certainly should
have said that it was not.
The discussion on the bill in another place.
as in this bouse, bas been on a very high
plane, and las been very informative and
interesting. Certain points mentioned during
the debate have struck me as being significant.
Some bonourable gentlemen who have spoken
Lave said that the first of July is net recognized to any great extent in Canada as a
national holidar . and that it is net so described
in the statutes.
May I say to those honourable gentlemen
that, as applied to the province of Prince
Edward Island. the suggestion that the first
of July is net recognized as a national holiday
is net wholly truc. It is well known that the
basic industry of thit province is agriculture.
Nith fiseries taking second place. Before the
days of the motor car and tractor we were
renowned within the maritime area for the
breeding of excellent horses. both draft and
standard breds.
With the advent of the
machine age. with the consequent development of motor transport and the ose of
muotorized equipment on the farms, the business of breeding heavy horses was con-iderably reduced. But while today there is not tl
same interest manifested in horse breeding
generally that there was in the past, we bave
not lest our entlusiasm for standard bred
herses. I think it is fair to say that eut
national sumner sport is harness racing. For
many years-at least since I was a young lad
-our
racing season started on the first of
Julv. It was a national holiday on which
the whole population turned out to see what
the winter months had produced in the way
of neoc blood for the harness racing season.
This is still truc today. Every year in the
citv of Summerside. which is so well represented b' n' friend from there (Hon. Mr.
Robinson), the harness racing season opens
on the fir-t of Julv. as it bas done for many
years, and is carried on at two-week interval'
in various parts of the province during the

banourable members, ta show that aur people
know the meaning ai tbe first of July, and
take pains ta celebrate it.
I do nat wish ta prolang my remarks on
this subjeet, but may I say that as the discussian went on my personal opinion sbaped in
tbis way: I arn willing ta support the principle ai a change ai naine for the lst ai July
haliday, in the hope and belief that wben the
bill is given second reading it will go ta
committee af the whole-which I believe it
should--or ta a standing cammittee, where we
could discuss the question ai the naine by
wbich we are ta know aur national holiday.
1 personally agree with the suggestion made
by aur venerable friend irom Grandville (Hon.
Sir Thomas Chapais), that "Coniederation
Day" is the mast apprapriate name for the
first af July. That naine really brings home
ta aur people what the day means. However,
1 was much impressed witb the statemnent
made yesterday by the honaurable senator from
De Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Gauin) that, although
a strang supporter af the bill as it now is, hie
would be willing ta bave it referred ta a
cammittee, wbere the variaus opinions that
have been expressed in the bouse could be
1
considered. I also -feel it was an excellent
suggestion ai bis that there should be consultation between the federal and provincial
governments with a view ta baving aur educational institutions-especially, I suppose, aur
primary and high sebools-place greater
emphasis on the significance ai the flrst of
JuIy as a national bhiday.
It seems ta me that, caming irom a man
who favours the present bill, tbe suggested
reference ta a committee deserves mast seriaus
consideration by the Senate. The first ai July
is now known as "Daminion Day": the bill
would change the name ta "Canada Day";
we have heard a proposaI ta substitute "Confederation Day", and it may be tbat stili
ather names will he submitted. In the circumstances, if there is a motion ta refer tbe bill
ta a committee I shaîl be glad ta support it.
Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: Several bonourable senatars, particularly an this side, impressed with wbat wae said yesterday by the
bonourable member fro-m De Salaberry (Hon.
Mr. Gouin), as indeed they migbt well be,
are anxious tbat they should bave a littie time
ta consider tbe practicability oi adopting the
suggestions he put iorward. This would invalve, first, the feasibility ai referriug cither

the bill or its subjeet-matter to a committee
before second reading, and then a consideration of the personnel of tbe committee which
miglit be appainted. Needless to say, foll-owing our traditional custom Vhis would mean
consultation with the leader on the other side
as ta the willingness of bis followers to agree
to sucb procedure, and as ta the members who
might be naminated ta sit an the committee.
As honourable senators are aware, the honourable leader opposite (Han. Mr. Haig) has not
yet been able ta attend aur sessions, but I arn
hopeful that he will be bere next week. Therefore, in arder to accommodate those senators
who favour the suggested procedure, 1 intend
ta ask the acting whip an tbis side ta move
adjournment af the debate until next week.
Honourable
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE:
senators, 1 bhave listened with great interest ta
tbe remarks of the leader of the government.
I arn not prepared persanally or an behaif of
my colleagues on this side ta either apprave
or disapprove af the suggestion naw made
and wbich was set forth first of ail yesterday
by the banourable senatar fram De Salaberry.
At tbe moment I have flot been able ta give
tbe matter sufficient cansideration ta reacb a
decision. I have a second reasan for not
wisbing ta proceed further just now-the absence ai aur leader on this aide. He will, I
hope, be in bis seat on Wednesday next. Aside
from these consideratians, hawever. I agree
with the honourable leader that it would be
wise ta adjaurn the debate.
On mation of Hon. Mr. Howard, tbe debate

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, when the report of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources was presented
yesterday, it was moved that it be considered
today. Inadvertently the order for consideration was put down for tomorrow. I would
ask, with leave of the Senate, that the error
be corrected, and that the Clerk now call this
order.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon.
Mr.
senators-

DONNELLY:

Honourable

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Excuse me. Do
you not think we should get a chance to
examine this report? This is the report of a
special committee, and under rule 23, paragraph (e), two days' notice must be given
for its adoption. Yesterday upon His Honour
the Speaker asking when the report should be
considered, I said Friday.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: This is the report
of a standing committee, and only one day's
notice is required by the rules.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: When yesterday my
honourable friend from South Bruce (Hon.
Mr. Donnelly) presented the report he suggested that it be printed in Hansard. We
got our copies of yesterday's proceedings just
as we came into the chamber. I think this is
certainly a case where two days' notice is
required to give us a chance to peruse the
report thoroughly, so that we may know what
we are dealing with.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: According to the
rules, only one day's notice is required for the
adoption of the report of a standing committee. True, consideration of the report was
set down on our order paper for tomorrow,
but, as the honourable leader of the bouse
has explained, that was done inadvertently
and it is the general desire that the report
be considered now.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No one who was
here vesterday bad a chance to read the report
until the doors were opened this afterncon
and copies of Hansard were available.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The report
appears in the proceedings of yesterday.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I object to our following the practice of haphazardly rushing
business througb this house. I can give you
a record of such instances extending over the
last sixteen years. It is an absurdity to ask
us to discuss and pass upon this report now
after having had it in our hands only in the
last few minutes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I suggest
to the honourable senator from Parkdale
(Hon. Mr. Murdock) that the honourable
(Hon. Mr.
chairman
of the committee
Donnelly), or someone he nominates might
explain the report to us? Whether or not it
should be concurred in today would, I take it.
depend on the judgment of individual senators. If after hearing the explanation my
honourable friend from Parkdale feels he
would like to study the report further, I see
no reason why he should not avail himself
of his rigbt to adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Tiat will be
entirely satisfactory to me-as long as we
Io not pass the report today.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:

Carried.

The Senate proceeded to the consideration
of the report of the Standing Committee on
Niatural Resources respecting the eceonomic
value of metalliferous mines in Canada.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators, the order of reference which authorized
the Standing Cormnittee on Natural Resources to iake an investigation into the
mining industry was based on a motion intro-

JUNE 20, 1946
duced early in the session by the honourable
senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae).
I regret very much that the honourable gentleman is not able to be with us today to participate in this discussion. He was taken seriously ill last night, but I am glad to report
that his condition is somewhat improved this
morning. I am sure every member present
will join with me in the hope that the honourable gentleman will soon be able to be with
us.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The report now
before you was prepared by a subcommittee
of the standing committee. The honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
took a leading part in the preparation of the
report, and since he is much more familiar
with mining matters than I am, I have asked
him to explain it. This he has kindly consented to do.
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN: Honourable senators, as bas been stated, the order of reference to the Standing Committee on Natural
Resources provided for an inquiry into the
economie value of metalliferous mines in
Canada. The submissions made before the
committee dealt almost entirely with the
status of the gold mining industry of Canada. There were no submissions made on
behalf of the base metal mines or silver mining interests.
In the course of the committee's proceedings we heard from various representative mining organizations throughout Canada, including the Ontario Mining Association, the
Western Quebec 'Mining Association, the MidWest Metal Mining Association and the British Columbia and Yukon Chamber of Mines.
There also appeared before us Dr. W. C.
Clark, Deputy Minister of Finance, and other
departmental officials. A Hansard report of
the proceedings was taken, so that there is
available to honourable senators a permanent
record of the briefs and the evidence of the
witnesses who appeared before the committee.
May I summarize briefly what was said and
the conclusions which the committee came to
as a result of the submissions? Although there
were no submissions on behalf of the base
metal industry, it appeared that the base metal
rmines and the gold mining industry of Canada
have been a very fruitful source of income
and employment for the people of Canada.
For instance, over a period from 1907 to 1944
the value of the production amounted to
some six billion dollars, and of that tota.
approximately two and a half billion was the
result of gold mining. In the gold mining
industry a number of problems developed and

371

became very acute during the war years. The
shortage of labour and materials, along with
the restrictions put upon the use of essential
supplies, caused a substantial reduction in
the output of the producing mines. For
instance, in 1941 gold production in Canada
amounted to about $200,000,000; in 1944 it
In order to
was a little over $100,000,000.
achieve even this lower production during the
war it was necessary for the producing mines
to do certain things not in accordance with
sound business practice. Upon studying the
reports of these mines one will observe that
their ore reserves have been considerably
diminished; which means that during the war
period, due to shortage of labour, it was not
possible to continue the milling operations
and development programmes necessary to
maintain a number of years' supply of ore
ahead of the milling process. It is generally
understood that good business practice requires
ore reserves for about five years ahead of
milling. In some instances it will be found
that the mines are down to two and even to
one year's supply.
While labour is becoming a little more
plentiful it is very expensive, and of course a
considerable amount of working capital is
required for the development work which does
not bring immediate returns in the mining
These problems have occurred
operation.
during a period of high taxation, and at a
time when there was not only an increase in
the cost of labour available, but the threat of
a further increase. To illustrate what these
difficulties mean to the mines, we were given
figures from the Department of Mines for the
province of Quebec to show that in 1944 the
net profit per ton of ore milled was 62 cents.
Figures were supplied with respect to mining
operations in Ontario indicating that the net
profit per ton of ore in 1944 was $1.94, and it
was pointed out that, if the threatened
increase in wages materialized, the additional
cost per ton of mining operations in Ontario
would amount to about $2. Comparing this
with the net profit of $1.94 in 1944, one will
appreciate that the problem facing the gold
mining industry in Canada is a very serious
one.
May I now go on to show the importance
of the mining industry? The committee was
told, for instance, that in 1941 the gold produced in Ontario was worth $123,000,000. Of
this amount some $42,000,000 was paid out in
wages; two and a half million was spent on
transportation; and an infinite variety of other
things entered into the picture to such an
extent that some witnesses estimated that one
miner working in a gold mine supports or
provides employement in other industries in

SENATE
Canada for, at least four persons. It must be
realized also that the farming communities in
the mininýg areas are supported substantially
by reason of t.he requirements of the miners
and their families. The various materials
used in connect ion with mining operationýs and
whichi provide indirect employment are miiiing equipment, cars, locomotives, electrical
equipment, chemnical supplies, tools and power.
Eery conceivable type of material produced
in Canada in some forma or other enters into
the requirements of the gold mining industry.
Wc must not assuîme that gold is where you
find it, and that you simply dig it ont of the
ground. As a matter of fact gold mining is a
vcry difficuit and expensive operation. We
have been told that only approximatoly onetenthi of one per cent of the properties on
which devclopment work is donc ultimately
hecome pioduîcing mines; but the prespecting,
exploriog and developing provide a very considerable amount of employmcnt, and the
expenditures mode on Iliat work and on the
materials consumcd in the course of it are te
the gencral advantage of the people and the
industries of Canad.a.
Investors who put risk capital into sucli a
speculative enterprise require some assurance
that after the property îeaches the stage of
production thcrc will bo some likelihood of
a reasonable return on thle money expcnded,
an(l a possibulity of restoration of some part
of the capital. After ail, once gold is mincd
it is gone forever. It is a xvasting asset. One
senses the problemns involvedi in the mining
industry, not only as regards wlîat is fair
in the way of taxation but wbat is reasonablo
as a depletion allowanco and for depreciation,
and the extent to wbicb the mining industry
can be encouraged to expand in Canada.
We know as a matter of fact that tiiere is
ne fiee market for gold in Canada; that tbe
gold mincd bore is acquired by the government. As a resuit of its production the benefit of a considerablo amount of employment
accrues to the people of Canada. A second
great benefit tliot this country enjoys arises
from the fact that gold bias been a very valuable isset during the war ycars when we hiad
to mncet our foreign exchange requirements
and mnaintain international trade balances.
Beyond that it is even more important in
relation to sucb measures as tlîe Bretton
Woods Agreement wbich we discussed last
faîl, by xvbicb we were required to make
some contribution in the formn of gold to the
international clearing bouses.

During the war easa considerable amount
of diamond drilling and developmenf xvork
was done on varions propertios.
Man 'y of
these holdings are now in a position te become
produîcing mines; but it was the opinion of
the witnesses-and they were mon experienced in the mining industry that in these
tiînes, w itlî the buirdcn of inereased costs and
prescrnt taxes, it is difficult te bring in producing mines witli any hope for vorv successful eperation. It will ho appreciated that
a groat many of these properties yicld lowgrade ore, and that the margin between sueces,,fîl and unsuccessful operation is vory
small.
If the ceat of mining is increased
directly by wages and materials, or indirectly
by the maintenance cf the ordinary corporation income tax rates, the result will simply
hc te convert into wase rock muchi of the
low-grade ore wlîîch otlîerwise would ho

of the proceedings bofore the eemmittoe.
The problemn of your commiftee was wliat
could and should ho done in order te maintain and encourage thle gold mining
industr '
of Canada. Well, wve looked bock ovor the
past and in former statutory provisions found
precedents for whaf, we now recommend. One
of the reconîrnenda tions is. thaf for the firot
three fiscal periods fromn the commencement
of production new mines shaîl ho exempt
from corporation income tax. That is net a
new proposaI at ail, because tbat very provision was un section 89 of the Income Tax Act
from 1936 until the end cf 1942. Strange as
ie may seem, althougli that provision ceased
te bave ans- effeet after Decomber 31, 1942,

years of its production it would net bave te
pay nny excess profits tax, but weuld ho sub-

JUNE 20, 1946
ject to the normal income tax of 40 per cent?
Needless to say, few if any new mines came
into production during the war years.
The first recommendation of the committee
was that the provisions of section 89 of the
Income War Tax Act be re-enacted so that
the income of new mines coming into production after a date to be fixed by the minister
shall, for a period of three years thereafter,
be exempt from corporation income tax.
Then we added a recommendation that for
the following two fiscal periods the rate of
tax on these new mines be 50 per cent of the
rate generally applicable to corporation income at that time.
The purpose of this combined recommendation I will now try to make clear. In the
development of a mine the company's capital
is spent in prospecting, exploring, diamond
drilling and proving the commercial value of
the ore. Usually by the time a mine gets
to the stage of proving that it bas commercial ore, it finds that its capital has been
exhausted in the process, so money bas to be
borrowed in order to provide for the construction of a mill. Back in 1936 it seemed
to the income tax authorities and to the
Minister of Finance-owing largely, I assume,
to representations of the then Minister of
Mines and Resources-that new companies,
having expended their capital in proving that
they had mines which could be profitably
operated if the necessary money were available, should be allowed an opportunity to
build up working capital out of their earnings. It was found that after coming into
production a new mine, while maintaining its
development programme, needed three years
in which to accumulate sufficient working
capital to provide for successful operation
thereafter. Your committee gave full consideration to the country's requirements for
revenue, but it also fully considered the contribution which the gold mining industry
makes to the welfare of the country as a
whole by furnishing this very necessary mineral that enters so largely into our business
relations with other countries.
Another recommendation in respect of new
mines is that the depletion allowance should
be at the rate of 50 per cent. A mine is a
wasting asset, which fact the government bas
recognized in the past by permitting a depletion allowance to be deducted from the company's earnings before arriving at the amount
of taxable income. From 1917 up till 1933 the
rate of depletion allowance was 50 per cent,
but since 1934 the rate bas been only 33ý per
cent. For example, if in the fiscal period a
mine earned $600,000, it would deduct one
third of that to get the amount subject to taxation. Prior to 1934 the depletion allowance
63268-26

375

on shareholders' dividends from producing
mines was 50 per cent; but from that year to
the present time it has been 20 per cent. In
the light of representations made, the committee felt that mines would be helped to
operate successfully, that more employment
would be provided and that the country as
a whole would benefit if mining companies
were once again permitted a depletion allowance of 50 per cent, and we have recommended
that this rate be restored.
We also recommend that new mines should
not be required to charge depreciation during
the proposed three years of exemption from
corporation income tax. We were told that
even when mines were entitled to this exemption, namely, from 1936 to 1942, it was
the practice of the income tax department to
compel them to write off depreciation at the
rate of 15 per cent annually. That is, during
the three years in which they paid no income
tax they would, no matter how small the earnings, write off 45 per cent of the value of their
plant, equipment and other property. The
committee felt that a new mine in any year
when it was exempt from corporation income
tax should not have to charge depreciation at
an amount greater than the year's earnings.
If in the three years when you have to write
off 45 per cent of the value of your property
for depreciation your earnings equal, say, only
30 per cent of that value, obviously you have
lost the right to set off the other 15 per cent
against income. We thought it was well to
direct the attention of the proper authorities
to this matter.
There is one other recommendation in
respect of new mines. From 1936 to 1942 the
department permitted new mines a tax-free
period of six months, known as a run-in or
tuning-up period, preceding the three years'
exemption allowed under section 89. It was
recognized that it takes six months to coordinate mining and milling operations, to get
the ore flowing, to fill the circuit and actually
commence the production of gold. The committee recommends a return to the past practice of not charging a corporation income tax
during this tuning-up period.
All the recommendations to which I have
referred so far are in connection with new
mines. The committee also considered in what
way producing mines could be assisted. From
annual reports published in the papers of the
last few days honourable members will have
noted that well-established producing mines
all show decreased earnings. One reason is
that during the war they exhausted their ore
reserves to some extent and were not able
to replace them, so now they are spending
money on development work, trying to block

out more ore. This is a programme that will
have to be carried on for two or three years
before the mines get back to the sound,
business-like footing on which they were before
the war.
There are two remaining recommendations.
All the gold produced in Canada has to be
minted at Ottawa, and the government has a
series of charges which yield a profit on the
service. The committee felt and recommended
that these charges should not exceed the actual
cost.
Our final recommendation is that the services of the Department of Mines and
Resources be expanded in the interest of the
gold mining industry, so as to provide more
assistance to prospectors through geological
surveys and aerial mapping. This recommendation is based on submissions made to us
by the Prospectors and Developers Association. It was represented to us that such
expanded services would result« in the saving
of a good deal of time and money in locating
and
exploring
commercially
worth-while
properties.
Now, a last word. It may appear that there
is an attempt to have this report adopted by
the Senate in haste, but I can assure the
house that there is no such desire on the
part of any member of the committee. The
position is this. The budget is to be brought
down next week, and it was felt, both by the
mining industry and certain departments of
the government, that the committee's recommendations. with the supporting data indicating the position of the mining industry, should
get to the proper authorities in time to be
acted upon for budget purposes. J feel all
the more strongly that that is a good reason,
since in discussions that I have had recently
in certain circles not too far distant from those
in w'hich budget decisions are made it has
appeared that there have been no subaissions
in relation to mining other than those presented to the Senate. I have given this
rather lengthy explanation today in the hope
that honourable members, if they found it
sufficiently clear and complete, would come
to a decision that would facilitate getting the
committee's recommendation. to a place where
they might be reflected in the forthcoming

budget.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Would the henourable
gentleman allow me a question? Are the
recommendations concerned exclusively with
gold mines, or do they relate to all metalliferous mines?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The recommendations
deal with gold mîîining. foi the reason that all
the submissions to the committee were made
Hon. Ir. HAYDEN.

on behalf of the gold mining industry. I
think I can understand why no submissions
were made in respect of base metals. and perhaps I should say a word or two about this.
There is a fiee market for base metals, and
therefore the price is determined by supply
and demand.
There is, however, no free
market for gold. I suppose that if it were
possible to have eue. many of the problems
and difficulties I Lave mentioned would cease
to have even an academic interest.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Would the committee's
receommendations with re-pect to ligltening
the tax burden so as to increase the amount
of working capital apply with equal force
to other classes of mines than gold mines?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes. I have been
talking about depletion allowances in respect
of gold mines. There used to be a difference
between the depletion allowances in respect
of base metal mines and those in respect of
gold mines, the government having drawn a
distinction of which apparently the industry
approved. For instance, from 1917 to 1928
the depletion allowance for base metal mines
was 25 per cent, whereas for gold mines it
was 50 per cent. But frenm 1934 to date the
depletion allowance in respect of base metal
mines and gold mines alike bas been 331 per
cent. With the qualification that there is a
frec market for base metals but not for gold,
what is said un the committee's report in
relation to the economie value of the gold
mining industry to the country would apply at
least as forcibly to the base metals mining
industry.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: Why should dividends from gold mines be taxable on only
50 per cent of their value, and thus be placed
in a preferred position as compared with
other dividends, which are subject to full
taxation?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
I am sorry that I
did not make myself quite clear. The conmittee does not recommend that shareholders'
dividends fron gold mines be entitled to a
depletion allowance of 50 per cent. I simply
pointed out by way of information that since
1934 the amount of depletion allowance to
which shareholders have been entitled in
respect of dividends from producing gold
nines is 20 per cent. In the report we do not
deal with the position of shareholders at all,
but we recommend that in arriving at the
amount of income to be taxed, mining conpanies be allowed to deduct 50 per cent of
their annual earnings by way of compensation
for the wasting character of their assets. In

that way you enable them to maintain a working capital position and to continue developing their properties.

RESEARCH COUNCIL, BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
eading of Bill 154, an Act to amend the
Research Council Act.
He said: Honourable senators, 1 would ask
,lhe hunourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) to explain this bill.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, Bill No. 154, xvbich it is my
privilege to nttempt to explain, is an act to
amend the Researchi Council Act. The due
performance of this task makes necessary
some comments with respect to the original
act, and as to why it is necessary to amend it.
It will also be necessary to say something
about the Research Council itself, its accomplisliments and its history.
In 1915, while the first Great War was in
progress, and the results of German researclh
were no longer available to the world. t1llIon. Mr. ASELTINT'

British government estabiihed a committee
of the Privy Council of Great Britain on
scientifie and industrial research, together
with an advisory council. The purpose of
this committec and its advisory body was not
primariiy directed to the solving of war
problems, though that was no doubt in mmnd,
but rather, with a long view, to the promotion of scientifle work in the post-war period.
The British government sent a communication to each of the British dominions informing them of the action taken and suggesting
similar local organizations. Acting under this
stimulus, the Canadian government in 1916,
appointed a committee of the Canadian Privy
Council, supported by an advisory council,
on scientifle and industrial research, and tbus
laid the foundation in Canada for the organized study of scientific problems by thousands
of educated experts in varinus fields of industry and science. The record of achievement
of the National Research Council in the tbirty
years which. have followed is se tremendous
that it is beyond my powers to even summarize them. I understand that a mere outline of what it bias accomplished fuils ten
v olumes. One is tempted, however, to make
some few references to the Research Couneil's
war achievements, as they are mucb ton spectacular and interesting to pass entirely unnoticed.
When the rvcent war broke out there waz.
in operation one National Research Laboratory, liouscd in a modemn building erectcd
seven years previousiy on Susse~x Street in
Oiitawa. During the, war as many as twentyone ýotheýr ]aboratories were established ail
across Canada from Halifax to Vancouver.
Tbey were devoted to the solution of many
problems of vast importance. For instance.
there were the large laboratories in Montreai
working in connection with the atomnic enýergy
plant at Chalk River, the cold weather station
at Winnipeg *for the development of jet
engines, the radar laboratories near Ottawa,
and the naval research stations on both coasts.
There were at times as many as 280 prolects
in progress in thirty laboratories. including
t'hose of the universities, the provinces and
private companc-s.
Some of the subi ects deait with were
chcmistry, as aýppied to explosives and
chemnical warfare; miedicine, as appiied to
high fiving and biologicai warfare; phvysies.
as aplied to tise now famous proximity fuse,
radio and radar. predictors, gun-sigbts, antimine and anti-submarine devices, buoyant
cables and plastic armour, the magnetie
neutralization of sbips to counter the magnetic
mine. and maux'
others. Canada today
marches in the front hune among nations i n

JUNE 25, 1946
connection with nuclear research, and at Chalk
River posse.sses equipment to be found in no
other country in the world, unless it be the
United States. In that regard Canada has
stepped into the very forefreut of scientific
development, to the great credit, of vur ýceuntry, and to cur material benefit as well as
our persenal pride.
In the modern world, a -machine and ehemical age, keen minds, sound knowledge and
controlled imagination are more important
than strong backs. So we have been spending .money fairly freely and have been
devoting the energies of the best minds in
this country to those difficuit, problems of
science and of industry the solution of which
have made and will continue te make for
pregress in practically ail fields of human
endeavour.
But let us return to the Research Ceuncil.
The original government action was by erder
in ouncil. This was formalized by an act
of parliament assented te, on the 29th of
August, 1917, Chapter 20 of the Statutes of
Canada of 1917.
It is a very simple act
appointing what is called "The Honorary
Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research." This body consisted of ten unpa.id
or voluntary members, and an administrative
chairman a'ppointed by the Governor in
Council on the recommendation of the subcommitte-e of cabinet and te be paid a
salary out of money annually appropriated by
parliament. This act served the purpose until
1924, when it was replaced by the present
act, Chapter 177 of the Revised Statutes of
Canada 1927. which made the coiuceil a body
cerporate with power to employ staff and
establish lahoratories.
These acts did not give to the council any
m-onopoly on research in Canada. 1 need
only mention the research achievements of
the Department cf Agriculture in the development of Marquis and other varieties of
wheat, without which Canada's wheat crops
could not have been se markedly successful.
Research is aise carried on by the Department
of Mines and Resources and by the Departmnent cf Fisheries, as well as by the provinces,
by th2e universities and by private companies.
With ail these research agencies the Research
Gouncil is in close collaboration. There is ceoperatien and littie or no overlapping. This
is due to, the central authority here, which
is recognized in ail the provinces as the leadîng authority in these matters, being se well
organized and subdivided that activities in
this cennectien are carried on in such a way
that ne two men are doing the same task at
any one time.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Does that supervisior
imply contrel by the Research Council ovei
the research activities in the varieus departments of the geveroiment at Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Distinctly ne, and
there has been ne attempt by the council
to boss the scientists of other departments.
1 suppose there is always a certain amount of
jealousy between men working in the same
field-what is known as professional jeaiousy;
but these men with se large a field te cever
have tee m-uch to do te quarrel among
themselves. What the Research Ceuncil bas
atteinpted te do is te direct in a free and easy
way the activities ef other branches. Since
the council is in control of such a large fund
of information, the result of years of research
here and abroad, its advice as to the type cf
work which other bodies undertake cannot be
disregarded; and I knew as a fact that other
bodies d'o ask the Research Ceuncil for ad-vice
as te, the particular phases of problems te
which they sheuld bend their energies.
By the present act the Henerary Advisery
Council fer Scientific and Industrial Research
was increased te, not mere than fifteen persons,
te be appeinted by the Gevernor General en
the recommendation of the Privy Ceuncil
Cemmittee. The President, who is the enly
permanent and paid member cf the council,
receives remuneratien cf $15,000 per year,
whicha seems medest enough in view of the
qualifications required and the importance of
the wcrk he is to do. The other members
of the council reccive only travelling expenses
and ether expenses incurred in connectien with
the work ef the council. They are required te
meet in the city cf Ottawa at least feur times
each year.
AlI disceveries and inventions made by the
technical staff are vested in the ceuncil. In
this respect section il cf the bill reads ini
part as follews:
-shahl be made available te the public under
such conditions and paymnent cf fees er reyalties or etherwise as the Council mnay determine,
subject te the appreval of the Geverner ln
Council.
Members cf the technical and scientific staff
have very little opportunity te increase their
remuneration by the discovery ef inventions
based upen knewledge acquired while in the
goverument service.
The ceuncil, hewever,
subject te the appreval of the Governer in
Council, may pay techeical officers and ethers
working under its auspices such benuses or
royalties as in its opinion may be warranted.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Was that provisien
in the old act?
Heu. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is in the act as
it stands teday, although I do net think it

SENATE
was in the act of 1917. It bas been the rule
-icne 1924, and will continue to be the rule if
the bill now before us is passed.
The reccipts and expenditures of the council are subject to audit by the Auditor General.
This is a very important provision, without
which parliament would bave little assurance
as to the proper expenditure of considerable
sums of money handled by the council. The
president is required to present an annual
report to the council, and members of the
council must prescnt a statement of receipts
and expenditures to the Committee of the
Privy Couneil. The activities of the Research
Council must be reported to parliament, so
they are close to the elected reprasentatives
of theù peoplec who can read the reports if they
wish, and bave the capacity to understand
their bighly technical nature.
The duties of the couneil are set out in
section 6 of the bill, which reads as follows:
The council shall have charge of all matters
affecting scientific and industrial research in
Canada which may be assigned to it by the conmittee. and shall also have the duty of advisimg
the conmittec on questions of scientific and technological methods affecting the expansion of
Canadian industries or the utilization of the
natural resources of Canada.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If a university makes a
discovery, is it required to communicate it
to the council?
Hon. Mi. ROEBUCK: No. It would not
be possible for the Dominion Government to
pass an act requiring a university, which is
under the control of a province, to communicate its discoveries to a federal agency. Universities, however, are prend of their achievements, and except perhaps in time of war,
when secrecy is necessary, they boast of their
discoveries. When a university makes a discovery which justifies its existence, perhaps,
and makes its cost more acceptable, it is
widely publicized. In any event it would
have no objection to communicating its findings to the scientists of the Research Council.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I quite agree with
the remarks of the honourable senator, and
my impression is that such is the case. Universities receive grants to aid them in carrying out specific projects, and frequentiy members of the trained staff of the Research
Council are assigned to advise and assist them.
Many times the universities repay such service by assigning technically-trained men on
their staffs to assist in the investigations of
the council.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Would the honourable
senator permit me to ask a question? As I
underanid his explanation. the coincil can
investigate only such matters as are referred
to it bi the Committee of the Privv Council.
Is the ltonourable gentleman not of the opinion
that the services of a national institution of
the character of the Research Couneil should
be made available to varions other institutions in Canada? For instance, if a university
had to carry out a certain research programme
and required assistance, would it not be proper
that it should have the benefit of the services
of the National Research Council without
the formality of an Order in Conncil?
Hon. Mr. IROEBUCK.

That is the committee of the Privy Council.
The assignment is not done by order in couneil,
not by the Governor in Council, but by the
committee of the Privy Council appointed for

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Wiat machinery is proto bring about that co-operation?

vided

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not know that
there is any formal machinery.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Is it not a fact that
certain members of the council are the heads
of some of our principal universities, and that
co-ordination comes about in that way?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I think the onourable member has outlined the method bv
which co-ordination is achieved.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I should think that would
be the case if the jurisdiction of the Research
Council were not limited to such matters as
are assigned te it by order in cotncil.
I
appreciate what has just been stated by the
honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen). A certain number of members of
the Researchi Council are university men, but
all the universities in the country are not
represented. Suppose a university which is
not represented wanted access to the couneil,
would it be necessary to have an order in

council

passed foi

that

purpose?

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No. May I direct
attention of honourable senators to section 6
of the act, which reads as follows:
The couneil shall have charge of ail matters
affecting scientifie and industrial research in
Canada which nay be assigned to it by the conmittee . . .

that

purioc.

I

imagine

the

cxplanation

is

that since parliament must supply the necessary funds. or at least be responsible for them
-it dots not supply them all-there has to
be some limitation on how far the Research
Council may go. In the past this limitation
tas rested very lightly on the shoulders of the
council, and I have beard of no suggestion
from that body that its jurisdiction be
extended.

JUNE 25, 1946
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Reference is made to the
committee of council. Is that a committee of
the National Research Council or a committee of the Privy Council?
Hon. Mx. ROEBUCK: lt is the Committee
of the Privy Council on Scientific and Industrial Research. I shall shortly state just who
the members are. They are certain ministers
whose duty it is to keep in close touch with
the activities of the Research Council.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I know it is unfair to
interrupt my honourable friendHon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, that is perfectly
all right.
Hon. Mr. EULER: -,but in order to remove
what is perhaps a misapprebension, I should
like to refer to a statement that I understood
him to make, namely, that the Research Council can deal only with such matters as are
referred to it by the Committee of the Privy
Council.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is right.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I happened to be the
chairman of that committee for a number of
years, and I cannot recall that there was any
such limitation whatsoever. There is one
other senator who was also a member of that
committee, and without being critical at all
I think I can say that the committee paid very
little attention to the doings of the Research
Council. The point I want to make is that
I question very much whether in actual practice the Research Council deals only with
matters referred to it by the Committee of the
Privy Council.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I think the honourable gentleman is quite right. However, he is
speaking of practice, whereas I am speaking
of the act. The act does provide as I have
stated.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The Research Council
acted pretty much on its own initiative.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I would not suggest
that the act be changed. The honourable
gentleman says that the committee, when he
was its chairman, paid little attention to what
the Research Council was doing. That was in
times of peace. In those years the council was
a very small organization compared with what
it has become in recent years. When my
honourable friend was chairman of the committee he knew very well what the council
was doing, and he had no desire to limit its
activities; but had it proposed to do something that was not approved by his judgment,
he would have invoked the powers given him

381

by the act and told the council that it could
not do that. This provision is in the act
because the Research Council's power to spend
money on research is practically unlimited, and
must be kept within the control of the elected
representatives. I will read section 6 of the
act again.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Before the honourable senator does that, can he tell us how
much money has been spent by the council?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, I cannot give
the grand total of the money spent from the
beginning, but a little later I shall give some
indication of the very large amounts being
spent now. That is information which no
doubt will be of interest at the moment.
Section 6 says:
The council shall have charge of all matters
affecting scientific and industrial research in
Canada which may be assigned to it by the committee, and shall also have the duty of advising
the committee on questions of scientific and
technological methods affecting the expansion of
Canadian industries or the utilization of the natural resources of Canada.
It is to be noted that the council has charge
only of the matters affecting scientific and
industrial research in Canada which may be
assigned to it by the committee of the Privy
Council. I have referred to the council's
duties, and now I will refer to its powers. I
do that because it is necessary to bear in mind
just what those powers are, if one is to judge
properly of the proposed amendments. The
powers are set out in section 10 of the act.
May I emphasize that it is proposed to authorize the council to transfer some of those
powers to an incorporated company. I am
reading the powers carefully, because they
limit the jurisdiction which may be conferred.
The council may exercise the following powers:
(a) To make by-laws for the conduct of its
business;
(b) To control and direct the work of the
council through the president ...
(e) To expend such sums of money as may
be annually appropriated by parliament for the
work of the council or whieh shall have been
received by the council throughi bequest, donation
or otherwise;
(f) With the approval of the committee, to
appoint such scientific, technical and other
officers as shall be nominated by the president,
and to fix the tenure of such appointments, to
prescribe the several duties of such officers, and,
subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, to fix their remuneration.
It is to be noted that the powers I have read
are purely administrative. The council's substantive powers are set out in paragraphs (c)
and (d) of section 10 of the act as it now
stands, and in two further paragraphs to be
added to that section.
I now turn to the proposed amendments,
which come, by the way, from the Research

382

SENATE

Council itsclf rather than from the Privy
Council Committee or from the Department
of Munitions and Supply, as some have supposed, due to sponsorship in the Commons by
that Minister.
Section 2 of the bill adds a clause to section
3 of the act giving legislative status to the
Committee of the Privy Council on Industrial
and Scientific Research, which is unobjectionable. This committee, of which the Honourable C. D. Howe is chairman, is not inactive,
as some have supposed. It meets frequently
-three or four times last year-and actually
directs the policy and activities of the Council.
It is composed of the Ministers of (1) Reconstruction and Supply (chairman), (2) Trade
and Commerce; (3) Mines and Resources;
(4) National Defence; (5) National Health
and Welfare; (6) Financo; (7) Agriculture, and
(8) Labour.
I come now to section 3. In 1939, prior to
the war, the Rescarch Council had a staff of
approximately 300, and even at that time the
president was overloaded. He is necessarily
a man of science, but as the one full-time
menber of the council, paid, and resident in
Ottawa, all activities, both business and scientific, channelled through him. During the war,
the calls for scicntific progress were so great
that the staff increased from 300 before the
war to approximately 2.000 at its close. This
need not astonish any honourable members,
for I an told that the TUnited States, during
the four years it was engaged in the war, spent
over ten billion dollars on research.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I understand that there
is a yearly report of the Rescarch Council's
work. Would that report cover the money
spent on scientific research since the beginning of the war, and the narnes and salaries of
the 2,000 employecs? If net, could the honourable member, or the leader of the government,
supply the information?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: J do net think it is
given in such detail as one might find in the
public accounts, but -the information is available and I have no doubt the leader of the
government can produce it. Furthermore, I
expect this bill will be referred to one of our
standing committees, in which event the
officials of the council will doubtless be called
before the committee and questioned with respect to their expenditures and achievements.
Of course, I realize that the ten billion dollars was not spent entirely by the federal government of the United States. It is a rough
estimate of expenditures on research work by
all authorities in that country.
The Research Council's figures are much
more modest, though it must be borne in mind
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

that research is being carried on in other
departments of the federal government, and by
the provinces and the universities. Honourable
members wdll observe that the council's figures
show a commendable growth. The original
act was passed in 1924.' In 1928-29 the council's budget was $323,366.56.
The main
research building was formally opened in 1932,
and the council's budget for the fiscal year
1932-33 was approximately $450,000.
The
professional staff numbered 57.
For the
fiscal year before the war, 1938-39, the council's
budget was approximatelv $900,000, and there
was a staff of something less than 300 persons.
The war brought about a tremendous expansion of the council's activities. During
the last vear of the war the council was supporting directly a staff of 1,600 persons and
indirectly another 400, or 2.000 in all. The
total expenditures were eight times those of
1938-39, or nearly 7,000,000. The estimates
for the current fiscal year are $6,378,000, quite
apart from expenditures on atomie energy
in the Challk River and Eldorado enterprises.
The council is operating 17 laboratories on
Sussex street in Ottawa, in Montreal, Chalk
River,
Winnipeg,
Saskatoon
and
other
places. There are plans for the building and
establishment of others. such, for instance, as
a new radio and radar laboratory at Ottawa.
There are about 50 associate research committees and 100 subcommittecs composed of
Canada's

foremost

scientists,

engineers

and

indu strialists.
The council has a large scientific library and
publishes a journal of research. It also awards
post-graduate scholarships and makes grants
in aid of research.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
universities?

Are those

made

to

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Mostly to universities, but I do not think they are limited
in that way.
Grants can be made-and
probably have been made-to research by
private companies. But that would only be
incidental; for the most part the awards are to
universities and to university men.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: How are these advisory
committees constituted.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They are organized
on the invitation of the president of the Research Council, and are the outgrowth of a
very large number of conferences, uîsually
springing out of some activity then in progress.

Organizations

of

this kind

do

much

work because the accomplishment of one
enterprise always opens up avenues for other
enterprises, and so further bodies or committees are organized.

JUNE 25, 1946
The council bas offices in London and
Washington for the exchange of scientific information-not exactly a spy system, but
with the weather eye open for any scientific
develoýpment in allied countries.
The council has a considerable revenue
apart from grants by parliament. In the six
years ending April 1, 1946, the revenue of
the Research Council for services rendered
amounted to $4,360,997.13.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The moneys received
for those services are, I understand, to be
added to what the council receives from the
government?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They are expended
by the council and audited by the Auditor
General, but they do flot become part of the
consolidated revenue fund.
In addition to the figure I have mentioned,
other goverament departments paid to the
council for work on departmental problems
the sum of $6.600,000. So as you see--perhaps
under somewhat special circumstances--the
earnings of the council over that period of
six years were in the neighbourhood of
$10,000,000.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Which departments
were served?
Hon. Mr. TROEBUCK: Agriculture, Fisheries, and Munitions and Supply, for the most
part.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Why is the council
allowed to retain that money?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Because the council
spent a good deal of the money in earning it.
The $10,000,000 is flot profit; it is payment
for serviccs-and services cost money. So the
council finances its activities.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Why should flot the
money ha paid into the consolidated revenue
fund?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is a matter
for judgment.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Has flot that money
to be re-voted, the same as in the case of the
Post Office Department?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No, it is flot revoted, and there are reasons why it is flot.
In the early stages of the war a gif t of
81,300,000 came to the council froma private
mnterests, with no strings attached and without direction as to how it should be spent.
That sum enabled the council to, hranch out
freely into varions uines of endeavour. Research
is largely a combination of sound judgment
and knowledge, together with controlled
imagination. Exclude imagination from the
laboratory, and research gets nowhere. Brul-

383

liant discoveries coma about only when men
are free to work. So that gift of $1,300,000
was tha finest gesture made towards the industrial expansion in our country during the war
years.
Something should be said about the carrying on of the business of this council on
money that it earns and is pcrmitted to
spend. 1 see no objection to this practice,
and would flot like to see the funds channelled
through the consolidated revenue fund. Suoh
moneys dû not come from the public purse
in the first instance; thay are earned by the
concil itself, and parliament has no responsibility to the taxpayer to guard them, as it
would guard moneys from other sources.
However I do flot speak with authority on
that subject.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does the coundil
give a full accounting of what it does with the
money?
Hon. Mr. ROEBIJCK: It accounts for every
cent. Thase accounts are audited by the
Auditor General. They appear in the report
which must be prescnted to the Committee of
the Couincil; there fore they are open to
parliament.
The council received a contribution of
$1,346,000 from the Sir Frederick Banting
Fund, and by work peirformed for that fund
earned an additional $363,000. For development work on radar Research Enterprises paid
over to the council $1,900,000. That amount
was flot retained by the council, but was
voluntarily paid over to the consolidated
revenue fund. If the Research Council is to
spend that moiney it must be voted.
Industry during the recent years bas become
science--conscious and what the Research Council did for war enterprises it will now perform
for the arts of peace.
The bill proposes to, apýpoint two more permanent ,paid officials: a vice-prasident (administration) and a vice-president (scientific),
and tha-t the membership of the council be
increased from fifteen to twenty. The president
is to, remain the chief executive officer, having
supervision over the work of the staff, both
administrative and scientifie. The vice-prasidcnt (administrative), as might be expected,
will have charge of ail matters relating to
achministration; the vice-president (scientifia)
will have charge of the laboratories of the
council, and both officers will, be subjeat to the
control and direction of the prasident.
It is further proposed that there shahl be an
executive committee consisting of the presidcnt, the two vice-presidents and at least three
other members to be selected by the Research

SENATE
Council. The executive committee will exercise
the powers of the council and will submit the
minutes of its proceedings to the council. It
is obvious that a committee of fifteen members, resident in all parts of Canada and
meeting only four times a year-frequently to
deal with matters of a secret nature--require
soime small committee to represent them. The
members of the committee should live in the
vicinity of Ottawa, should be specially
qualified for the office, and should be able to
devote their constant attention to the activities of the council.
I come now to a proposed amendment
which calls for careful examination, both as
to what it does and does net contain, so that
it may be judged upon its merits free from
the popular misconceptions with respect te
its implications.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I interrupt the
The bill provides
honourable gentleman?
that each member of the council shall receive
travelling and other expenses in connection
with the work of the council. Is the word
"expense" defined under the act?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It is not defined
under the act, but I think experience tas provided a definition. The council bas been in
operation for a long time, and a certain
routine has been established and passed upon
from time to time by the Auditor Ceneral. J
presume that will continue in the future.
It is proposed to empower the Research
Council, with the approval of the Governor in
Council, to procure the incorporation of companies under Part I of the Companies Act for
the purpose of exercising such powers as the
council shall direct, and as are conferred upon
it by paragraphs (c) and (d) of section 10 of
the act and the two additional paragraphs in
section 7 of the bill. It is important to observe
that the powers of the proposed company or
companies are limited to those conferred upon
the couneil, so that anything which can be
done by a company incorporated by the council can also be done by the council itself. The
council cannot increase its powers by the
expedient of incorporating a company. The
provisions with respect to companies do not
alter what can be donc, but how it can be
donc. In other words, the proposed amendment does not affect the weight or the number of the council's eggs, but only the basket
in which they are placed.
Let us examine the powers of the council
which may be delegated to a company. In
this respect careful attention should be paid
to two paragraphs appearing in section 10 of
the present act, and two which are added by
the bill, because they contain the powers
which may be conferred upon a company.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

Section 10, paragraph (c) of the act reads as
follows:
To undertake in such way as nay be deemned
advisable:
(i) to promote the utilization of the natural
resources of Canada.
(ii) researches with the object of iiproving
the technical processes and inethods used in the
industries of Canada, and of discovering processes and inethods which miay proiote the expansion of existing or the developmnent of new
industries,
(iii) researches with the view of utilizing the
waste products of said industries.
(iv) the investigation and determination of
standards and imethods of mneasurements, incuiding length, voluie, weight, mass capacity, time.

heat, light, electricity. magnetism and other
forms of energy; and the deternination of physical constants and the fundamental properties
of matter,
(v) the standardization and certification of
the scientifie and teehnical apparatus and instruients for the government service and for
use in the industries of Canada. and the deterinination of the standards of quality of the mtaterials used in the construction of public works
anid of the supplies used in the varions branches
of the government service,
(vi) the investigation and standardization, at
the request cf any of the industries of Canada.
of the naterials which are or inay he used in,
or of the products of, the industries making
such a request.
(vii) researches, the object of whici is to inprove conditions in agriculture.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Who may be directors
of these companies, and how are they appointed?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They are appointed
by the Research Council, I think with the
stpervision of the conmittee, and perhaps by
order in council.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: It says:
The council imay, with the approval of the
Governor in Council, . . .
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is it, "with the
approval of the Governor in Council." The
power "to

undertake

.

.

.

to promote

the

utilization of the natural resources of Canada"
is a big order, and I have no knowledge of
wbat it means beyond what it says. The
remainder of the section is but the work of a
bureau of standards and of research laboratories.
The other clause to which I referred, paragraph (d) of section 10 of the present act,
gives the council power:
.To have charge of. and direction or supervision
over, the researches which inay be undertaken,
under conditions to be determined in each case.
iby or for single industrial firms. or by such
organizations or persons, as muay desire to avail
thiemiselves of the facilities offered for this purpose.

That is, power to engage in research for other
persons or organizations.

JUNE 25, 1946

The new powers are contained in paragraphs
(h) and (i) added to section 10 of the act.
The first of these is:
(h) To carry on experimental and development work and manufacturing with respect to
the matters referred to in paragraphs (c) and
(d) of this section so as to render the processes, methods or products to which the said
matters relate more available and effective in
useful arts and manufacturing and for scientific
purposes and otherwise.
I take it that "to carry on experimental and
development work and manufacturing" means
to establish and operate pilot plants. Inventors have frequently found to their disappointment and cost that an idea alone is not of
much value until it is tested in practice.
There is a large gap between the conception
of an idea or even its development in a
laboratory and its final utilization in a manuThe Minister of
facturing establishment.
Reconstruction and Supply declares that it is
the government's intention to engage in manufacturing, not for production but only for
research and experimental purposes.
During the war the council designed and
manufactured numerous radar sets for Research
Enterprises. These were, however, merely pilot
models, and quantity manufacturing was carried on from that point by Research Enterprises.
The second new power of the council is supplementary to the proposed provision of
subsection (1) of section 11, that inventions by
a member of the staff of the council or a company, and all rights with respect thereto, shall
be vested in the council. I refer to Varagraph
(i) of section 10, which authorizes the council:
To license or sell or otherwise grant or make
available to others Canadian or other patent
rights or any other rights, vested in or owned or
controlled by the council, to or in respect of
discoveries and inventions and improvements in
processes, apparatus or machines, and to receive royalties, fees and payments therefor.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: What will become of
that money?
Hon. Mr. EULER: They will spend it as
they like.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It will be a revolving
fund. That is for the consideration of this
house, but I would ask that judgment be suspended until I have given as full an explanation as I can of this bill and of the one which
follows it on our order paper, namely, Bill 155,
an Act respecting the operation of Government Companies.
I have enumerated the powers of the council at some length, because the amending act
would give to the Research Council the authority to incorporate as many companies as it
sees fit, and to transfer to such companies

385

authority to exercise the powers conferred
upon the council by section 10, paragraphs
(c), (d), (h) and (i).
We are assured by the Minister of Reconstruction and Supply that it is not intended to
exercise the authority thus broadly. The only
company now in contemplation is one to
handle the council's patents and patent rights,
a task which, though requiring a great deal of
time and attention, is not scientific research
but merely business, and one that may be
conveniently segregated into the hands of a
special company.
In connection with patents, let me make a
statement which I think is well worthy of
attention. While the council owns or controls
or has interest in a very large number of
patents, its primary purpose is the development of industry, not its obstruction. The
royalties demanded are as low as the council
considers reasonable. What I wish honourable
members particularly to note is that the council has never given an exclusive licence for use
of a Canadian patent, nor has it ever sold a
Canadian patent. The council retains at all
times the right to licence somebody else if the
licensee either fails to carry on his operations
or is slothful or unreasonable in exercising his
patent rights. The reason the council has
never sold a Canadian patent is that it desires
to retain control in order to see that every
patent is used and that none is abused for the
purposes of cartels or monopolies.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That is, patents developed by the Research Council only?
The council
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No.
comes into possession of patents in many ways.
I myself have personal knowledge of the control of some patents for the making of rubber.
A rubber company desired to get the assistance
of the Research Council for the purpose of
scientific investigation, so it entered into an
agreement to transfer to the council control
of certain patents in return for the couneil's
research work upon them.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: A matter of contract.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: A matter of contract. I am referring to it only by way of
pointing out that there are various means
by which the council may acquire control of
patents other than by taking out patents on
its own inventions. I am referring only to
Canadian patents. Such considerations as I
have mentioned do not apply to foreign
patents, which are dealt with on a purely
business basis.
The advantages of transferring to an incorporated company the control and operation

386

SENATE

of the council's patent business, the buying
and selling, the constant reviewing and maintaining of patents, are several-fold.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: More powers than these
are to be transferred.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, and I have
referred to them at some length. I am
speaking now of the patent business only.
The advantages of transferring this to an
incorporated company are:
1. The council management will be relieved
of a heavy and exacting burden, and thus
will be able to devote more time to its
research functions.
2. As the company must produce periodical
reports, including a balance sheet, and capital
and operating accounts, it will be much casier
to check up on the management of this particular function than it is now when it is
mixed in with all of the council's other
activities.
Hon. Mr.
company?

DUPUIS:

This

is

a

crown

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The phraseology in
the bill is "government company".
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: With the government
holding all the stock.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Except the qualifying shares of the directors.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is this a method of
giving the government power to incorporate
numerous government corporations?
lon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No. That subject
will be discussed at length in connection with
the next bill. This bill gives the government
the power to incorporate as many companies
as you like for the control, ownership, management, and so on, of the particular fune,ions of the Research Council, and none
>her.

Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Under the Companies
Act.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Under the Companies Act.
3. Business men are very familiar with company organization and are used to carrying
on business under the provisions of the Companies Act, so that the assistance of skilled
directors is thus obtainable.
The company will be subject to the provisions of the Government Companies Operation Act, which is designed to subject it to
parliamentary scrutiny. It will be required to
make annual reports to the minister, and
through him to parliament.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

Its accounts will be audited by the Auditor
General.
Such companies will not be under the Civil
Service Commission, and accordingly a system
of superannuation is provided.
In addition to the patents company mentioned, there are two other projects which it is
expected will be turned over to the Research
Council for operation. The first is the Chalk
River project, which involves the administration of an industrial plant and town site, the
purchase of raw materials, the operation of a
manufacturing process and the sale of the
product. The Chalk River project is a combination of scientific and business activities.
Tho' scientific phases make it a fit subject for
Research Council supervision, and the business functions can very properly be handled
by a company under a board of directors. At
the moment, Chalk River is being operated
by the contractors who built the plant. When
the project has been thoroughly tested it may
be turned over to the Research Council. No
decision bas as yet been made.
'he second project is Eldorado Mining and
Refining, Limited, which is concerned with
the production of materials for use at Chalk
River and'at similar establishments in other
countries. These activities are already being
carried on by a board of directors in corporate
organization. It may be turned over to the
Rescarch Council, which will simply mean that
the directors will report to the council, and
through the minister to parliament, instead of
as at present to the minister direct. The
change will bring the scientific experience of
the council to the supervision of the company's highly scientific operations. Therefore
it is thought to be worth while.
This completes my explanation of the bill,
but its consideration is dependent in very
large measure upon the view that may be
taken by honourable members of the next
bill on the order paper, governing the administration of crown or government companies.
The two bills are so closely linked together
that I trust opinion with regard to this particular crown company power will be suspended until we have also considered the
provisions with regard to the control of these
companies and the provisions incidental to
that control.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard, the debate
was adjourned.

JUNE 25, 1946
GOVERNMENT COMPANIES
OPERATION BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 155, an Act respecting the
operation of Government Companies.
H1e said: Honourable inembers, as the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) bas said, this bill is very closely
allied with the preceding bill, and I have
asked him to undertake its explanation also.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: I hope,
honourable senators, I shahl not tire you out
in the process. An explanation of a bill of
this kind is worthless unless it is fairly complete. This must be my apo:logy for the time
1 have already taken on the preceding bill.
1 should say by way of introduction that
this hill evidently requires a statement not
only of what it is but also of what it is not.
It will clear the ground if I tell you that it
is not an act for the incorporation of government companies. There is nothing in the bill
which even suggests such a ýpower; it is
concerned only wjth. regulating the operation
of such companies after they are brought into
being.
XVa have for many years had statutory companies charged with the responsibility of
holding government property, operating government business, or performing government
functions. The Canadian National Raihways,
Trans-Canada Air Lines, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the Bank of Canada and
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation are notable examples. The incorporation
of government companies under Part 1, of
the Domninion Companies Act is an invention
of the Department of Munitions and Supply.
brought about hy the exigencies of war and
déesigned to organize the nation's human and
material forces for the carrying out of specific
enterprises. Under the capable direction of
the Minister of Munitions and Supply, the
Right Hon. C. D. Howe, it was eminently
s-uecessful.
The limited liability company is designed,
out of long experience for the very purpose
of unitedly carrying on business activities. It
is a form of organization well known to business men. The methods are familiar and the
rules welh learned.
The subdivision of t-he war effort into
separate enterprises, the securing of management, the hiring of staff and the buying of
proýperty, plant and supplies was thus facilitated. The Department of Munitions and
Supply grew with astonishîng rapidity, and
the resuits obtained were far in excess of
any reasonable expectation. As many as

thirty-one companies were brought into being,
enabling many thousands of men and women
to play their part in orderly array for the
achievement 'of
the common objective., I
think it was a glorio-us part.
The war has now passed into victory. The
war job is donc. The Department of Munitions and Sýupply bas become the Department
of Reconstruction and Supply, and most of
the crown companies have fohded their tents
like the Arahs and stohen away-not s-ilently.
but to the accomapaniment of marching feet
homeward bound. 0f the thirty-one companies. eighteen have been woýund uýp; eight are
in process of windmng up, and five only remain
with any likelihood of permanency.

active operations for many years to come, and
they are likely to be joined by two companies
alreadv mentionedi in connection with the
Research Council, one to handle the Chalk
River enterprise and the ot.her the Research
Council's patent business.
That is to say, we now have five government companies with a fair prospect of
oermanency. Accordingly it is necessary that,
apart fron the Companies Act, we- provide
some general rules to govern their relations
vitlh the crown and with parliament. Previously they were operated to some extent under
the War Measures Act and were financed out
of war appropriations voted by parliament.
The War Measures Act is gone and there are
no more war appropriations.
It is not likely that we shall have any
government companies m addition ,to those I
have mentioned, for little power to create
them remains in the statutes, other than that
to be given the Research Council for objects
within its jurisdiction by the amending bill to
the Research Council Act. Power to incorporate mas- also be found in Bill 165 now
before this bouse relating to the development
and control of atomic energy, but it will be
limited to the prescribed subject. Power to
incorporate sucli companies was contained in
section 6, subsection 3, of the Department of
Munitions and Supply Act, and was limited to
the carrying out of the puropes of that act.
The sections of the act crea.ting the Department of Munitions and Supply have been
replaced by the Department of Reconstruction
and Supply- Act 1945. Section 6 of that act
preserves to the Minister of Reconstruction
and Supply all rights, powers and functions
which were, immediately prior to the coming
into force of this section, by any act, order or
regulation, vested in the Minister of Munitions and Supply. This would seem to continue
his power to incorporate companies, but le
is emphatic that it does not. He says the
power was for the purposes specified in the
act, which relate wholly to war. There being
now no war, it would be difficult to find a basis
for setting up a new company under that act.
We may thus be assured that there will be
no attempt to act on such powers, if any, as
remain. and that any future incorporations will
be by statute, passed by parliament, and, therefore not subject to the provisions of the Act
respecting the Operation of Government Conmpanies. A good indication that I am correct
in this is found in the fact that War Assets
Corporation was created by act of parliament, and is not a company incorporated
under the Companies Act.
Hon. M\r. ROEBUCK.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is not the act still
in force which gives the government power to
form crown companies at will?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I have just given my
thoughts in that connection. It seems to me
tiat the powers whihel existed under the
Department of Munitions and Supply Act
continue. That is the way I interpret it, but
the minister says emphatically that is not so.
He states that the powers given him by the
Munitions and Supply Act were for the purposes of war only, and that since the war is
over it would be difficult to find a basis in
that act upon whici to form a crown company.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Or to finance it.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Ilt could be financed
under tiis bill. but not under the Munitions
atnd Supply Act, or by appropriations under the
War Measures Act, as was done by order in
council during the war. I do not wish to be
dogmatie about the question, but I have given
my interpretation. I quite appreciate the difficulties which would attend the efforts of the
minister if he were to attempt to incorporate a
company by the methods used during the war.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Some other minister
rnight attempt to do sn.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Is not the formation
of crown companies being shifted to the
Isteari Council? I. not the bill now being
presented to finance them?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: One such company
no under the Rsarch Council is te PolivintiCompany.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: But it is in existence
now.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is so. To my
knowiedge the only companies suggested at
the present time are the patents company and
the one to take over the Chalk River enterprise.
Section 2 of the bill is broad enough to
cover all crown companies incorporated under
the Companies Act, irrespective of the departmeots concerned or the minister in control.
Section 3 permits such companies to have
bank accounts in the Bank of Canada or a
chartered bank approved by the Minister of
Finance. I warn ionourable senators that that
provision is more significant than would appear
on first reading. The section allows a company to deposit its receipts in the bank and
to pay out of its account all administrative
and operating costs. and expenses of the company. Were it not for this provision all
receipts in the course of business would go

JUNE 25, 1946
into the consolidated. revenue fund and disbursements would have to bc voted by parliament. It would be difficuit, if flot impossible,
to carry on business in that way. In the past
this difficulty was taken care of by P.C. 329776, passed under the War Measures Act, on
the 2Sth of October, 1942. Similar provisions
are to be found in the statutes creating the
National Harbours; Board, the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and every
other statutory organization which operates as
an incorporation.
Sections 4 and 5 of the bill provide for ornergeocy financing apart from money approprîated
by parliament. Section 4 reads as follows:
The Governor in Council may
(a) authorize the Minister of Finance to advance to a cornpany, by way of loan, additional
working capital out of uni±ppropriated moneys in
the consolidated revenue fund: and
(b) authorize a company to borrow additional
capital and authorize the Minister of Finance to
guarantee the repayment of moneys so, borrowed;
but the aggregate of outstanding advances made
and ions guaranteed pursuant to this section
shall fot, in tbe case of any company, exceod
five hundred tbousand dollars at any one time.
Section 5 of the bill provides for expenditures, sud reads as follows:
Tbe Governor in Counceil may
(a) authorize a compauy, on bebaîf of His
Majesty, to construct. acquire, extend or improve
capital works, and, for this purpose, to expend
any of the moneys adminîstered by it,
That is tbe answer as to wbat happons to
revenue which a company obtains.
The section furtber provides that the Governor in Council may:
(b) suthorize tbe Minister of Finance to pay
from any unappropriste(l moneys in the consolidated revenue fund sncb furtber sums as may
be necessary to carryý out tbe construction, acquisition, extension or improvement of sucb capital
works, and
(c) authorize the Minister of Finance to purchase additional sbares of capital stock of a
eompany and to pay for the same out of unappropriated moneys in the consolidated revenue
f und,
but the aggregate of the amounts paid under
paragraph (b) of this section and tbe amounts
used to purchase shares of capital stock under
paragrapb (c) of this section shaîl not. in tbe
case of any company, exceed five bundred
tbousand dollars in any fiscal year.
Considerable misunderstsnding and' doubt
bas developed with respect to the mesning of
this section. I ar n ot satisfied with the
explanations which 1 bave read, and submit
that a thorough examination should be made
when the bill goes to committee. It will be
observed that the phrase "in any fiscal year"
modifies the verb "exceed," not the clause "the
aggregate of the amounts paid." The section
does not say that the aggregate of the amounts

389

psid or used in any fiscal ypar shall not
exceed so much, but that the amounts paid or
used shaîl not exceed so much in any fiscal
vear. The wvording is most confusing, and 1
do not know bow it would ho interpreted by
a court. The matter should be clesred up
before our committee.
Hon. ',,r. LEGER: It certainly should be
clarified.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I believe the intention is that the amount on both administrative and capital account shahl be $1,000,000
and shall not exceed that amount.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
honourable gentleman if ho suggests that the
words "at any one time", in section 4 of the
bill, are confusing?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK. Nu. Thîey are perfectly clear. Section 5 uses the words "in
any fiscal year", which may be interpreted
to inean that 3500,000 can be paid in tbis
fiscal year, a similar amount in the next fiscal
yoar, and so on ad infinitum. 1 do not think
that is the intention.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Under the pro visions of section 4 how many times could
$500,000 be borrowed in any one year?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:
that.

0

nly once.
It

does flot say

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The section says that
the amount shaîl flot excoed M50,000 at any
one time. For instance, if during a parliamentary recess the Polymer Company received
a large order and found it nocessary to ereet
a plant to fili that order, to wait for parliament to meet would entail an unreasonable
delay. Tberefore power is given to the company, with the approval of the Governor in
Council, to, borrow tbrough the Minister of
Finance from the unappropriated moneys in
the consolidated revenue fund, the sum of
&500,000 for administration and a similar sum
to build the plant. Thon when parliament
met and voted that money Polymer would
be in a position to make further borrowings
if the previous borrowings had been satisfied
either by repaymont or by a parliamentsry
grant. That is my interpretation.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The bill employs the
words "the aggregate".
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: There îna.y ho sevoral borrowings, but thoy must flot exceed
$500,000.
Sections 4 and 5 of the bill are duplicated
almost word for word in sections 16 snd 17
of the Canadian Br9sdcasting Act. It will

SENATE
be noted that a private company could provide for emergency financing by borrowing
from. the bank or by an issue of bonds and
debentures, or similar methods; but these
means of financing are flot available to government companies. and so powers are given
for emergency financing.
Section 6 of the bill provides for the
recovery by the crown of moneys in the
bands, of the company in excess of its requiremonts. Similar provisions will be found in
the Canadian National Railways Capital
Revision Act, 1937, Chapter 22, section 10.
In that connection the directors exercise discre tien as regards repayment; but in the
operation of government companies the minister exorcises the discretion with respect to
recalling money.
Section 7 of the bill provides that the coinpany can exorcise its powers only as an
agent of lis Mai esty, whieh is a certain safeguard against these powers being used for
private purposes. The company may contract in its corporate naine without specifie
reference to His Mai esty, which moans it
can buy, soul and carry on business the samne
as any other company. The fact that it can
sue and be sued on its own behalf, rather
than ns an agent of His Majesty, does away
with the nocessity of obtaining a fiat from
the Minister of Justice before cemmencing
an action.
1 invite the lawyers in the bouse te teIl
me wbether the clause is wide open enoiîgb
te cover both contractual righits and obligations and also torts. I have asked dopartmental
lawyers about it. but have received no reply.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: And by that time
the aet would be amonded.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not think it doos.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I maise the question because section 2 of the bill states that the
govemnmont companies are incorporated under
Part I of the Cempanies Act.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I amn not sure.
Somotimoes 1 think torts are coverod, because
rights and obligations growv out cf wrongs.
If the board of direetors of one of those
companies ordered ene of its servants te
drive at a top speod to a tewn teo get something. and on the w~ay that servant ran over
somebody, that would ho a tort which would
give the injured party rights te compensation
hv the company.
That is one viow. The
other viow is that "right or obligation"~ is
apparently meant to imply a contractual
right or obligation. 1 arn roady to be hired
in support of either view. and 1 think 1 could
put uip a fairly good argument. When this
bill goes to committeo the departmental
offlcers can ho askod whothor they meant te
cover torts and, if net, w-hy it is net se stated.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD:
good clause for lawyers.

It

is apparently

a

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. There might
bave te be an action te decide what is meant.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: May I ask my
honourable friend a queýstion, referring back
to section 4, under which the Govýernior in
Council may authorize a company te borrow
money within a certain limitation? I understood him te say that 'vas intonded to replace
te po'wers conferred tipon ordinairy cempanies
te borrow in other ways.
lion. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. At ahl evonts,
other comlxanies have these powers. and a
governiment eompany has net. Thereore this
sect ion is necessary.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I do net ce anything in this bill which deprives goverriment
companies of the ordinary borrowing powers
which any company organized under Part I
of the Companies Act can exorcise xvith the
consent of its shareholders. 1 was wendering
whether my honourable friend's remark was
coriet, or if the mere fact of incorporation
uinder Part I of the Companies Act would
permit a goveroment cempany, with the consent of its sharehelder which is the govoramient-te borrow inlimited sums of meney
secuircd hy bonds or debonturos, or- in any
other way.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I arn net prepared
to bo dogmatie in my reply. Bofore I could
answor my honourable friend with any deflniteness 1 should have te read the bill with
bis question in mind; but my present tbought
is that power is not given te theso companies
te borrow money outaide.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I cannet answer the
question off-hand. My bonourable friend may
ho right, as he usually is. I would rather
pass the question for the moment and take
it up in cemmittee.
1 have said that it is net possible te have
mon hirod by the Civil Service Commission
for the purpose of carrying on what is really
a commercial business. These companies will
be able te hire and fire witbout reference te
the commission.
Section 10 is the only other section te whicha
1 need refer. The criticism we hear most
n
frequently is that business assigned te -- incorporated company will be removed fromn the
control or scrutiny of parliament. I submit
that this bill endeavours te correct that tendoncy. It provides that each company shail
submit to the minister an annual report of

39

JUNE 25, 1946
its affairs and operations, and that he must
lay this before parliament. He may eall for
further reports, and of course parliament may
cail the company and its officers before a
Commons or Senate committee for questioning, so that appropriate legisiation or other
action may follow. Furthermore, as I have
already made clear, the segregation of an
enterprise into the hands of a special board of
directors, charged under the Companies Act
with keeping the books there specified, makes
it easier rather than more difficuit to check
Up onl the operations concerned.
Provided the bill is clarified in some smal
respects, I can see no objection to it. flow
we could carry on companies without a
regulating statute, I arn unable to imagine.
There may ho somo question as to the incorporation of these companies. Should we have
government companies at ail? Anyway, we
have them, and they have justified themselves
from certain points of view, and it seems that
we are going to continue to have them. It
would be very difficuit to get rid of them at
this moment. That being so, it is essential that
we have an act for their control and regulation. I can sec no real objection to the bill.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:- I was looking through
the bill with the expectation of finding a
section authorizing the minister in charge to
provide the money needed. There does not
seem to ho any such section.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: There is no need to
give parliament power to appropriate money.
This bill, in two-sections, authorizes the Governor in Council to appropriate up to $500,000.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It seems to me that the
amount of money that may ho appropriated in
one year for these companies should be statutory.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: How would it bo
possible to state the limitation? The patents
company would require perhaps only a smal
sum, but the Polymor company is in a difforent class. We spent $50,000,000 on that
company, and last year it made $10,000,000, so
we are at present $40,0O0,000 down. We are
now into atomnic enterprises. No one knows
what wili corne out of the Eldorado seheme,
or the Chalk River operations. It would ho
impossible to lirait in advance the amount of
money which. parliament might appropriate
for such undertakings.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Howard, the debate

ATOMIC ENERGY CONTROL BILL

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 4

SECOND READING

SECOND READING

Ion. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 165, an Act relating to the
development and control of atomic energy.
He said: Honourable senators, I would ask
the honouraible senator from Toronto to
explain this bill.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, before proceeding to discuss and explain
tbe construction, constitution and purpose of
this bill, I should like to make a few general
observations with respect to its subj ect matter.
I arn sure ail honourable senators bave been
reading a great deal about the conference on
atomic energy wtiich bas recently taken place
in New York, and which bas been widely discussed in the press. I do not believe that
civilization bas ever faced a more important
problem than that of finding an effective
ineans of dealing with this very powerful
force.
For many years scientists have tried to
find a means of splitting the atom, claiming
that the discovery of this phenomenon would
develop a new source of power. That bas
been accomplished, and we now realize that
man has produced something which he may
not be able to control. Therefore civilization
is faced with the problem of finding an effective means of regulating this power of unknown proportions.
For many years physical science bas been
on the march. There is no doubt that the
development and pr9gress of the world can
be largely attributed' to scientifie discoveries,
and that the growth of this continent is
almost directly due to achievements in the
field of science. In the early part of the
nineteenth century people crossed the ocean
in sailing vessels. Later in the century new
forîns of power were perfected and put to
practical application, with the result that we
have advanced in this century. The discovery
of new sources of power in the latter part of
the eighteenth century, and during the aineteenth and twentieth centuries, raised the
standard of living throughout the world, and
I believe the splitting of the &tom will bring
about even greater improvements in this
rezard. provided the new power can be controlled and used for peaceful purposes.

McL. ROBERTSON
Hon. WISHART
moved the second reading of Bill 198, an
Act for granting to is Maj esty certain sums
lof money for the publie service of the financial
year ending 3lst March, 1947.
He said: Honourable senators will no doubt
recali that the total estimates for the fiscal
year 1946-47 amount to $2,769,349,815.66. 0f
this amount $1,202,652,841.26 is authorized by
statute; the balance of $1,566,696,974.40 must
be voted by parliament. By Appropriation
Act No. 2 parliament voted one-sixth of the
annual financial requirement. This was to
cover Aprîl and May. By Appropriation Act
No. 3, a sum amounting to one-twelfth was
voted to cover the month of June. This bill
makes provision for a further one-twelfth, or,
as shown by section 2, a sum of $136,598,972.86.
In that respect this bill is similar to thse one
passed a month ago; but it is different, in that
it contains no schedule of items-such as
appeared in the carlier biIl-calling for additional amounts to defray expenditures connected with tbe demobilization of the armed
forzces and other special obligations of a seasonal nature. This being so, I presume that
no such additional amounts are required at
tbis time.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I have no objection
to the bill being given second reading. I
presumne that some of the items mentioned wil
be considered by the Finance Committee, and
that when the Budget bas been brought down
we will be able to go into the matter much
more fully.
Ion. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I would repeat what I have said on
previous occasions-that the passing of this
bill is to facilitate public service and ini no
way precludes any honourable, member from
obtaining information which he desires concerning general expenditures.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

SENATE

It is unfortunate that organized society has
not always kept abreast of the developments
of physical science. During the industrial
revolution and similar periods in the world's
hiStory, there were those who refused to
accept the new knowledge gained by fresh
discoveries and opposed the application of
new principles until. by natural progression.
those principles forced themselves upon society.
New inventions while giving more leisure to
the masses of the people have enabled countries of the world to produce ail kinds of goods
in greater abundance. If in this process of
change there has been a disorganization of
society and the community in general, scientists have not accepted the responsibility for it.
They have felt that the problem was of a
social and not a scientific nature.
It is interesting to observe that today scientisis are taking an interest in political affairs,
and are trying to evolve some means of control
for the new source of power. Before the secret
of splitting the atom was discovered, thus
releasing the power known as atomie energy,
no one could visualize the problems which
would result. It was during World War II
that the discoveries with relation to atomic
energy were put to use for the first time.
Today military leaders as well as scientists
and political leaders are aware that unless
corne means is found to prevent this new
'ource of power from being used for destruetive purposes, civilization cannot survive
another war. I am sure it was a great shock to
military leaders as, well as to others throughout the world to learn how devastating was the
effect of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and
Nagasaki. and there can be little doubt that
the bomb was to some degree, if not largely,
responsible for bringing about an early end to
the Japanese conflict.
It must be borne in mind that, in the event
of another war, sufficient atomie bombs could
be carried in one aeroplane to destroy a whole
civ. and that projectiles loaded with atomie
bombs sent from one 'coutinent to another
would be reasonably effective in destroying
any iparticular plant or city, together with the
people in the vicinity.

As soon as the atomic bombs were dropped
on Japan it was felt that the control of
atomie ecnergy was a matter that should be
brought forcibly to the attention of the whole
world. Reference to a few of the significant
highlights since that time may be of interest
to the house. On August 9, 1945, three days
after Hiroshima was blasted, President Truman
declared that the bomb was "too dangerous to
be let loose in a lawless world" until means
had been found "to protect ourselves and the
rest of the world from total destruction." On
the 3rd of October President Truman sent a
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

message to Congress calling for the creation of
a commission to control atomic fission domestically, and suggesting international discussion
of its control throughout the world.
On November 15 came the first of the major
steps to set up international supervision. The
United States, Britain and Canada issued an
agreed declaration that called for the exchange
of information about atomic energy among
the nations as soon as effective safeguards could
be established. On December 27 the second
step was made public when the "Big Three"
Foreign Ministers, meeting in Moscow, revealed that they had agreed on recommending to the United Nations General Assembly
the appointment of a commission to deal with
the problem.
On January 24 this year came the third
step, the creation of the United Nations
Atomic Energy Commission, composed of
delegates of each of the eleven nations represented on the Security Council, plus Canada.
Canada, though not a member of the Security
Council, was added as a member of the commission because this country is one of the
sources of supply of uranium, which is used in
the development of atomic energy. Canada
having the plant that has been erected at
Chalk River, where extensive research into
tomlii fission has been carried on, occupies
an extremely important position.
As the
Minister of Reconstruction and Supply said in
another place, we, along with the United States
and Great Britain, have the secrets, and the
knowledge of how to use them.
Although nationally and internationally we
are at present concerned with finding some
means of controlling atomie energy and using
it for peaceful purposes, the real problem
facing the world and civilization is the establisbment of a society of mankind which will
enable people of different races, creeds and
political philosophies to live together in peace
and work unitedly for the benefit of humanity.
It seems to me, honourable senators, that it is
going to be extremely difficult to find effective
means of controlling the use of atomie energy
by legislatiori, or by agreements between countries, until the countries themselves can evolve
some method of settling their own simpler
problems.
Sonie Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: So far as we know
today, the only countries possessing knowledge
of atomie energy are Great Britain, the United
States and Canada. It would seem that before
nations can conduct discussions with confidence, all countries should disclose how far
they bave gone in the development of atomie
energy. Canada, the United States and Great
Britain have made it known that they possess

JUNE 26, 1946
plans for breaking the atom and producing
power from this source. We do flot know what
is happening in other countries, particularly
mn Russia, although it is f airly well known or
suspectied that there are sources of uranium in
that country, and it is believed that substantial strides have been made there with respect
to, the development of atomnie energy. We
do know that so far as Great Britain, the
United States and Canada are concerned this
new discovery will neyer be used for warlike
purposes, except as a means of seif-defence.
It seems to me that we should have a statement from other countries indicating, as I said
before, what efforts they are making aiong
these lines.
It is necessary for the people of the British
Empire, the United States. and the other great
democracies of the world, to evolve some
form of social science which wiil enable them
to deal with the people of countries having
political philosophies different from their own,
on a basis similar to that which obtains among
the democratic peoples of the world. I arn
certain that if the saine relationship existed
between the people of other coiîntries as
exists between the peopie of the British Empire, of the United States and of the other
great democracies, we should "not be so much
concerned about the control of atomic energy.
We should have confidence in the fact that
this power of unknown and unlimited, force
wouid neyer be used for aggression or destruction, but would be developed for
peaceful purposes. It would scem to me,
therefore. that social, science must be greatly
advanced, through. national and international
organizations, before we can evolve any
effective means of controîling atomic rnergy
and the further development and use of
physicai science along this uine.
The first step toward finding ways and means
of controlling atomic energy. and using it for
peaceful purposes bas recentiy been taken
by the UJnited States. The plan laid d'own by its
representative on the United Nations Atomic
Energy Commission provides, first, for the
creation of a body to be known as the International Atomic Development Authority,
operating in connection with the United
Nations Securîty Council. The objectives of
this pl-an would be to vest in this body coinplete control over atomic development in
order to pre'vent its use by any nation for
purposes of war. Second, it provides for the
surrender by the United States to the International AtoFmic Development Authority of al
its knowledge with respect ta the use of atomic
energy as a weapon at such timne as satisfactory safeguards can be agreed upon between
the nations of the world. in order that the

395

body organized to control this new power will
have effective and com-plete control. Third, it
provides for the destruction of the stock pile
of bombs held in the United States.
It will be seen that before such a plan can
be carried out the nations must have confidence in each other and supreme confidence
in the international body which, is set up to
deai with this p'roblem. It seems to me,
honourable senators, that no hasty action
should ho taken by those countries possessing
the secret until it is more oonvincingly
deronstrated that the United Nations Organization as now constitutcd has the coinplete support of ail the nations constituting
that body. It is the duty of thýose countries
which now have the means of producing
atomic energy te use their knowledge for
peaeefiil purposes, and to make the source of
the new power available for the people of
the world.
Before anything definite can be done for
working out this probiem between nations, the
nations must be prepared to declare whether
or not they are willing to surrender some of
their sovereign powers, because, according to
the proposais put forward, nations wiil have
ta, surrender certain of their sovereign rights
so as to grant to this new authority specific
powers with regard ta the following matters:
1. Complete control of the world's supplies
of uranium and thorium, the present sources
of atomic power.
2.* Exercise of control over operation of alI
plants producing fissionable materials in dangerous quantities.
3. Absolute contrai over atomic research
in the field of atomic explosives. Non-dangerous research and production activities would
be open to nations and their citizens under
reasonable iicensing arrangements.
4. Distribution of activities and materials.
5. The International Atomic Development
Authority would have the right ta inspect
atomic activities in ail countries.
We are not confronted today, honourable
senators, with the immediate problem of determining what international body shaîl be set
up to control the use of atomie energy thraughout the world. As respects this bill, we are
concerned only with the control, development
and use of atomic energy within Canada.
The bill is brief and, when carefuily read,
self-explanatory. It proposes to set up a
board, to be known as the Atomic Energy
Control Board, which wiil have authority ta,
control the development and use of atamic
energy within Canada. The board will be a
branch of government and responsible ta the
government, much on the samne basis as the

396

SENATE

Scientific and Research Council-of which we
heard a good deal last night. It will consist
of the person holding the office of president of
the Honorary Advisory Council for Scientific
Research, and four other members to be
appointed by the Governor in Council. It is
expected that in this way there will be a
direct connection or liaison between the Advisory Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research and the Atomic Energy Control
Board.
The power of the board is limited and controlled in several ways by requiring approval
of the Governor in Council before it can carry
out certain functions.
Section 8 provides under paragraph (a):
The Board may-(a) undertake or cause to be
undertaken researches and investigations with
respect to atomie energy.
That is, the board will have complete authority to undertake work of this character. In
respect of virtually all other matters the
board is subject to the control of the Governor in Council, and must obtain its approval
before exercising the further powers set forth
in this section. There is also provision for
contact with the Committee of the Privy
Council, as constituted under the Research
Council bill.
I would impress on honourable members
that this board will have nothing to do with
the international control of atomic energy.
That subject will no doubt be brought up at
a later date. It is expected that our representative on the commission set up by the
Security Council of the United Nations will
also be a member of this board. So there will
be a liaison between the international and the
domestic body in this respect.
The further provisions are, as I have said,
self-explanatory. Thcy deal with the voting
of supply to carry on the work of the Atomie
Energy Board, and also the reports which from
time to time are to be filed with the government and tabled in parliament. There is also
the usual section respecting civil service
superannuation and the like.
One other section of the bill which I should
like to bring specifically to the attention of
the bouse is section 10, under which the board
is authorized, with the approval of the Govceno in Council. to procure incorporation of
companies to carry on the objects of the bill.
The purpose of this provision is te enable the
board, with the approval of the Governor in
Council. to set up a company to operate the

as the Eldorado Mines, which are now conThe hill also protrolled by the crown.

of atomie energy. There is a further provision for the encouragement of exploration,
with a view to discovering sources of
supply of uranium and thorium. substances
used in the production of atomie energy.
I do not think any further explanation of
the provisions of the bill is necessary. I am
sure honourable senators have been extremely
interested in the discussions which have
recently taken place; this subject is not
entirely new to them, because it was debated
both here and in another place last December,
when the resolution was presented providing
for the constitution of the international conmittee.
In conclusion I should like to say that the
enactment of the present bill is nothing more
than the first step taken by one of the countries principally concerned in the development
and control of this new power. If Canada
were the only country involved, we could
devise some satisfactory means of control.
But other nations are involved, and I doubt
if we will be able to find any satisfactory
means for its control through an international
commission or organization until, as I bave said
before, we first solve the many other problems
related to establishment of permament peace
throughout the world. Therefore, I would
suggest that honourable senators give careful
attention to any discussion in the press on the
subject under consideration, and inform themselves as to what other countries are trying to
do to evolve an effective means of dealing
with this problem internationally. It will not
be long before this country, along with others,
will be required to make a decision, and when
that time comes, honourable senators, the
decision to be made will decide the destiny of
civilization.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Can the honourable gentleman tell me whether steps similar
te those provided for in this bill are being
taken in the United States and Great Britain?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: ln answer to the
honourable senator I would say that in the
United Kingdom a bill lias been passed which
vests in the ministry the power which by
this bill is vested in the board. In the United
States there is before the Senate a bill setting
up a board with an advisory commission and
a liaison with the military authorities. This
bill has not yet been passed.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Does the honourable senator know if anyone in Canada has
the formula for producing atomic energy?
Could we manufacture it if we wanted to?

RESEARCH COUNCIL BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 154,
an act to amend the Research Council Act.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Hon-ourable senators witt appreciate that this afternoon Iam
ptaying a new rote. It is to be hoped that the
arrangement witl be of a temporary nature;
but while we await the return of our leader
I witt do the best I can. My poticy wilt be
"to prove att things and hold fast to that which
is good." I amn pleased to be able to tell
bonourabte members that the geniat senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig) is not seriously il!, but is wett on the road to recovery
and is expected to be in hais seat next week
or shortly tbereafter.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: With the consent of
the bouse, I shoutd tike to deat with the Research Council bitl and the Government Companies bitl at one and the same time. This
witt facilitate their second readings and earty
reference to committee. I wisb to compliment
tbe honourable senator from Toreonto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) on bis very fine explana-

tion of these two bis. His remarks were very
lucid, and saved me a great deal of work and
research.

Deating first with Bit! 1,54, an Act to amend
the Research Councîl Act, I may say that ini
my opinion this is a very important measure
and a quite n-ecessary one. I do> not see how
the functions of the Research Council coutd be
carried on without sucýh a measure, and I have
tittte objection to it. We were totd tast night
that very large sums of money were received
by the councit in the form of donations and
as paymen-ts for services rendered to various
companies
and organizations throughout
Canada. It occurred to me that there shoutd
be some definite control of the expenditure of
that money. 1 asked the bonourable senator
a question on that point, and bhe said that there
was no control, but that at tbe end of eacb
year tbe couacit madie a futl.accountmng to the

government of the day, showing what had
been done with the money.
Section 7 of the bitt gives the councit certain new powers. I do not object to these
ncw powers so tong as the councit does not
go into private business-a poticy to which
honourable senators on this side of the bouse
are very mauch oppoSed.,
We are also, opposed to the formation of
too many crown companies, a matter in
wbich, section 9 of the bilt seems to give the
council considerabte tatitude.
The honourabte minister in another place stated that it
might be necessary to buitd pilot plants, and
that if they proved successfut the government might start another crown company.
Lt would seem, therefore, that section 9 of
the bitl opens the dooýr to the formation of
more companies. Speaking for mysetf, 1 arn
opposed to the government going into business to any great extent; h.owever, if the
councit does not enter into production and
comnpete with ordinary business, 1 have no
'objection,. and 1 feel that tbere is no fear of
that as tong as the present minister is in
office.
In deating with. the Bit! 155, an Act respecting the operation of Govern-m'ent Companies,
1 wish to make a fe-w remarks regaýrding the
formation of crown companies. If we are to
have these companies suc:h a bill as bas been
proposed is necessary, because there must be
some method wbereby these companies can do
business, and at the same time can be controtted. We were totd that during the war
there were set up under the Deýpartment of
Munitions and Suppty somie 31 companies, 18
of whicb have already been wound up-for
which I commend the government-that eigbt
are in the process of being wound up. and
onty five remain in operation. The five remaining plants are Canadian Arsenats Limited,

398

SENATE

Polymer Corporation Limited, Park Steamships Limited, Wartime Housing Limited, and
Eldorado Mining and Refining Limited. My
understanding is that Park Steamships Limited
and Wartime Housing Limited will be wound
up within the next three to five years, but
that the other three companies will continue
in business for an indefinite period.
I should like to refer particularly to the
Park Steamships Company.
I think it is
high time that the minister in another place
gave parliament a full; report setting forth
the number of ships constructed and their
cost; and if any have been sold, the number
and the price obtained. I know these ships
cost over $200 per ton dead-weight, and the
minister stated before one of our committees
a session or two ago that a certain number
of ships had been chartered and the revenue
received applied to reduce the cost of construction. This it seems to me is an altogether
inaccurate way of arriving at the cost. We
should know what the actual cost has been.
and therefore, when the bill goes to committee, as it undoubtedly wilI. I hope we
may get the information with regard to this
company.
I am pleased to note that the minister has
stated emphatically that it is not the intention of the government to form any more
crown companies to compete with private
industry. The legislature of one of the western
provinces has passed an act giving the provincial government full power to form any
number of crown corporations at any time
without application to the legislature, and provision has been made for financing these companies by a definite grant of so many hundreds
of thousands or millions of dollars every year.
I would not like to see that kind of thing
done by the federal parliament, and I am glad
that the minister',s remarks indicate it is not
likely to be donc.
The Polymer Corporation at Sarnia was
formed for the production of synthetie rubber
from oil gases. There is no doubt that this
corporation would not have been formed when
it was by private industry, as at that time
synthetic rubber was considered only as a
wartime substitute while natural rubber was
not available. The prospect of capital loss
Process
after the war was considerable.
changes and improvements may have modified
this view considerably; nevertheless it is
extremely doubtful that private capital would
purchase the Polymer Corporation today. During the course of a debate in another place
the minister said he would be very willing to
sell Polymer if any corporation was prepared
to pay a reasonable price for it. I would not
expect any offers to be made, because of the
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

large investment that would be required and
the fact that the industry is not too firmly
established. I say thalt without in any way
reflecting upon the quality of the product
and its absolute essentiality in time of war.
Polymer Corporation cannot be said to conmpete with private industry, except in so far as
its product may compete with natural rubber.
But the government has stated categorically
that it does not propose to put any restraints.
by way of duty or regulation. upon the
importation of natural rubber into Canada;
consequently the existence of Polymer Corporation will not in any way prejudice the
position of ýCanadian rubber consumers.
I intended ta read an extract from Time
magazine of June 10, 1946, with regard to the
Polynier Corporation, but I will simply quote
the statement that last year the corporation's
profit was $10,166,687. That is a very creditable showing, and I have no doubt it was one
of the reasons why this bill went through the
other bouse so easily.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Was that the profit
from the Sarnia plant?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: How much is the investment there?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 850,000,000.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is a good percentage of profit.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Another company
that is to continue in business is Canadian
Arsenals Limited. This company I am told.
bas been formed ta take over Dominion Arsenals-which in pre-war days was under the direction of the Department of National Defence
-and also certain war plants, some of which
are in stand-by condition while others are
being operated on a small scale. It bas been
stated most emphatically that it is not intended to have Canadian Arsenals Limited produce
goods for competition with private industry.
Munitions production is intended solely for
the armed forces of Canada, and possibly also
for the forces of its allies. But it is a fact that
at the moment one of the Arsenals plants is
producing fertilizers which are being sold for
commercial purposes in competition with fertilizers produced by private companies. However, at the present time there is a tremendous
demand for fertilizerHon. Mr. HOWARD: I was going to say
that.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:-so the competition
is net of much importance to private manufacturers. Whether this will be truc when
there is not such a demand remains to be seen.

JUNE 26, 1946
I have no objection Vo the Eldorado Comnpany. the atomic energy company, or the
other new companies that are about to be
formed.
1 corne now to the bill itself. I think it is
obvious to ail honourable members that it
does flot incorporate any company. I agree
with the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) that sections 4 and 5
do flot prohibit any of these companies from
borrowing money in the usual way. They are
incorporated under Part I of the Companies
Act, and have ail the powers conferred by that
act in addition Vo the powers given by sections
4 and 5 of the bill.
The part of the bill Vo which I chiefly object
is section 10, subsection (1). 1 should like to
read this into the record:
Every company shall, as soon as possible after
the thirty-first day of March in each year, and
in any event within three months thereof, submit
to the minister an annual report in such form as
the minister mýay prescribe of its affairs and
operations during the twelve-month period ending on the thirty-first day of Mardi and the
minister shalh lay the said report before parliament, if parliament is tien in session or within
fifteen days of the next session of parliament.
My objection is that the report required by
this subsection is a report "in such form as
the minister may prescribe". Now, thc minister might prescribe for one of these crown
ccrpanies a report whici would flot give
parliament a truc picture at ahl. In my
opinion every one of tiese companies should
bc required to submit an annual audited
statement, suci as any large industrial concern would issue, in addition to a general
report; and I suggest tiat in committee the
section be considered carefully and'amended
Vo this effect.
On behaif of honourable members on this
aide of the house, I may say that we have no
objection to the reference of Bills 154 and
155 Vo a Senate committee.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
as to the principle of Bill 154, so far as it
relates Vo the development of further research
in Canada, I think there can be no reasonable
objection. The place of research in the fields
of industry and science has become so well
established that we cannot quarrel. with the
effort Vo extend its area in those particular
fields and in others to which it may relate.
For instance, scientific research was responsible
for the development in western Canada of
certain types of wheat that proved immune
to the ravages of rust. Certain researches
have been of definite value to agriculture in
many ways. There is no doubt of the value
of research as applied Vo the u tiltization of

399

wood products and of metal products. In
fact, in the whole field of endeavour research
has a very important place.
This bill raises one or two questions that
I tbink require further explanation and elucidation, which could probably be given in
committee. We have to consider the bill, it
seems to, me, in relation to its companion
measure, Bill 155, which is designed Vo lay
down principles covering the operation of
crown companies.
Without any diesire to detain the house, I
tbink tiere are two sections in Vhis amcnding
bill whici deserve rather careful scrutiny and
pretty full consideration.
Section 7, as
explained by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) hast
night, is intended to very greatly enJarge the
powers of 'the council with regard Vo the
supervision of research. I have noV the Researchi Council Act before me, but the honourable gentleman outlined the powers contained
in paragraphe (c) and (dl). Those powers refer
Vo investigations which I think may quite
properly be descri-bed as relating Vo fundamental research. But the amending sections
give a very considerable increase in powers Vo
the Research Council or the autiority ciarged
with the administration of the act. Section 7,
paragrapi (h) gives this additional power:
To carry on experimental and development
work and manufacturing with respect to the
mnatters referred Vo in paragraplis (c) and (d)
of this section so as to render the processes,
methods or products to which the said mnatters
relate more available and effective in useful arts
and manufacturing and for scientific purposes
or otherwise.
Paragraphs (c) and (d), as I stateci a moment ago, relate Vo wiat might be described
as fundamental research. This section apparcntly gives power to the Research Council Vo
set up not only pilot plants Vo test out tie
effectiveness of any ncw discovcry, but also Vo
set up a manufacturing plant Vo make use of it.
I would point ouit Vo honourable senators that
this is a complete departure from the powers
conferred by the original act.
Let me illustrate in this way. Suppose in
Vie progress of their research work the cmployees of the council discover a new method
of utilizing wood products Vo make indiustrial
alcobol. Vnder tic present aet they would at
that point make suci information available Vo
ind-ustry generally. I amn noV a lawycr, but if
I understand this section aright it gives the
Research Coundil power to set up a plant for
the utilization and manufacturing of thc
products resulting from scientific research in
such an instance as I have just given. 1 may
be wrong in my interpretation.
If I am,
perhaps the lawy-er members can set me rigit.
If I arn correct in my asumption, this is a

very important departure, and is certainly
sometbing upon which the committee, when
the bill is referred to it, should receive full and
complete information.
If honourable senators will read that section
witb section 9, amending section 14 of the act,
they will find it in this form:
14. (1) The council niay, with the approval ef
the Governor in Ceuncîl,(a) procure the incorporation of any one or

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: In the process et the
nationalization et varieus industries in Great
Britain tbere luis been very frank and coinplete discussion in tbe British House et Ceinieons. as there xva- in tbeîr lat cleetion.
The people et Great Britain know tbc dir-(tien in wbicla they are meving, and tbey are
inoxing in tbat direction with their eyes open
te fiîndamental changes in many aspects et
thîeic national econemy. But we in this country seema te be moving in that direction witheut a great deal ot thought, and without the
approval et the electorate. Indeed, the C.C.F.,
which advocated sirnilar policies, were repudiated by the voters.
It is net with any intention et oppesing the
measure that I arn utterîng these views, but
rather te impress upon honourable members
the importance et a full examination et this
trend and where it Ieads. One thought that
strikes me in regard te the power here sought
for the incorporation et companies under the
Cempanies Act is that ail such cempanies
should be organized by aet et parliament antI
net, as under this bill, by the council on the
approval et the Minister under the provisions
et the Companies Act. If the incorporation
has te be secured by a special act et parliament, then the legislatien cernes before us and
can be scrutinized. T'he natural tendency et
course is te get these things through as ea.sily

JIJNE 26, 1946
as possible. My observation-and it goas back
over a considerable. number of years-leads
me to the conviction that it is comparatively
easy for things that we believe in and cherish
to slip away from us unless we are ahl the time
on the watch to appreciate what we are
doing.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I do flot want my
ramarks to be construed as in opposition to
the bill, but rather as a very strong suggestion
t.hat the committae to which this bill will ha
referred should very thoroughly examine
these proposais. 1 might go further. It does
seem to me there is implicit in this legislation the introduction of a principle that we
have neyer adopted in the past. I repeat, if
you can establish crown companies to do this,
that and the other thing, where are you to
set a limit to thle practice? What field of
business or endeavour may not ba touched by
such crown companies? 1 may ba a bit oldfashioned, but to me this trend is not oniy
significant, but carnies with it very definite
implications for the future economnic life of
this country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, I do not want ta delay consideration
of this bill, but I desire to take this opportunity of concurring heartily in what the hon.
ourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) bas said. The implications in legislation of this kind are much more significant
than the expressed purpose in particular cases.
There is an important principle at stake, to
which we should give very serious consideration. You find here a legislative pattern which
couid have the affect of leading to a great and
marked change in our national economy. If
we are ta agree to that in particular cases, then
1 think we should surround that agreement
with all the safeguards we can; therefore I
endorse the suggestion of the honourable senator from Churchill that in every case the
crown company should ha incorporated by act
of parliament. I would- suggest further that
the particular work ta ha nationalized and
undertaken by that company should ha deciared ta ha a work for the general advantage
of Canada.
It seems to me that in considering this bill
parliament should require from such a comnpany, once it is set up, more in the way of
accounting than simply a statement in sucb

f.orm, as may ha prescribed by the minister.
That has a tendency to remove contra! of the
company too far from. the people's representatives in parliament, where the direction of any
wark for the general advantage of Canada
63268-27j

401

should finally rest. If crown companies are
rnecessary and are ta ha set up, then they
should ha required- to bring in statements of
their operatians diractly ta parliament, so that
parliament may pass upon the necessity of the
work they are doing, and the cfficiency witb
which they are carrying it an.
It is my submaission that there is a lot more
involved in this bill than the simple giving
of authority for the incorporation of crown
companies. The implications of the change
in aur national economy ta ha effected by this
bill are very great. I wo-uld suggest, therefore,
that this is samething to which we should give
aur very seriaus consideration when the bill
is before us in committee.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable sýenators, I am disposed ta agrea with the remarks
of the two honourable senators who have just
preceded me. However, I wish ta raise a
rathar more technical question which arises
aut of Bill 1,55, and which saems ta me ta
indicate that not sufficient thought bas heen
given ta ail the implications of the bill.

Section 2 of this bill providas that under
certain circumstances companies, in which the
sale shareholder shahl ha His Maj esty, may be
mncarporated under Part I of the Companýies
Act of 1934. Having some knowledge gained
from professianal experience of the operatian
of the Companies Act, I wondered ta what
extent Part I of the ýCompanies Act was
really intendad ta apply ta crawn campanies.
For that reason I was very glad that the
twa honourable senators who preceded methrew out the suggestion that it migbt hapreferable ta have every crawn campany
incorporated by a special act, se, that its
exact duties and functians would ha known..
Honourable senators, if under Part I of the
Companies Act we permit the incorporation
of crown campanies *by letters patent issued
by the Secretary of State, we automatically
confer upon tbosa companies a vast aggregation of powers of which I am sure honouraible
senators are, for the moat part, unawarp. Let
me refer the bouse ta section 32 of the Companies Act, whioh enumerates 30 or 40 different
carporate powers which are inherent in every
company organized under Part I of that act.
I need only read two or three paragraphs ta
anahie honourable senators ta appreciate the
point I.am trying ta make.
Paragraphs (a) and (b) are as foliows:
(a) ta carry on any other business, whetber

'MOTION FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE

The Senate rsuned, fcom Tbursday, June
the adjoucned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mc. Fostec foc the second reading of Bill
8, an act respecting Canada Day.
20,

Hon. ATHANASE DAVID: Honoucabie
senators, the honourabie senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard), who adjoucned the
debate on Ibis bill. bas very kindly asked me
to speak today in bis place. I realize tbat one
who presumes to addcess Ibis honoucabie bouse

JUNE 26, 1946
on this important subject after so many excellent speeches have been made is apt to be
accused of audacity and temerity, but I am
sure that all honourable senators are of opinion
that men of sincerity and conviction should
express themselves on this question, as to
which we are at the present asked to legislate;
and what is more iniportant, that they should
think of the effect it will have upon the future
of this country. Surely it is possible, honourable senators, to diseuse this bill without falling
into the uncompromising attitude of some
writers and speakers who have expressed themselves on one side of the question or the other.
This bill merely indicates that Canada, supposedly having attained or being on the way
to attain nationhood, does not want its national
holiday to reflect dependency and colonialism.
The more I consider the matters of national
importance which are being discussed here
now, or that have been talked of recently, the
more prone I am to come to the conclusion
that any difference of opinion that existe is a
matter of principle and doctrine. Two opposing principles or doctrines are apparent in
Canada today. One is that which claims colonialism is but a transient, temporary stage in
the infancy of a country, and that the ultimate
goal is complete and absolute independence as
a full-fledged nation without fetters of any
kind.
In 1882 Renan defined a nation as follows:
A nation is a soul, a spiritual principle. Like
the individual, a nation is the attained goal of a
long chain of effort, sacrifice and devotion.
To have common glories in the past, a common
will in the present, to have performed together
great deeds, to desire the accomplishment of
even more-these are of the very essence of a
people. One's love is proportionate to the sacrifices one lias accepted and the evils one has
suffered.
On the other hand Bourget had this to sav:
To be, for a country, consists not only in
breathing. eating. drinking. To really exist. a
people must depend entirely upon itself, think
for itself. feel its own way, think its own
thoughts. be fully and absolutely independent.
Simple though this may seem, it is charged with
intense significance.
Before coming to the second doctrine, I wish
to amplify the meaning of the restricting
phrase I used that Canada was supposedly a
nation. I will believe that Canada is a nation
only when every vestige of our direct dependency bas disappeared. I will regard Canada as
a nation when a truly national life and a truly
Canadian mentality become apparent. Whatever may be the powers and the freedom conceded to us, it is only in our own internal life,
in our very midst, in our own conception of a
fraternal life, that we can create and animate a
national life and prove to the world that we
have attained real nationhood.

403

Now I come to the second doctrine, which
I believe is adhered to by a small number
who purport to desire the independence of
Canada but, whatever may happen, will always
pretend that it is too soon to bring that
They greatly dislike being called

colonials by their relatives or friends in Great
Britain or elsewhere, yet they prefer to remain
colonials in fact. With them sentimentality
is stronger than reason and national pride. I
hope no one will feel that I am moved by
vanity when I say that I have my pride. My
ancestors came here in the early years of the
seventeenth century. The first of the family
to come, Didier David, after borrowing fifty
pounds fronm a friend by the name of Pierre
Dolbeau, landed on the banks of the St.
Lawrence in 1608. During the 338 years since
then, even in the time of the French regime,
the David family has regarded no other country than Canada as its homeland.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: True there was in the
bottom of the heart an affectionate rememberance of France, but never since has the
family loved any other country than Canada.
Having finished with this digression, I come
now to the main point, the second doctrine.
I wish to state in all sincerity that in what
I am about to say I intend to offend no one.
I believe that when truth is expressed with
the object of bringing good to a country it
cannot cause evil even to the individuals in
the country. What would happen if the
second doctrine were to prevail? That doctrine is the one held by those who, although
they sometimes speak about the future independence, of Canada, are yet satisfied to be
considered as mere coloniale. If that doctrine
were to prevail, why not declare right away
that we need no national flag, no national
anthem, no national holiday, no national

announce that our hope, desire, and ambition
is simply to make money in Canada and,
following an example set not so long ago, go
abroad to spend the remainder of our lives,
to die and to be buried. If a clear statement
of that kind were made, ail would know just
where we stand and what we can expect. As
it is today, everyone seems anxious to talk
Canadianism; but when the time comes to
act upon the talk, Canadianism is completely
forgotten by the small remaining minority
of-allow me to give them their right nameimperialists. This minority knows very weIl

404

SENATE

that wveare flot yet a nation and that, notwithstanding certain rights and privileges conceded by the Statute of Westminster, that
samne statute confirms the fact that we are
stili a dominion and therefore a mere
dependency.
I readily admit that at the outset the appellation "Dominion" was a very convenient one,
doing away with the termi "colony" or "possession", which at that time wouid have been
most obiectionable and would have rernained
,ýo. The substitution of a naine that seems to
imply but littie dependence, I must agree was
very clever. And, as a matter of fact. it
romains very clever. I think it is Lord Derby
who is to be congratulated upon this diplomatic achievement.
Honourable senators, you may take it for
granted that nu word of threat or of menace
.,hall ever faîl from my lips in this bouse.
But, with ail the respect that I have for this
bouse and for everyone who occupies a seat
here, rnay I say: Let the Senate beware of
the reaction that the killing of this bill would
lîrovoke, not in Quebec alone but ail tbrougli
Canada. Please believe me, honourable senators, when 1 say that, I arn speaking not as a
man from Quebec, but as a Canadian. Notwitbstanding rny profound affection for my
native province, my country is Canada and
I arn Canadian to the cure. In whatever
province 1 rnay bappen to be at
any tirne,
I always feel perfectly at home. As a Canadian citizen, I say the Senate should not ignore
the immense wave of Canadianism which bas
arisen and which, as it rnoves forward, swells
and becoînes more and more powerful.
Not s0 very long ago a newspalper'in Ontario
said that "Quebec must ha Canadianized. Is
tlcat su? Surely the writor of the article had
a very slight knowledge of Canadiani history
and knew vers' little of the province of Quebec and hier inhabitants. In Qucbec there were
Canadians even befure the cession of this
country to England. Migbt it not be that one
of the factors responsible for the battie on tbe

head of tbe Canadian militia, and Montcalrn,
at the bead of the French troops? Those who

for tbey acted witbin tbeir rights. But those
who rernainod, about 65,000 in aI!, kneit down
on the soil and kisscd it, and swore loyalty
to the King of England and fidelity to the
land of Canada. The Canadians of French

Therefore 1 shahl continue to

Honourahie members, the independence of

position, will ho received with the greatest
expression of our respect.
It bas been suggested in this debate that the
appellation to be given to the lst of Juiy miglit

JUNE 26, 1946
well be "The National Holiday." I think this
should be the only point to engage our attention. I have said before, and I now repeat, that
for me every day is "Canada Day". Therefore
I cannot say that I am enthusiastic about that
title for our national holiday. An example
elsewhere may help us. Everyone will, I am
sure, admit that after the revolution Frenchmen were very proud of their achievement;
yet the national holiday of France is simply
"the national holiday- la fete nationale." It
commemorates the fall of the Bastille, the
abolition of the last vestige of royal prerogative and prestige. Why not, then, call the
first of July "The National Holiday" to commemorate the day confederation was sanctioned? I do not believe that all Frenchmen have always loved to commemorate the
destruction of the last vestige of royal
authority, yet they have accepted it as they
accepted the revolution, notwithstanding the
harm it caused them. So in Canada we would
accept commemoration of confederation without forgetting-although forgiving-the difficulties and uncertainties which it created.
La fete nationale-The National Holidayshould enlist the good will of all Canadians
desirous of harmony, peace and fraternity in
our own country before they even think of
imposing the same throughout the world.
Peace should be established among the citizens
of every country before the United Nations
Council even starts to think of the signing of
a treaty of peace between the nations of the
world.
In conclusion, honourable senators, I believe
our national politics would at times be less
confused if they were placed on the highest
possible plane, and the problems they have to
solve were regarded not from below but from
above. The best way for this bouse to give
politics greatness and nobility would be to
display at all times before the citizens of
Canada our respect for the permanent interests
of our country.
In the exercise of the sovereignty that is
delegated to us, we should never forget that
we represent but a fugitive hour of our
national life, and that therefore we must not
sacrifice to the whims and fancies of the
moment either the remembrance of the generations that have passed or the hopes, desires
and ambitions of the generations that are to
come. Canada must be the first and the last
consideration of internal as well as external
politics every hour that we sit here. Let us
hope that whenever we are called upon to vote
on a measure our thought shall always be
focused on the general welfare and greatness
of Canada. For Canada is not only the
Canada of today, it is the Canada of yesterday

405

and the Canada of tom'orrow. IL is the soil
that will survive our passing and ephemeral
ambitions; the land that bas impressed its
character on our institutions, on our hearts,
on our souls, on our literature; the country
that bas found the expression of ber genius
in real and true democracy and the prese-vation of its great traditions. Finally, it is the
Canada which at all times, in joy as in adversity, only asks us to understand ber, to love
ber, and to serve ber as we do our own mother.

THE LATE SENATOR McRAE
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, it is a matter of the
greatest regret that it is necessary for me to
refer to the passing of one of our very distinguished colleagues. While it was generally
known when the session opened that Senator
McRae had not been enjoying as good health
as we would have wished, during the session
he was a most regular attendant, and not only
contributed to the deliberations and work of
the Senate itself, but was most active in the
discussions and activities of a special committee, appointed on his motion. It comes
therefore as a shock that one who had contributed so much to our deliberations shduld
be so suddenly removed from our midstMajor-General the Honourable Alexander
Duncan McRae was a native of Ontario, having
been born in Glencoe on November 17, 1874.
As a young man he went to Duluth, Minnesota,

4Ub

SENATE

then to the prairie provinces, and ultimately
to British Columbia. Of tireless energy and
great business acumen, his name was associated
over a long period of time with many of the
foremost activities in those provinces. He was
a very successful organizer and promoter of
new enterprises and activities, covering land
settlement, fishing, lumbering and mining, and
as a result of his efforts literally millions of
dollars of British, American and Eastern
Canadian capital were invested in Western
Canada.
In the First Great War he rose to the rank
of Brigadier-General, and then to that of
Quartermaster-General of the Canadian forces
overseas. Later he was loaned to the British
Government to organize the Ministry of
Information under Lord Beaverbrook, being
given the rank of Major-General.
In 1925 he became actively interested in
political life, and in 1926 was elected to the
House of Commons. He was summoned to
the Senate on September 4, 1933, and throughout his membership 1e made a notable contribution to the work of this chamber.
I am sure it is the feeling of all honourable
senators that in his passing we have lost not
only a genial personality but an outstanding
figure in the political, financial and business
life of Canada.
We extend to his widow and his familr our
sincere sympathy in their bereavement, and
express our hope that their grief inay be
assuaged somewhat by remembrance of the
great service that Senator McRae lias rendered
to his country.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, I agree with everything that bas been
said by the honourable leader of the government with respect to our late colleague, Senator McRae. I also join with him in extending
to Mrs. McRae and the other members of
the family our sincere sympathy in their
bereavement.
As a young man Senator McRae was directly
responsible for the settlement of a great part
of western Canada; the province of Saskatchewan in particular. I first heard of him
when in the early nineteen-hundreds I was a
law student in Winnipeg. He was then a
member of the firm oi Davidson and McRae,
who acted as agents for the sale of Canadian
Northern Railway farm lands in Manitoba,
Saskatchewan and Alberta. Before that time
he Lad been with the Saskatchewan Land
Valler Company. He used frequently to visit
the United States, where Le took advantage
of every opportunity of advertising western
Canada, with the result that trainload after
trainload of Americans were induced to come
to the prairie provinces on the understanding
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

that they should buy land and settle on it as
farmers. In this way General McRae helped
to place on the vacant farm lands of Saskatchewan and the other prairie provinces immigrants of very high calibre.
When the land settlement boom was over
le moved to British Columbia, where Le took
an active part in, public affairs. He displayed
an independent attitude in politics by leading
his own party. The movement was not a suceess, and we next heard of him as a Conservative member of parliament at Ottawa.
As a political organizer he was most successful,
and le guided the forces of R. B. Bennett
to victory, though in 1930 himself was defeated. Shortly afterwards le became a member of the Senate, where he took a verv active
part at all times.
Senator McRae was a man of very strong
convictions, extremely loyal to his friends
and to his country. His militairy record is
0
unsurpassed.
As an organizer he Lad few
Squails. and J am told tbat no enterprise of
wthich he was the organizer ever failed to
niake good. His knowledge of Canada's mining
tro-oures probably exceeded that of any other
imember of this chamber.
One could go on indefinitely detailing the
gool qualities of the dooeased, and his nany
deedscof kindness and philanthropy. Senator
McRae will be greatly inissed on this side of
fte house, for his advice hias aivays been
much appreciated. We a ll mou rn the p:assing

lon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable senators. J wish to associate mvself with the verv
fine and wll deservEd tribites to the laite
Senator McRae by the twNo honourable goentem0(eniwe have just ieard.

As has ben said. Senater McRae was
raised on a farmit in western Ontario. near
Lendon. His first business exprience was as
a bUnker in Duluth. whre le aorumuatid a
-niail fortune which enabled imui to join with
Mr. Dividson. to whom the previous speaker
refurred. Their business was very successfil;
they did a great work in bringing settlers to
the prairies, which resulted in the development
of the western provinces. and in the early
years of this century the names of Davidson
and McRae were household words all through
the west.
Later Senator McRae went extensivelv into
lumbering, fishing and mining in British
Colmbia. He was a man who gave Lis whole
heart to any enterprise lie started. He once
said of himself that Le was no coupon clipper.
He got his satisfaction not out of the accumulation of great wealth but in seeing what Le
started develop and prosper.

I know that every member of this chamber
who attended the bearing on metalliferous
mines before the Natural Resources Coinmittee noticed the great interest displayed by
Senator McRae, and how anxious bie was
that the inquiry sbould be successfui. It was
very evident to ail that bis beaith was faiiing.

and hie aiways took a great interest in farming.
If vou wili look at the last issue of the

for profit as for the benefit of the live stock
industry of this country. H1e tohd me that bie
beiieved the swmne raisers of this country
wouhd make much more money if tbey brougbt
some new bhood into their herds, and with
that in mind he bimseif imported some very
fine animais from the best berds that bie couhd
find in England. I have personal knowledge
of two of bis animais having been shipped to
a neigbbour of mine, parthy at my request,
and I know that as a result there bas been
a great increase in the number of sehected
bacon hogs shipped out of that district.
Senator McRae was also keenly interested
in Scotch black-face sheep. On one occasion
1 asked him why this was so, and he said he
supposed it was because he was Scotch. The
real reason was that hie beiieved the meat
from Scotch black-face sbeep bad a much
better flavour than that from sheep of other
breeds. 11e aiso bad an extensive berd of

dual purpose cows. I arn just mentionîng
these facts to show that hie was weil justified
in designating himself as a farmer.
I arn sure that the business people with
whom General MeRae was associated have
suffered a great loss ini being deprived of his
counsel. This house aiso bas suffered a great
loss in the passing of a man who for fifteen
years bas been a very useful and greatly
appreciated member of the Senate. I personally have suffered a great loss, for General
McRae was a man whose friendship I valued
very highly. I desire to join with other members of the Senate in expressing to, Mrs.
McRae and family our deepest sympathy.
Hon. G. V. WHITE: Honourable senators,
1 wish to associate myseif with the two leaders
and my bonourable friend fromn South Bruce
in their tributes to our departed culleague.
My first acquaintance with Senator McRae
was during the first World War, when bie was
Quartermaster General of the Canadian forces
overseas. Our association became more intimate after hie was appointed to this chamber.
Those of us who followed his career in World
War I realized his outstanding organizing
abilities, and those qualities were forcefully
demonstrated after bie returned to civilian
if e.
General McRae was intensely interested in
the development of bis country. He was an
outstanding citizen and cont.rihuted in a large
measure to the growth of Canada. As was
just stated, the Parliamentary Guide gave
bis occupation as farmer, but hie had many
other vocations. He was a banker, colonizer,
industriaiist, soldier and legisiator. In ai!
those capacities hie possessed a brilliant aptitude for promotion and organization. H1e
brought millions of dollars of British and
American capital into Canada. He was a
great believer in immigration, and it bas been
said that hie and his associates were largely
responsibie for increasing the population of
western Canada by a quarter of a million
persons.
Senator McRae's life, a wonderfui example
and inspiration to young Canadians, was active
and colourful. From a bumble farm boy hie
rose meteoricaliy to be one of Canada's ieading
citizens and richest westerners'. With savings
of $1,000, at the age of twenty-four be set out
on a career which was nothing short of spectacular, for ten years later hie was rated one
of the richest men in the West. H1e pioneered
in iumbering, mining, wbaling, and land development. 0f late years hie was particulariy
interested in the mnining industry of this country; and, as was pointed out, hie was instrumental during tbe present session in having a

SENATE

special committee of the Senate appointed to
examine into the economic value of metalliferous mines in Canada. In connection with the
committee's work he did a great deal of intensive study. It was typical of the man that
althoughli he realized his health was in a critical
condition lie kept on working even until the
very hour when he was removed to hospital.
Perhaps his most oustanding characteristie was
his extraordinary organizing ability, which he
applied to everything he undertook.
To
this ability and his belief in his country must
be attributed the success that le attained.
The passing of our esteemed colleague leaves
a vacancy in our ranks difficult to fill. I join
with those who have preceded me in extending
deepest sympathy to Mrs. McRae and family
in their bereavement.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I wish to assure our honourable friends
sitting opposite that we on this side from the
province of Quebec feel that we share with
them the deep loss sustained througli the
passing of Senator MeRae. Though net of his
political faith, we greatly admired him as a
man, as an outstanding Canadian officer, as a
statesman and as a leading business man. His
life and career will be an inspiring example to
the younger generation. It will teach them
that with industry, high purpose and continuity
of effort, any Canadian in what lias been so
aptly termed God's country can attain to
leadership in any walk of life.
Senator McRae lias also given us an example of biroadmîîincedness. Whenever lie lias
taken part in our debates lie lias never failed
to judge the questions before us dispassionatelv, th, first and foremîost subject of his
concern being the national interest.
He
divested himself of his warm allegiance to the
political party in whos councils lie liad been
a leading figure, and as a senator treated
aill legislation sfrietly on its merits. He was
net parochial in his ouitlook; lie viewed
national issacs as a true Canadian. He gave
his individed attention to the stady and solution of the problems, whether proviccial or
dominion, which fro
fin te to ine confronted
us.

Since I became a member of the Senate I
have had the privilege of meeting him quite
often, and the friendship that developed between us lielps me now to appreciate the loss
of honourable senators opposite.
Senator
McRae was a conspicuous figure in this
chanîber and in our standing committees. His
withdrawal is net only a lamentable loss to
this chiamber. but a grievous loss to Canada
as a whole. for lie made an invaluable contribution to our induistrial and financial life.
ion. Mr. WHITE.

We from the province of Quebec realize
wliat a severe loss we have suffered in
the passing of Senator MeRae, and I want
to join those who have preceded me in expressing to Mrs. McRae and the members
of the family our deepest sympathy in their
bereavement.
Hon. GERALD G. MeGEER: Honourable
members, as a British Columbia colleague of
General MlcRae, I know that I voice the
sentinients of my fellow members from that
province and of its people generally when I
say that General McRae possessed in rare
degree those characteristies of mind, of spirit
and of person that are the common glory of
our British race.
His carter is a witness to our way of living.
He started as a boy upon an Ontario farta. He
had nothing but that which came to him with
life and the opportunities of his native land.
He rose from that humble position and devoted
his untiring energies net only to the betterment of his own position but to the betterment of everything with which lie became
associated.
Today in Vancouver the magnificent house
that lie built there is the home of Canadian
veterans of two world wars. I do not think
there was any feature of his many successes
that lue looked on with greater pleasure. and
nothing pleased himn so mucli as to go there
and see the veterans enjoying the delightful
surroundings liat lie was privileged to give
to them.
Ceneral McRac had the driving force of a
vigorous constitution, the entlhusiasm of a
ian whose vision was unlimited, the balance
of a man born with judgment and able to
undetake and see great things to fruition.
One of the characteristics that distinguished
him we shall all do well to appreciate. Great
were his obligations in private business, nunaerous were bis activities, but lie always
observed this rule: that public affairs were
important enouglh to demiand, and to recie,

; vs'y substantial portion of botli his timae
and his ability. He was one of the business
nien-of whom there are iany in this bousewho realized
that
the nation's
affairs
need the guidance of men wlio by success in
private affairs have demonstrated their ability
to serve their country.
Senator MeRae formed his own political
party in British Columbia and characteristically, as a man of ability, understanding and
decision, he called it the Progressive Party.
The newspaper associated with it was known
as the Searchlight. In the progress of his life
the searchlight of investigation always played
an important part, and it was because of his

devotion to investigation and his ability to be
guided by what he discovered, that he achieved
his great success.
Right up to his last fleeting breath he really
lived. He had a job to do-to get prepared
for presentation to this house, the report of
the Natural Resources Committee on Canada's metalliferous mines. That was his job;
he left the committee room only when that
work was completed, and within an hour was
taken to the hospital, where he passed away.
We who today join in paying tribute to his
memory and in extending our sympathy to
those who have lost a husband, father and
friend, have some consolation in the fine
example that has been left to us.
In speaking on behalf of my colleagues from
British Columbia and my fellow citizens from
Vancouver, where for many years General
McRae lived, let me say we realize we have
lost one of the forces that contributed greatly
to the betterment of that part of Canada and
the Dominion as a whole.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, it will be recalled that yesterday a message was received from the Assistant Secretary
to the Governor General stating that the
Deputy of His Excellency would attend in this
chamber this afternoon at 5.50 to give Royal
Assent to bills. As the government business
on the order paper is not of a pressing
nature, with the consent of honourable members who are entitled to proceed with orders
No. 5 and No. 6, and with the approval of
the Senate, I would now move, seconded
by the acting leader opposite, that out of
respect to our late colleague we adjourn during pleasure, to re-assemble at the call of the

The Senate adjourned during pleasure.

(2) The Yukon Territory as constituted by
Chapter forty-one of· the Statutes of Canada,
1901, together with any part of Canada not
comprised within a province which may from
time to time be included therein by the Parliament of Canada for the purposes of representation in Parliament, shall be entitled to one
member.

that there shall be assigned to each of the

other provinces such number of members as
will bear the same proportion to its population as the number 65 bears to the population
of Quebec. The general rule thus stated is
subject to two important qualifications, first,
as set forth in the third recital to the resolution, that on any such readjustment of representation the number of members for a province shall not be'reduced unless the population
of that province in relation to the total population of Canada has diminished by at least
one-twentieth since the then last preceding
adjustment; and second, that in no case shall

Everyone is aware that the basis of repre-

sentation in the House of Commons is determined by the provisions of the British North
America Act, 1867, section 51 of which provides that such representation shall be
adjusted on the completion of each decennial
census. As is stated in the words of the two
opening recitals to the resolution, the formula
which now governs the decennial redistribution provides that the province of Quebec shall

it is represented by 10 members in the Senate.

Also, by reason of the qualifying rule related
to proportionate shrinkage in the population
of a province, Ontario would continue to be
entitled to 82 members because since the
census of 1931 its proportionate population
has not decreased more than 5 per cent in
relation to the population of Canada as a

Ontario's population has suffered a proportionate decrease of more than one twentieth

SENATE

since its representation in the House of Com-

nions was fixed at 82. In other words, while
the proportionate population of Ontario has
decreased in excess of 5 per cent in relation
to the population of the whole dominion, this
diminution lias taken place over a greater
period than ten years, with the result that this
province is entitled to a number of representatives in the House of Commons considerably greater than would be the case if
there were a straight application of the principle of representation according to population. Should honourable senators entertain
some doubt as to whether the Ontario situation is strictly in accordance with the spirit
and plain words of section 51 of the British
North America Act, I perhaps should say that
thLe Privy Council has construed sub-section
4 of section 51 to mean that unless the diminution tas occurred within the ten-year period
no downward readjustment can be made in
the number of members of the House of
Commons fron any province. For purposes
of reference that judgment is to be found in
the case of Attorney General of Prince Edward
Island vs. Attorney General of Canada,
reported in Law Reports (1905) Appeal Cases,

.
p.
To further illustrate that the application of
this section 51 as it now stands and as it haï
been interpreted by the Privy Council leads
to somie real inequalitv, let me refer to the

Provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. As
I have already pointed out, these provinces
would lose 3 and 4 members respectively as a
result of the census of 1941, notwithstanding
that the reduction of their population in proportion to that of the dominion as a whole is
probably less than that of Ontario. It would
just be the misfortune of these western
provinces that the shrinkage of population had taken place since 1931 instead of over
a longer period, as in the case of Ontario.
Similarly, in considering the relative positions
of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec under
the law as it now stands, even if the population
of Quebec were to become much greater than
that of the province of Ontario, it would continue to have the fixed number of 65 members
in the House of Commons while Ontario
might remain entitled to 82.
Having in mind the unsatisfactory features
of the present system to which I have been
referring, in order to indicate to honourable
senators what is in the mind of the governlion. INIr.BENCH.

ment in bringing forward the present resolution, I think I could not do better than make
a short quotation from the highly illuminating
speech on this subject which was made by the
Right Honourable the Minister of Justice in
the other place. At page 1992 of the House
of Commons Hansard for the current session,
he stated as follows:
Dissatisfaction lias been expressed over this
growing gap between the original principle of
repreîentation by population and thle way the
provisions of the British North America Act. as

coistrued in this Prince Edw-ard Island decisîon,
liave worked out; and it was felt by tlie governiment.

in

considering

the

of representation, that a fairer basis for the
reie entation iii parliament ssould be the 1opu-

lation of all tthe provines as a wliole ratlier
thai

the population of any one province.

In otlier words, it is simply proposed, by
abandoning the formula which makes the
population of Quebec and its fixed number of
65 members the keystone of the structure of
our system of representation in the House of
Commons, to achieve a truer degree of representation by population throughout Canada as

a wlole. If this resolution is adopted and the
imperial statute amended accordingly, distribution of the representatives in the House of
Comimons will be more truly and directly
related to the distribution of population fron
coast to coast. Subject only to the proposed
continuance of the rule providing that a province shall have no fewer members in the House
of Commons than it tas representatives in the
Senate, readjustments in representation will be
freed froin the present restrictive rules which
have been productive of inequalities in the
past. Perhaps the most important consideration of all is that, by removing the possibility
of injustice being done to this or that section
of the population in the matter of its numerical representation in the other branch of
parlianiît, we will bc talking a great forward
step in the interests of national unity.
What, then, is the proc'edure or formula
proposed for the future? This appears in the
operative part of the resolution and the draft
of the suggested bill embodied therein. I shall
attempt to explain it. It is proposed that the
total number of members of the House of
Commons be fixed at 255. Out of this number

*In order to bring the total numnler of meinbers to 255, tliese thrcc provinces, having the largest rernain-

ders, are each entitlcd to au additional mnember.
This table indicates that the application of
the new formula would resuit in representation ini the House of Commons being divided
bctween the fine provinces as follows:
Prince Edward Island would have 4 members because, as I already have said, that is
the minimum number to which its representations can be reduced.
The population of Nova Scotia is 577,962.
M'len that is divided by the number 45,578,
it establishes that Nova Scotia becomes
entitlcd to 12 members and there is a
remainder of 31,026.
New Brunswick, with a population of
457,401, gets 10 members and bas a remarnder of 1,621.
Quebec, with a total population of 3,331,882, becomes entitled to 73 members and
there is a remainder of 4,688.
Ontario, which bas a population of 3,787,655 becomes entitled to 83 members with a
remainder of 4,681.
Hon. NIr. BENCH.

Manitoba, whose population is 729,744,
wvill have assigned to it 16 members with a
reinainder of 496.
Saskatchewan, with a population of 895,99ý2,
will bave 19 members with a remainder of
30,010.
Alberta, with a population of 796,169, will
bav e 17 meînbcrs with a remainder of 21,343.
British C'olumbia, whose population is
817,461, xvill have 17 members assigned to it
with a remainder of 43,035.
As a result of this first step there will be
assigned, including Prince Edward Island and
the Yukon, 252 out of the total of 255 seats.
It therefore becomcs necessary to allot the
three remaining seats to the thrce provinces
enjoying the largest remainders. These are
British Columbia with a remainder of 43,035,
Nova Scotia, with a remainder of 31,026 and
Saskatchewan with a remainder of 30,010.
Accordingly, each of these provinces would
bave une inembcur added to it., total, as arrived

JULY 2, 1946
at by dividing the quotient into the respective
populations of these provinces, and we thus
would have constituted the whole membership of 255 of the House of Commons. As 1
have indicated, the census which governs the
conclusions which I have just stated is that
of 1941.
In the over-ali resuit, a readjustment of the
representation in the flouse of Commons on
the basis of the proposed new section 51 would
give the people of Prince Edward Island
4 mcembers as compared to their present number of 4; those in Nova Scotia 13 members
as compared to their present 12; the people
of New Brunswick 10 as compared to their
present 10; the people of Qiiebec 73 as compared to their existing 65; those of Ontario
83 members as compared to their present 82;
Manitoba 16 as compared to their present 17;
Saskatchewan 20 as compared to their present
21; Alberta 17, the same as they now enjoy;
British Columbia 18 as compared to their
present 16, and the Yukon 1, the same as at
present.
Quite apart fromn what appears to be a basic
improvement in the formula designed to
achieve a truer degree of representation according to population, it is interesting to note
that under the new arrangement Manitoba and
Saskatchewan, which otherwise would have
Iost 3 and 4 representatives respectively, will
now lose only one each.
The honourable senator froma Lunenburg
(Hon. Mr. Duif) inquired as to why the
number of 255 was selected as the first divisor
to determine the quotient. While I have not
the factual answer tu this question, I assume
the number may have been chosen as being
the most convenient for several reasons. It
rather closely approximates t.he existing total
mernbership of t.he other place and does not
unduly increase the number of Seats. Moreaven. in its application it very nearly preserves
t he present representation of two of the midwestern provinces, which otherwise would have
suffered substantial lasses. To me it seems to
make good sense to com.mence the operation of
the new formula on a basis which will maintain
as nearly as possible the representation to
which Manitoba and Saskatrchewan are now
entitled. It helps to apply the new idea with
general approval throughout the country and
without leaving the false impression in this
section or that section that any real injury
thereby has resulted.
Regarding the suggested new formula itself
and the equity which its application will
achieve in the matter of representation according t.o population of ail sections of the Cana-

417

dian community. perhaps I should remind
honourable senators that this resolution bas
passed the other house, where it was debated
from May 28 to June 20. The discussion li
that branch of parliament, in which sit the
elected representatives of the people.who are
most directly concerned with the matter, was
highýly analytical of ail aspects of the problemn
and the remedy which the resolution humbly
recommends to lis Majesty.
So much for the resolution and the
mechanies of the readjustmeat of representation in the flouse of Commons which will
follow if the request is acceded to by the
parliament àt Westminster. If I have been
unable to present these features of the matter
with the same clarity of expression with which
they were presented in the other house by
the right honourable gentleman who there
proposed the resolution, 1 hope honourable
senators will be able to follow my analysis
froma the printed record, and that I thereby
may have been of some assistance to them
in their study of the proposai. I recognize
that it nmust he almost impossible to follow
the mathemnaties, in particular, of this oral presentation.
While I do not think there is anything I
usefully could add regarding the resolution
itself and what it proposes to accomplish, 1
think it may be incumbent upon me to make
a few observations on a collateral aspect of
the matter. It was suggested in the other
house, and I have heard expressions of the
same opinion from individual members of this
chamber, that an amendment of this kind
ought not to he sought on the joint address
alone of the two houses of this parliament;
but that, as a forerunner of such joint request,
there first should be sought and ohtained the
consent of the individual provinces. That
suggestion involves a principle which has been
the subject of numerous discussions since the
British North America Act was pa.ssed in
1867. I recognize it to be a feature upon
which one finds divergence of views. My
own humble opinion, for what it is worth,
and which I will attempt to support, is that
in this matter, at least, the consent of the
provinces, or of any province, is not requisite.
As I understand the case put forward by
those who argue for the necessity of provincial consent, it is that the British North
America Act is the embodiment of what has
heen called a "treaty" or a "pact" between
several crown colonies for the purpose of constituting the Dominýion of Canada and its
federal and provincial systems of government

Hon. Mr. EULER: That would not necessarily affect their power to diminish the number of members of the House of Commons.
We have only 96 members in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The honourable gentleman misunderstands. This is in relation to
each individual province.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: You could not reduce
the membership under section 51 or section
51A.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I am not citing section 51 for that purpose. I am trying to give
the honourable gentleman from Waterloo, who
asked for it, the provisions of the act. I have
read section 51 and section 51A. I am now
giving him section 52:
The nunber of menbers of the Hlouse of Commons nmay be from tine to tie increased by the
parliamnent of Canada, provided the proportionate representation of the provinces prescribed
by this act is not thereby disturbed.
The purpose of this resolution is to request an
amendment to alter the prescription for the
distribution of membership in the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If I migbt again interrupt the honourable gentleman, in spite of his
rather patronizing way of telling me something, I submit still that he is not answering
my question when le speaks of the Parliament of Canada having the right to increase
the membership of the House of Commons.
I asked him: Does it necessarily follow that
they would not have a similar right of
decreasing its members?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: The simple answer is,
no.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It would only be
increased or decreased by the application of
the formula contained in the British North
America Act, and subject to, shall I say, the
floors in respect of the several provinces. I am
very sorry; I did not know that I was bypassing the question put to me.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My thought was that

sentation in the different provinces, without
interfering with the law regarding the representation of Prince Edward Island.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: But by the application
of the formula as now contained in section 51
you might have, and would have, in fact,
having regard to the census of 1941, a reduction in the total membership of the House of
Commons. As regards Prince Edward Island,
if you disregard the floors which I have mentioned, that province would be entitled to
only two members on a redistribution at the
present time. However, by the provisions of
section 51A Prince Edward Island must have
four members.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I already knew that.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Honourable senators,
I think the question of the bonourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) bears
very definitely on the powers of this parliaument to do whatever it wishes in this matter.
I shoild think parliament could reduce representation as well as increase it. I believe that
point could be argued successfully. lowever,
my honourable friend is giving an expository
explanation of this resolution. If the propo-al had been for a formula changing the
basis. of representation, 65 members from Quebec, which is thc foundation of the whole plan,
you could recommend a reduction as well as
an increase.
Hon Mr. McGEER:
to the constitution?

Without amendnent

Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The constitution
would bave to be amended, certainly, by act
of parliamient.

lion. Mc. EULER: Just as it is now.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Ilonourable senators,
nay I state my proposition in this way? If
there had been an understanding, a pact or
an agreement that the provinces should be
conssulted in matters of this kind, it would
have been vey s
vimple when the original act
was passed to iave inserted appropriate
language covering the situation. That this
was not done is. in my humble opinion, conclusive as against the argument for provincial
consultation and consent. It seems to meand I say- this without disrespect to any
province to which it may apply-that a province which came into confederation after 1867,
and accepted the statute of 1867, bas an even
poorer case than the original provinces.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is admitted.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should like to conelude this branch of my argument by a state-

JULY 2, 1946
ment of the practice followed ever since 1867
in connection with the amnendment of the
British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Before proceeding ta
that branch of bis remarks, would the honourable senator permit me ta ask a question?
Since the British North America Act is an act
of the parliament of the United Kingdom, is
there any rule «which would prevent an
interested party appearing before that parliament and obj ecting ta a proposed amendment?
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Is that flot a guarantee
affording some measure of protection to flot
only the Canadian minority but the majority
as well?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: 1 certainly would flot
sugge.st that, when this proposed amendment
is sent forward ta is Majesty, any province
would be debarred from appearing before the
parliament at Westminster and objecting to, it.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: What chance would it
have?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: 1 would remind the
honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard
(Hon. Mr. McGeer) that, according ta my
recollection, when a similar address was presernted in 1943 for the purpose of securing an
ameadment extending the tirne within whicb
readjustment consequent upon the 1941 cens
could be made, the legisiature of the province
of Quebec unanimously passed a resolution
opposing the prayer of the address. 1 presumne
that representation was hrought ta the attention of the parliament at Westminster.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: But is was not acted
upon.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: It was sent ta the
Prime Minister of Canada but was flot brought
ta the attention of Westminster.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I am prepared ta accept
what the honourable gentleman opposite says
in that regard. However, if the Quehec provincial legisiators unanimausly adopted sucb a
resolution and then did not bring it ta the
attention of Westminster, they must have been
only shadow-boxing wben they .passed it.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: If the honourable
senator's proposition is correct, would not the
corollary be that a province that is entitled
ta 'be heard at Westminster should be entitled
to, consideration at Ottawa?

421

Hon. Mr. BENCH: My bonaurable friend
cen make any deduction from his premise that
he wishes. I assume that any such province
couild he heard at Westminster.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: But have no right to,
be heard at Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The provinces are being
heard. The province of British Columbia is
being heard through my honourable friend
who is just now addressing himself ta this
tapie.
Hon. Mr. RiOEBUCK: The honoýurable
gentleman has said that non-mention in the
act of right of the provinces ta be heard is
conclusive as against their right. If that is so
with regard ta any portion of the act, why is
it nat also conclusive against the contention
of the provinces that they have a right ta be
heard on those sections which apply ta the
provinces?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I should say that as a
matter of practice, and what one mighit expect
te be the measure of legislative wisdomn that
would be exercised, the imperial parliament
would not amend any provision of the statute
in whicb the provinces might be said ta have
a vested right without themn being heard. In
matters clearly defined as being exclusively
within the jurisdictian of the provinces, then,
as I have stated-and it is only my awn
opinion-I would nat think it proper for this
parliament ta ignore the provinces in requestmng His Mai esty the King in bis Imperial
Parliament ta make an amendment ta the
statute.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is a matter
of propriety rather than law.
Hon. Mr. BENCU: My friend lias heard
what I have 'said in that regard. I arn stating
it as clearly as I can.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The hanourable
gentleman is daing very well.
Hon. Mr. BEN CH: I think in that respect
it wauld be affecting a right vested specifically
in the provinces which would entitle themn
ta be heard.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: My honourable friend is
not speaking for the government?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That is quite true; I
amn not clothed. with any such authority.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I say a few
words ta further clarily the question whicb
bas been raised? Granted that a province
might be beard at Westminster in connection
with this subject in the face of an addreas

from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) to explain

Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
tbe Department of Transport Stores Act was

limait to tbe inventory of stores tbat tbe depart-

They wiil also remember that the

act was passed by the Parliarnent of the
United Kingdom upon an address from the
Senate and House of Commons of Canada.
The provincial governrnents were flot consulted and did not consent, On the contrary
-and I think this is important to note-the
legisiature of the province of Quebec adopted
a formai resolution of protest against the
passage of the measure.
I think that is ail I need to say-I arn sure
it is ail that I shouid say-oni the subject of
this resolution.
Honourable members bave
been extremely patient and I arn, as always
when I speak here, very grateful for their
kindly consideration. I oniy want to add that
upon the grounds of wbat I respectfuiiy consider to be the practical necessities of the
situation in applyiag the provisions of the
statute, as weli as upon the fundamental principies governing the construction and interpretation of statutes, and finally-and perhaps
rnost importantly-upon
the grounds of
abundant precedent, I arn convinced that
without the consent of the provinces it is
competent for this parliament to present the
proposed address to His Mai esty the King,
and for tihe parliament at Westminster to act
upon the address.

ment could bave at tbe end of any fiscal year.

In 1939 an amendment was passed to extend
tbis limit and the amount fixed was $1,250,000.
The purpose of the present amendment is to
extend tbe limit stili furtber, to $1,600,000.
A brief word of explanation as to wby this
amendment is necessary may be in order.
The Department of Transport operates canais,
bas control 'throughout Canada over civil
aviation and radio communications, and is
responsible for our country-wide meteorological
services. During the, last four or five years
the department's activities in connection witb
tbese and some other matters bave expanded
considerably, and to, meet any emergency tbat
migbt arise it bas been necessary to keep on
band a larger quantity of stores. Furtber, the
value of many items in these stores bas
increased, in some instances substantially. The
bill is simply an extension of tbe principle first

approved by parliament in 1937 and already
extended once, in 1939.

SENATE

Honourable
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN:
senators, in 1901 the Northern Pacifie and
Manitoha Railway Company, the Winnipeg
Transfer Railway Company, the Portage and
Northw estern Railway Company and the
W askada and Northeasterni Railway Company
leased to Her Majesty the Queen in the rigbt
of the province of Manitoba, for a period of
999 years, what wvas then, kniown as the Manitoba Railway Company, and gave an option
to purchase the railway at any time during the
currency of the leaso for $7,000,000. That lease
wa.s assigned hy the province of Manitoba to
the Canadian Northiern Railway Company,
whicli in 1901 came to parliamcnt and obtained
authority to purchase the assignment of the
lease, the railway and its undertaking, and also
the right to take up the option of $7,000,000.
The Canadian Northern Railway later assigned
its lease to' the Canadian National Railways;
and what the Canadian National Railways
seeks now is authority to take up the option
to purchase the Manitoba Railway.
The lease provides that the annual rentaI
shaîl ho $210,000 for the first ton years;
$225,000 for the second ton years; $275,000 for
the third ton years. and 3300.000 for the
nrnaining poriod. Tue Canadian National
Railways lias been pay~ing a rentaI of 3300,000.
It finids that hy refinancinig it can borrow the
money at an attractive rate of interest and
save at least $90,000 a yoar. Thiat is why it
seeks the auithority of parliamont to purchase
the railway.
The bill is simple, and may ho divided into
fouir parts. First of ail, it provides for the
assignaient of the option in accordance withi
the terrns of the act passed by parliament in
1901.
Second, it provides for the sale and
acquisition of the-railwa *v and its undertaking,
including certain stock. Third, it provides for
cIcar title. as in any purchase. Finally, it
prox ides for the method of effecting the
tran.sfer.
That inûthod may be stibdix ided into three
p)arts. First, the Canadian National Railways
may purchase and acquire hy means of an
ordfinarv deed or conveyance, as one private
indix idual would from another; it may proceed hy expropriation, as it normally does
undor section 17 of the Canadien National
Railways Act; or it may deposit certain plans
in the land titlos office of Manitoba.
The scehel
to the bill sots forth the
branchles of the Manitoba railway, as follows:
the Red River Valley railway, the Hope Farm
hraneh-hoth of which I know very well-tbe
Morris-Brandon branch, the Souris River
hranch, the Portage la Prairie hranch, the
Lake braneh and the Winnipeg Transfer
brench-a total of 353.17 miiles. The board of
Hon. Mr. COPP.

directors of the Canadian National Railways
has approved the purchase of the railway as
an excellent transaction, both as regards
refinancing and reducing its fixed charges. The
matter was made the subi ect of discussion
when the aniiual budget of the Canadian
National Railways was beforo the Railways
and Shipping committce of the other house.
The committeo approved the railway's budget
for 1946, which set asidýe $7,000,000 for this
prirchase.
This legisiation is sought, flot because it is
necessary to corne to parliament, but because
it is feit that a matter of this kind should he
endorsed by parliament. The saving whichi
will be effected amounts te, $90,000 a year.
The annual rentai for the unexpired termi of
the 999 years is $300,000 a year. The Canadian National Tiailways will purchase this
this line for $7,000,000. They can borrow the
$7,000,000 at a rate of 3 per cent, which will
mean an annual interest charge of $210,000.
Hon. Mr. EULER: They xnight have to
pay more than 3 per cent in the course of
the 999 years.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Yes; but they will
have to pay the $300,000 rentai unless they
purchase tue railway.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Is it not correct
that part of this railway bas been abandoned?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: A very small part.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: How many miles?
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Five and a fraction
miles.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: What are the pro
visions of the lease with regard to maintenance? Is that expense in addition to the
x'ental of 3300,000?
Lion. A. L. BEAUBIEN-': 0f course, under
the bease the railway must be maintained so
that you cao run your trains over it. The
railway from Emerson to Winnipeg is one
of the i)est pieces of road in Western Canada,
and both the Northern Pacific and the Great
Nortbern operate over it.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I should like to sec
the lease.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBiEN: 1 bave not got it
before me, but no doubt it cen ho obtained.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: When the bill is before
the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications it would be interesting to
have somne information from the financial
standpoint with respect to the operation of
the line. This anticipated saving of $90,000
a year may be morý than offset by operating
expenses.

JULY 2, 1946
Hlon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: If the Canadian
National Railways does nlot purchase the uine
it will have to continue to pay the $300,000
rentai for about 960 years, the balance of the
term of the lease. If my honourable friend
the acting leader opposite wishes to see the
lease, the bill should be referred to the Standing Committee of Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Ycs.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: I can quite appreciate
what the honourable gentleman hias said, but
I think it would be of interest to honourable
senators to know what kind of bargain was
made when the line was leased.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The bargain was
made between the province of Manitoba and
thec Canadian Northern Railway. As honourable members are aware, the Canadian Northern Railway systemn later became part of
the Canadian National Railways, so the lease
liad to be taken over.
Hon. Mr. PATERSON: May I state that
I started as secretary to D. B. Hanna of the
Canadian Northern Railway in 1898. We took
over the Northern Pacific and Manitoba Railway in 1901. I remember when we made our
first run to Brandon over the raîlway. At
that time it was in se mucb better condition
than the Canadian Northern that we experienced something that we were not accustomed
to. We travelled over it in Mr. Hanna's
private car 99, which was a very fine car.
Leaving Brandon there is quite a hilI down to
Rounthwaite and we were both watching the
speedometer. It moved to 50 miles an bour.
This rather worried Mr. Hanna, but when the
pointer indicated 70 miles an hour hie leaped
up. grabbed the beil-rope and stopped the
train-upsetting my table and typewriter in
doing so. He feit that 70 miles an hour was
too fast for safety. A good many years later
I bought a few elevators from a man named
Martin, and one of tbem was on the Hope
Farm branch of this railway. Not only did
bie deed me the elevator but also bis rigbt,
title and interest in the railway, and I tbought
1 really owned that railway; but now I find
I do not. The Canadian National Railways
lias spent so far about 81,000,000 in keeping
this line in good running order. It was a very
good purchase at the time, and still is, as it
goes through what I consider the most fruitful
part of Manitoba from a railway standpoint.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: What amazes me is
the long term of the lease-999 years. I
wonder just what right one bas at any time
to consummate deals tbat bind generations for

425

1,000 years. I expect, thougb, that this whole
scherne is something we inherited when we
took, over the Canadian Northern Railway,
instead of allowing it, as we sbould bave done,
to go into receivership. Then this lease would
hav-e laped.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I do not know
whether my honourable friend regards the 999
year leace as a bad deal, but it was granted by
the Roblin Government in 1901. Later it was
assigned to the Canadian Northern R-ailway,
which, as we aIl know, became part of the
Canadian National Railways.
1 always
thought Premier Roblin wvas a pretty keen
negotiator-at least politically; 1 do not know
w~hat lie was in railroading.
Some Hon. SEN-ATORS: Question!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
re.id the second time.

given for getting us back here a week ahead
of time is a poor one.
Hon. LUCIEN MORAUD: Honourable
senators, I understand fromn the leader of the
goverument that it is hois intention to finish
this week the debate on. the important matter
As honourable senators
of redistribution.
know, our ranks on. this side of the bouse are
rather depleted at presenit, but some of our
members are very anxious to take part in the
debate and can make valuable contributions
to it. The hionourable mernber from Grandville (Sir Thomas Chapais) is one; another is
our honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig). We
hope these gentlemen will be with us after the
recess.
It is my unde-rstaaâding that the British
parliament will adjuurn at the end of July, and
1 cannot see why there should be so mueh

hurry about sending this resolution f0 Westminster by that time. Redistribution was
postponied in 1943, and I understand that it is
not now the intention of the governiment to
present a redistribution bill at this session. I
,see no reason, therefore, wby the Senate

should flot take ample tîme

to study and

discuss this.resolution, even if it should necessitate an adjourniment of the debate until after
the recess.

Hon. Mr. DUFF: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Honourable memýbers
would then bave time to study the varions
-tpe(ts of the resolution and be able to speak
,
on it.

Hon. J. A. CALDER: Honourable members,
1 entirely agree with what bias been said by
the member fromn La Salle.

concernied I cannot

So far as I am

understand

why

there

should be any hesitation about delaying this

rçsolution. The honourable gentleman who
bas just spoken has said. and it is also my
understanding, that the governiment does not
propose to deal with the actual redistribut ion

this year. It is naw only the month of July,
and if this recommendation went through in
September there would stili be plenty of time

for consîderation by the Imperial Parliament,
since the Parliament of Canada is net to deal
with it thîs year.
Honourable mnembers wilh appreciate that

this is one of the most important changes that
parliament bas ever proposed to the British
North America Act. Every member of this
house should therefore have t.he fulhest oppor-

tunity to make himseif thoroughly acquainted
with what is proposed and what its effect wihh

be. But we are asked to pass t-his resolution. in
two or three daye. In my judgment that is
neither reasonable nor fair.
Hon,. Mr. DUFE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CALDER. Every member is
entitled to have the fullest opportu.nity to
study this measure at length, because, I repeat,
it is one of the most important ever introduced
in parliament. Furtherrnore, it is very complex and one must study it carefully before
coming to a condlusion as to what should be
done.
For these reasons I think the honourable
leader of the government should consider the
points which have been raised by the honourable senator from La Salle (Hon. Mr.
Moraud).

JULY 3, 1946
1 come now to section 2:
Paragraph (d) of section four of the said Acf
is repealed and the following substituted therefor:
"(d) if it consista in whole or in part of any
filthy, putrid, disgusting, rotten, decomposed or
diseased animal or vegetable substance, whether
manufactured or not, or if if is otherwise unfit
for food."
The present paragraph (d) reads as follows:
(d) if it consists wqholly or in part of any
diseased or putrid or rotten animal or vegetable
substance, whether rnanufactured or not.
It will be notcd that the words "filthy,"
"disgusting" and "decomposed" are added by
the amend.mcnt. The department desires this
amendment so as to be able to probibit the
sale of certain commodities which, althougb
perbaps not violating the provisions of paragraph (d) as it now stands, are considered f0
he unfit for human consumption. Perhaps I
might mention one instance of whicb I learned.
A certain shipment of peanut oul wbich some
importers were sceking to bring in from a
United States port, where it had been refused
cntry. was found on examination f0 contain
rat hair, rat droppings and varions other
The importers
unmentionable impurities.
argucd that this oil could be rcfined to a state
suitable for public consumption, but fortunately importation was debarred. That is only
one of a considerable number of sucb instances
with, wbicb the departmnent bas bad to deal.
Section 3 of the bill reads:
Section 6 A of the said Act, as enacted by
section two of chapter fifty-four of the statutes
of 1934, is repealed and the following substituted
therefor:
"6A. No person shaîl import, offer for sale, or
sell any food or drug represented by label or by
advertisement to the general public as a treafment for any of the diseases, disorders or abnormal physical states named, or included in
Schedule A to this Act or in any amendment t0
such Schedule."
The only cbange proposed by tbis amendment is the substitution of the words "food or
drugs" for the word "remedy." Tbe amend1
ment is requested because the word 'remedy"
is not defined ini tbe act and it is considered
that this word, if given its ordinary meaning,
migbt not include appliances wbicb are being
offered for sale for the treatmenf of certain of
the diseases named in Scbedule A, and wbicb
should be prohibited. By chapter 3 of the
statutes of 1939 a new definition of "drug" was
passed, to come into force on proclamation of
the Governor in Council.
This definition,
amongst other things, added to, tbe former
definition of drug "any article that may be
uscd for the diagnosis, treafment, mifigation
or prevention of disease in man or animal."
If was felt thaf tbe section as at present
worded would not prevent the use of certain

undesirable appliances by unscrupulous persons, and that the amendment would give
additional protection to the public.
Section 4 of the bill readls:
Part II of the said Act is repealed and Part
III of the said Act, as enacted by section nine
of chapter three of the statutes of 1939J, 15 renumbered as Part Hl.
As Part Il merely deals with honey as a
food, it is flot thought necessary to retain it,
since honjey can be adequately covered by
regulation.

He said: 1 would ask the honourable senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw)
to explain the bill.
Hon. F. W. GERSHAW: Honourable senators, it is sought by this bill te, put into legislative f orm wbat, since 1943, has been carried
on by order in council. As will be recalled,
the Soldier Settiement Act was passed in 1919.
By virtue of its provisions 25,017 soldier
settiers were placed upon the land at a cost
to the dominion government of $109,000,000.
The rate of interest payable by soldier settiers
wau fixed at 5 per cen.t on current account
and 7 per cent on arrears. 0f the original
settlcrs some 6,153 were successful and are
stili on the land, but the majority met witb
disaster and despair. They worked bard, but
poor crops and ruinously low prices made it
impossible for them to, make the payments.
The act bas been costly to the governmcnt
and a beadache f0 those charged witb its
administration. 0f course, hîndsigbt is better
than foresight, and now everyone realizes that
mistakes were made. The purchase price,
paid for land, some of it utterly unsuitable

for farming, was too high; the cost of implements and livestock was also very high, and
some of the settlers were unfitted for farîn
life. The whole set-up was based on the
then high price of wheat, ranging from $2.50
to $3 a bushel, a price which very quickly
fell to 38 cents a bushel.
The government has received in repayment
of principal $50,000,000 and about $25,000,000
on account of interest. It has from time to
time cancelled $24,867,000 on principal account
and about $19,000.000 on interest account. The
soldier settlers still on the faim owe the government about $5,400,000.
In another place, both in the Veterans Committee and in the bouse, the bill was debated
at great length and generally endorsed. The
only objection was that it did not go far
enough, that all indebtedness should be cancelled. There were some complaints about the
administration of the act.
The bill is short and simple. By section 76
the interest rate for certain soldier settlers
who served in World War Il is reduced from
5 per cent to 3½ per cent from and after the
standard date in 1942 or the date of enlistment,
whichever is the earlier. The "standard date"
is an arbitrary date, being the first of October
in Manitoba and the other western provinces
and the first day of November in the provinces
east of Manitoba.
By section 77 there is a similar reduction
in the interest rate for soldier settlers even
thougli they did not serve in the forces in
World War No. II, but the reduction takes
effect from and after the standard date in
1944.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: I agree more or
less with what was stated in another place,
that all the indebtedness now owing by the
soldier settlers should be cancelled; but I
understand the Senate lias no power to amend
the bill in that respect. The proposed reduction of interest from 5 per cent to 31 per
cent will afford some relief. I have no objection to the bill being given second reading.

WOMEN'S ROYAL NAVAL SERVICES
AND SOUTH AFRICAN MILITARY
NURSING SERVICE (BENEFITS)
BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 200, an Act respecting benefits
for persons wlio served in the Women's Royal
Naval Services and tîhe South African Military
Nursing Service.
He said: Honourable senators. I woild ask
the honourable senator from Summerside
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) to explain this bill.
Hon. BREWER ROBINSON: Honourable
senators. ma' I sav first that the Women's
Royal Naval Service, conimonly known in
England as the Wrens. in which women of
Canadian domicile served during the war, is
not recognized as the equivalent of a military
organization in the same sense as the wonen's
division of the Royal Air Force · r of the
o
army. For that reason the Canadian girls who
werc in the W.R.N.S. are not eligible to receive
lthe rehabilitation benefit.s provided for by
the statutes Of Canada. This bill is intended
to enable thtemo to secure the same benefits as
other veterans.
Hon.

Mr.

ASEI.TINE:

It

nakes

tlii

Hon. Mr. IOBINSON: Yes, it makes them
veterans. ind as cterans thery are entitled to
rehîabilitation benefits.
Inclided in this same group are persons
enroled in another body well known in the
United Kingdom. Queen Alexandra's Royal
Naval Nuirsing Service and also niedical or
dental practitioners serving witih the mtedical
or the dental branch of the Royal Navy. The
personncl of these organizations comprise the
first group to which the bill refers. Fifty or
sixtv Canadian girls are said to come within
this category. but it is difficult to know their
exact number because they performed their
services in England at various periods during
the war.
The second group. known as the South
.frican Military Nursing Service, was enrolled
in Canada-they were not enlisted-the Depart ment of National Defence acting as agent
for the South African goveronment. I understand there are nearly three hundred girls in
this category, and like the Wrens in England
they are not recognized as having belonged
to a military organization. It is intended by
this bill to place them in the position of
veterans, so that they may receive rehabilitation and other benefits to which veterans are
entitled.

JULY 3, 1946
Briefly, lionourable senators, tliat covers tlie
provisions of tlie bull, and I believe it sliouid
receive favourable consideration.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: May I lie permitted
to ask tlie lionourable senator what would lie
the cost of recognizing these people as
veterans?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I am not in a position to -answer that question directly. I can
say that it will confer on these young women,
wliose domicile is in Canada, the same riglits
and privileges tliey would 'have enjoyed lad
tliey served during tlie war witli a similar
organization estaliislied by the government
of Canada.
Hon. Mr. DESSUREAULT: What did they
do?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: The Wrens are well
known as part of the naval service of the
United Kingdom. Tliey rendered a service
similar to that performed in many parts of
tlie world by the CWACs and tlie Women's
Division of the Air Force, or by the ATS in
England.
Hon. N. McL. PATERSON: Honourable
senators, may I be permitted to say a few
words regarding Canadian girls serving overseas? Tlie St. John's Ambulance Association,
in whicli I succeeded tlie late Honourable
Senator Coté as Hospitalier and Almoner,
had tlie privilege of sending some 125 girls
overseas. The first contingent went at its
own expense, and its members were aIl tlirough
the blitz. Some 90 of these girls are stili overseas, and will return as time and opportunity
permits. The Red Cross, during thé same
period, sent 300 or 400 persons overseas.
We wished to have the services of the St.
John's Ambulance girls recognîzed in some
manner-by a medal, by recognition as veterans, or at least by having the government
tliank themn for their services--but so far we
have been unable to get themn any public
recognition. At one time we furnislied them
with a riblion to show that they lad been
overseas, but some officer ordered tliem to
remove it. We are still seeking to have the
government approve of a joint Red Cross and
St. Johin's Ambulance medal, because we
believe that is the least we can do. We could
not use the King's effigy on the medal, as that
lias been forbidden in most colonies and
dominions. We were allowed to use tlie Canadian coat of arma, however, and a joint medal
was prepared for tlie girls of the St. John's
Ambulance Association and the Red Cross
Society, but unless it is recognized by the
government it is useless. It is only a souvenir, for they cannot wear a rilibon.
63268-29

I have taken this opportunity of calling
attention to the fact that these girls have
flot been recognized in any way because it is
my opinion that if we are going to put througb
such measures as this bill provides for, our
own girls should receive some consideration.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: I heartily agree with
the honourable gentleman that those who
served with St. John's Ambulance Association
are equally entitled to recognition. I understand that a sub-committee on veterans affairs
lias this matter under consideration, and from
certain remarks made in another place I gather
that a report wili lie submitted and some
action will lie taken.
Hon. Mrs. WILSON: Honourable senators,
the members of the Soutli African Military
Nursing Service covered by this bill are
Canadian registered nurses wlio, in the early
1
days of the war, seeing no immediate prospect
of getting overseas with the Canadian forces,
responded to, the eall for nurses from. the
Government of South Africa. They received
lower remuneration than the nur~sing sisters ini
the Canadian forces who, I think. have feht al
along tliat this discrimination was unjust.
I tliank the
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON:
lionourable senator for giving this additîonal
information. At noon today wlien I saw the
bill applied to members of the South African
Military Nursing Service 1 was somewhat at a
loss. I was out of tlie country when that unit
was formed liere, and so liad no knowledge of
it, but I arn now informed tliat the Department of National Defence acted as agent for
the Southi African government in securing
duly qualified registered nurses to volunteer
for service in Southi Africa.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I would like to ask a
question of tlie lionourable senator who explained tlie bill (Hon. Mr. Robinson). Let us
take two young women wlio -eniisted in the
naval services during the early part of tlie
war. Each was put into uniform and became
subject to naval discipline, buit one wau sent
to act as a stenograplier in a naval office in
London, England, wliereas tlie other was
assigned to a similar position at Naval Headquarters here. Does this bllI draw a distinction
between those two young women, or do they
botli participate in ail tlie benefits made available to combat men wlio risked their lives
week after week and month after month on the
field of battle?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: It is a little difficult
to, answer that question. Tlie bill relates to
women domniciied in Canada prior to the war
who, after the outbreak of war, volunteered
for service in wliat is known as tlie Wrens--

REVISELD
EDITION

SENATE
not the Canadian Wrens, but the English
Wrens-and served in that branch. A Wren
would be subject to naval discipline and would
have to serve wherever she was ordered to go;
she would have no say as ta whether she
should be sent to one place or another.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: But it would be
outside of Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If she was in the
Wrens, ber service would of course be outside
Canada. Our own Women's Royal Canadian
Naval Service is a Canadian organization,
every member of which is entitled to certain
benefits regardless. of whether she served in
Canada or abroad. A member of the Wrens
who served in England would be entitled to
wear the Canadian volunteer medal with the
maple leaf, indicating service outside Canada.
This bill relates to Canadian members of the
Women's Royal Naval Service, an organization under the control of the Royal Navy.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Will they receive any
recognition from the British government for
the services they rendered in England?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If I understand correctly, no Canadian who served in other than
Canadian forces would receive the volunteer
medal.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: What I had in mind
was the benefits. I am very ignorant of this
whole thing and would like some information.
I take it that this bill would make Canadian
women who enlisted in the Women's Royal
Naval Service, a British unit, eligible for all
the benefits to which woimen who serv-cd in
Canadian units are entitled.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Can my honourable
friend say whether or not Canadian women
who were in the Women's Royal Naval Service would receive any benefits from the
British government.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: They would receive
the same pay and be subject to the same discipline as the thousands of Engish girls who
served in that unit.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If the Wrens were
recognized in the same sense as the girls
attached to the Royal Air Force, they would
receive all the benefits to which veterans are
entitled. However, because of the technicality
of non-recognition of the Women's Royal
Naval Service in the British law, the Wrens
receive no benefits in England; but one of the
objects of the present bill is to make Canadian
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON.

members of the organization eligible for benefits in this country. I believe honourable members will agree that a girl who served with the
navy rendered as useful service to her country
as if she had been in the Air Force.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Would benefits be paid
to some women by both the Canadian government and the British government?
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: If a Canadian
woman served in the Royal Air Force her
remuneration would be supplemented to make
it equal to what it would have been if she
had served in the Royal Canadian Air Force.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable senators, the subject matter of this bill is entirely
new to most of us. Its scope is very farreaching. The bill would make every woman
who served in the organizations mentioned a
"veteran" as defined in the Veterans' Land
Act, the Veterans Insurance Act, the Veterans
Rehabilitation Act and the Veterans' Allowance Act. It is my opinion that a great deal
of money will be necessary to take care of
these women in years to come. Some of them
may be financially assisted to take up land
and go into farming, and those who become
ill and unable to look after themselves will
be entitled to remuneration under the Veterans'
Allowance Act. It seems to me that this bill
requires a great deal of study, and I think it
should be sent to a committee, where detailed
information may be obtained. I do not know
to wiat commtitee the reference should be
made. The Committee on Banking and Commerce is already overworked.
lon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If second reading
is given to the Railway Bill, which is the next
item on the order paper, it will be sent to the
Committee on Transport and Communications. Perhaps this bill could bo sent to that
committee.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

RAILWAY BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Robertson for the second reading of Bill 138,
an Act to amend the Railway Act.
Honourable
Hon. VINCENT DUPUIS:
senators, the purpose of this bill is to amend
sections 310 (1) and 421 (1) (g) of the Railwav

JULY 3, 1946
Act. May I say at the ouýtset that I have
been requested, by one of my colleagues
to "railroad" the bill. I would remind bim
that in this act there is a subsection wbich prohibité in certain circumstances a speed in
excess of ten miles an hour, and I must abide
by the law.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.
Hon.. Mr. DUPUIS: Perhnps it would. be well
to give a brief hýistory of section 310. Originally it was section 276 of the Railway Act of
1901, wbich stipulated:
Whenever in any city, town or village, any
train is passing over or along a highway at rail
level, and ia not headed by an engine moving
forward in the ordinary manner, t, e company
shaîl station on that part of the train, or of
the tender if that is in front, which is then
foremost, a person who shaîl warn persons stand.
ing on, or crossing, or about to cross the track
of such railway.
The railway brotherbood strongly objected
to the posting of a man on the tender, and; in
1917 the words "or of the tender if that is in
front" were deletcd. That meant that when
a train which was moving backward consisted
of only the engine and tender it wo.uld no
longer be neeessary to have a man on the
tender to warn people off the track. However,
after an accident which occurred in Hull the
Privy Council decided that an, engine and
tender constituted a train, and. this interpretation again made it necessary to place a man on
the tender. This was contrary to the intention
of parliament, and the purpose of the bill is
to give effect to that intention. Of course,, if
a train coneists of a number of cars in addition
to the engîne and tender, the-re bas to be a
man on the back whcn the train is moving in
reverse.
An Hon. SENATOR: The back of the train
then becomes the front.
H-on. Mr. DUPUIS: Yes. As the original
section reads, in the event of an accident the
burden of proof would be on the railway
company on the grounL that there being no
man on the tender tbe level crossing wvas not
adequately protected. It is proposed to -amend
the section to -rend:
310. (1) Whenever in any city, town or vilIage, any train, not headed by an engine or its
tender, is passing over or along a higlhway at
rail level which is not adequately protected by
gates or otherwise, the company shaîl station on
that part of the train, which is then foremost, a
person who shall warn persons standing on, or
crossing, or about to cross the track of such
railway.
That is, the words "or its tender" are inserted
to relieve railway companies from the requirement that a man be stationed on the tender
to warn persons_ when the engine and tender
are mioving reversely over level crossings. This
63268--29J

433

too, will evade the consequence of the judgment of the Privy Council to which 1 have
referred.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will the honourable
gentleman explain why it is necessary to
"evade" the consequence of the judgment?
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Experience has proven
that it is no longer necessary to have a man
stationed on the tender. The engincer in his
cab is in a much better position to warn
persons on the crossing.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Yes; but I understood
the honourable gentleman to say that an
accident happened, and that as there was
not a man stationed on the tender the privy
council beld that the railway company was
at fault.
Hon. Mr. DUPIJIS: The privy council
decided that an engine and tender constitute
a train. In 1942, acting on the representations of the railway brotherhoods, the government passed an order in council amending the
section by addýing the words "or its tender".
It is now proposed to give that amendment
statutory authority.
The amendment contained in section 2 is
consequential on the preceding amendment,
which 1 have explained.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: If 1 understand the
honourable senator, this amendment was first
made for the protection of members of the
railway brotherhoods. What about the protection of the public?
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Let me cite the words
of Sir Henry Drayton in this connection:
In the opinion of the operating departm"nt of
the Board of Railway Commissioners, a man on
the tender when the engine leads the movenient.
although backing, serves no useful purpose. In
the case of almost every engine, as a matter of
fact, the engineer has ýat ]east as good if not a
better view of the track in front of him as in
the case of a front movement, a tender nearly
always being shorter than the houler and other
e!ngine works in front of the cab; and, in the
case of a reverse niovement, as a usual thing.
there is no possibility of the view heing ohscured
either by smoke or steani.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The engineer would not
be able to warn people on the track.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Yes; hie is in a better
position than the man on the tender to blow
bis. whistle or ring bis bell.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The man on the tender
could warn people on the track 'by shoutîng at
them.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Trains must proeeed
over a level crossing at a speed not faster
t.han ten miles an heur, with bell ýringing to
warn the public.
The motion was agreed to, a.nd the bill waa
read the second time.

lion. S. A. HAYDEN moved the second
reading of Bill 9, an Act to incorporate Prescott
and Ogdensburg Bridge Company,
H1e said: This bill provides for the incorporation of a company for the purpose of
constructing a bridge across or a tunnel under
the St. Lawrence river between Prescott and
Ogdensburg. A similar bill was passed in 1939
authorizing the construction of a bridge only.
Tien the war intervened and the work was net
procecded with. In the interval the time
limitation ran out, and it is necessary therefore to come back to parliament for a renewal
of authority. A new company is to be incorporated to takc over whatever ass5ets and
liabilities there may be of the carlier company.
There is a time limit imposed within which
approval of the Governor in Council and also
of the St. Lawrence Bridge Commission of the
State of New York must be obtained. There is
aIso a time limait within which the work must
be commenced, and finished.

completed within thiree years thercafter.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: What wotild be the

and the prescrnt bridges?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There is a bridge near
Brockville,

about

forty-five

miles west, and

another bridge at Cornwall, about forty-five
miles the other way. There bas been an agitation on hoth sides of the river for more direct
access to the thicklv populated parts of the

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Until sncb time as the

the approaches on the American end being, I

of each decennial census, and that on any
such readjustment the number of members
for a province sh-all not be reduced unless the
proportion which the number of the population
of the province bore to the number of the
aggregate population of Canada at the then
last preceding readjustment of the number of
members for the province is ascertained at the
then latest census to be diminished by one
twentieth part or upwards;
And whereas the effect of the aforesaid provisions has not been satisfactory in that proportionate representation of the provinces according to population has not been maintained;
And whereas it is considered that a more
equitable apportionment of members to the
various provinces could be effected if readjustment were made on the basis of the population
of all the provinces taken as a whole:
A humble address be presented to His Majesty
the King in the following words:To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracious Sovereign:
We, Your Majesty's

most dutiful and loyal

subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament
assembled, humbly approach Your Majesty,
praying that You may graciously be pleased
to cause a measure to be laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom to be expressed
as follows:An Act to provide for the readjustment of
representation in the House of Commons of
Canada on the basis of the population of
Canada;
Whereas the Senate and House of Commons
of Canada in Parliament assembled have submitted an address to His Majesty praying that
His Majesty may graciously be pleased to cause
a Bill to be laid before the Parliament of the
United Kingdom for the enactment of the provisions hereinafter set forth;
Be it therefore enacted by the King's Most
Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and
consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, 'and by the authority of the same
as follows:
1. Section fifty-one of the British North
America Act, 1867, is hereby repealed and the
following substituted therefor:
51. (1) The number of members of the
House of Commons shall be two hundred and
fifty-five and the representation of the provinces therein shall forthwith upon the coming
into force of this section and thereafter on the
completion of each decennial census be readjusted by such authority. in such manner, and
from such time as the Parliament of Canada
from time to time provides, subject and according to the following Rules:
1. Subject as hereinafter provided, there shall
be assigned to each of the provinces a number
of members computed by dividing the total
population of the provinces by two hundred
and fifty-four and by dividing the population
of each province by the quotient so obtained,
disregarding, except as hereinafter in this section provided, the remainder, if any, after the
said process of division.
2. If the total number of members assigned
to all the provinces pursuant to Rule One is
less than two hundred and fifty-four, additional members shall be -assigned to the provinces (one to a province) having remainders in
the computation under Rule One commencing
with the province having the largest remainder
and continuing with the other provinces in the
order of the magnitude of their respective

435

remainders until the total number of members
assigned is Two hundred and fifty-four.
3. Notwithstanding anything in this section,
if upon the completion of a computation under
Rules One and Two, the number of members to
be assigned to a province is less than the
number of senators representing the said province, Rules One and Two shall cease to apply
in respect of the said province, and there shall
be assigned to the said province a number of
members equal to the said number of senators.
4. In the event that Rules One and Two
cease to apply in respect of a province then, for
the purpose of computing the number of members to be -assigned to the provinces in respect
of which Rules One and Two continue to apply.
the total population of the provinces shall be
reduced by the number of the population of
the province in respect of which Rules One
and Two have ceased to apply and the number
two hundred and fifty-four shall be reduced by
the number of members assigned to such province pursuant to Rule Three.
5. Such readjustment shall not take effect
until the termination of the then existing
Parliýament.
(2) The Yukon Territory as constituted by
Chapter forty-one of the Statutes of Canada,
1901, together with any part of Canada not
comprised within a province which may from
time to time be included therein by the Parliament of Canada for the purposes of representation in Parliament, shall be entitled to one
member.
2. This Act may be cited as the British North
America Act, 1946, and the British North
America Acts, 1867 to 194,3, the British North
America Act, 1907 and this Act may be cited
together as the British North America Acts,

Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: For a lawyer, he
showed an astonishing knowledge of mathematics, and his calculations were easily followed. I fear that when he decided to take
up the study of the law the teaching profession lost a valuable professor of mathematics.
While I accept his figures, I cannot accept
his constitutional argument. At first glance
I was of opinion that the subject-matter of
the resolution concerned mainly the House of
Commons, but upon further consideration I
have come to the conclusion that it is one
of the most important questions we have had
to deal with for many a day. We are asked
to pass legislation to amend the British North
America Act in an entirely new way. If the
resolution passes this chamber it is bound to
meet with the approval of the British parliament, irrespective of the representations made
to that parliament by the individual provinces.
From its inception the Senate bas been
considered the guardian of provincial rights.
In this instance the provinces have not been

436

SENATE

consulted. Therefore we in this chamber wiil
be remiss in our duty if we do flot examine
carefuliy the whoie question of whether or flot
the Parliament of Canada can legaliy do what
is suggested by this motion. Surely the
Fathers of Confederation neyer for a moment
anticipated that the federai parliament wouid
assume authority, without consulting the
provinces, to makze changes in tise act of confederation whicbi xouid affect the whioie Canadian set-up and might seriousiy affect our
]aws, liberties, traditions and ways of life.
1 for one was shocked to read that tihe
federai Minister of Justice, who was responsible for the motion in the other place, had
gone so far as to say tliat tise Parliament of
Canada lias within itseif thse power to make
represcotations to the Imperiai Parliament to
amrnd any part of our constitution, other than
sections 91 and 92 of the British North America
Act, xitisout consuiting tise provinces. 1 think
tisat is a fair statement of whiat was said in
the otlier place. Thie mimister was asked if
lie wouid inelude tise repeai of section 133 of
tihe British North Amnerica Act, which proteets
the French language in titis country. lis
answer scas, yes. If by a reso1ution sucs as
titis the Parliament of Canada were to sucIs
cessfu iiy petit ion th cJusscrilt lart cinmc n t e
o f i Ne art, il
do aa av witis that sectio
seems to me it wouid be takinig a, xery drastie
and entirely illegai step. Appareutiy the minister based his argumsent on Professor Kennedy's
xxork on constitutionai law. Professor Kenurd stalecd before a pariiansentary committee
dv
in 1935 tisat isarliament could go even furthcr
and recommend amcndments tu section 92,
wisiciî defines provincial riglits. Tiserefore,' if
the resolution we are now eonsidering passes,
we may in a few years find ourseives faced
%viti anotiser resolution advocating an amendlient to section 92. In my opinion members of
this chansber shouid most emphaticaliy reject
suds an intcrpretation.

in the House of Commons as the champion of
During a debate in
constitutional rights.
that louse in the session of 1906-07 he made
a speech to the effect that the provinces should
be consulted when changes in ·the British
North America Act wee being considered.
Sir Robert Borden speaking in the same debate, as reported at page 2199 of the House of
Commons Hansard, replied as follows:
I agree with what has been said by the right
honourable gentleman regarding the undesirability of lightly amending the terms of our
constitution and am inclined to agree with him
on the necessity of some consultation with the
provinces, although of course all the provinces
are represented here.
Further he said:
But inasmuch as this is a federal compact
which we are .asked to vary, it is only right that
each province should be consulted and its decision given, in the right of its separate entity.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would the honourable
senator permit a question? I should like to
ask him if it is not a fact that Sir Robert
Borden, whom he is now quoting, headed the
government of this country in 1915 when the
Imperial Parliament amended the British
North America Act in connection with the constitution of the Senate? May I ask further
if it is not a fact that on that -occasion the
provinces were not consulted and-except for
Prince Edward Island, which took it upon
itself to make certain representations-did not
consent?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I may say that upon
looking up the record I find there was an interprovincial conference in the month of November, 1913, the proceedings of which were
reported. At that conference Prince Edward
Island made out a case, but it was not considered or dealt with because the conference
was not called for that purpose. I understand
that in 1914 another conference was held with
regard t this matter. The proceedings of that
conference were not printed, but I am told
that the resolution which changed the representation of the Senate throughout Canada was
initiated in 1914 though it was not until 1915
that a decision was made as to what should
be done. In the meantime all the provinces
were consulted or at least had an opportunity
to state their views.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That is not in accordance with the evidence given before the House
of Commons committee in 1935. Dr. Skelton,
who was a witness before that committee,
specifically stated that the provinces were not
consulted and did not consent, although Prince
Edward Island did make certain recommendations. I apologize to the honourable senator
for the interruption.

437

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I have stated my
understanding of the situation, and the
interruption does not worry me in the least.
On February 10, 1914, Sir Robert Borden,
as reported at page 612 of House of Commons
Hansard, spoke as follows:
The terms which were then fixed between the
four original provinces undoubtedly constituted
a compact between those provinces, and up to
the present time they have, of course, been carried out according to the true intent and meaning of the statute.
That remark was made in connection with
the debate following the holding of the interAgain in 1914 Sir
provincial conferences.
Robert Borden, speaking of the interprovincial
conference held in Ottawa in the fall of 1913,
is reported as follows:
Speaking for myself, I do not sec how it would
be possible for this parliament to attempt any
alteration in the representation of the provinces
without the consent of the provinces themselves.
It was in that connection that the question was
taken up before the interprovincial conference
held last autumn in the city of Ottawa, and the
result of the proceedings of that conference
amounted to this, that the conference declined
to take any action on the subject, saying that
the matter was one for consideration of parliament.
I sho'uld like to make an explanation of the
phrase "saying that the matter was one for
consideration of parliament." What Sir Robert
meant was that if parliament thought an
alteration in the representation of the provinces was advisable, a conference would be
called for the purpose of hearing what they
had to say and to get their consent.
On February 19, 1925, at page 335 of the
House of Commons Hansard, the Right
Honourable Arthur Meighen, P.C. made the
following statement:
Undoubtedly the pact of confederation is a
contract and there are rights involved therein
not represented by the Parliament of Canada.
We could not put ourselves in the position of
asking that rights so secured should be disturbed
on our motion alone. The speech of the Minister
of Justice determines, I think, without power
of dispute, that there should never be suggestion
of amendment affecting other parties to the contract save after conference and consent of those
other parties.
I come now to certain statements made by
the late Honourable Ernest Lapointe. Speaking on the British North America Act on
March 20, 1924, he said, as reported at page
20 of Hansard for that year
It is a treaty between various colonies which
entered into an -agreement. They fixed what the
powers of the central parliament should be, and
thev also fixed what the powers of the various
provinces which succeeded the colonies of tbhat
time would be, and this was ratified and accepted
by the Imperial Parliament of the time. Everything we have or have not is because we wanted
it so. Now this treaty cannot be changed-it

SENATE
lias been the contention cf many constitutienal
authorities, anti I think it is enly fair tbat ne
change shouid lie accepted, witliout the consent
nf ail those wlso were parties to it. It is a
sacred treaty just as is any other treaty; it is
no "scrap of paper."
On IFcbicar 5 18. 1925, Mr. Lapointe again
.s1 oke on thi', subject. I arn reading frem
Homsard at page 297:
If confederation was a part, an agreement, is
it possible for one of tihe parties to tise agreement, or ratier for tise body which rýesulte

nor in the statute itself is there any stipulation
that the provinces should be consulted or the
consent of even a majority of tbem obtained?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 1 have not been able
to, find anything to, that effect. It will be
remembered that I read a statement concerning the Australian constitution, which contains
a section giving the federal parliament power
to amend the constitution without consulting
the states. It seems to me that if, when the
Brit.ish North America Act was passed, it had
heen intended to give our federal parliament
such power, a similar provision would have
been placed in that statute.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: My honourable friend
quoted a letter which Mr. Godbout wrote at
a time when he thougbt Quebec did not have
its fair share of representation in another
place. Does my honourable friend think Mr.
Godbout would complain at the proposai to
give his province eight more friends there?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I am sorry that I
cannot hear my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Mr. Godbout, was complaining in 1943Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I cannet hear what
is being said.
Hon. Mr. LES AGE: -because he thought
Quebec did not have as many representatives
as it should have in the other house. Does
my honourable friand think ha would complain now of tha proposai to increase the
number of rapresentatives by eight?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: 1 could not hear
what my bonourabia friand was saying.
This rasolution involves a very dangerous
precadent. When the prairie provinces joinad
confaderation thay wera fuily aware of the
fact that section 51 of the British North
America Act was part of the agreement hy
which they ware willing to ba bound. Therafore thay could not complain if at the present
tima tbey did losa temporarily a few members
in the other house. Tha only contention of
thesa provinces is. that redistribution should
ba delayad until the 1946 census is compieted,
in order that it may ha ascertained whether
tha displacad population bas raturned. They
are not asking for the suggastad amandment.
Naithar is Quebec asking for it, and, as far
as 1 can learn, nona of the othar provinces
are. Therefora I make this suggestion. Let
us stand by the prasent agreemant for anothar
parliament. 1 arn satisfied that by 1951, whan
the naxt cansus is taken, things will have
righted themseivas and the western provinces
will have ragaînad population entitling them
te the number of mambars wbich. tbay would
temporarily losa under the proposed redistribution.

Honourable sanators, I intand ito vote againet
the rasolution.
Hon. L. MOR.AUD: Honourabla membelrs,
1 had hoped that the dabate on this resolution
would have bean launched soonar in this
chambar, or that it would ha postpnd until
after the racess, so that a more authoritativa
voice than my own, that of the honourable
senator from Grandville (Sir Thomas Chapais),
might have expressed the opposition of the
Quebec members of my party to the proposed
measure and emphasized the grave reasons
that justify such opposition. Son of one of
the Fathýers of Confedieration, our venerable
colleague is one of the few survivors of the
era that witnessed the birth of confadaration.
He bas made a thorough study and written
a history of that pariod, and is espacially
qualified to deal with the issues we are now
debating. I hope bis illness wvill be of short
duration, and that for many years he may
remnain with us to shed lustre on this chamber.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Ilear, hear.
lon. Mr. MORATD: Since tha start of
the debate in another place, our colleagua
from Grandville has often impartad to me
bis daap-saatad conviction that this resolution
violates the spirit and letter of the confedieration pact, and that it devolves upon the
Sanate to prevant the' perpet ration of sucb a
violation. As a matter of fact, the legislative
bodly to which we belong in a two-chamber
system was created hy the Fathars of Confaderatien "te be a check upon the lowar
bouse", Cauchon said:
We ougbt to place in tha constitution a counterpoise te prevant any party legisiation, and to
moderate the pracipitancy of any governmant
which migbt ba disposed te moea too f ast and go
tee f ar. I Inean a lagislative body able te proteet the people against itself and against the encroachment of power.
We now find ourselvas confrontad by a
measure with respect te whic.h the Senate
must proteet the people against itsalf.
Hon. Mr. DTJFF: Hear. hear.
lion. Mr. MORAUD: I do net care te
discuss the problem involvaed in datarmining
whether this resolution is favourable or unfavourable te one province or anethar, or te
aIl tha provinces. I am even ready te acknowledge that the new systamn of electoral
redistribution is, in present circumnstancas, an
equitable measura calculated te render justice
te the diffarent parts of the country.
We must, however, bear in mmnd that tha
government dacided it could modify section
51 of the Britisb North Amarica Act witbout.

SENATE

the provinces, because it feared it could not
secure their consent; but it adopted and
declared this policy, thereby asserting the
principle that the provisions of the British
North America Act can be modified without
the consent of the provinces. The government therefore takes the position that the
provinces are allowed to express their opinion
only on matters vested in them specifically by
the terms of the act, and have no say whatsoever on matters assigned to federal jurisdiction.
That is the principle which this chamber
would sanction by adopting the resolution.
This would ignore the very nature of our
constitution, and the fact that within its
framework, apart from strictly provincial and
strictly federal questions, there arise questions
that one may teirm mixed. It would be idle
to repeat the theories that have been developed
on one side or the other in support of the
contention that our constitution is a legal
pact or simply an act of parliament. I refrain
froin recalling to your attention the numerous
opinions voiced by statesmen of other days
and of both political parties. I will spare
you many citations I could furnish from
judgments of the Privy Council. It is. however, an established fact tiat but for the Charlottetown and Quebec conferences, where
representatives of both races and of the
different provinces discussed the formn
of
the proposed constitution, the parliament at
Westminster would never have passed the
British North America Act.
Wiether or not a truly legal pact was
concluded between the two races and between
the provinces, it is unquestionable that between
the Fathers of Confederation and the interested
parties they represented there was a "gentleman's agreement," and at common law this
remains for us a political agreement which
none of the parties bas the riglt to violate.
Hon. Mr. DUFF:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD:
The first words of
the Boitish North America Act say so
implicitly:
Whereas the provinces of Canada, Nova
Scotia, and New Brunswick, have expressed
their desire to be federally united into one
dominion.
Moreover, from 1867 te about 1930 the
theory of a legal pact was admitted by all.
During the war of 1914-18 a certain degree
of centralization was deemed necessary to
enable Canada to continue the struggle alongside of ber allies, but at its conclusion the
provinces were able to recover what little
Hon.

Ir. MORAUD.

autonomy they had lest, and between 1920
and 1930 we witnessed a real expansion of
provincial rights.
This was, so to speak,
the golden age of provincial administrations.
It was at the end of this period that the
premier of Ontario, Honourable Howard
Ferguson, with the support of the premier
of Quebec, Honourable Alexandre Tascliereau, was able in a document dated September 10, 1930,-a document that is now
famous--to confirm what up till then liad
been acknowledged as of common law, namely,
that confede-ration constituted a legal pact.
On the other hand, certain facts and circumstances seem to liave given birth to the
eontrary legal theory. The exigencies of the
battle waged against unemployment gave rise
to the belief that in order to cope with the
cisis it was necessary to centralize administration and government in Ottawa as muci as
possible. Apparently it was in the face of this
neces-itv that there first sprang up among certain university professors the idea tiat our
conttiîtioii w as not a solemn pact, but
mere lv a Briisi -tatute, aiendable by the
parliament at Westmiseur just like any other
British statute. Mr. Norman McLeod Rogers,
late Mini-er of Labour and tien Minister of
National Defence in the King government, in
a paper read before the Canadian Political
Science Association-a paper that has become
i Claissic-stated thbat the theory of confederation bcing a pact was erroneous and exposed
the country to grave danger. Later, other
university professors casme forward to support
and develop Mr. Rogers' theory, and for a
long time it continued to be the subject of
academie discussion.
During the war, and particularly in the
present post-war period, we have witnessed as
never before the development of a policy of
centralization-a policy that is said to be
necessary for the preservation of our national
ceconomy and the implementation of social
securit
meaSuiires.
Once again facts have
brougit to the surface the legal theory that
the British North America Act is an ordinary
statute that may be aimended without the
consent of the provinces. This assertion is
made with reference to section 51, not so mucli
because of the section itself, but because the
purpose is to repeat a precedent tisat will
make it possible to modify our constitution
more easily in the future. lt is needless to
recall to honourable menbers the force of
trecedent in Englih constitutional law. That
which one aims to accomplish tomorrow
becoes casier by reason of what one succeeded in accomplishiing yesterday.
This
centralizing theory becomes very dangerous in
its ultimsate conse que
inces. Those who uplhold

JULY 3, 1946
the theory I have referred to in relation to
section 51 are compelled to admit that other
sections of our constitution can be modified
wjthout the consent of the provinces. Thus it
lias heen stated that section 133, which recogiîizes thei duality of language in CanadaFrench and English-could ho amended without the advice of the provinces, and especially
without, the assent of the province whorein the
Frenchi group constitutes a majerity. This, I
believe, overlooks the fact that our constitutien includes net enly strictly federal matters
aed strictly provincial matters. but aise mixed
questions.
These mixed questions at first
-lance and from a strictly legal standpoint
may seem to pertain solely to the federal geverninent, but at the same time, directly or
indirectly, they interest the provinces and the
two great races of the couintry. For example(luality of language, the Senate. representation
in the House of Commons, are so many
mixed questions. Thus, honourable members,
if we should accept the prieciple the goverement now pets forth in this resolution we
should jeopardize the very existence of the
legisiative body to wbich we belong.
May I be permitted to recaîl the fact
that the Sonate was created te protect what
one may caîl the sectional rights of the country? Ie 1S65, in the course of the debate on
confederation, Sir John Macdoeald made this
statement:
In order te pretect local interests and te provent sectional jealeusies. it was feuiid requisite
that the three great divisionsThere are now four.
-inte which British -North Amierica is separated, sheuld ho represented ie the uppor chamber on the principle of equality.
The Sonate having thus been created to
protect minorities and the provinces, its disappearance wouid ho a political biow dealt at
the very heart of confederation. Hence it
seems te me important that this ho not rendered legaliy possible without the consent of
the provinces. One must flot be led to believe
that this possible disappearance of the Sonate
is a more figment of the imagination. It is
conceivablo that a leftist party might seize
office some day and in the lower house propose
the abolition of the Sonate. Is such a measure
net an important plank in the platform of the
C.C.F. party? If you read the manifesto
adopted in 1933 at the first national convention of the C.C.F. party in Regina, a manifesto which still constitutes that party's creed,
yen will note that the last paragraph of
article 9 dealing with the British North
America Act is as follows:
The Canadian Sonate, which was origieally
created te pretect provincial rights, but has
f ailed even ini this function, bias developed into
63268-30J

a bulwark of capitalist intorests, as is illustrated
by the largo number of company directorships
held by its a od mombors. In its poculiar composition of a Wxed number of members appointod
fer if e it is one of the mest reactienary assomblios in the civilizod world. It is a standing
obstacle te ail progressive Iegislation, and the
only permaneetly satisfactory metbod of dealing
with the ceestitutional difficulties it croates is
te abolish it.
Hon. Mr. DUFF: Shame!
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I may ho told that
even if the lower chamber adopted a reselutien asking lis Majesty te abolish the Sonate,
our assembly would naturally refuse te subscribe te it. The Sonate ne doubt would ho
able te hold eut for a time against a leftist
governmen.t, but through the mecbanism of
section 26 of the British North America Act,
or by what we caîl "swamping", it would
become easy te secure. je this very assembly
a ma.ierity favourable te its abolition. In
relatively few years--as we are ail tee sadîy
aware-the appointment of senators who prier
te appeintment had promised te do away with
the Sonate would render possible the abolition
of this chamber. The grievous thing would ho
net, the disappearanýce of the Sonate itself but
the wiping eut of the protection which by its
very nature this body ensuros te, minorities
and te the established social system-a system
which nobody doubts is open te imprevement,
but which at aIl eývents hias repeatedly demenstrated its national usefulness.
But at the moment when the existence ef
the Sonate was imperilled there would ho
invoked, were it well establisbed, the legal
necessity for consultation of the provinces on
mixed questions.
Sncb consultation would
undoubtedly remain the best guaranteo for the
survival of our assombiy. One may deduce
from such an emergency how necessary it is
that the provinces 'be consulted en mixed
questions.
Had it been the belief of the French group
je British North America at the time of confedieration that .some day it would ho prevented
from putting forward a viewpeint on mýixed
questions, it nover wouid have agreed te
hand over te the English majority of the
federal goernment complote jnrisdiction over
these mattors. Moreover, when in the past the
provinces deemed they had beon wronged
in matters of electeral redistribution, they
speke as provinces. For instance, there is the
now fameus case of Prince Edward Island in
1905, te which, reference bias often been made
in receet years. If henourablo senators refer
te Law Reports-Appoal Cases at page 37, they
will observe that it was the AttorneyGeneral of the Province of Prince Edward
Island who, presented the argument of bis
piovinee against the Attorney-General for

SENATE
the Dominion of Canada. The province did
flot speak tbrough its fedieral members, but
through the medium of its goveroment, by
way of referece.
We sheould nlot believe, that the present
attitude of the province of Quebec is but the
manifestation of political rivalrv. In 1943.
wbien the govcrnment decided to postpone
redistribution, the premier of the province of
Quebec. the Ilonourable Mr. Adelard Godbout, wrotc to the Right Honourable Mackenzic King under date of Junc 22. asserting
that:
The British NL'orth America Act cannot be
properly smended lu this respect without the
assent of the provinces.
The prescrit premier of the province of
Queberc. the Honourable Mr. Duplessis, is
mercly rcasserting that prinriple. This analogy
betwco the attitude- of two provincial adci~ai~prove s that the, presot premier of
the provimcc speaks not onl- for bis government but also on behaîf of the whole
ppuila tion.
In reneltwioc naay 1 sa-v flic ruedtioo before
us is net wbctber tbe measure now proposed
by tbw gox roment is fax ourable or unfavourtabir to the prIovinces, but rather xvbether or
not 0iu attcmpt te amen( lich British North

Whw sbould the contract in thecry apply ooly to sections, 91 and

in tbcse two sections?
Nething is more

BACON

FOR EXPORT-CURING
PROCESS
DISCUSSION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators. I wish to refer to a matter that I think
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD.

is of urgent public importance. I have before
me an article that recently appeared in the
Montreal Star under the heading, "Top
Quality Hogs Souglt-Held, Main Requisite in
Competitive market."
The article reads:
If Canadian farmers are seriously pointing
future liog production to the British market, ait
earnest effort to raise the percentage of grade A
hogs should start at once, according to the lIdustrial Development Couneil of Canadian Meat
Packers.
In its monthly letter for June, the council
states that throughout the war years Canadian
farmers literally "pulled iog production up by
its bootstraps" and in 1944 bacon exports rose
to an all-tinie high of over 700,000,000 pounds.
During the latter war years, it adds, Canadian
bacon represented about 80 per cent of the
rationable supply in Britain.
The latter points out that considerable praise
was lavished on Canadian producers for the
quality of bacon shipped but "iwe are now entering the post-war period in the British bacon
market and the future will not be influenced by
our past records."
The letter notes that former competitors are
again "swinging into production" and while
Britain bas contracted for bacon supplies to the
end of 1948, "after that it is quite possible that
free competition may 'again rule the market."
The council refers to the quality of the bacon
shipped being ail important and indicates a
greater quantity of top quality bacon will have
to be produced.
In this connection it states that during the
war years "Canadian consuimers have accepted
pork products remaining after most of the good
hogs liad been expotel," adding tiat "it is not
logical to expect that this course canlbe conttinuel." If both the export anîd donestic objectives are to be met. it is suggested that mîore of
the better and less of the poorer grade hogs are
required.
The letter prints a tabulation of liog gradings
during the years 1941 to 1945, inclusive. ioting
that every provice. except P.E. had a higher
percentage of "B-1" thtan "A" hogs.
I naintain that 'ur fariners h ave suffered
as a result of thei attempt to improve the
quality of Canadian bacon for export. At
first hogs were graded alive, and for every
pound that an animal was overweiglht tlie
farmer lost two cents. If he was prevented
by a snowdrift er mud from getting hi, hogto market on a certain day, and during the
delay each of tlim hcame only a pound
overweight, they were not considered to be
worth the top price. A deduction was also
made if any iog was light or not of proper
conformation. It is bard to understand whv
the gaining of a single pound in the weight
of a hog should bave a bad effect on the
qualit' of the bacon. Wien the system of
rail-grading was introduced the farmer continued to suffer through a lower price for any
overweiglt hog. regardless of how high the
quality of the dressed carcass might be.
While on my way home during the last
recess. I met on the train a man who told
me that lie and his family went to England

JULY 4, 1946
just before the war and were beld there until
the war ended. He had been in the retail
trade in Saskatchewan for many years and he
naturally went to work in a retail store, where
lie sold meats to, ail classes of English people;
and be bad no dou'bt that when Danish bacon
became available again they wouid no longer
buy ours. I asked hirn if the Canadian bacon
was too fat, and he said, "No, but the soft
underside of it pushes into the cutting
machine."
Out in our part of the country we bave a
packing plant-I do flot want to mention
the name-constructed by a man who had
mucli experienýce in curing bacon in Europe,
and I arn told by a retailer who bas been
bandling and cutting bacon for twenty-five
years that the product of that plant is far
superior to what we get from the big packers.
I would suggest to the government that it
should look into the curing process of our
large packing companies. I arn firmly con'vinced that it is this process or their method
of storing or handling that has given our
bacon a bad name in tbe Old Country.
In the sarne issue of the Star there is
another article that I miglit be permitted to
read:
Agricultural policyThe Hon. the SPEAKER: I would remind
the honourable gentleman tbat if lie wishes to
speak furtber on this subject he, should place
a notice on the order paper.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I thought, Mr.
Speaker, that the matter being of great importance just at this time, it should be called
to the attention of tbe Senate and the goverfiment. If, however, it is your ruling that I
sit down, ail riglit.
Hon. Mr. MTJRDOCK: You bave done
pretty well.

JULY 4, 1946

acting as the controlling legislative body to
protect the rights and interests of the
provinces; and for a Governor General.
The legislatures of the provinces of New
Brunswick and Nova Scotia were not constituted by the British North America Act,
but under section 88 continued as they
existed, except that under the conditions of
certain mutual interprovincial agreements then
embodied in the act, they delegated certain
authority within the boundaries of their respective provinces to the federal institution
named Canada.
But even ou'tside of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia, I submit. everything that pertains to the original Dominion of Canada,
except its name and rank in the Empire, is
the subjeet of interprovincial agreement. Lord
Carnarvon. in a speech he delivered at Montreal in 1883. cited by the late Dr. R. F. Taylor,
K.C., before a meeting of the Saint John
Board of Trade, said:
The British North America Act is not to be
construed merely as a municipal act, but should
be viewed as a treaty of alliance requiring
sobriety of judgment and plain common sense to
interpret it.

May I also cite A. P. Paterson? At page 4

of his book, The True Story of Confederation,
he writes:
Confederation was an agreement. It effected
the union of several contiguous self-governing
provinces. It joined these as one Imperial Dominion under a federal system of government,
each province retaining certain rights. Obviously, therefore, a clear, definite understanding
of the terms and spirit of this agreement is
essential to its fulfilment, just as its fulfilment
is essential to its permanence.
The resolutions adopted by the London Conference, coupled with the pledges given the Maritimes by the authorized representatives of the
province of Canada, completed and constituted
the Confederation agreement.
Having completed the agreement, the coñference passed the following resolution:
"'he sanction of the Imperial Parliament
shall be souglit for the union of the provinces on
the principles adopted by this conference."
That, honourable members will note, was a
resolution passed at the London Conference.
May I quote again from the same author at
page 39 of the addenda, the agreement between
the original provinces. I will quote the heading
to show how the representatives viewed what
they had adopted. It reads as follows:
The following is the complete text of the Confederation Treaty, arranged by the authorized
representatives of the provinces of Canada. Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, at London, December, 1866.
I submit it is quite apparent that the delegates to that conference considered that they
had adopted a treaty.
At page 51 the same author cites parliamentary debates of 1865, where, in a speech on

the resolution adopted at the London Conference, John A. Macdonald is reported as
follows:
These resolutions were in the nature of a
treaty, and if not adopted in their entirety the
proceedings would have to be commenced de
novo (anew).
That is, the condition was a "sine qua non",
and nothing was donc.
Again at page 54, the author quotes the
words of John A. Macdonald as reported in
the parliamentary debates of 1865:
I might mention that the maritime provinces
recognizing the peculiar position of Canada
geographically and the danger in case of hostilities, had most cordially agreed that any sum
this parliament might vote for the defence of
Canada (Ontario and Quebec) they would undertake their share of it.
The author then says:
Confederation is, primarly, a commercial union
of the provinces arranged by them with the
approval of the imperial parliament; but with
the supreme power vested in the imperial goverument, and with a constitution which is both
written and unwritten.
The federal parliament was created to carry
out the letter and the spirit of the Union Agreement and thus ensure for each province-as was
the clear intent-a fair share of all resultant
commercial benefit.
If the British North America Act is a treaty,
pact or agreement between the provinces, or
if the Dominion of Canada is constituted by
a league of the provinces-and I maintain
that it is--it necessarily follows that any vital
terms of that treaty, pact, agreement or
league cannot and should not be altered
materially without the consent of the constituent parties to it, namely, Ontario, Quebec,
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
The question has been asked whether the
consent of all the provinces is required. In
my humble opinion the answer is no, because
the provinces-other than the original fourwere constituted by authority given under the
British North America Act, and their constitution, adopted as such by our own parliament, provided for representation in parlianient. The four original provinces entered
into a league, agreement or pact-call it what
you will-which specified certain terms and
conditions under which they were ta function.
My position, simply, is that the terms and
conditions of the British North America Act
cannot be amended without at least consulting the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario. Further, T say
that representation was one of the conditions
of the agreement entered into in London.
May I quote article 21 of the treaty of
1866? It reads:
For the purpose of such readjustments. Lower
Canada shall always be assigned 65 members, and
each of the other provinces shall, at each

SENATE
readjustment. receive for the ten years then next
succeeding the number of members to which it
will be entitled on the same ratio of representation to population as Lower Canada will enjoy
according to the census then last taken by having
65 members.
I submit, honourable members, that this
article contains practically the same wording
as section 51 of the British North America
Act, and, as I have said, represents one of the
terms and conditions upon which the agreement permitting confederation was based.
At page 52 of The True Story of Confederation, John A Macdonald is reported as
follows:
In settling the constitution of the lower house
which peculiarly represents the people, it was
agreed that the principle of representation by
population should be adopted.
In order to protect local interests and to prevent sectional jealousies it was found requisite

that the three great divisions into which British
North America is separated should be represented in the Upper House on the principle of
equality.
We now have in Canada four divisions.
Accordingly, in the upper house-the controlling
and regulating but not the initiating branch (for
we know that here as in England, to the lower
bouse will practically belong the initiating of
matters of great public interest)-in the bouse
which lias the sober second thought in legislation
it is provided that eaci of these great sections
shiall be represented equally by twenty-four
members.
Tiat eaci of the great sections shcall appoint
twenty-four inembers and no more wi Il prevent
the upper house from being swamped fron time
to time by theiministry of the day for the purpose of carrying tleir own scienes or pleasing
their partisans.
No ministry can in future do wliat they liave
done ii Canada before.
We will have thle righît of the iin1ority respected.
Then he cites George Brown:
Our Lower Canada friends have agreed to give
us repiesentation by population ii the lower
bouse.
The reference still is to an agreement.
-on the express condition that they shall have
equality in the upper bouse
That means that one condition was dependent
on the other condition.
George Brown went on to say:
On no other conditions could we have advanced a step: and for niy part, I ani quite
willing they should have it. But hionourable
gentlemen nust see that the limitation of the
mieibers of the cupper house lies at the base of
the whole compact on whici the schemîe rests.
I quote that because of the reference to a
compact. Evidently they thought or in fact
were assured that they were entering into an
agreement. The author then says:
As all the provinces were desirous of effecting
a union upon an equitable basis, the supreme
H4". Mr. LEGER.

problei confronting the Fathers of Confederation was to evolve an agreement which, while
empowering a general parlianient to legislate for
all three "great divisions" (Ontario, Quebec and
the Maritimes) would, at the same time, ensure
equitable protection for the interests of eaclc.
How ever, after long deliberation, there seemed
but one practical solution-equal representation
for eaci division in the upper hlouse. This, it
was confidently believed, would offset the minority disadv-antage of representation by population
ib the lower louse. The upper house was to be
non-partisan. due regard being had to the fair
representation of both political parties. Life
appointment was deliberately intended to place
its members beyond the influence of party. Tliey
were expected to discard the role of partypolitician and to enter the Senate as statesmen
henceforth to move in an atmospiere no longer
partisan; statesmen who would strive to implement the confederation agreement in its
integrity: and. by protecting the interests of
every "great division." prevent sectionalism and
build up a nation imbued with a truc national
spirit. each section participating in the national
prosperity.
It was argued in another place that the
members there represent their respective
provinces and are able to give consent to the
resolltion. My argument is that they certainly do not represent the governments of
their- respective provinces. The members
could not possibl' do anything to affect the
foui original provinces.
Hon. Mr. )A\VID: Would the honourable
senator allow me? When lie was speaking
about flic four original provinces of confederation. I understood himu to say that at
least their con-ent to the amendment would
I would contend that the
e required.
prov inces whici came in after 1867 enjoy the
same privileges and have the same obligations
as the original four.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: If that is so. then according to my honourable friend's argument flic
consent of the nine provinces would be required for any amendment to the British
North Anerica Act. What would happen if
acpqiie-ced in an amendment
eight proviic
and one did not?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: My view is the same
as that just expressed b' the honourable
promingentleman, but in another place somec
ent men bave expressed the opposite view.
Perhaps I have not made my'self clear. I
agree entirely with the proposition ju-t stated
by my honourable friend. but I have been
trying to empliasize that in m1sYjudgment
there is no getting away fron the conclusion
th:at the consent of the four original provinces
at least must be obtained, because there was
an agrecment, a treaty. a pact between those
four provinces.

JULY 4, 1946
Hon. Mr. DAVID: If that can be said of
the four provinces it can be said of the nine.
lon. Mr. LEGER: I do not want to argue
in support of the contrary view. But I took
the trouble of looking into that phase of the
question. Section 1 of the British North
America Act, 1886, says:
The Parliament of Canada may from time to
time make provision for the representation in
the Senate and House of Commons of Canada, or
in either of them, of any territories which for
the time being form part of the Dominion of
Canada, but are not included in any province
thereof.
That authorized the federal parliament to
provide for representation of the western
territories.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman? I think the federal
parliament was given that authority in the
British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: There was a doubt as
to the federal parliament's authority, and the
amending act was passed to remove that
doubt. In the Manitoba Act the representation of the province is dealt with in sections 3
and 4; in the British Columbia Act, in section
8; in the Alberta Act, in sections 4 and 5, and in
the Saskatchewan Act, in sections 4 and 5.
These are acts of the dominion parliament. So
while I maintain that all the provinces should
be consulted before any amendment is made
to the British North America Act, I do not
think I would quarrel with the argument that
it is not legally necessary to obtain the consent of the provinces which did not enter into
the original compact, agreement or treaty.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As regards the four
original colonies, which are now provinces,
would the honourable gentleman contend that
their consent should be unanimous?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Absolutely. I contend
that to proceed to amend the act without the
consent of each and every one of the four of
them would be to break the treaty, agreement,
or whatever you might call it.

449

Some hon. SENATORS: No.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is the law as I
view it.

You cannot break a treaty with

impunity. If we have a treaty or agreement,
as I maintain we have, it cannot be broken
with impunity.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: In view -of the fact
that we have made amendiments to which
some provinces did not consent, does the
honourable gentleman hold the opinion that
those provinces may now secede from
confederation?

Hon. Mr. LEGER: Before I could answer
that I would have to be shown what the
amendments were. I maintain that if they
affected the treaty on which confederation was
based, consent should have been obtained.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Is the whole British North America Act not a'treaty? Does the
treaty not comprise the whole act?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Yes, it comprises the
whole act, but the whole act was founded upon
certain conditions precedent, and I maintain
that that treaty must be respected..
Hon. Mr. BENCH: What about the amend-

ment of 1943, which the legislature of Quebec
opposed by unanimous resolution?
In the
honourable senator's opinion, would the passage of that amendment be sufficient ground
to justify the province of Quebec in seceding
from confederation?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not think the
honourable gentleman wants me to answer
his question. I cannot speak for Quebec; the
matter is one for its government to determine.
Even if the British North America Act were
amended without the consent of the provinces.
it does not necessarily follow that one province would be se dissatisfied with the amendment as to break away from confederation.
I do not maintain that for one minute. But

I do maintain that any agreement entered
into should be respected by all the parties

to it.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: So that New Brunswick,
for instance, could prevent any amendment
to the act, even if all the other provinces
consented?

Hon. Mr. McGEER: If, without the consent of Quebec, an amendiment were enacted
taking away the guarantee of section 133-

Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not know whether
New Brunswick would have the power to

section.

prevent an amendment, but I would go so far
as to contend that if New Brunswick were
dissatisfied with an amendment that was
passed, that would be a sufficient ground for
the province to seced'e from confederation.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is the language
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Yes-what would you
say to that?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It would be up to the
government of the province of Quebec to
decide its attitude.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: It would break away.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: J am not speaking for
any particular province, I am simply pointing
out the situation that might arise.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
ionourable gentleman if lie does not have to
go behind the statute and rely upon the provisions of the agreements and resolutions?
lon. Mr. LEGER: The agreement reached
at the London conference is all contained in
the British North America Act. The statute
gave legal form to the agreement.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I do not suppose a
single member of this house sincerely believes
that Quebec would remain in confederation if
this parliament were te do away with section
133.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: There is no chance that
it will be done -away with either, and my
bonourable friend knows that is se.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: The obvious reply
to the honourable senator from Vancouver
(Hon. Mr. McCeer) is that his question as to
section 133 was raised in the other house and
was answered by the Minister of Justice.
There we find the acid test of this whole
tleory. I do net believe the Briti-i parliament would agrer to such an amendment.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The point raised last
nighît was just as extreme on the other side.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I do net think se.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I say that in the final
analysis-an(d this is the test-if the issue of
seceding from confederation is ever raised, it
will he settled not Iv the majority of the
people of Canada, certainly net by the memhers of tlie House of Commons. but bv each
individual province deciding for itself whether,
under conditions contrary to the original pact,
it still wishes to adhere to confederation.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Will the honourable
gentleman consider how a province would
secede? He will find that an interesting point.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: We are not driven te
that yet; if we were, I think we would find a
way.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Let well enough alone.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: These being my views,
I conclude that the federal parliament is
arrogating to itself rights which, without a
conference with the provinces, should not be
entertained, and for that reason I propose to
vote against the resolution.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would the honourable
gentleman permit me to ask him one more
question? He spoke of the British North
H'n. Mr. LEGER.

America Act being the embodiment of a treaty
or a pact, and also of the provinces, particularly
Nova Sceotia and. New Brunswick, having by
agreement delegated to the central authority
certain of their powers. Has he considered
the fact that what are now provinces were
only crown colonies prier to confederation,
and the question of whether they were competent by agreement to delegate any powers
to the central body?
Mr. LEGER: Yes. Certainly New Brunswick was. I am not familiar with conditions
in Nova Scotia, but I think it was in a similar
position. In New Brunswick the confederation
pact was rejected by the popular vote at the
first election, and therefore nothing was ýdone;
but at a later election it was accepted, and
that made it possible for the province to join
in the confederation.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: The point is that, prior
to confederation, New Brunswick, for instance,
was merely the creature of an imperial statute.
I suggest to the honourable gentleman that.
as such, New Brunswick had no authority to
delegate any of its powers to a central
parliament.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: But the people of
the province bad full authority.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It was not the governnient of New Brunswick, it was the people, as
such, who delegated the powers.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: They could net.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The majority so voted,
and their decision was embodied in a resolution.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It was a kind of
referendum.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Call it that if you wish.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Because of the mere
fact that the crown could intervene and prevent their coming to an agreement, it does net
follow that there was no contractual power.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: They were net mere
slaves of the crown.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: I move that the
debate be adjourned.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Before the motion
is put, I should like te repeat whbat I said
yesterday. I have no desire t be placed in
the position of not giving honourable members the fullest opportunity of discussing this
very important question, but I liad hoped
that we might be able to conclude the debate
this week. J know the hionourable senator who
lias just moved the adjournment of the debate
(Hon. Mr. Marcotte) and the honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McGeer) wish

JULY 4, 1946
to speak on the resolution, and 1 would be
willing to facilitate them or any other honourable senators wbo desire to take part in the
debate. If it is the wisb of the Senate, we
can carry on this afternoon and this evening;
then if the debate is flot concluded we can
ineet tomorrow morning at il o'clock, and, if
necessary, resumne the discussion next week.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSýON: I know it will
inconvenience somne býonourable senators, but
I do flot wish to be subjected again to the
As a
criticism directed at me yesterday.
matter of fact the government bas flot said
it will neot introduce a redistribution bill tbis
session; no one in autbority bas said anytbing of tbe kind. I hope we sball be able
to make somne furtber progress tbis afternoon.
Tbe lengtb of tbe debate will make no difference, except tbat it rnay prevent tbe proposed
adjournment until thbe 23rd instant. But we
do not bave to take a recess; we can continue
our sittings next week. Personally, I sbould
like very rnuch to bave the Senate adjourn
for a couple of weeks, but if I amn going to
be placed in tbe position of appearing to
rush the resolution tbrougb witbout adequate
discussion, 1 arn quite willing to reconsider
the proposed ad.journment. Perbaps in addition
to the honourable gentlemen I bave mentioned otbers desire to continue the debate
now in order tbhat we may make beadway. I
would 'suggest tbat tbe bonourable senator
from Ponteix (Hcn. Mr. Marcotte) ask leave
to withdraw his motion for adjournment of
the debate, in order tbat bonourable members
wbo desire to speak now may do so.
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: My only rea-so.n
for moving the adjournrnent of tbe debate
is tbat tbe scarcity of secretarial help bas prevented -me from. getting rny notes in order
sa tbat I may present my views in concise
form. I bave bad to do my own typing, and
amn not able to proeeed this afternoon, but
tumorrow I shall be ready ta go on, even if I
bave to spend the night in preparing my
notes. I arn not seeking to delay the resolution. I am willing to accept the bonourable
leader's suggestion on the understanding that
I may renew my nmotion later, and so be in
a position to resume tbe debate tomorrow.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the pleasure
-of tbe bonourable gentleman to withdraw his
motion for tbe adjournment of the debate?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: Certainly.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, perhaps by way of a change I, a layman,
may be allowed to follow the legal gentlemen
wbo se far bave carried on this debate.

I find it hard to understand wby tbere should
be any burry to pass this resolution. Not so
long ago we passed a bill to continue in force
certain regulations and orders made under
tbe War Measures Act, se technically we are
stili in a state of war, and it does seem to mie
ratber strange that there sbould be any
attempt te rush tbrough redistribution rîght
now. Western Canada occupies a very important place in tbe economic set-up of the
dominion. Tbis year tbe prairie provinces
may produce a billion dollars of new wealtb.
During the war a good many of the people of
the western provinces went to other parts of
tbe dominion to engage in war work, and
altbough it is altogetber probable that most
of tbem will return to tbeir home provinces,
many of tbem bave not yet done so. It seems
to me, tberefore, that tbe government would
be well advised to present this resolution a
year or two hence, rather than try to rush it
througb now. My only comment on it is tbat
it migbt lead to dissatisfaction. In view of the
vast area of the West, the loss of one member would be serious. We have often beard
of a tbreatened separation at the head of the
lakes because of unfair treatment in the matter
of tariffs. Now tbere is a furtber cbarge of
10 per cent to be paid to tbe Foreign Excbange
Control Board on the purchase of farm implements.
Before resuming my seat may I ask this
question: If in a few years' time we have an
additional 500,000 people in tbe province of
Saskatchewan, what will be tbe adjustment in
representation? Would we tben be entitled
to a larger n-umber of members?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, before the motion is put, may I say
tbat this resolution bas been on tbe order
paper for a long time? As the bonourable
leader of the government bas said tbat it is
the intention that this bouse adjourn tomorrow
until July 23, and many of us wbo live far
from Ottawa bave made our train reservations.
I hope the honourable gentleman who bas
moved tbe adjournmrent of tbe debate will be
prepared to speak on it tomorrow, se that we
may pick up tbese reservations witbout delay.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I hope tbere will not
be mucb more empbasis placed upon the need
for leaving tbe Senate chamber and going home
in the middle of the session.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am sure my
honourable friend will take advantage of the
recess.

REDISTRIBUTION
MOTION-DEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday the
aljourned debate on the motion of Hon.
Mr. Robertson:
That whereas by the British North America
Act, 1867, it is provided that in respect. of
representation in the House of Commons the
Province of Quebec shall have the fixed number
of sixty-five members;
And whereas the said Act provides that there
shall be assigned to each of the other provinces
such a number of members as will bear the
same proportion to the number of its population as ,the number sixty-five bears to the
number of the population of Quebec;
And whereas the said Act provides for the
readjustment of representation on the completion of each decennial census, and that on
any such readjustment the number of members
for a province shall not be reduced unless the
proportion which the number of the population
of the province bore to the number of the
aggregate population of Canada at the then
last preceding readjustment of the number of
members for the province is ascertained at the
then latest census to be diminished by one
twentieth part or upwards;
And whereas the effect of the aforesaid provisions has not been satisfactory in that proportionate representation of the provinces according to population has not been maintained;
And whereas it is considered that a more
equitable apportionment of members to the
various provinces could be effected if readjustment were made on the basis of the population
of all the provinces taken as a whole:A humble address be presented to His Majesty
the King in the following words:To the King's Most Excellent Majesty:
Most Gracious Sovereign:
We. Your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal
subjects, the Senate of Canada in Parliament
assembled. humbly approach Your Majesty,
praying that You may graciously be pleased
to cause a measure to be laid before the Parliament of the United Kingdom to be expressed
as follows:An Act to provide for the readjustment of
representation in the House of Commons of
Canada on the basis of the population of
Canada;
Whereas the Senate and House of Commons
of Canada in Parliament assembled have submitted an address to His Majesty praying that
His Majesty may graciously be pleased to cause
a Bill to be laid before the Parliament of the
United Kingdom for the enactment of the provisions hereinafter set forth;
Be it therefore enacted by the King's Most
Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice and
consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
and Commons, in this present Parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the same
as follows:
1. Section fifty-one of the British North
America Act, 1867, is hereby repealed and the
following substituted therefor:

roîtîrart uipon xviici lie federalion xxas fouuded,

JULY 5, 1946
iior is it legitimate that any judicial construction of the provisions of sections 91 and 92
should impose a new and different contract upon
the federating bodies.
Honourable Mr. Veniot, the father of our
honourable colleague Doctor Veniot, stated:
Further than that, it must be understood, I
maintain. that it was a strict agreement between
the provinces.
That was part of a question put to Mr.
Edwards, Deputy Minister of Justice, who
replied:
I agree with you, that it was an agreement.
At page 54 of the report of the committee
there appears this statement:
In February, 1925, however, Mr. Meighen
said: "Undoubtedly, the pact of confederation
is a contract and there are rights involved
therein not represented by the Parliament of
Canada."
At page 3 of the report a portion of the
evidence of Mr. Edwards, then Deputy Minister of Justice, reads:
I would desire to negative any idea that in
any matter which relates to all the provinces,
the mere fact that certain provinces object
would entitle them to have a voice at London
or at Ottawa, wherever the constitution is being
amended. That would be a matter of purely
dominion concern which should be settled in this
parliament; but where the amendment would
affect what we would sall actual provincial
rights, and there is a body of provincial opinion
opposing the amendment. I would say this parliament should consult the interested provinces.
(Question) : It might lend great weight, Mr.
Edwards, but do you think we representatives
of all the provinces in the federal arena are
authorized to speak for the provinces on the
question of jurisdiction?
(Answer) : Not for the provinces, no.
They voluntarily agreed to accept the newr
tonstitution; and they and the dominion are
bound by the terms of that constitution as it
stands today; so that when you come to face
any question as to how you are going to amend
that constitution, and the amendment in prospect is one which will take away from the provinces a thing whieh they got at confederation,
you have to consult the provinces.
Someone made the remark, "That is fair."
Speaking in the House of Commons on
February 3. 1865, Sir John A. Macdonald, in
introducing the resolutions adopted at the
Quebec conference, referred to what he called
the "treaty of union." He said further:
The government desires to say that they presented the scheme as a whole, and would exert
all the influence they could bring to bear in the
way of argument to induce the bouse to adopt
the scheme without alteration, and for tbe simple
reason that the scheme was not one framed by
the government of Canada, or by the government of Nova Scotia. but was in the nature of a
treaty settled between the different colonies,
each clause of which had been fully discussed and
had been agreed to by a system of mutual compromise.

As I stated in the preliminary discussion, we
must consider this scheme in the light of a
treaty.
I trust this scheme will be assented to as a
whole. I am sure this house will not seek to
alter it in its unimportant details and, if altered
in any important provisions, the result must be
that the whole will be set aside and we must
begin de novo. If any important changes are
made, every one of the colonies will feel itself
absolved from the implied obligation to deal
with it as a treaty. Each province will feel
itself at liberty to amend it ad libitum so as to
suit its own views and interests.
Now let us examine further the views
expressed by Canadian statesmen and jurists.
In 1883 Sir Wilfrid Laurier said:
I repeat, each time that this parliament
(Ottawa) succeeds in depriving a province of a
right which it holds, no matter how insignificant
such right may be, it is a step further along the
the path leading to legislative union.
Honourable Mr. Justice Mignault made this
statement:
The British North America Act is merely the
legalization of a pact entered into by the provinces.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Would my honourable
friend please cite the page number of Hansard
from which he is reading?
Hon. Mr. MARCOTTE: The extract was
taken from the House of Commons Hansard of
this year. I regret I cannot give the exact
page.
The following statement was made by the
Honourable Justice Loranger:
The confederation of the provinces was the
result of a pact and the imperial parliament
merely ratified it.
These are past commentaries. Are they
sufficient to prove to you, honourable senators,
that this is more than a statute? I think
they should, be ample.
This was a case in which parties, unable to
deal between themselves because of their legal
incapacity, went to the only authority available to them and said': "We are incapacitated,
because we have no legal authority to act.
This is what we want. Will you give us the
compromise we wish for? Will you ratify the
treaty between us that we of ourselves have
no power to make? Will you consecrate our
entente?"-and it was dons. That, in my
opinion, is more than could have been done
by the contracting parties.
In the other place references have been made
several times to the two books written on
our constitution by Dr. Maurice Ollivier. No
one bas more admiration for these two books
and their author than I have. Dr. Ollivier
takes the stand that the British North America
Act is merely a statute, so as regards the
present resolution his opinion should bc <f
great weight.

SENATE
In a memorandum prepared for the commuittee, Dr. Ollivier cited a table lie had
prepared, showing the sections of the act
which could be amended-some without the
consent of the provinces, some with the consent of a majority of them, and some with
their unanimous consent. Among the sections requiring the consent of the majority is
section 51, which the present resolution would
imend. Among those which could not be
imended without the unanimous consent of
lie provinces is section 133 which deals with
.he use of the French language. In the light
,f this section. I fail to understand the
leclaration made by the Minister of Justice.
Section 133 reads as follows:
Either the English or the Prencli language
may be used by any person in the debates of the
houses of the Parliaient of Canada and of the
houses of the legislature of Quebec; and both
those languages shall be used in the respective
records and journals of those liouses; and either
of those languages smay be used by any person
or in any pleading or process in or issuing frous
any court of Canada establisied mder this act.
and in or from all or any of the courts of
Quebec.
The acts of the Parliament of Canada and of
the legislature of Quebec shall be printed and
hublislied in both those languages.
Yesterday soue comments were made on
'he statement of the minister, and where it
w ould leaid us. I sIo nt propîose to cite the
table prepared by Dr. Ollivier, but I would
point out tiat according te hiin section 51
of the British North Amrica Act-the vers
one we now are asked lo take out of ouir
constitution-requires the consent of at least

that the adoption by themo. by their own parliament, of their own constitution, puts it into the
category of an ordinary act of parliament in so
far that in future it could be changed legally by
the procedure of an ordinary act. But tlhey have
stated in the debates and discussions of that
change that, where minorities are protected,
they will continue to respect that protection,
relying in future not on legal protection, but
sinply on cie another. I feel that with flexibility, reasonable flexibility, rather than rigidity,
we shall, besides greatly simplifying the whole
process of governiment, be stimulating still forther the development in Canada of that spirit
of trust and tolerance without which even legal
safeguards are of little value.

Honourable senators, this citation should
prove to us that we should be very careful in
amending our constitution.
Last session, in dealing with the powers of
the Senate, I had occasion to cite the opinion
of three great lawyers on the duties of this
house. Under our constitution the Senate was
created as a body to represent the provinces.
There is no need to repeat that opinion, but
there is need to appeal once more to honourable members of the Senate to use the utmost
care and vigilance in dealing with resolutions
like the present one. Oh, I know it has been
stated that we should depend on good will and
understanding-and let us hope thal we shall
achieve them; but the safest wav to en-sure
that we will reach the desired goal is to save
for the provinces, not the chance. but the
right to be consulted on questions so vital to
them.

imperial act stating tiat no change in the

JULY 5, 1946

Speaking in another place in 1906 the Right
Honourable Sir Wilfrid Laurier said, as
reported in volume 2 of Hansard for that year,
page 2302:
But one consideration which, to my mind, is
absolutely conclusive and paramount, is that
under our system of government, a second chamber is an absolutely needed safeguard for the
smaller provinces against -a possible invasion of
their rights by the larger provinces . . .

This

principle having been adopted admittedly for
the protection of the smaller provinces, every
one will admit at once that if we were to remove
that safeguard, there would be a natural discontent in the smaller provinces, so that I contend that we cannot seriously entertain, even
for a moment, the idea of ever abolishing our
Senate. The arguments which we sec from time
to time in the press have altogether ignored that
view of the constitution, which is a true one,
.and a paramount argument in favour of the
maintenance of a second chamber.
Now, if the paramount justification for the
Senate's maintenance is its power and its
responsibility to protect the rights of the
smaller provinces from invasion by the larger
provinces, the time has arrived when the
Senate should exercise its power in fulfilment
of that responsibility.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: If on occasions of
this kind it is not the view of the members of
the Senate that those rights should be protected, then that paramount justification
defined by our greatest constitutional administrators will have disappeared.
I do not represent British Columbia, as was
stated by the honourable senator from Lincoln
(Hon. Mr. Bench). I represent one of the
senatorial seats in the western division-of
which British Columbia happens to constitute
a fourth part, just as Prince Edward Island
constitutes a part of the maritime divisionand I want to address my first remarks to the
rights of those smaller provinces in the west
that are being invaded by this proposed legislation, and to advance the claim that although
the proposed change would substantially
increase the membership of the House of
Commons, the number of members for the
four western provinces would remain the same.
Before dealing with the resolution placed
before the Senate by the honourable member
from Lincoln, may I present a statement that
was offered to the members of the Parliament
of Canada in 1867 by the Attorney General
(West), the Honourable John A. Macdonald?
I quote from Confederation Debates, 1865, at
page 38:
In the formation of the House of Commons,
the principle of representation by population has
been provided for in a manner equally ingenious
and simple.
I think the word "ingenious" might be used
to describe the new formula which the hon-

457

ourable gentleman from Lincoln gave us the
other night; but no one would ever regard it
as "simple".
The introduction of the principle presented at
first the apparent difficulty of a constantly increasing body until, with the increasing population, it would become inconveniently and expensively large. But by adopting the representation
of Lower Canada as a fixed standard-as the
pivot on whieh the whole would turn-that province being the best suited for the purpose, on
account of the comparatively permanent character of its population, and from its having
neither the largest nor the least number of
inhabitants-we have been enabled to overcome
the difficulty I have mentioned. We have introduced the systein of representation by population without the danger of an inconvenient increase in the number of representatives on the
recurrence of each decennial period. The whole
thing is worked by a simple rule of three. For
instance, we have in Upper Canada 1,400,000 of
a population; in Lower Canada 1,100,000. Now,
the proposition is simply this-if Lower Canada, with its population of 1,100,000, has a rigbt
to 65 members, how many members should Upper
Canada have. with its larger population of
1,400,000? The same rule applies to the other
provinces-the proportion is always observed
and the principle of representation by population carried out, while, at the same time. there
will not be decennially an inconvenient increase
in the numbers of the lower bouse.
Along with that basis of determining the
representation in the House of Commons I
am going to quote the remarks of the same
gentleman dealing with the manner in which
the Senate's representation was determined.
At page 35 of the same debates will be found
this statement:
In order to protect local interest, and to prevent sectional jealousies, it was found requisite
that the three great divisions into which British
North America is separated, should be represented in the upper house on the principle of
equality. There are three great sections, having
different interests, in this proposed confederation. We have Western Canada, an agricultural
country far away from the sea, and having the
largest population which have agricultural interests principally to guard.
That western section then was the province
of Ontario and did net include any of western
Canada as we know it today.
We have Lower Canada, with other and separate interests. and especially with institutions and
laws which she jealously guards against absorption by any larger, more numerous, or stronger
power. And we have the Maritime Provinces,
having also different sectional interests of their
own, having. from their position, classes and
interests which we do not know in Western
Canada. Accordingly. in the upper house-the
controlling and regulating, but not the initiating,
branci (for we know that here as in England.
to the lower house will practically belong the
initiation of matters of great public interest),
in the House which bas the sober second-thought
in legislation-it is provided that each of those
great sections shall be represented equally by 24
members.
Now we propose to change the basis of
I know that
the relative representation.

Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I call upon honourable members of the Senate to at least give
that kind of political jugglery the thorough
examination it deserves. I call upon them to
fulfill their obligation to the west-the younger
part of Canada-and to protect the smaller
provinces against an invasion of their rights
through a proposal that increases the representation of Quebec and Ontario by nine and
leaves the representation of the four western
provinces as it is.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask the bonourable gentleman a question? Under the
proposed resolution are not the western provinces being given the same number of members of parliament per unit of population as
Ontario and Quebec are to get?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: We thought we were
until we examined the proposal. As we see
it, we have been deluded or have been under
a grave misapprehension in believing that we
lived in a part of Canada where the population was increasing. I am simply giving the
results of the formula proposed today as
against those set out by the Fathers of Confederation and long accepted as satisfactory.
If we are to make a change in the Canadian
constitution, let us base it on the sane reason
and simple understanding that the Fathers of
Confederation exercised when they laid the
foundations of the nation we enjoy today.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Does the honourable
senator ask for the West a larger proportion
of representation on the ratio of population
than is given to the provinces in other parts
of Canada?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I only ask that the
basis of representation be the same as that
which existed when we entered into confederation.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Then you would
have four seats less.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: We would have four
seats less in a house of 227 members. Now
it is proposed that in a house of 255 members
we should have the same number of seats
we have today in a house of 245 members.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Is .this not the
answer to my friend's proposition: that unfortunately the part of the dominion to which
he refers has not the population to warrant
an increase in membership?

459

Hon. Mr. McGEER: That may be the
answer; it may even be the answer you will
be prepared to go out and give to the people
of British Columbia; but in my opinion it is
not a satisfactory answer. In any event, let
us face the proposed change as it stands: it
means increasing the representation of the
East in the House of Commons while that of
the West remains fixed. That may not appeal
to some of our western friends. But let me
turn to another point.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Before he does that.
will the honourable gentleman please tell us
what he thinks should be the basis of representation in the West?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I say that the basis
of representation was perfectly satisfactory
before this amendment was proposed. If there
is anything wrong with subsection 4 of section
a1 of the British North America Act, that can
be eliminated, and with the basis of representation as arranged in 1867, with 65 members for QuebecHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Does my honourable
friend suggest that the increase in population
in Ontario and Quebec should be disregarded?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: That would change, as
it has done all the way along. The membership in the House of Commons has increased
from 196 to 245.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The representation in the
West would be less under that arrangement.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Not proportionately.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: It would be down
seven members.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The total membership goes down to 227.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: On this proposed basis
we will never catch up.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: My honourable
friend is surely overlooking the fact that his
own province of British Columbia, where the
population has increased, is to get two more
members, while two of the prairie provinces
are to lose two members because their population has decreased.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Everyone knows that
at the time of the 1941 census there was a
tremendous drift of population from the
prairie provinces, as there had been for years,
to British Columbia. Now the people are
drifting back again, and the population of the
prairie provinces is probably increasing.
Whether or not we should be subject to a
system of representation based on temporary
flights of population, which may or may not
occur at the decennial periode, is a question.

460

SENATE

It may be that plan is better than the one
figured out by the Fathers of Confederation.
From the point of view of eastern Canada it
obviously is the better plan, because it
increases the present'representation for the
East and leaves that of the West unchanged.
I do not say that it is not the best way, but
I maintain that this question is one that
requires very serious consideration. Before
taking a step that is not demanded, except by
the few who thought up this scheme, we should
carefully examine and analyse its present
effects and future results. I do not think
there is any popular demand for this change in
Quebec or Ontario, or any claim for it in the
maritime provinces. Certainly there is no
demand for it in western Canada. Then, why
the hurry?
We are told that this resolution is necessary because it will more trulv reflect the
principle of representation by population.
From mv reading and study of our constitution. it secms to me that in addition te the
original crown colonies of Nova Scotia, Prince
Edward Island, New Brunswick. and Canada.
there were the crown colonies of Vancouver
Island and Britishl Colrumbia as tiey existed at
that tinte, and Ruperts Land-the Great
Wett as we cal] it todiy-under the control of
the Hid-on's Bay Comtpany. The important

the foundation of the nation of Canada. One
couîld easily brush these matters aside today,
but they have a nasty way of cropping up
tomorrow. We are asked te take away one of
the fuindamentals of that compact, and thereby
to deprive Quebec, the pivotal province, of
its present basis of reprsentat ion and put that
province on the saie basis as the re-t of Canada. Do you titnk tiat the people of Qtuebec
camte into confederation for nothing; or that
one of the essentials of the agreement can be
wiped ont withoutt serious conscquences?
May I deal with the question of "rep by
pop" as it works out in the Senate, Iaving in
mind the reference I made to the remarks of
the Attorney General?
In 1915, when the
West was made one senatorial division, the
principle of territorial representation was completcly violated. Two great divisions were
lion. Mr.tN
M

tt-ER.

clamped into one. The provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan both economieally
and in their trade relations are linked with the
east. The port of those two provinces is Fort
William. The great inland waterway system
of the Great Lakes, the canals and the St.
Lawrence river iN the highwav for both
experts and imports. When the St. Lawrence
waterway is developed, Fort William will be
the equivalent of an ocean port. ln addition.
the markets, industrial centres and distributing bases of Manitoba, Saskatciewan and
Ontario are inseparably linked together.
We have another division on the Pacifie
coast where we are just as isolated, if I may
use the term, or just as much tied to the
ocean, as are the provinces on the Atlantic
coast. We are tied net only te the Pacific
Ocean but to the Panama Canal. Our internal
rivalries are definite and real. Our ocean ports
on the Pacifie coast-Vancouver, Victoria and
Prince Rupert-compete with all the lake and
river ports from Fort William to Buffalo,
Montreal, and Quebec, and with all the
Atlantic seaboard ports from Saint John and
Halifax to Portland, Maine. New York,
Boston. Philadelphia. and Norfolk, Virginia.
When we coie to ask fot eqtual treatment in
the matter of cost of transportation, we are
told tat there are natiral difficultics for which
we imust pay-the difficultis of meuntai
transportation.
We establishied before the
Board of Transport Commrissioners thiat the
cost of operation through the tmoutains, even
via the Canadian Pacific Railhayv, w-as Iss bv
some 36 per cent ian the cost of operation of
the Canadian Pacifie into Montreal or Saint
John. or of the Canadian National into Halifax.

We were also able to e stallisi

tiat the

ioutntain differential was net fixed to take
Care of operation costs, but was deliherately
imposed as a barrier to the mîove mcents in and
out of Pacifie ports of goods that would niove
throuîgh the Panama Canal.
Yes, we need fair representation in the
Hou-e of Commons. But we are entitled also
to eqtaility in the Senate, for it is in the
Senate that the rigits of the smaller provinces are to be protected.
The Maritime
Provinces, with their powerful representation
in both iouses of parliament, have too their
gecographie disadvantage. The distance from
Montreal to Saint John and Halifax is far
greater than the distance from Montreal to
New York. To obviate this natural geographie disadvantage, the Maritime Freight
Rates Act fixed an arbitrary rate under which
the railways operate between the rest of
Canada and the Maritimes at a loss. The people of British Columbia along with the rest
of Canadians are taxed to make up that loss.

JULY 5, 1946
I ask honourable members of the Senate if
they think it is fair that a situation such as
that should continue.
Let me give some figures. According to the
1941 census the population of British Columbia
was 817,461, and that of Alberta, 796,169, a
total of 1,613,630. The population of Prince
Edward Island was 95,047; Nova Sceotia,
577,962, and New Brunswick, 457,401, a total
of 1,130,410. British Columbia and Alberta,
a natural division of the same kind as the
Maritimes, though having a population of
nearly 500,000 more than the Maritimes, have
twelve senators less.
I suppose somebody will tell me that that
too is on the basis of representation by population. There probably is some gentleman in
Ottawa who can calculate on a mathematical
trapeze and perform some kind of political
calisthenics by which we are supposed to be
led to believe that an increase of ten in the
parliamentary representation of the East, with
no change in the representation of the West,
is just the kind of thing that the people of
the West should 'be thankful for. Well, I am
not thankful for it. Someone said the other
night that we wanted justice in the basis of
representation. Then, let us have a little bit
of justice in the matter of the Senate representation for British Columbia and Alberta.
I do not think you would expect the people
of the West to be quite as docile or stupid
as they would have to be to accept that kind
of treatmenit without a protest. I wonder
what my honourable friends from the Maritimes would be saying if the shoe was on the
other foot. I wonder what they would say if
in British Columbia and Alberta we had
500,000 fewer people than the 'Maritimes but
had twice as much representation in the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: How about Saskatchewan and Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Saskatchewan and
Manitoba are in the same position as British
Columbia and Alberta. We in the Great West
were just jumbled together, nobody apparently
having been concerned about our representation in this house, a matter which has now
come to be a grim reality. J think there bas
not been a deliberate design on the part of
men of the East to discriminate against us.
We are ourselves largely to blame. As I have
often said in Vancouver, the distance from
that city to Ottawa is actually 3,000 miles, but
after nearly twenty-five years' experience with
the Ottawa point of view it bas seemed to me
that the distance from Ottawa to Vancouver
is about 50,000 miles.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS:
ematies is that?

What kind of math-

461

Hon. Mr. McGEER: What I mean to say
is that the East has its own business to attend
to, and that if we allow this kind of thing to
go on we deserve what we get. But, honourable senators, when we bring the situation
before you we expect treatment based upon
the principles on which our Canadian Confederation was founded-and the greatest of these
is that in Canada we shall live under a scheme
of government that administers impartial
justice throughout the land, so that no one
section or class may unrighteously advance at
the expense of the other.
Do we agree upon the basis of representation
by population? A basis that had regard to
territorial divisions as well as to certain
principles was fixed in 1867. Is it necessary
that it should be changed now? And if we
agree that it should be changed, should we not
agree at the same time that the representation
of western Canada in the Senate should be
on the same basis as the representation of
eastern Canada? Is there anything wrong with
that? Is there anything un-Canadian about
it? I say that is one of the things that should
be considered and determined before an appeal
is made to the Parliament of the United Kingdom for the change proposed in the resolution
before us.
I have given you an instance of an injustice
imposed upon a provincial minority, certain
smaller provinces, an injustice that should be
remedied. Let me refer to another minority,
since it is here that minorities have the right
to look for protection. I wanted to move an
amendment te this resolution, to provide that
the words "Contributory old age pensions" be
added to section 91 of the British North
America Act, after the words "Unemployment
insurance," which were added in 1920. The
great mass of workmen who never lose a day
either from idleness or indifference and rarely
from sickness, who do net look forward to ever
getting a penny's worth of benefit from unemployment insurance, have to pay the shot.
On the good principle that the more fortunate
should help out the less fortunate-a principle
of which there is not so much evidence in this
world as there might be-we say te the
industrious and efficient workmen: "You are
employed all the time, so you should pay for
the unfortunate men who are the first to be
laid off when depression comes along and
unemployment begins to stalk the land."
I say, let us be fair te that group of workers,
who are the backbone of industry; let them
have the privilege of enjoying at retirement
an old-age pension based upon the contribution they have made to the relief of those who
were unfortunate enough te be unemployed.
When considering amendments to the British
North America Act, are we willing to regard

462

SENATE

the rights of that minority as an essential
If I read correctly Sir Wilfrid
element?
Laurier's definition of the paramount justification for the existence of the Senate, it
involves not merely the protection of the
smaller provinces, but the protection of
minorities as well.
There is one other statement that I should
like to refer to, because I think it was wholly
lacking in historical fact. We were told that
there is justification for the proposed procedure. I do not think there is. I think
the weight of authoritative opinion is overwhelmingly against any such conclusion. The
amendment most relied upon as justification
for this procedure is the one made te the
British North America Act in 1915. If you
will check the record, you will find that that
amendment was first introduced in 1914.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Correct.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: In 1914 the Senate
moved an amendment to the bill that came
from the House of Commons. The amendment was not accepted by the government.
The bill was reintroduced in 1915, and in due
course came before the Senate. In presenting
that bill to this house the leader of the government. Senator Lougheed, made a statement
which in my opinion summarizes the whole

since British Columîbia caine into ConfederaIn

Senate Hansard of March 29, 1915. at page
211, Srizitor Louigheed is reported as follows
At the close of the session of 1914 I hlad the
honour to mîove, on behialf of the governnent, a
precisely similar address to the one iiow before
us for our consideration. The object of the
address is to divide the dominion into four senatorial sections, or groups, not in any way departing from the representation already enjoyed
by the Maritime Provinces, the province of
Quebec and the province of Ontario so far as the
numbers of their representatives in this chamîber
are concerned. It is proposed to add, as I bave
said, a fourth group, giving a representation of
24 senators in this chamber to that portion of
Canada lying west of Lake Superior. That is to
say, it is proposed to icrease its representation
in this chamîber to six senators for the provimce
of Manitoba, six for Saskatchewan, six for
Alberta and six for British Columbia. As lionourable gentlemen are doubtless aware, we already have legislation upon our statute books
omaking provision for a representation of six in
the province of Manitoba. Some question bas
arisen as te wlether the Parliament of Canada
has authority to appoint the additional number
of 2 for which provision was made in the Manitoba Bounidaries Extension Act, passed in 1912.
It is considered by some of the law officers of
the crown that this parliament had authority to
make provision for that increase of numbers.
However, others have cast a doubt upon the
exercise of such authorit, and it is, therefore,
thought desirable to seek imperial legislation
upon the subject. No question can arise as to
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

the provision which already has been made foi
the appointiment of six senators for the prov

inces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. respectively
When the North West Territories were eiectel
into the two provinces already mentioned, namîeî3
Saskatchewan andi Alberta, provision wa- made
for a representation of six from eacl of thiose
tvo provinces, but inasmuch as imperial legislation was thoughît desirable for the other provinces, it was therefore considered proper that
the entire representation should be included in

this measure. As to the province of British
Columbia, honourable gentlemen are doubtless
aware, wlien the British Columbia Act of h imni
was passed. provision was made for only thiree
senators and no further provision was made for
an increased representation of that province im
this chamber. As all those provinces have
simultaneously increased in population. and a,
they closely approximate each other in popula
tion, of course no question can arise as to the
reasonableness of the number which is beinu
given to each. It is also provided that the
clause in the British North Anierica Act whwh
iakes provision for either three or six additional senators being appointed upon leave being
given by the imperial authorities in the case of
an emergency be amended, and that in view ni
the extension of the number and of the creation
of four groups. this clause in the British North
America Act should read "four or eiglit." as the
case may bc. instead of "three or six" as it now
reads. Provision is also made in the address
that eaci province of the dominion shall ahvays
have a representation in the House of Commons
as large as their senatorial representation
That was to take care of what had already
been agreed to for the province of Prince
Edward Island. So when you came to the
amendment of 1915 there was nothing new;
no precedent was being established. On that
occasion a much beloved and well-remembered
gentleman, the late Senator Turgeon, said:
J believe that this is the mîîildest, most just
and righteous amîendment that lias ever lice' proposed to the British North America Act. but I
think it would be the part of wisdoni, and I
think it would be better if the house, altlheiulî
everyone is agreed to it, sought and secure
concurrence of the provinces. and took that coneurrence with tbem to London.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Were the provinces consulted on the 1915 amendment?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The provinces had been
consulted all the way through. There was no
disagreement. Both parties, Liberal and Conservative, in the Senate and in the House of
Commons, were unanimous in their support
of the amendment. Every province had had
under consideration what had been done ever
since British Columbia, Manitoba, and later
the prairie provinces, entered Confederatinon
It was merely confirmation of what had been
done by extending te British Columbia whar
had already bren given to the other western
provinces.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I quite agree as te
the western provinces. But the point is, were
the provinces that were not given increased
membership consulted in 1915?

JULY 5, 1946
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I think every province
would be consulted.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: There was no
formai conference.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I shall deal with that
a littie later. That is a littie more of your
calisthenics.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: British Columbia
style.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I arn here representing "British Columbia style," and I ar n ot
concerned whether my honourable friend
from Ottawa likes it or flot.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I ask my honourable friend flot to impose upon the intelligence of the house by assuming there were
conferences and consultations when there
were none. There are other people who know
the history of Canada as well as my hionourable friend.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: 1 have simply pointcd
-out
that when the province of British Columbia was formed provision was made for three
members, when ManitobaHon. Mr. LAMBERT: There is no dispute or complaint about that. We know
very well that British Columbia came in on
the guarantee of getting a railway.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: If you think we did
not know what was tak ing place in 1915,
when we were going to have an increase of
membership from three to six, I would remind
you that there were representatives of the
British Columbia government here; and any
main who knows anything about what was
going on at that time knows full well that
it was on the representations of British
Columbia and Manitoba that the amendmnent
was made. Alberta and Saskatchewan already
had six members.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Was that done
by representatives of the legislatures or of
the governments?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: By the representatives of the governments--which is the way
it is always done. I have seen a great
many conferences, and only once was the
representative of the legislature of British
Columbia not acknowledged as the representative of the government of that province.
Hon. Mr. CREBAR: Just to clear up a
point with respect to the amendment which
was adopted -in 1915, may I ask whether
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, New
Brunswick, Quebec and Ontario were called
in to a preliminary conference to see if they
63268-31

approved or disapproved of the proposai to
increase the senatorial representation of British
Columbia and Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I do not know whether
they were or not.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I may say to my
lionourable friend that if hie inquires hie will
find they were not.
Hon. Mr. McGEEiR: I do not stand only
on that. I did not expect that a case so
strongly built up on the 1915 amendment
would be wiped out by that argument alone.
Let me cite a gentleman whom I thinit ail
will accept as an outstanding authority. He
appeared before a Special ýCommittee on the
Briti sh North America Act appointed by the
House of Commons in Fehruary, 1935. The
committee filed its report on June 19, 1935.
Dr. Oscar Skelton, Under-Secretary of State
for External Affairs, appeared before the coinmnittee and cited ail the amendments which
had been made up to that time. I refer
honourable members to page 35 of the report,
where the following. will be found:
B.N.A. Act, 1915
Object: To increase the number of senators
and alter the main senatorial divisions.
Procedure. The procedure adopted was 'that
the Act was passed by the United Kingdom parliament following an address by the Senate and
House of Commons of Canada. Prince Edward
Island made representations before a bouse of
Commons committee, which were not accepted.
Other provinces were not consulted and made
no representations. The suggestion was made in
the Ilouse of Commons by Mr. Q. Turgeon now
Senator Turgeon, that the provinces shouid be
consulted, but it was 'fot acted upon.
The reason no representatione were made
was, I submit, that there was no change' to

which anybody,

outside of Prince Edward

Island, was objecting. The representatives of
that province were heard, but their views

were not acceptcd.

Dr. Skelton proposed to

segregatc the diffèrent types of amendments.
At page 38 of the report hie said:
To return to the summary of thèse precedents:
1. It would appear that a request to the
United Kingdom parliament by the dominion
government alonte, without action by the dominion parliament, is flot adequate;
2. That in six out of seven ameodments,
amendment bas been based on action by the
dominion parliament alone without consent of
or consultation with the provinces generally.
3. That in two of thèse cases (the definition
of parliamentary privileges in 1875 and extenin 1917), the
life
s'ion of the were of parliamenttemporary charof minor or
.amendments
acter and involved no provincial interest.
4. That two at least of the remaining cases
(1871, empowering the federal parliament to
admit new provinces and assign them representation in Ottawa, and 1915, revising the Senate
provisions) might have been considered to possess some provincial interest but were effected
wvholly by feeal action;

JULY 5, 1946
page 753 of Hansard of the British House of
Commons of June twenty-first, 1907, Mr.
ChurchilI said:
Adherence to the union was something in the
nature of a treaty . . . an agreement has been
come to by all the provincial prime ministers
and the dominion government, with the exception of British Golumbia . .. the Prime Minister

of British Columbia -and others thought that the
words "final and unalterable" should not be inserted in the Bill . . .
At page 1616, under date of June thirteenth,
1907, he said:
The parliament of British Columbia passed a
resolution protesting against the settlement being
regarded as final and irrevocable . ..

In defer-

ence to the representations of British Columbia
the words "final and unalterable" applying to
the revised scale had been omitted from the
Bill.
On the same page he continued:
I would be very sorry if it were thought that
the action which His Majesty's government had
decided to take meant that they decided to establsh as a precedent that whenever there was e
difference on a constitutional question between
the federal government and one of the provinces,
the imperial government would always be prepared to accept the federal point of view as
against the provincial.
Now I ask any lawyer in this bouse if that
is not a propei position for a government and
parliament to take with reference to a statute
that is also a constitution by which are preserved the rights of others. I think that is a
fair statemenit of the British North Amei-ica
Act, which is, of course, a statute and must
be interpreted according to the laws with
respect to the interpretation of statutes. As this
is a statute that contains a constitution, due
regard must be had not only to the rules,
regulations and precedents governing the
interpretation of statutes, but the law and
precedents governing the interpretation of constitutions. If it is sound in law to say that a
statute which is a constitutional statute should
be interpreted according to the rules of the
staltutes, it should be aniended according to
the saine rules. The precedent of 1907 established the right of even a hopeless provincial
minority to not only go to the British Parliament, but to have its representations heard
and in part acted upofi. It is a precedent
which makes the British Parliament a trustee
for the rights of the minority as well as those
of the majority.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I suppose the provinces could go there now?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I have no doubt they
will go. If I were representing British Columbia I would go to the British Parliament in
no uncertain way. I am not sure what consideration would be received today, because
the situation bas greatly changed.
63268--31

Now I should like to speak for a moment
to the question of whether the British North
America Act is a guarantee of minority rights
in Canada. May I quote from the Debates
of Confederation, 1865, page 944, where Hon.
Mr. Dorion is reported as follows:
I do not rise to offer any lengthened rgmarks,
but to draw for a moment the attention of the
members of the administration, with a view to
obtain some information in connection with this
scheme; but before doing so, I would say a word
in reply to the explanation given by the Honourable Attorney General (West) to the question put by the 'honourable member for the
county of Quebec (Hon. Mr. Evanturel), with regard to the use of the French language. The
Honourable Attorney General (West) stated
that the intention of delegates at the Quebec
conference was to give the saine guarantees for
the use of the French language in the federal
legislature, as now existed under the present
union. I conceive, sir, that this is no guarantee
whatsoever, for in the Union Act it was provided that the English language alone should be
used in parliament, and the French language was
entirely prohibited; but this provision was subsequently repealed by the 1lth and 12th Victoria, and the matter left to the discretion Qf
the legislature.
So that if, to-morrow, this
legislature chooses to vote that no other but the
English language should be used in our proceedings. it might do so, and thereby forbid the 'use
cf the French language. There is, therefore, ne
guarantee for the continuan-ce of the use of the
language of the majority of the people of Lower
Canada, but the will and the forbearance of the
majority. And as the number of French members in the general legislature, under the proposed confederation, will be proportionately
much smaller than it is in the present legislature, this ought to make honourable members
consider what little chance there is for the continued use of their language in the federal legislature. This is the only observation I have to
make on this subject, and it was suggested to
me by the answer of the Honourable Attorney
General (West).
Hon. Attorney General Macdonald: I desire
to say that I agree with my honourable friend
that as it stands just now the majority governs;
but in order to cure this it was agreed at the
conference to embody the provision in the imperial act. (Hear, hear.) This was proposed
by the Canadian governinent, for fear an accident might arise subsequently, and it was
assented to by the deputation from each province
that the use of the French language should form
one of the .principles upon which the confederation should be established, and that its use, as
at present, should be guaranteed by the imperial
act. (Hear, hear.)
Hon. Attorney General Cartier: I will add to
what bas been stated by the Honourable Attorney General for Upper Canada, in reply to
the honourable member for the county of Quebec
and the honourable member for Hochelaga, that
it was also necessary to protect the English minorities in Lower Canada with respect to the use
of their language, because in the local parliament
of Lower Canada the majority will be composed
of French Canadians. The members of the
conference were desirous that it should not be
in the power of that' majority to decree the
abolition of the use of the English language in
the local legislature of Lower Canada. any more
than it will be in the power of the federal legislature to do so with respect to the French

to deatb. It occurs to one, hom-ever, that tbey
also liad reached a higli estate, which imposes a
corresponding obligation. I copied out of the
Bible on the table of this bouse. from the Acts,
the quite natural statement of Festus:
It is flot the manner of tbe Romans to deliver
any man to die, before that lie whieb is accused
have the accusers face to face, and have licence
to answer for bimself concerning the crime laid
against him.
Everybody-will agréé that that is a prctty
scund prnil.The
ministoc continucd:
Tbere was no statute; there was no law
whieh required tbat this be done; but there
was the concept in tbe Roman conscience that
it was the proper tbing to do.
I suppose the inference is that the Parliament of Canada, baving reacbod its new bigb
estate, bas devoloped a sense cf responsibility
equivalent te that wbicli the Roman Emperors
hiacinl the time of St. Paul. Well, bonourable
senators, I only ivant to say that if the
sccurity cf our provinces nnd minorities is
ne better than was the security cf St. Paul
ini the hands cf Fostus and Agrippa, we are in
a vory sorry plight. I know authentic secular
history rather suggests that the facts concerning St. Paul's final years are unknown, but
ne such conclusion is possible from churcb
his¶tory and tradition.
From thesze sources
Nve ýloarn tbnt St. Paul, nlong with a number
of other Christians, wns taken out on a
Roman holiday and tbrown to the lions in
the colosseum.
Another tradition is that
3\ero, wbo ivas accused cf hurning Rome for
bis ovin amusement, hlamed it on the Christians,' and that St. Paul was one of the victims
in a Roman purge.
Is that the kind of
security we want for Canadian provinces and
Canadian minorities?
Why net go a little
further?
There was another great Roman
authority on whom the Carpenter cf Nazareth
dopended-Pontius Pilate. He bad the samne
arbitrary powers as Agrippa and Festus en.ioyed wheit they carried Paul te Rome, either
to ho butchered to make a Roman holiday
or to ho eaten by lions in a Roman circus.
An Hon. SENATOR:
eut?

Why net beave that

Hon. Mr. McGEER: 1 would have left it
eut if my honourable friend had net mentioned it.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Wou'ld the bonourahie
gentleman allow me te intervene? In ail fairness te the Minister cf Justice I tbink my
honourable friend will agree with me that the
right benourable gentleman net only relied on
Roman justice but aise on British justice wben
hoe cited twc cases in the hisory cf this
country. For instance, ho pointed eut that
Britain aholisbed the right cf French-Cana-

467

dians te use the French language, but the
common sense cf Britishers triumpbed. and
that rigbit was restored.
Hon. Mr. McGRER:
I am net complainieg of what the Minister cf Justice may have
bad in mind. I think that se long as we have
mon of the type cf the Right Honeurable
W. L. Mackenzie King as Prime Minister and
the Right Honcurablo Mr. St. Laurent as
Minister cf Justice we are in no danger of
having imposed on us nny Roman law or
Roman ideas cf socurity for minorities or
provices.
But Mr. King bas already announced bis intention cf retiring, and this
résolution in my opinion is a dangerous precedent right on the ove cf bais departure, hocause we do net know who is gcing te bo
in control tomorrow. But lot me say te my
bonourable friend that that is net the peint.

Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Tbat is guaranteed
in the act. The guarantee is heing swept
away. You are putting yourselves back te
wbere you might again bave in autbority tbe
samne type cf persons that once teck their
language away from Frencb Canadians--to
he given back under pressure. It is a permanent guarantee-at least it was intonded
te bo.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Would the bonourable
gentleman allew me again? On the peint cf
guarantee, may I remind him that thero is a
xvorld cf differencehbetween tbe section now te
ho amended and section 133. If the bonourahblo gentlemanHon. Mr. MeGEER:
to ask?

Have you a question

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: It will take .iust one
minute. The section to he amended is based
on section 40, whicb reads:
Until the Parliament cf Canada etberwise provides, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New
Brunswick shalbave se many membors. But section 133 dees
net hegin with the words "Until the Parliament cf Canada ditberwise provides."
It
simply says, "Either the Englisb or the French
language may ho used." It seems te me there
is a world cf difference thero.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: That which it is sought
te change is net semetbieg with wbicb the
Parliamnent cf Canada bas te do. AIl that

section 40 and came into operation on the
completion of the 1871 census--is the provision et representation for the constituencies
wîthin the limit flxed hy the constitution,
namely 65 members for Quebec and proportionately for the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Until Parliament otherwîse provides.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Tlîat limit is flxcd by
the constitution, and parliament had ne power
te change it then, cor has it now, uintil it
goca forward te tise British Parliament with a
plea for ýamendint.
I now come te another more 'important
issue . :Are wc on sate ground under the
present censtitutienal powers? la Canada constitutioually equipped te meet the clianged
conditions wlirh nmv exist-international, internai and domestic? I do net think se. I
think everybody in this country realizes that
Canada has attained a new place net only in
the British Commonwealth of Nations but
among the nations of the world. During the
last twenty years we have meved through a
great depressien inte a great war, and the
revelatien ef Canada's powers that came
during the war is ne less kuoýwn te the youn'ter
generation th-an te the eIder mnes. The
yeîlnger generatien are nsking. and righitly se,
that these enermous powers which have been
revealed as being in the pessession et the
Canadian people shaîl ho used fer the benefît
et the Canadian people. What have we
iearued? We have iearuýed tluat we ran assumne
ail the obligations of the lite war and-as His
Honomîr the ex-President ot the United States
told us the other night-can previde one-flfth
et the food required to break the werld's
gicatest famine.
Are we going back te the 1930's, or any
semblante et them? Net withoîît extreme
danger te our whole ecenomy. What waa the
position et this country in 1867? It was a
group et crown colonies travelling along like
a eenvoy of sailing shipa under the guiidane
et the Mother Ceuntry. Weak, it looked te
the Motherland for detence, fer immigratien,
for economic aid and for financiai power. Do
we look te the Motheriand fer anything today? We defend ourseives; we have entered
into an agreement with the United States fer
the joint defence et the North American continent. Do we need te borrow in London?
W/e have agreod te lend, without interest for
a period et tino, 1,250.000,000 Canadian dollars, and the money can be spent in Canada,
the United States, or any other country.
There is net one string attached te that money
sent eut et Canada te the banka et London.»
We have shipped 750.000,000 Canadian dollars te other countries for expert trade; we are
Hon. Mr.

McGEEIt.

providing 600,000,000 Canadian dollars under
the Bretton Woods agreement, and a large
sum to UN"RRA; and wve are rindertaîznz
large obligations in connection with international food supplies.
Now, let me put this question te you: How
would you like to be in court opposing a client
who had lent the judgc a million dollars? We
are in theposition of that client: the British
government is behiolden to us for a gift or boan.
We should have ioaned the money te Great
Britain without a dollar of intercat; indeed I
think we shiould have given it. I have ne
quarrel at ail with wbat has been donc. What
15 the position of the imperial parliament when
it cornes to adjudicate upon constitutional differences between the minorities and the
majority in Canada? That position bas
changed, and as a result, in my humble opinion we are now charged with the responsibility
of taking over our own constitution and, by
'agreement of the najerity. defining the
securities that will be satisfactory to both the
majeritv and the minorities in this great
nation. We muist agree. French-Canadians andi
Anglo-Canadians have agreed in the paat. We
cannot at a moment such as this let any sentimient of loyalty te party politics stand in
the wav of omît net only becoming masters in
our- eau bouse, but ef taking the power te
become masters.
There is eue other precedent I want to quote
-the Statute of Westminster. Were the provinces consulted when it came into being? 0f
course they were. On three different occasions
there was iuvolved what Dr. Skelton calîs the
"tederal element" in our constitution-the
ameudment on subsidies in 1907, the transfer
of powers from the provinces te the dominion
in relation to unemployment insurance in
1940, and the change of national statua under
the Statute of Westminster in 1931. That
change of status grew eut of net only the
demanda et Canada but the demanda et the
other overseas domninions fer self-governing
power. After the imperiai centerences et 1926
and 1929 the representative of the Canadian
gov erement, tlien the Pliglît Henourable R. B.
Beninett, returned te Canada te consult the
provinces. At page 3193 and tollowiug pages
of the Gommons 1Ious.ard et 1931, -Mi. Bennett
is reported as follows:
In meving the lmotien tliat stands je iy naine

received a communication freont the prov*..I
ince ef Ontario saving that they did net desire

JULY 5, 1946
these changes should take place until tbey had
an opportunity to be heard. I also received a
communication from. the province of Quebec...
they agreed that inasmuch as the original Act
might b e amended in the opinion of. the goveroment of this province b y this parliament by a
xnajority vote. they should have the opportunity
before any such action was taken Vo presenit
their views and make known their decisions. I
communicated with the various provincial governments and invited them. Vo attend a
conference.
I Vhink it will be a matter of satisfaction Vo
the house Vo know that the representations of
the provinces and the dominion unanimously
agree that we should insert as a section of the
Statute of Westminster the section which is
now hefore the house.
This is the section which the members of the
conference conceded we should draft for ourselves as our section in the Statute of Westminster. The section reads:
Nothing in this act shail be deemed Vo
apply to the repeal, amendment or alteration
of the British North America Act, 1867-1930,
or any rule or regulation made thereunder.
In other words, lest it be conclnded by inference that the rights of the provinces as defined
by the B.ritish North America Act had been hy
reason of this statute curtaiied, lessened, modified or repealed, we make in the Statute itself
a declaration that such is noV the case.
In this debate Mr. Raiston offered the
criticism that the procedure being followed
might indicate that one or more of the
provinces had the right Vo, prevent the federal government fromn seeking an amendment.
But that cr iticismn was. wholiy unwarranted,
for the right Vo be considered and the right to
he heard in objection, which has neyer before
been denied, would he absurd. unless any objection offered could be sustained or denied. In
the present instance it is this right Vo consideration, this right Vo be heard, and this
right Vo objeet that it seems Vo me are now
being brushed aside.
Unfortunateiy -our Canadian constitution
contains nq statement as Vo how it should.be
amended.
The steps foiiowed in initiating any proposed amendment under the practice that has
evolved are conference and agreement between
the provinces and the dominion followed by
a resolution of the federal parliament, praying
for legislative enactmnent by the parliament of
the United Kingdomn with the rîght of ail
parties concerned Vo be heard.
It is the right of ail our provinces, of the
representatives of eur people, Vo come Vo the
determination of a change in their constitution
by open discussion, argument, debate, agreement-and disagreement, if you will. That
is the foundation of British democracy. That
is one of the foundations of oýur Canadian
demnocra tic security that is being attacked
today.

Do you think that an> of the great FrenchiCanadians could carry on this programme in
the light of what has been said on the subjeet? Permit me Vo refer Vo the views of the
late lamented and much ioved Right Honourable Mr. Lapointe. I think you will agree
with me when I say that in a sense the
British Parliament is the trustee of the riglits
of Canadian mai orities as well as of the minorities, of the federal as well as the provincial
authorities. In the final jurisdiction of the
British' Parliament is Vo be found the safeguard of Canadian constitutional rights. At
page 3203 of the House of Gommons Debates
of 1931 Mr. Lap ointe is repnrted as saying:
I .do noV believe that the rights of the minoriVies in this country are linked with the legal
situation as it exists now. The hest safeguard
which the minority has Vo proteet their rights
lies in themselves rather than in &omne outside
authori.ty. I am of the opinion that Canadians
as a whole, in Quebec as well as in other provinces would noV permanently be satisfied with
a condition under which they would be subordinated Vo any power outside the Verritory of
Canada.
In that statement Mr. Lapointe was giving
expression to his view that some ime ini the
future Canadians wouid agree Vo take contrai
of their own constitution and work out the
procedures Vo take the place of the jurisdiction
of the parliament of Great Britain.
Hie further said:
So I Vhink there is a possibility of reaching
an agreement in that maVter. It will be difficuit
wfork, I am quite willinig Vo agree with my hionourable friend the Secretary of State, (Mr.
Cahan), that this conference will have before it,
but I helieve there is a possihility of coming Vo
an agreement and of devising safeguards Just as
strong as those which now exist in order te allay
the fears which the minorities might have in
regard Vo their rîghts.
Where is the agreement to take the place of
those securities that Mr. Lapointe recognized
as existing notwithstanding the passage of the
Statute of Westminster?
The late Dr. Skelton made certain observations, and I Vhink they are wort-hy of being
repeated. I read fromn page 42 of the 1935
report on the B.N.A. Act, in which Dr.
Skelton is reported as follows:
Applying these Canadian precedents and this
outsie experience Veoaur immediate probiem,
how hest amendment is Vo be effected, Vhe first
question appears Vo be, should the parliament
of the United Kin dom be retained as the, instrument for effectsng amendments? I cannot
see any reason for such a solution. No other
country in the world looks Vo the parliament of
anoth9r country for the shaping of its constitution. This solution could only be supported if
we believe that Canadians are the onflypeopie
sO incompetent that they cannot workc out a
solution of their constitutional problem, and se
biased that they alune àmunj the peuples of the
world cannot be trusted Vo ceal f airly with the
varions domestic interests concernied. To retain
permnanently the intervention of the parliament

to give of their great wisdom and experience
in holding the line of caution and consideration
when changes in the fundamental constitution
of the nation are being made.
I think that the Senate would be well advised to delay this proposal and consider it
with other larger measures. I have presented
a resolution for future consideration, but I
am not insisting on it; and I thank honourable
senators for the kind and close attention they
have given to my remarks on what I believe
to be the situation today. I do not want
them to think that I am without experience.
I have been active in a good many fields of
Canadian life. ' Born in the -centre of the
dominion, I took part of my education in the
Maritime Provinces and for fifty years have
lived on the Pacific coast. My experiences cmbrace working with my hands at a trade and
being associated with our labour movements.
It has been my privilege to study law, to hold
office as mayor of the city in which I live, to
represent it in the provincial legislature, as
well as in the Canadian House of Commons
for ten years, and to receive the great honour,
which you all enjoy, of being a member of
this chamber.
I do not apologize for the views I hold, because they have been gathered from an active
participation in public affairs and the business of our Canadian people by one who has
never failed to thank his parents for selecting
the Dominion of Canada as the place where
he was privileged to be born.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I crave the indulgence of the house for
a few minutes only. I shall have consideration for the patience of my colleagues, in view
of the lateness of the hour, but I believe I
would be derelict in my duty if I did not
offer as a humble contribution to this important debate the brief remarks which I am
-about to make.
In the first place I should like to remind the
Senate that a few days ago we celebrated the
79th birthday of confederation. For 79 years
the British North America Act, our constitution, has governed relations between the provinces as well as between Canada and the
British Empire, or, as it is now known, the
British Commonwealth of Nations. Since that
statute has enabled our country to keep on
its course for almost four score years and
to arrive at its present glorious position, it
must be concluded, I submit, that the statute
is a good one and that its provisions indicate
that the Fathers of Confederation were farseeing and broad-minded. If we stopped to
examine with a magnifying glass the meaning
of this, that and the other section, and were
afraid to make any change because it might
63268-32

471

be dangerous in the future, the act would become an iron rule lacking that flexibility necessary to meet changing circumstances in the
life of the nation. I suggest to honourable
members that in ;he British North America
Act, as in any other piece of writing, the
letter killeth, but the spirit quickeneth.
I shall try to confine my remarkà to the
resolution before us and not attempt to rove
over all the territory that has been covered in
this debate. The resolution is contemplated
by section 40 of the British North America
Act. The act provides that the number of
members from the various provinces in the
House of Commons may be changed from
time to time by the Parliament of Canada,
in accordance with a basic formula. The
province of Quebec was assigned a fixed
number of 65 members, and this established a
basis of representation which determined in
turn the representation of each of the other
provinces. In my humble opinion a certain
provision in subsection 4 of section 51 of the
act has been misinterpreted by the Privy
Council and has led to an anomaly in the
representation of the various provinces in
the House of Commons. This resolution proposes a change which would do away with
that anomaly and re-establish representation
upon the basis of population, except only for
the p'roviso that no province shall be represented by fewer members in the House of
Commons than it has senators in the upper
chamber of parliament.
I shall not deal with any figures that have
been quoted, but I should like to suggest to
the honourable senator who has just taken his
seat that in my judgment the table of figures
he gave does not tell the whole story.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: It does to us.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The honourable gentleman failed to indicate that if the representation were adjusted in accordance with the
British North America Act as it now stands.
there would be 238 members in the House of
Commons, or seven members less than the
present number, and that these seven would
be taken from the four western provinces.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: There would be
227, not 238.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Under the British
North America Act as it stands now, there
would be 238, but if the calculation were made
without taking into account subsection 4 of
section 51, there would be 227.
Hon.,Mr. VIEN: I wish to take up as little
time as possible, because the patience of the
Senate isHon. Mr. MacLENNAN: -exhausted.

CANADA'S

METALLIFEROUS

MINES

REPORT 0F COMý\MITTEE CONCURRED

I;

The Senate resumcd from Thursday, June
20, the adjourned debate on the considieration
of the report of the Standing Committec on
Naturai Resources rospecting the economie
value nf metaliferous mines in Canada.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK:
Hon-ourablo
senators, thýe report of the Standing Committoe
on Na tut-ai Re:sources is a resuit of the motion
made before this house on the 28th day of
Marelh last, which reads as foilows:
That the Standing Comîinittee on Naturai Resources ho instructed te examine into the economie value of metaiiiferous mnues in Can ada
and report to tdie house its findings, and to
that end have power to cati and examine w itliesses and keep a record of its proceedings.
I am sorry the honourable sonator from
Toronto (Hon. 'Mr. Hayden) is not in the
cliamber tonight. On the 20th day of June
last ho made a very fine explanation of wliat
the committee contcmplated in the report
which ýwas be-fore us. I thon askoed to have the
matter stand, and it lias been largely my fault
that, it lias not beon furthcr debated since
that date.
I would now ask honourahie sonators to
f oiiow My remarks, te sec if in any moasure
the eommittee foilowed its order of reference,
namely, to invostigate motalliferous mines in
Canada. Excopt for goid and goid mining flot
one single featuro of the question referred to
the eommittee was touchod lapon.
In bis
remarks on the 2Oth of June my honourable
friend from Toronto stressed that fact. H1e
went te considerable length to state what gold
bas done. Among otiier things, lie said:,
After ail, once goid is mined it is gone forevor.
13- Mir. ROBERTSON.

And furtber on:
We must not assume -tiat goid is where 3 ou
find it.
That comment of the honourabie gentleman
reminds me of an incident reported three weoks
ago by our friend who at ton o'clock evory
Sunday morning makes a radio broadcast for
the information of the country people. 11e
told about a chieken somowhere wost of Northi
Day which, w-lin kilied, w-as found te have in
its crop a gold nuggot th at on examination
turned eut te ho worth $100.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Somo chien!
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Since that time I
have tried lt visualize tho number of prospectors and promoters appearing in that
vicinity in an offert te ascertain where the
chicken got its nugget.
The hon-ourablo senator from Toronto mado
a very nice explanation of what the cemmittee
did'. As reported at page 423 of the Sonate
Hansard, lie said:
The probleni et 3-our cenimittee was wiiat
colilit andi shoîild lie (louie il, eider to niatutain
anti encourage thte goild tning iudustry ef
Ciantadla.
Titat is: net nt ail what the committee w-as
instrîicted te de. It wvas te inquiro into the
value cf metalliferous mines in Canaada; but
net one sentence eaui ho found in the report te
indicate that the committee inquired into any
plîa.,e of mining except
gQld minîng.
On tue 20th day of June the distinguishod
members of the committee wero in a hurry te
gct their work compieted, te place their report
before titis lieuse, and have it O.K'd. and
sent aiong te tue Finance Minister se that ho
wotild take their recommendations into consideration.
What wore the recommendations?
They were recommondations to put more
meney into the peekets of the prospectors.
I amn net one of these feiiows who will argue
against tUe preducers and, workmen in the
mines of Canada gctting a .iust and fair wage;
they shouid get it first, lait and aiways; but
there are otiier indix iduals very mucli intercste(l in the goid mining industry who, in my
humble judgment, roquire some timely supervision te kcep them fromt utilizing the services
of many uninformod citizens of Canada and
cisewhere, and inducing thcm te bite w-bore
they should net bite.
According to the report' of June 19 the
cemmittee
lîad befere it a number of
distingiiished gentlemen
and well known
associations. Lot us sec what associations and
witnosses appeared before that committee.
The associations w-ore as foliows:
The Ontario M-Niiug Asseciation;
The WVesternî Quiebec Mining AsseciatÀon;

JULY 23, 1946
The Toronto Stock Exchange;
The Mid-West Metal Mining. Association;
The Prospectors and Developers Association,
and
The British Columbia and Yukon Chamber of
Mines.
The following witnesses were heard:
Mr. Sidney Norman, Special - Writer, the
Toronto Globe and Mail;
Mr. A. W. Hawkey, Chemist, Royal Canadian
Mint;
Dr. W. C. Clark, Deputy Minister of Finance;
Dr. Charles Camsell, C.M.G., former Deputy
Minister of Mines and Resources, and
Mr. W. H. Losee, Director of the Industrial
Census, Dominion Bureau of Statistics.
The committee did not have before it certain gentlemen who, I think, should have been
there, and who could have given advice in the
matter of protecting the rights of individual
citizens of Canada and elsewhere.
I , am
referring to the chairmen of the Ontario and
Quebec Securities Commissions. Our friend
the senator from Toronto told us how many
millions of dollars had been earned in the
gold mining industry during past years, but
he did not say, and could not say-nor can
I-how much money compared to the value
of the gold produced had been spent by tfie
people of Canada and the United States on
this "Corne on" stuff.
May I read two short articles which indicate what I mean? One is under date of
June 14, two or three months subsequant to a
time when we heard a good deal about some
of the states in the United States barring
certain mining prospectors in Canada .from
carrying their wares across the border and
selling them to the uninformed and unsuspecting public.
This article is headed
"Restrain Toronto Broker in Virginia", and
says:
A permanent injunction prohibiting Wanapi'tei Basin Mines Ltd., of Canada, from offering
gold mine securities for sale in Virginia without
authorization of the State Corporation Commission was entered by the S.C.C. today in one
of a series of actions dealing with unregistered
security offerings in the state.
The commission also entered a temporary restraining order against a Toronto firm of
investment brokers, banning their security offerings unless authority first is obtained from the
commission as the administering authority for
the Virginia securities law. The firm is A. E.
De Palma & Co.
Robert Mitchell & Co., of Toronto, was summoned to show cause why a similar restraining
order should not be entered in its case.
That is only one of the things that indicate
to me that the chairmen of the Ontario and
Quebqc securities commissions should have
been present to give this committee some
advice regarding protection of the unsuspecting
and uninformed public.
I will read part of another article which
came out on the 20th of June. That, by the
way, was the date when this matter was last

475

disciissed in the Senate. The article is headed
"J. T. McTague may order investigation of
Beaulieu," and it goes on to say:
"An out and out investigation" into the transactions that caused the sharp drop of Beaulieu
Yellowknife stock from $2.60 to only 60 cents,
may be ordered in the next few days by the
Ontario Securities Commission. This was announced late Wednesday by Chairman J. P.
McTague, who said the commission is now completing a preliminary investigation . . .
Mr. McTague's statement followed a special
meeting of Beaulieu shareholders Wednesday
afternoon at·which Samuel Ciglen, president,
charged the stock was driven down by "professional (short-selling) operators who saw a
chance to make a killing. I am convinced, he
said, "'that they got together and that it was
organized."
Alan Jobson, a shareholder, who said he was
a ticker-tape watcher, declared "more stock was
sold than was owned." He said he knew some
of the short operators, adding "that a lot of
good guys got licked for a million dollars in the
deal."
It seems to me that for the protection of
the public our Committee on Natural
Resources should have had something to do
with inquiring into the wherewithal of that
kind of work. Here, when at full strength,
we are 96 presumnably-most of us-distinguished representatives of Canada; mature,
capable citizens who will honestly and fairly
undertake to protect the rights of all
Canadians. But is there any evidence of anything being done here to prevent the gold
mine promoters from taking advantage of the
common craze of the years gone by-"Come
on, suckers; bite!"? To my mind the committee should be asked to deal with the matter
as it was originally placed before them, which
they have not done, by any means. The
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) said in his statement on the 20th of
June that all that the committee had dealt
with was gold. We know from his statement
what it was they were undertaking to do;
they were undertaking to get more money
into the pockets of the gold mine promoters
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:

Oh!

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Did somebody say
"Oh!"? That is exactly all that was involved,
the getting of more money, regardless of who
was hit or hurt.
I might go into it at further length. When
on the 20th of June I adjourned this debate
I intended to deal with it in a considerably
different way from the way I am dealing
with it now; but time brings changes, and so
tonight I want to suggest that if the Benatecomposed, as I have said, of 96 presumably
distinguished and reputable citizens-wants
to hand out even-handed justice to the
ordinary citizens of Canada, this report from

SENATE
the committee should be sent back to them
with instructions to do what they were instructed to do in the first place, and not to
come in here with some far-fetched excuse to
boost the stock and the wealth of the gold
mine promoter in the Dominion of Canada
and, presumably, elsewhere. I would not be
in order, of course, in making a motion of
that kind; but I really think the Senate
ought ta say that a, committee, when something is placed before it, should consider that
question and deal with it in the form in which
it was originally presented.
The motion authorizing the comimittee to
act on this particular question read:
That the Standing Comm ittee on Natural Resources be instrueted to examine into the economie value of metalliferous mines in Canada . . .

mining as a whole, but would help the public
in general ta, realize what mining means to
Canada.
Under the able chairmanship of the honourable senator from South Bruce (Hon. Mr.
Donnelly), we conducted our inquiry into the
economie value of metalliferous minas in
exactly the same way as the honourable senator
from Parkdale, as chairman of the Standing
Committee on Immigration and Labour, is
conducting his inquiry into the operation and
administration of the Immigration Act. We
invited all managers or presidents of metalliferous mines in this country to appear before
our committee. Those who came represented
only the gold mining industry, probably for
the reason that gold, being controlled by the
Treasury Department, is placed in a different
category from other metals.

The committee did no such thing, but rather
undertook to deal with the one product of
which the chicken got a hundred dollars'
worth in its crop at some place about 100
miles west of North Bay. I hope somebody
in this house will further the suggestion that
the matter be referred back ta the committee
with instructions to inquire fully into the
metalliferous mines in Canada rather than
to deal with one of them.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Did you invite the
chairmen of the securitios commissions of
Ontario and Quebec?

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Honourable senators, it is not my intention to speak at great
length and to follow the arguments of my
honourable friend from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock).
Evidently he did not read the
resolution appointing the committee to inquire
into the mining industry in this country,
or if he did read it he certainly misinterpreted it.
Hon. Mr, HORNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The resolution authorized the committee to examine
into the economic value of the mining industry in Canada.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: No; of metalliferous mines in Canada.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: It is the mining
industry. I have quite a task in pronouncing
that term "metalliferous mines", so I said "the
mining industry". The resolution was proposed by the late lamented honourable senator from Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McRae), who
probably knew more about mining and the
value of the mining and metals in this country
than any other man in the Senate. He was
very sincere in moving that resolition, tbinking the inquiry lie proposed would not only
belp the Minister of Finance to appreciate
the economic value of these metals and of
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I shall come to
that in a minute, if you will give me time.
Today the gold produced in our mines goes
to the Mint to be assayed, and then, whether
the producers like it or not, it is taken over
by the Treasury Department. Cold was controlled during the war, and is still controlled.
Consequently the mining companies and
others interested in gold mining were thus
concerned about presenting their views before
the committee, in the hope, perhaps, that the
Minister of Finance might grant some concessions which would stimulate the operation
of producing 'mines and the development of
new mines.
My honourable friend must realize that this
committee was not appointed to inquire into
gambling. 'Gambling, whether in grain, in
mining stocks or in horse racing, is something
that can be much better investigated by the
securities commissions.
provincial
various
Today you will find that these commissions in
Ontario, Manitoba, Quebec, and other provinces, are exercising very close supervision
over gambling in gold mining stocks. I ans
sure that on reconsideration my honourable
friend will appreciate that he did not understand the resolution, or else lie has misinterpreted it to support his argument.
About six weeks ago I and some others
had the pleasure and benefit of visiting some
of the mining camps in northern Ontario and
northern Quebec. We went first to Kikland
Lake and inspected a producing gold mine.
It is one of the most up-to-date, well managed
concerns that I have ever seen. That mine has
a very rich ore body, and the manager told
me that as soon as the company was able to

JTJLY 23, 1946
get material it intended to double the capacity
of the mine. This would entail a capital
outlay of $4,009,000, and spread over the
various industries in this country producing
the required material, would provide many
man-hours of labour at good wages. In short,
just daubling the capacity of that one mine
would give to aur people a tremendous amounit
of work. At Kirkland Lake we faund the
most up-to-date recreational facilities, and
schoals better than same 1 have seen in much
larger centres. Everybody was well dressed
and well housed. The, men working in that
mine earned fromn $6 a day upwards. In a
word, high wages had made a contented and
pra -sperous community. Next we went to
Timmins, with a population of 30,000, and
again we 'saw the same conditions as prevailed in Kirkland Lake.
Mining development i that northern caunatry has brought about a rapid development in
agriculture, and today with a lucrative and
canvenient market, the local farmers are in a
prosperous condition. It is unnecessary for
me to emphasize the great economic value ta
Canada of this development of our natural
resources.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask a question? The committee was instructed to, "examie into and report upon the economie value
of the metalliferous mines of Canada." .Will
you tell us where and how you did that?
Hon:*A. L. BEAUBIEN: I'arn telling yau
now-if you will only appreciate what I arn
saying. I have shown how the development
of these mines has led to the establishment of
prosperous, contented communities, and how
in turn this mining development has brought
about i that part of the country a corresponding deveIopment in agriculture-a development it neyer would have had otherwise.
Next we went to Noranda, where we
inspected one of the greatest milis I have ever
seen. Noranda is rnostly a copper mine.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is right.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Then we went ta
Rouyn, Val d'Or, Malartie and that whale
northern portion. of the province af Quebec.
The mining shafts were as numeraus as grain
elevators along the railway lines of Western
Canada. 1 grant you that some of the shafts
were abandoned, but.,others were in process of
construction, and still others were goîng concerils. At one place near Noranda the manager
was sinking a shaf t. He gave us figures which
showed that before he could get one ounce of
ore body or quartz he would have to spend
8262,000. Well, if that is flot of economic value
to the .country as a whole I do not know what la.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: That is for the first
ounce?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: I do not know
whether it la for the first ounce or not.
Now, honourablesenators, as'I saîd before,
it la flot my intention to speak at any great
length on this subject. My honourable friend's
criticism appears to 'be based solely on articles
he has read i newspapers cancerning some
stock exchange gamiblers who probably have
done something they should not have done.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Not at all.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Those articles may
also have complaied of too much gambling
an the grain exehange.
Well, honaurable
senators, let me say that you are flot going to
stop gambling, for life itself is a gamble. I
submit that the gold mining developments in
this country are essential to the economic wellbeing of our people, because obviously unless
those natural resources hidden in the ground
are developed they will be of no value to
Canada.
The honourable gentleman -is correct when
he says that we inquired inta gold miining.
We invited other people to appear before the
commi.ttee, and if they did not came it was
because they chose not ta do so. Our report
was 'based, as will be that af the Committee
on Labour and Immigration, on, the only
praper basis for such a report-the evidence
produced before the cammittee. The on-ly
evidence we heard was on the gold mining
industry.
I repeat that gold mining is of very great
value ta the ecanamic well-being of this
country. That fact was proved during the.
war, because gold enabled us ta pay aur
exch ange, ta keep our currency and trade balance, and ta carry the heavy burdens of wartime. If -Canada is to, lîve and. progress economically and front a trade standpoint, aur gold
production is of great value.
Some hion. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: May I ask if the
Chairman of the Securities Commission was
invited ta appear before the committee? I
understaod the honourable member ta say that
lie was.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: No. I said that we
were nat instructed ta inquire in-to the prablem.
of gambling on the stock market or ta questian the securities commissioners of Ontario,
Quebec. Manitoba or any other province.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Then yau are willing ta let the aid adage stand: "Came on
sucker, bite 1"

Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
as a member of tbe committee I amn in duty
bound te say that either the honourable senator from Parkdaie or I misunderstood what
the cooimittee was to do. Had the honourable
gentleman atteaded the sittings of the coinmitte be would bave beard the very problem
he refers to discussed by the membeus of the
committce and t.bose wbo ap'peared before it.
As I understand it, ou duty was to sbow
what tbe mining induýtrY biad meant to tbe
building up of citiez, ail over Canada. My
friend sîîggests tlî,at many millions of dellars
were lest. In one sense that mon.ey xvas neot
lest. Our duty was to try te obtain seine consideration for risk capital or, if you. like,
"'gamble money." Had tbe bonourable gentlemnan li'tened to -the witnesses who testified
hefore the committee ho would, bave learned
of hundreds of mines whicb cost large sums of
money and tben were found to be non-producers. Some-one suggested that mining was
an extreniely risky busineýs. Tbe witnesses
0ur
agreed, and empliasized that fact.
endeavour was te learnocf the necessity for
tbe expenditure on miningr, and tbe value of
its development te Canada.
For instance, the Hudsonýs Bay -Mînîng and
Smelting Company mine, lecaed on the
border bet veen -Manitoha and Saskatchewan,
bias a greator future than any otiier mine ou
the Northî American c~ontinent. However, a

sent to the treasury for amounts rcquired
during a certain pcriod-usually three montbs.
A letteî' of credit was issued in favour of the

contenîp]atcs, the repeal of a certain section
of tbe Art.
Section 3 of the Public Printing and Stationery Act, wbicli it is intended te repeal,

JULY 23, 1946
companies wbich were to handie the work, and
the clerk of the committee, acting as bis
secretary, had oqual power.
Section 3 of the Printing and- Stationery Act
is now obsolote because the staffs of the Senate
and the Bouse of Gommons have been roorganized, and their permanent officers, cierks
and employes are appointed under the provisions of the Civil Service Act. According to
section 3, which it is proposed to repeai, the
chairman of the committeo can thooretically
ignore ihe Speaker and the Clerk of the
Bouse and give whatever orders hie desires.
The practice I have referrod to lias flot
been in vogue for some time; but it is d.eemed
désirable that there shouid lie no possibility
for confliet in-the future, and the purpose of
this bill is to deleto section 3, of the Public
Priuting and Stationery Act from the statutes.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Will the leader of 1the
governmnent tell us wbethor it is the intention
of the govcrnment to procoed witb the revision
of the, statutes? The repoaiing of certain
obsolete sections miglit lead to that end.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am informed
that thé present procedure bas removed the
necessity for this section in the act. It seems
desirable, therefore, that it should ho deleted
from the statutes. I do not know that anyt.hing further is contempiated.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That situation has
existed for aimost ten years.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, I tbink it lias.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I merely ask the intention of the goverument.
Bon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have no information on the subi ect.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As I understand the
honourahie senator from L'Acadie (Hon. Mr.
Loger), ho means that instead of obsoiete sections being amended piecemeal, the statutes
shouid lie revised without delay.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It should ho one operation. The fact is that our statutes have not
been revised and consolidated since, 1927.
Bon. THO MAS VIEN: Bonourabie sonalors, the two bills whicb have been brougbt to
our attention toniglit propose to remove an
anomaly wbich arises from the fact that there
are obsoiete sections in the two acts wbich *are
to ho amended. In former times it was considered that parliament sbouid ho independent
of tho crown, as represented liv the cabinet. The
government is only a committee of the Bouse
of Gommons, and is responsible to, that bouse.
The Senate is the senior branih of parliament.

This bouse and the Ilouse of Gommons should
lie capable of deaiing with legislation brouglit
before them without being hampered in any
shape or form by the government or anybody
else. -For the proper functioning of parliament we must have funds to pay the staffs
necessary to efficiently carry on the work of
both houses. For a number of years theýgovernment lias been bringing botb bouses of
parliament under more stringent eontrol.
According to the provisions of the Consolidated
Revenue and Audit Act, without the dictum,
.of the Comptroller of Treasury no money can
be issued to pay even senators or members of
the Gommons, or the staff of either house.
The provision which formeriy was effective
became obsolete by reason of the Consoiidated
Revenue and Audit Act, wbich removed from
the two bouses the control of finances voted
by parliament for their proper functioning. I
think that the two bis which have been
brought to our attention are quite appropriate,
inasmucli as they remove the anoma]y created
by two obsoiete sections.
1 deplore the fact that we have reduced
the independence and the powers, of parlianment by placing them under the control of
the Comptrolier of the Treasury, through the
Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, and
by making parliament subi ect to, the application of the Civil Service Act. My remarks
wouid have been more timeiy ten years ago,
for it was thon the harmn was done. I see no
fundamental objection to eliminating fromn
the statute book the two sections.which have
beco-me obsolete, but I want to go on record
as supporting my honourabie friend's suggestion as to the revision of the statutes. We
should revamp the législation which affects
the two houses of parliament. and in doing
so deai witb ail the statutes whicb piocemeaI
have taken away powers that parliamont
must have if it .is to maintain its ,proper
independence.
The motion was agreed to, and the bull
was read the second time.
QUEBEC BOUNDARIES EXTENSION
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WIÈHART MeL. ROBERTSON
movod the second reading of Bill 156, an
Act to amnend the Quebec Boundaries Extension Act, 1912.
Ble said: Honourable senators, this blli is
incidentail to, the proposai concerning redistribution, which was deait with by the
resu1ution passed in the Senato on July 5,
1946. In 1912 the Parliament of Canada
extended the boundaries of the provinces of

SI2NATE
M\anitoba, Ontario aiud Quebc. by cimpters
32, 40 and 45 of the Statutes of 1912. As,
under the provisions cf the British _North
America Act, the population of Quebec was
the determining factor in fixing the represeotation of the other prov inces in the House
of Commons,' it was provided that the population of the added territory would flot be
counted in the population of the province
to be divided by 65 to find the unit of repres,entation on a redistribution or readjustment
of representation consequent upon any census.
Uoder the proposed ameodment to the
British North America Act, as to the readj ustmnent of representation, the population
of Quebec will not hereafter be the determining factor in fixing representation in the
House of Commons. Therefore, it is feit
that the restrictions inserted in the legisiation
of 1!912 should be reflux d. At the present
time the legislation that this bill proposes
to repeal would have no effect.
Whien the 1912 statute was passed, its coining into force 'vas made contingent upen concurrent legislation of the province of Quebec.
The presenit bill also provides that the amendment shall not corne loto effect util the leg-isl:aturc of Quebec agrees to it.
The motion was agrecd to, and the bill was

THE LATE SIR THOMAS CHAPAIS
TRIBUTES TO HIS MEMORY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. WISHART
MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I regret very much that
it is m-y duty to report te you that since we
last met xxe have lost througli death one of
our most distinguisbed colleagues, Sir Thomas
Chapais, K.B. Some of our members, particularly the younger eues, may not have
realized that behind the courtly bearing and
geutlemanly mien of the late senator from
Grandville lay one of the longest and most
distinpuished political careers in Canada. Having been a candidate in the general election of
1891, and nppointed to the Legishative Council
of Quebec in 1892, the late senatýor was prommnent i 0 the political life of this country for
more than haîf a century.
Senator Chiapais' ancestors came te Canada
in the early part of the eighteenth century.
He xvas born on March 23, 1858--nine years
before confedieration.
Altbough educated for the bar, te which he
was admitted in July, 1879, Sir Thomas followed his natural inclination and devoted bis
life, in a large part, te education and journalism. He held degrees from Lavai University,
Montreal University, Ottawa University, University of Bishop's College and Queen's
University. For a time hie was professer of
bistory in Laval University.
As a tribute te the high esteem in which
bis intellectual qualities and general character
were held, lie received the highest honours
from both cburch and state. He was minister
xithout portfolio in several governments of

1

JULY 24; 1946
the province of Quebec, and was at varjous
times leader of the government in the legislative council, of which he was also at one
time president. In 1930 he was a delegate at
the Assembly of the League of Nations. He
had, been president of the Royal Society of
Canada and of the Historical Society of Canada. At the time of his death he was not only
a member of this honourable bouse but als
government leader in the Quebec legislative
council, and minister without portfolio in the
cabinet of Mr. Duplessis.
Despite bis advanced years, he was, until
comparatively recently, a most regular and
faithful attendant of the sessions of the
Senate. Bis contributions to our debates neyer
failed to evoke the interest and respect to
wbicb bis long experience and inteilectuai
qualities entitled him.
On July 15, iast, he died quietly in the
bouse in which be was born 88 years ago.
The halls of parliament wili know him no
more, but the memory of bis kindly, courteous
and dignifled personality wili long linger
amnid surroundings where he was such a familiar
figure.
1 am, 1 believe, voicing the regret of al
honourable senators at bis passing.
(Translation):Hon. LUClEN MORAUD: Honourabie
senaturs, I sincereiy beiieved tbree weeks ago,
when I requested this Chamber to adjourn
the debate on the resolution respecting a new
redistribution -of electorai divisions, that the
late Senator for Grandville (Sui Thomas
Chapais) wouid temain among us to tahe part
in this important discussion. As a matter Of
fact, I was banded, at the time of bis funeral,
the notes which he had started to draft i
this regard.
Providence decreed otberwise.

In reveaiing to him the ailment that was to
carry bim. off, bis physicians advised him to
undergo emergency treatment at the HotelDieu in Quebec, but their clear-sighted patient
bearkened te the voice of Nature rather th-an
to that of Science, and returned te bis old
home at Saint-Denis de Kamouraska, wbere he
was born, andi wbere bis f ather, bis mother
and bis wif e had died. Tbe faîtbfuiness of bis
attachment for bhis native beath,,moved the
wbolle population of tbis beautiful ancient
village,.who tbronged to bis imposing funeral
elong with bis friends who had foregathered
from ail parts of the province.
The villagers of Saint-Denis fuily sensed
that they were 'accompanying to bis iast resting place a man of extraordinary distinction,
who had filied a m6st fruitfui and useful

career which marks an aiready completed
epoch, tha:t of the Merciers, the Taillons, the
Bouchervilles, the Chapleaus, the Lauriers,
and other emninent patriots whose names will
live in history.
Canada, and more especially Frpnch Canada,
has lost in our colleague one of its most
notable citizens and most universally respected
personalities.
It was prîncipaily in our province that he
played a leading part; and the short bicgraphical notes published in the Quebec press
convey but a very faint idea of the fullness
of bis career.
Admitted to the bar in 1879, he immediately
became private secretary to Lieutenant
Governor Théodore Robitaille. Candidate in
Kamouraska, at the Dominion elections of
1891, he was defeated by Henry George Carroll, by a mai ority of 95 votes. The success
of the one and the defeat of the other marked
for eecb the beginning of a brilliant career.
Mr. Carroll became Solicitor General in the
Laurier cabinet, ýthen one of the most bighly
regarded judges of our Court of King's Bench,
and finally Lieutenant Governor of our province. Mr. Thomas Chapais, in 1892, became
legislative councillor for the Laurentides division, in 1893, at the age of 35, goverpment
leader in the Legislative Council. In 1895,
he was Speaker of the IJpper House; in 1896,
president of the Executive Couneil in the
Taillon cabinet; and in 1897, Minister of
Colonization and Mines in the Flynn cabinet.
In this same year, following the d-ownfall of
his party, lie became leader of the opposition
in the Legisîn-tive Council, a post he was to

occupy for 40

yeaTs.

He was summoned to, the Senate ini 1919,
as representative for the division of Grandville; in 1930, he accompanied the Right
Honourable, Sir Robert Borden, as a Canadian,
delegate to Geneva. Then, fromn 1936 to
1939, and since 1940 to the timne of his deat!i.
he again hecame a member -of the government of his province and governmnent leader
in the Legislative Council.
Appointed professor of history at Lavai
University in 1907, he bas pubiished numerous works: Les congré gations enseignantes
et le brevet de capacité (1893) ; Le Serment
du Roi (1901); Jean Talon (1904), crowned
by the French Aoademy;. Le Marquis de
Mon tcalm' (1911); Discours et Conférences,
3 Vols. (1873-1913): Mélanges de polémiques

instant. It was in bis library, in the midst of bis
books, that the venerable deceased wisbed to
be laid in state. Be had lived with them, and
it was with them that he wished to, sleep his
last sleep. Bis library and his family constituted his most cherished possessions in thjs
world.
Sir Thomas Ch-apais was a statesman i'n the
.full acceptance of the word. Throughout bis
whole life h-3 interesrted himself ini the politics
of bis country, and ail political parties always
recognized bis attachment, to bis province.
lie was a great Canadian. His wbole life
was one of wvork and -of devotion. to his own.
His mo§t cherished wish was fulilled: ho
worked right up to the closing daye of bis long
and fruitful career.
In bis private life, ho was a great Christian
and a wise counsellor. Be knew ail the
families of Saint-Denis, wbo did lot fail to
address tbo.mselves to him to settle their
family affairs.
Those who Lad the opportunity of attonding
his funeral wero able to note the attacbment
of bis fellow-parishioners, of whom be was the
idol and the counsellor. He rests, now in the
humble cemetery of bis native parish, among
those wbo loved and respected bim.
1 take it upon myself to be the interpreter
of the citizens of 'Saint-Denis the senatorial
division of which borders on mine, and to
,express in this chamber the loss they mourn.
I need not review tbe record of bis brilliant
ýcareer, for this was- done very fittingly by the
honourable senator for La Salle (Honourable
Mr. Moraud). Suffice it to say that ho was
born at Saint-Denis de Kamouraska, Marcb
23, 1858. After brilliant studios at the Collège
Ste. Anne de la Pocatière and at Laval University, he wap admitted to the Bar in 1879,
and started at once to take an active part
in tbe political life of his province.
When. barely 34 years of age he was
-appointed Legislative Counicillor for tbe Laurentides division, and, i 1919, was summoned
to the Canadian Sonate for the division of
Grandville. Bis long and distinguished career
tolls us botter than I could express it, tbe
immense services ho rendered to his country.
Be leaves the works and the memory of a
man of gentle birtb.
In the namo of the Canadian Sonate I
-wish to convey to bis loved onos and to the
citizons of Saint-Denis the expression of our
ýdeep sympathy and the grief we experience
at the boss of this great Canadian.
(Text):
Bon. JOBN T. HAIG: Bonourable sonaitors, in a spirit of sadness, and yet in a spirit
of joy, I riso in my place to eay just a word
,or two 'about a former distinguisbed momber

of this house. Seldom is it the privilege of
legislators to know a groat man at close
range. Usually we, tbink that a great man
is somoone in a place other than where
we and our associatos are. My great joy
cornes from tbe fact that during nearly
eloven years of mernbership in this house I
had the close personýal friendsbip of the late
Sir Thomas Chapais. Sometimes we Canadians wondor if our coun'try wilb bold together.
Somotimes people say that Canada can nover
bo united as a groat nation. Bonourable
sonators, a nation that can produce mon like
Sir Thomas Chapais will neyer bo disunited.
A nation is made by its great leaders. Lesser
liglits may seom to control t'hings for a wbile,
but in the long run the destiny of a nation
deptnds upon the loadership given by its
great mon.
I will flot take- the time to speak of -the
caroor of Sir Thomas Çbapais. That 'bas
already been referrod to in some detail. I
arn not sufficiently familier witb the French

(Translation) :
Hon. ATHANASE DAVID: Honourable
senators, what a pity that once again one must
deplore the disappearance from the chamber
of a, personality that shed lustre upon it.
Thomas Chapais represented the epocli that
extended from confederation down to Our
times. Under the parental roof he learned
what were the struggles that preceded
confederation and also the difficulties that
followed its adoption.
Both bis broad iearrning and his splendid
experience were always at the service of bis
Senate colleagues, and every time lie deemed
it advisable to give his opinion, bis wo*rds
were listened to with infinite respect.
Learned historian that he was, nobody ever
impugned his good faitb. One might not subscribe to all bis propositions, but~ one bowed to
their sincerity.
lis was a well filled life and when lie was
iwont to recaîl tbe violence of the first fights
in which he took part in the political field be
always did so witb a cbarming smile.
Indeed, I shaîl neyer forget the reminiscences
he placed bafore me at bis office here, in the
course of conversations to which lie often
jnvited me.
A journalist, he broke a lance many a time
with my father in the course of lively and
occasiondlly, even rather acrid, controversies.
But time bealed everytbing, and, meeting one
another in the Senate several years later a
friendship, which past discussions had flot,
lessened, grew dloser and became very intimate.
How -often in the company of Béique one
could sc thsm-all -three, be told me, walking
beneath the great trees bard by tbe P-arliament Buildings, recalling yesterday and speaking of tomorrow.
Nimble-minded, bis witty and occasionally
bantering remarks amused; and age baving
tempered the harshness of eanlier years, even
tbe sharpest discussions always bore the
imprint of tbe most beautiful and serene
cordiality.
Tbomas Chapais is dead, but be will not
soon be forgotten. Everytbing about bim
is an example, a splendid spectacle. An active
life until tbe very last preserved to, bim bis
wbole intellectual and pbysical power. Like
a giant oak of tbe Canadian forest, deeply
rooted in tbe soif, it took tbe storn* and
stress, of bis eighty-eight years to, felI bim.
A great Canadian citizen bas just departed
from our midst; a beautiful page of, tbe past
bas just been tomn. Honourable senators, let
us bow our beads in respect.

(Text):
Hon. JEAN MARIE' DESSUREAULT:
Honourable senators, as a Quebec colleague of
tbe late Sir Thomnas Chapais, may I have tbe
privilege of associating myseif with the very
eloquent and well deserved tributes whi have
been paid to bis memory.
I wish first to assure my bonourable friends
opposite tbat I participate in the deep loss
they have sustained through tbe passing away
o? Sir Thomas Chapais. Thougli not sbaring
bis political faith, I bave always admired bim
as an outstanding Canadian and a great statesman. From this day fortb our ranks will no
more include the sage and venerable Sir
Thomas Cbapais. He wîll be greatly missed,
and it is wîth heavy bearts and deep regrets
that we now experience lis absence from tbis
Cliamber. I know it is the hope of ail, that bis
spirit may remain with us as we continue tbe
work wbicb lie se ably participated in and
furthered during bis long membersbip in this
House.
Canada bas received from Honourable Senator Cbapais contributions botb innumerable
and invaluable. He wa-s a gifted man, and lie
sliowered bis gifts upon bis countrymen-politicians, farmers, workers, students and statesmen alike. His oratory, simple, beautiful,
forceful and wise came to the ears of many.
His unpa:ralleled historical works are endowed
with the profound patriotism tbat lie felt for
bis native Canada. Tbe age-old curse of prejudice found noi lodging in the mmid or beart
of tbe late Sir Thomas Chapais. Tbrougbout
bis long and distinguished career tbe views of
bis opponents were always respected, and their
logic considered. Sir Thomas Cbapais possessed tbe quality of an open and unbiased
mmnd wben in 1892, fifty-four years ago, be
entered public life as a member of tbe Quebec
Legislative Council. Tbis quality was retained
as lie advanced to become a member of tbis
bonourable House in 1919, some 27 years ago.
In atribute te, the late bonourable senator
we cannot overlook anotber of bis very singular qualities. Altbough in bis 11f e lie scaled
great beiglits, althougi lie distinguisbed bimself in countless acliievements and probed the
great complex problems of lis province and bis
country, lie was always but a simple man. H1e
loved the simple beauty of the small country
village wbere lie was'born and lived-and
wbich I know well. H1e loved the simple
beauty of its surrounding rivers, fields and
bilîs. Hie loved the simple .people
among
wbem lie dwelt; and in turn lie was tbeir
champion. In simplicity lie was distinguished;
in simplicity lie was bonoured and knigbted by
bis King.
Tbrougb bis long life and full years lie availed himself of the God-given opportunity to

accomplish many things that bistory will
surely record for posterity. It would appear
with but littie reflection that the Almighty
God saw fit te allow him ta remain witb us
longer than most great mec, and for this we
can only be prnfoxundly grateful.
The accomplishments cf Sir Thomas Chapais
during bis distinguished career are far toc
numerous for me te relate accurately at this
time; but long will hie be remembered by tbe
honourable members cf this bouse for bis
great strcngth cf character and bis unswerving

able ,senators, after ail the remarks addressed
to the memory of Sir Thomas Chapais, one
eould piot say very much more; in fact, there
is littie more to add, save what. bas already
been said. But you might perhaps like to
hear a few very personal reminiscences from
one who, in this chamber, was longer and more
Sir Thomas
with
acquainted
intimately
Chapais than any other.
This takes us a long way back. When the
deathof the late Seinator Danduraad occurred,
I %vas the man who had known him longest.
Ia 1892, and that is a long time ago for most
of you, My chief, Mr. Augé had just been
clected in St. James County in Montreal. In
thosp- days, sborthand was very little known,
and 'typewritiag even less. Mr. Augé, wh.o was
a great speaker, was in need of a secretary,
somebody not' only able to catch bis thought
wbile hie was dictatiag, but also able to write
it down prop"rly. Wbea hie weat to the Quebec
Legisiature for the first time. hie took me with
him and it was on that occasion that I had
the pleasure of meeting the man you became
acquainted with, Thomas Chapais,,who later
became a legisiative counreillor. Years went
by. In 1896, G. A. Nantel-whom many of
you have kaown-then minister of Crown
Lands, father-in-law of my friend Senator
David, took me to Quebec as temporary secretary. This tcmporary job of mine lasted
eight years. but it gave me the opportunity
to meet Thomas Chapais, xvbo at that time
was Minister of Colonrization. My minister
was Ministe2r of Crown Lands, a department
which is rua side by side with the other.
This gave me the opportunity to become
intimately acquainted with Chapais. My minister, who was a writer, a newspaper man and
a friend of Thomas Chapais, said to me:
"Your.first duty, since you are so fond of
books, will be to set my library in order, and
if you are in trouble go and see Chapais."
And, as I was often in trouble, I weat to
Chapais. Had you seen Chapais at that time,
in all the vigour of his youth, in bis full manhood, you would have known the real Thomas
Chapais. It is said that a man reaps as he
sows. You knew him as a great speaker, a
great politician, a great writer, a great historian, but you ilever knew him as I kaew
him thea, young, strong, vigorous, evea ambitious, but evvr conscinus of lais dujties, always
bonest and impeccable in bis life as in bais
work.

Tell. there was also at that time, in
Spencerwood, Sir Joseph A. Chapleau, the
Lieutcnant-Govcraor, and there was ia Quebec the Société des Dix-tan members whio
were often fiftcen-the Langeliers, the Lemieux;
among the Conservatives, there were the Nantels, the Chasé, the De Puyjalons and the
DcIpits. As sccretary to - the minigter 1

you can imagine biow I kcpt my eyes open,

Becauise of bis extraordinary memory and

you alway3 got the truth from him, and

office and said: "I have very good news for

w-ho said: 'You will sec what a lovely life we

and wc shaîl take care of youi." And Sir
Thomas, dîiring the rest of bis life, remindcd
me of the days of my youth.

with the late honourable senator, are probablv thinking after hearing the tributes of
those who, knew him so well: "He nust have

He was a real man,
honourable gentlemen. While I did not know
him intimately, like my honourable friend
from Ponteix, for nearly twenty years I had
the privilege and the pleasure of sitting opposte him, gaining inspiration from his eloquent speeches and feeling the enthusiasm
which
his
admirable
sentiments
always
aroused in me. Some of you have praised
his literary gift, some his political talent,
some his personal qualities. Well gentlemen, although I feel inclined to consider
him as one of the greatest newspapermen
ever produced by French-Canada, I mist
chiefly render homage to the impartial and
sober-minded historian-and this is the more
to his credit as he took part in many very
bitter political struggles during his youth.
Well, gentlemen, it is net only a voice wbich
has now become silent, it is also a writer's
hand which death lias stilted. Sir Thomas
Chapais was a devotee worshipping at the
shrine of History and, in his turn, he bas
become part of History.
Only a few days ago we closed the grave
on the mortal remains of a great citizen.
Already he belongs to the annals of the
country, political, literary, journalistic. The
example of his energy, his faith, his virtues, will
be an inspiration to cur youth who have
the heavy responsibility of following the steps
of the faitiful servants of the City in the
path of honour, of duty and of enlightened
patriotism.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have, honourable senators, a notice of motion as follows:
That the Standing Commrittee on Finance be
authorized to examine expenditures proposed by
the estiunates laid before parlianment, and by
resolutions relating to other proposed financial
ineasures of whici notice has been given to par,hament. in advance of the bills ba.ed on the
said estimates and resolutions reaching the

CANADA

DAY BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READINO-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed fromWednesday, June
26, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Foster for the second reading of
Bill 8, an Act respecting Canada Day.
Bon. WISBART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Ronourable memibers, throuýh the courtesy
of the honourable senator from St. Jean
Baptistè (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), who adjourned
the debate, I should like to say 'a word or two
on this bill.
I do not need to remind honourable senators that this is not a government measure.
It was introduced in the other house by a
priva-te member, and on reaching us was
sponsored by an honourable senator. So I
would ask honourable mnembers to regard the
observations I propose to make as strictly my
own and in no way reflecting government
policy as such.
I have become interested in this bill in
more ways than one, for I have found myself
infiuenced to a very marked degree by the
discussion which has taken place in this honcurable body. In my native province I had
heard no suggestion that there should be any
change in the name of nur national holiday,
and I must say quite frankly that when the
bill was, introduced it did not interest me

4'

very much. But as the discussion continued,
certain statements made from time to time
profoundly impressed me. I amrn ot sure that
I remember them in chronological order, but
one of the first that stands out ini my mind
was made by the honourable senator from
Vancouvkr-Burrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer), to
the effect that the first of July was littie
observed in thae city of Ottawa. This led me
to discuss with other senators the situation
in their respective. communities. 1 found that
while the day was celebrated with varying
degrees of interest, there certainly was flot
that enthusiasrn displayed which might be
expected in commemorating what is generally
regardcd as the national holiday ofL Canada.
Then, honourable senators, I asked myself
what 1 did to mark the first of July as the
outstanding day in our calendar. 1 might say
that I corne from a family which. was intensely
antagonistie to confederation. My earliest
recollection as a child is the attitude of my
grandfather. He was an associate of Joseph
Howe in the anti-confederation battles. Reverently but firmly he would remove the Union
Jack from our gate post, saying as he did so,
that the flag might fly there any day but the
lst of July. As time went on, the lst of July
meant to us in varying degrees, certainly not
I
sO much as might have been expected.
arn told that even to this day some of the
more extreme anti-confederates fly the Union
Jack at haîf mast on the first of July, although
I must confess 1 have neyer seen this done.
Some Hon. SENATORS.: Oh, oh.
But if rny
lion. Mr. ROBERTS*ON:
observant friend who sits on the opposite side
of. the house-with whom 1 share the great
privilege of residing in the very beautiful
village of Bedford-had looked, across the
bay on the lst of July last year, he would
have seen me flying the flag of Nova Scotia.
This I have done for many years, and had
I been at home on the first of this month
I have not the slightest doubt that I would
again have flown the same flag.
Hon. Mr. BENCB : Not the red ensign?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not know
.iust why I do it, honourable senators. 1
suppose it is a 'heritage from the past. As
an adult.whose responsibility is at least equal
to that of other people in Canada, I now
realize that by doing what I did 1 was not
making very much of a contribution to the
idea of a united Canada. Honourable senstors and others who have placed less than
the proper emphasis on the importance of
our national 'holiday have, to a greater or

JIJLY 24, 1946
a change of name Dominion Day to Canada
Day woul helip us very 'muc-h in the province
from which I corne. However, I do nýot think
it would hinder ûs, for so far we have not
made a v.nry goodb j.ob of celebrating the first
of July. I do not thiok we can boast of
our respect for that day. 1 arn quite mure
that the name "Confederation Day" would
flot help us. But, honoura-ble senators, I arn
prepared to accept the specific suggestion of
the honourable senator from The Laurentides
(Hon. Mr. Bouchard) andi the general spirit
of the honourable member frorn De Sala'berry
(Hon. Mr. Gouin), and to state that I should
Iike to see the first of July declared the statutory national holiday of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. 'Mr. ROBERTSON: I would 'he prepareil to go to the province of Nova Seotia
and say to the people ther'e-as 1 have said
to myselî and te my con-science-"ýI.t is time
we stopped fooling and being childish. about
this question. This is a great ceuntry."
Every honourable senator withîn the sound of
my voice is apprised cf the meaning of
citizenship in -Canada. But, gentlemen, our
responsibility does net end there. It is our
obligation to see that the children growing
Up in this country and the new-comers arriving here appreciate the significance of
citizenship as we do. I think a declaration
by statute that the first cf July is the national
holiday of Canada is worthy of our censideration. If any honourable member desires to
cal the day by a certain name, I can find no
fault wîth that. For instance, originally the
national holiday of the United States was
n'amed "Indcpendence Day," but today it is
referred te as "Thýe Fourth" or "The Gloricus Fourth". Because of the influence of
our American friends, we commonly refer te
our holidiay as "The First of July".
There are many differences of opin-ion as .to
the name by which the dey should be known.
I have rend that the Premier of Ontario had
said that even if the Parl'iament of Canada
changes the nlame of the first oif July te
"Canada Day", he will continue te refer te
that day as "Dominion Day." On the other
hand, if the Parliamnent of Canada declines te
change the name, it will he just as fair for
people in some other senti-ons of the country
te refer te the day as "Canada Day." The
important peint is that the Jul" lst k4heiulcI be
declared 'by statute te be the national holidày
ef Canada.
Honeurable senaters, I intend te, vete fer
second reading cf this bill in the hepe that in
comrnittee it will be amended as I have suggested. Sheuld it flot ha se changed, I reserve
my right te then de as I sce fit. But I ask

491

honeurable senators te bear in mind the importance cf this matter and te give serieus
and epen-rninded censideration te the question
cf establishing a national holiday. Heneurable members mîght well vote in faveur cf
second reading cf the bill. Sheould it neot be
amended in cemmittee, they cf course will
have a perfect right te de as they see fit afterwards. Fer my part I arn going te accept the
suggestion and the spirit cf the honourable
senaters who have speken in support of the
bill. I h-ope this house will give it second
reading and that in cemmittea it may be
amended along the lines I have suggested.
Serne Bon. SENAT ORS: Hear, hear.
Hen. J. J. BENCR: Heneurable senaters, I
had intended te vote against this bill en
second reading. Undouhtedly the people in the
part cf the country frorn which I cerne are
oppesed to designating the first of July as
"Canada Day", and I arn net sure that I disagree with the views that the old name sheuld
net he changed se speedily and give way te,
the new.
The honeurable gentleman whe has just
speken referred te Joseph Hewe. I sheuld like
to give the beuse my memoiy cf a brief statement made by that very great Canadian. My
recollection is that it goes semething like this:
It is a wise nation that gathers up its recerds,
preserves its munirnents, decerates the graves
of its illustrieus dead, and festers national
pride and loe cf country by perpetual referenca te the gleries and traditiens ef the past.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: That is exactly correct.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That sentiment, expressed many years age by anether eminent
Maritimer, has heen echoed in this chamber
today hy the henourable leader cf the geveroment. As I say, I had intended te vote against
the scond raading cf the bill. However, I
am rnuch irnpressed by the suggestion that has
fallen from the lips of the honourable leader,
and lika hum 1 arn prepared te vote for second
reading cf the bill, reserving te, myself the/
right te vote against tha third reading if sueh
an arnendment as he suggests is net made
in cornmittee.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Heneurable senators, 1
have already sl5oken en this bill, but I weuld
ask the indulgence cf the housa te allew me
te meve the adjeurnrnent of the debate until
tornorrew. The prepesal that has just been
made is absolutely new te, me, and I need
serne littie time te consider it. I realize that
in the circurnstances I cannet move the adj eurnment without unanirnous consent.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. VIEN:
Honourable senators,
there is no member of the house whose suggestion I would yield to with more pleasure
than I would to that of the leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig). However, it happens that
I have to go out of town tonight, and as this
debate has been carried on for a considerable
period I feel that we should conclude it now
unless there are cogent reasons for a further
adjournment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
This is, after
all, a private bill, and I would not have made
my suggestion but for the fact that I have a
certain responsibility to the house. I may
say frankly that I had intended to notify the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
of what I was going to do, but had no opportunity of speaking to him on the matter. The
fault is partly his-he attends so many committee meetings. It seems to me ·hat his
t
request is reasonable, but I suppose the
sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Foster) is the
one who should be consulted.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I do net want to raise
anv unreasonable objection.
Unfortunately,
I shall be away tomorrowHon. Mr. HAIG: I will promise the honourable gentleman a pair, if I have to pair
with him myself.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Perhaps the debate could
be adjourned until the honourable gentleman
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) returns.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That would be agreeable
to me. I simply want a little time to consider the suggestion that has been made this
afternoon.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I suppose it will be
understood that the rest of us who have already spoken in this debate will be given the
sarne opportunity as the honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) to speak again.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If it is the wish of
honourable members. I will withdraw my
request; but in that event I will certainly ask
that the house divide when the vote is taken.
I would be loath to do that.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The honourable gentlemari <oes not decire to reopen the debate?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No, no.
Hou. Mc. VIEN: The bonourable gentlemin simiply dei-rr to think over thre situatio
in ih I light of re marks made bY the
lionourable leader of the bouse.
i

lon. Mr. HUG: Yes.
Mr. I tAIG.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: That is a cogent reason
for adjourning the debate, and I agree to
the adjournment with pleasure.
The motion was agreed to, and the debate
was adjourned.
FOOD AND DRUGS BILL
CONCURRENCE

IN

COMMONS

AMENDMENT

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the amendment made by the House of Commons to Bill X9, an Act to amend the Food
and Drugs Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved concurrence in the amendment.
He said: Honourable senators, I will ask
the honourable gentleman from Gloucester
(Hon. Mr. Veniot) to explain the amendment.
Hon. C. J. VENIOT: Honourable senators,
this bil. which originated in the Senate, was
rend the third time and passed here on the
5th of July. It now comes back to us from
the other bouse with a short and commendable amendîment. Before the bill was considercd in the other place, representations
were made by the Canadian Pharmaceutical
Association to the Department of National
Heath and Welfare. to the effect that section
1 as worded might have implications beyond
what the department intended, since it might
be interpreted as giving the department power

to regulate the commerce in a particular drug
by, for instance, fixing the price' of the drug
or limiting tire quantity of it which could
be sold. In order to avoid any misinterpretarion of the deparntment's purpose, the other
house amended section 1 by adding at the
end thereof the following words: "in the
interest and for flue protection of the publie
heal-th."
The section as amended would
read:
Subsection one of section three of the Food
and Drugs Act, chapter seventy-six of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, as amended by
section five of chapter three of tIre statutes of
193!), is further amiended by adding thereto iimiediately after paragrapli (k) thereof the
following paragraph:
(kk) îlefining the conditions of sale of any
drug in the interest and for the proteetion of
the public health.
It may be recalled that the main purpose of
this section was to regulate the sale of penicillin and other new drugs, such as [ho sulpha
drugs. A large proportion of the medical profession as well as some provincial departments
of health consider it desirable that, for some
time at least, penicillin and other new drugs
should be sold only on doctor's prescriptions,

sc

that thise dlrugs muîay be under professional

JULY 24, 1946
controi. The amendment is a wise one and
should be adopted without hesitation by this
honourable house.
The motion was agreed ta.
EXPORTS CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 126, an Act ta amend the Export
Credits Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I will ask
the honourable senator from King's (Hon. Mr.
McDonald) ta explain this bill.
Hon. JOHN A. McDONALD: Honourable
senators, I hope ne one will get the impression
that I -set myself up as an authority on expert
credits insurance legisiation, for I feel that I
prabably do flot know as much about it as
some other members do. However, from the
reading I have done and my conversation with
the cief executive officer of the corporation,
I may be able ta give sufficient information
to enable honourable senators ta give the bill
second reading and refer it ta the Committee
on Banking and Commerce. There it could
be examined clause by clause in the presence
of the chief executive officer, and alsa Mr.
Johnson of the Department of Finance,' bath
of wham could be asked for any detailed information required.
Hanourable senators will remember that the
Expert Credits Insurance Act is comparatively
new legislation, having been first pàssed in
August, 1944. It was amended last fail ta
increase fromn $100,000,000 ta $750,000,000 the
amount that may be loaned by the Minister of
Finance.
Legisiation similar ta aur act has been in
effeet in Britain for 27 years, and the United
States government is now drafting a law along
the same lines. Before thý war sixteen«foreign
nations provided insurance facilities such as
our exporters have under this statute.,È
The bill is divided inta two parts. The
flrst part, which cames under the jurisdiction
of the Minister of Trade and Commerce, gives
exporters of Canadian goods the privilege of
_getting insurance which. they cannot get from
private enterprise. There are, I believe, two
private insurance companies, but they wil
only insure goods goinig ta the United States
or ta Newfoundland, s0 an shipments elsewhere aur exporters are unable ta obtain protection other than that available under this
Canadian government insurance scheme.
The scheme is of course a great encouragement ta the expansion of aur export trade.
It must bc remembered that Canada has to
expert about 25 per cent or more of ber
produets, whereas it is estimated tbat only

492

about 10 per cent of the products of the
United States are exported. Possibly that is
one reasan why the United States has been
behind Canada in this particular legisiation.
The amendments in the first part of the
bill are»the resuit of six months' experience
by the Expert Credits Insurance Corporation,
which was set up under the act. The corporation started business late in September
last yéar. I do nat knaw whether hanourable
members have seen its first report, covering
activities of a littie more than six *manth1-s,
but it was tabled in another place on the
23rd of May. The amendments suggested in
part I of the bill are, first, ta allow the corporation ta insure an exporter against any
risk of ioss under an agreement for the expert
of goods,

as well as any risk of loss involved

in the actual expert of the goods. The act
authorized the corporation ta insure an
exporter only after the goods had been shipped,
whereas it is desirable, in order ta promote
tlie increase of Canada's foreign trade, ta
rnsure exporters immediateiy they enter into
contracts with foreign buyers. Hanourable
senators will understand the reason for this.
Quite often gaods are ordered from manufacturons, and they have ta be stamped or
in some other way marked. In such cases
it is desirable that the insurance should run
from the time the arder is given.
lion. Mr. HAIG: Daes that proteet the
exporter in case of cancellatian of the order
after the manufacturing has started?
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: Yes, it does, if
the cancellatian could not be foreseen.
Haon. Mr. QUINN: The insurance protects
him.
Hon. Mr. McDONAIjD: Yes. The second
change is to allow the corporation ta insure
an exporter against ail risks of loss involved
in foreign trade arising from events beyond
bis contrai. Originally the act allowed the
corporation ta insure against certain specific
risks only.
The third change is tea show the corporation
ta insure ail goods which are exparted from
Canada, whether they be Canadian-produced
goods -or im4ported goada which are re-exported.
The re-export of goads forms a minar but
integrated part of Canada's expert trade.
These extensions of insurance protection
have been authorized since August 31, 1945,
under order in counicil P.C. 58e5, whkch order
wilh, of course, be cancelhed if this legishation
is enactcd.
The amendments ta Part II of the act are
desig-ned chiefly ta enlarge the purpose for
which credits may be used. This part cames

SEN ATE
tîncir the jurisdiction of the Minister of
Finance as well as of the M.ýinisýter of Tradc
and Commerce; whereas the first part cornes
wholly under the jurisdiction of the Minister
of Tradc and Commerce. The changes noted
bore are three:
(a) The amendments are designed to enable
a (redit to bc used for the pur-pose of payxing
for C-anadian services.. Under the aet, crcdit
e:ir only be used for the pturpoýýc of paying the
cosr of Caaadian-produced goods. There has
been a demnand by some countries for Canadian shipping, engineering and other services,
and this change will allow us ta meet reasonable demands of this nature.
(b) The second class of amnendments are designed ta enable a foreig-n country ta, make
the credit available ta private importers.
Under the act it is necessary for the foreign
goveroment itself or some agency of the

misunderstanding in that respect.
The Minister of Finance tabled in another

attention to those parts in the present bill
which were not found in the first. But before
doing so I should like to bring up to date
some of the information which I gave to
the house in May as te the general working
of the act, with particular reference to the
Members

will recall that in May I produced a certain
table dealing with the receipts and disbursements of the fund, and that the honourable
leader on the other side was particularly
interested to find out whether during any of
the then recent winter months the disbursements by way of benefits had exceeded the
receipts. I was able to give him that information. It was to the effect that March last
was the first month in which the benefits paid
out from the fund exceeded the contributions
into the fund, and that they did so by an
amount of approximately a million and a
half dollars.

was then referred te the Standing Committee
on Immigration and Labour. That committee
reported on June 19 in these terms:
The committee has been informed that the
government proposes to recommend amendments
to this bill which will involve substantial charges
on the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The proposals alter the character of the bill, making it
a money bill which, under the provisions of the
British North America Act, must originate in
the House of Commons and be first recommended
to that house by message of the Governor General. In these circumstances, it is the opinion
of the committee that the bill should be returned to the Senate with the recommend.ation
that it be withdrawn, and that consideration of
this subject be deferred until the bill from the
House of Commons reaches the Senate.
That, in, effect, is what happened, honourable members. The originail bill was withdrawn, and after the usual formalities required
for a money bill a new bill wiith certain
amendments was introduced in and passed by
That measure is now

before us for consideration on the motion for
second reading.
With two quite important exceptions this
new bill is te all intents and purposes the
same as the bill which we considered in May.
Perhaps honourable senators will recall that
I then inflicted upon the House a rather long
explanation.

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
Including the
government's contribution. I stated at the
time I was advised that for April the position
had been reversed and that the contributions
had again exceeded the payments made. I am
now in position to place before the house
a further table which gives the operation of
the fund for the months of April, May and
June. Briefly, during the month of April the
receipts exceeded the benefits paid out by
slightly over $2,000,000; the same was -truc for
the month of May; and for the month of
June the receipts exceeded the payments out
by slightly over two and a half million dollars.
With the permission of the house I shall
place this table on Hansard.

There was another point which 1 mentioned in May, dealing with the intention of
that time to extend the ceverage cf the
ITnemployment Insurance Act to the industry
of lumbering and legging in the province cf
British Columbia. Section 22 of the bill, by
amendment, permits the commission te brin,
a part of an industry under the eperation of
tlie act in cases where conditions in var' ous
sections of the country are se diverse that
it is not possible te bring in ail parts cf the
indtrti
ever the whcole country. In point
cf faut, it lias now beceî decided te bring the
lcgging and lumber industries in Britishi
Columbia cnder the provisions cf the t7nemplcyînent Insturance Act as of the lst, cf
August nexf.
MUay 1 ncw d&A
vr briefly withi the l' rincipal chianges 1ino\-idedl for by t bis measure?
The bill is a rstlir formiidable locking documient, ccnsisting cf 29) pages. but a large proportion cf it ccnsists cf a rearrangemntn and
reelassifleation of various sections withocî an',
important change in principlc. I weuld ask
heneciable senaters te turn te pages 3 te 15.
Hon. Mr.
able sena fer
erniment te
by order in

HAIýG: May 1 ask the henourif it is boet possible for the gevbrinig an indusfry under the act
ceuncîl?

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I arn ceming ta
that questien, and if the honeurable gentleman will allow me I will deal wit.h it lofer.
As I was saying, pages 3 te 15 merely contain a rearrangement of sections 27 ta 49 cf
the original bill and doi net involve aey
important changes in principle.
The important changes are as follows: In
section 29(1) (b) there is a change in the

ameunt of maney which an unemployed person drawing benefifs from the fund can earn
without disqualifying himself. Formerly he
ceuld earn by casual emplayment flot mare
than a dollar a day. That figure bas been
increascd ta $1.50.
ISon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

Thae next change will be found ini section
31(2) (d) which deals with persans having dependents. Honourable senaters will recaîl that
those w'ho have dependents get unempîcyment
benefits on a slightly higlier scale than thase
xx'he have noce. This amcndment is dcsigned
te give the benefit of that higher scale ta
persens wbe maintain a self-centained domestie
establisliment and support therein a wholly
dependent persen cennectcd by bloed relationship, marriage or adoption.
The tlîird important change will be faund cri page 7 af the
bill.

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE:

May I ask the

honourable gentleman if those features were
net in the bill wbich came before us earlier?
Hun. Mr. IILGESSEN: I aSm going uver
flic main features cf tlîe bill before us. I
hope I amn net wcaiying rny lîiacourable
friend.
The table of benefits and ratitcý for till chins'
cf empîcyces is broughf inte the body cf the
bill at page 7. Originally it was bidden away
in the second sehedule at the end cf the act.

The fourf h change, and anc of considerable
importance, arises under section 88(l) at page
21. Honaurable senafors will recaîl that the
L'nemplaynaent Insurance Comnmission bas two
principal funictions: firsf, te colect and ad-

minister the Unemployment Insurance Fund,
and, second, f0 cstablish and maintain an
unemployment service thrcughaut Canada.
Heretofore the commission bas been more or
less a self-governing body, responsible anly
to the Govcrnor in Council. This alteration
praposes ta make the commission, insafar as

the emplaymcnt service anly is concerned,
responsible fa fhe Minister of Labour. There
are a number of reasons for the proposed
change; but as these were discussed at some
lengf h by f13e honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) last May, if is unnecessary
for me ta go into fhemn at fhe present time.
In section 97, on pages 23 to 26, there will
be faund new provisions pcrmitting the coin-

497

JULY 24, 1946
mission to make regulations with respect to a
very large number of matters arising under the
act. At page 25 wiIl be found about tan or
twelve new powers that are given ta the com-

mission.

The most important of these, as I

pointed out last May, are the ones which
require employers ta apply ta the commission
when they wish ta employ people, and those
which require employeca who propose to take
employment to report to the commission and
register.
Section 105 at page 26 of the bill imports a
new principle which I am sure wilI appeal ta
honourable senators. It is designed to provide
for secrecy of the records of the commission.
In others words, the information which the
commission obtaîns as ta the empinyment of
an individual and the rate of pay which lie
receives is lienceforth to ha treated as secret
and confidential as between that individual
and the commission, in the samne way as a

man's income tax return is treated as confidential information.

Perhaps the most important ameindment
provided in the bill of hast May, and repeated
in this bill, is found in Part IV, under the general headîng of "Veterans" at page 22. This
provision details the riglits of combatants in
the recent war with respect to. unempioyment
insurance. Honourable senators will recal
that the general scheme is that anybody who
wam on active service in the Canadian forces
during the war. and who comes back to Canada
and engages in insurable employment during a
period of at least fifteen weeks in any one year,

thereby becomes entitled ta ba treated as if
lie or she had been undar the provisions of
the Unemployment Insurance Act from the
time of enlistment or the lst of July, 1941,

when the act came into force, whichevar is the
latar. In ordar ta make that effective the
gavernment pays into the fund on bahaîf of
the veteran the amount of the contributions
which lie and bis employer would have made
during the period whulle lie was on service.
Now I come to the additional changes introduced by this bill, and whicha were not ta ba
found in the original measure of last May.
They relate ta the fact that it lias now been
decided ta br.ing merchant seamen and other
employees in transportation by water under
th.e provisions of the act. Honourable senators
will recall that in Part II of the first sehedule
of the act there is a long list of what are called
excepted employments. These employments
do flot come within the purview of the act.
One of the excepted employments, as shown in
paragraph (e) of Part II of the firet sehedule
is as follows:
03268-381

Employment in transportation by water or by
air and stevedoring.
It is intended to amend that by substituting
the words:
Employment in stevedoring.
May I revert 110W to, the question xny honourable friend asked a few minutes ago? There
are two methods hy which excepted employment listed in the first schedule can lie brought
under the act. The first is under section 86 (2)
of the act which provides as follows:
On the recommendation of the committee and
the commission,' the Governor in Council niay
extend the provisions of Part Il of this Act
to any of the empinymnents specified as excepted
employments in Part Il of the First Schedule
to this act with such modifications, if any, as
may be found necessary, or by special or supplementary schemnes.
That method was adopted last year to bring
under the act employment in transportation
by air. The second method of bringing in
new classes of employment is by amending
legisiation, such as this bil, and striking out
somne of the exceptcd employments now listed
in the first schedule. That is the method
110W proposed in order týo cover employment
in transportation by water. The provision
respecting employment in transportation hy
air has becomne unnecessary, because this wais
deait with in 1945; and employment in transportation by water is now being taken out
because it has been decided to bring merchant
seamnen under the provisions of the Unemployment Insurance Act.
The second new amendment introduced by
this bill relates to the same subject, employment by water, and relates particularly to
merchant seamen who served in the recenr.
wvar. At page 23 of the bill there is a new
general lieading
section 96, under the
"Veterans", which I deaIt with a few moments
ago. It relates ta the rights of veterans. This
section 96 provides:
For the purposes of this part "veteran" shail
include merchant seamen ta whom a special

bonus or a war service bonus was payable and

period of service" of merchant eeamen shall
be sucli part of the time served which counted
for sucb bonuses as may be prescribed by the
Governor in Council.
That is the part of the new -legisiation which
made it necessary to withdraw the previous
measure from this bouse and to introduce the
present bill in the« House of Commons. The

policy

of

including:

merchant

seamen

as

veterans and entitling them to the provisions
of this act involved the deposit by the gov-

ernment of a substantial amount of money
in the IJnemployment Insurance Fund in order

seamen. The measure then became a money

BILL
SECOND

RSEADING

Hon. WJSHART MCL. ROBERTSON moved
tihe second reading of Bill 245, an Act te
amend the Public Printing and Stationery
Act. (Advances to the King's Prrnter).
11e said:
Honourable senators, the purpose of this bill is to increase the amount cf
the outstanding advances of money te the
King's Printer. The ameunt of the advances
was fixcd at $700,000 in 1939, when the total
expenditures by the King's Printer were about
$5.0001000.
By order in ceuncil under the
War Measures Act the advances were iacreascd to $2,000,000, and it is now proposed
te authorize this amount by legisiatien. Honourablo senators will understand that the
money is advanced te the King's Printer te
enable bim te buy materials and psy for
work that bas te be done, the work being

aftcrwards charged up te, the respective departments. During the war there was a very
large increase in the total expenditures fer
printing, and I believe that at one period
tbey reached a total of nearly $12,000,000.
It is cxpectcd, bowever, that there will be a
considerable reduction from new on, and that
the amount of $2,000,000, which as I say bas
alrcady been provided for by order in council,
will be sufficient.
It is really a sert of

COMBINES INVESTIGATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bihl 193, an Act to amend the Combines Investigation Act.
Be said: Honourable members, I have
asked the honourable senator from Rougemont
(Hon. Mr. Beauregard) to explain this bill.

JULY 25, 1946

Hon. ELIE BEAUREGARD: Honourable
senators, the purpose of this bill is to amend
the Combines Investigation Act. It will be
recalled that within the last two years Mr.

F. A. McGregor, Commissioner of the Combines Investigation Branch, made an exhaustive investigation into the operation of combines and cartels. In his report he recommended that the act be amended to provide for
more efficient administration, in order to facilitate inquiry into undue monopolistic trade
restrictions and unlawful combinations in
restraint of trade. This bill deals entirely with
organization, and makes no change in the
existing definitions of offences.
On October 1, 1945, the administration of the
act was transferred from the Department of
Labour to the Department of Justice. Consequently by section 1, the definition of "Minister" is changed from "Minister of Labour"
to "Minister of Justice."
Section 2 amends Section 6 of the act. Its
purpose is to increase the personnel and so
improve the administration. At present there
is a commissioner and an assistant commissioner. The amendment provides for the
appointment of one or more deputy commissioners, defines their powers and duties, and
empowers the commissioner to authorize a
deputy commissioner to make inquiries.
Section 10 of the act enumerates the duties
of the commissioner. By section 3 of the bill
paragraph (e) of section 10 is amended to
read:
(e) to compile information and make studies
concerning the existence in Canada of monopolistic conditions arising from the operations of
international cartels or otherwise and ta make
reports from time to time to the minister.
I infer that this amendment will enable the
commissioner to be more alert with regard to
the operations of international cartels.
Section 4 is new and is substantially similar
in form to section 20 of the Dominion Trade
and Industry Commission Act, 1935. The
amendment reads:
4. The said Act is further amended by adding
immediately after section ten thereof the following section:
"10A. The commissioner may receive complaints respecting practices alleged to be offences
under this act or under section four hundred
and ninety-eight or section four hundred and
ninety-eight A of the Criminal Code and may
investigate the same and, if of opinion that a
practice complained of constitutes such an
offence, may communicate the complaint and
such evidence, if any, in support thereof as is
in the possession of the commissioner to the
attorney general of the province within which
the offence is alleged to have been committed
or ta the Attorney General of Canada, for such
action as the .attorney general of the province

501

or the Attorney General of Canada, as the case
may be, may deem appropriate in the circumstances.'
This amendment is necessary since,' by subsection 1 of section 14 of the bill-it is proposed to repeal the Trade and Industry
Commission Act.
Section 5 of the bill deals with section 12
of the act. This section, if amended, will
read as follows:
The commissioner shall, on application made
under section eleven of this actThat is when six British subjects forward
an application supported by affidavit.
-or whenever he has reason to believe that a
combine exists or is being formed, or on direction by the Minister, cause an inquiry to be
made into all such matters as he considers
necessary to inquire into with the view of determining whether a combine exists or is being
formed.
So there are three ways of starting an
investigation into monopolistie organizations.
Section 6 of the bill amends section 22 of
the act, which deals with the powers of the
commissioner as to witnesses, and reads as
follows:
The commissioner may order that any person
resident or present in Canada be examined upon
oath before, or make production of books, papers,
records or articles to, the commissioner or
before or to any other person named for the
purpose by the order of the commissionerSubsection (2A) of section 6 of the bill
provides that the commissioner shall not
exercise power to penalize any person so
ordered to furnish documents, papers or
articles, unless application is made to a judge
of the Exchequer court, a superior or county
court.
Subsection (2B) reads as follows:
A justice before whom anything seized pursuant to a search warrant issued with reference
to an offence against this Act is brouglit may,
on the application of the commissioner, order
that such thing be delivered to the commissioner
and the commissioner shall deal with anything
so delivered to him as if production of it had
been made to him pursuant to subsection one of
this section.
This means that pending an investigation
the commissioner may be put in possession of
instruments, documents and evidence.
The next section of the bill provides for the
deletion of the last part of section 24 of the
act, which to some extent offered protection
against prosecution. Documents produced and
in the hands of the commissioner could be
used only under two sections in the Combines
Act and the Criminal Code dealing with the
same offence. The section now reads:
No person shall be excused from attending
and giving evidence and producing books,
papers, or records, in obedience to the order of
the commissioner, on the ground that the oral

502

SENATE

evidence or documents required of him may
tend to criminate him or subject him to any
proceeding or penalty, but no such oral evidence
so required shall be used or receivable against
such person in any criminal proceedings thereafter instituted against him, other than a prosecution for perjury in giving evidence upon such
investigation, inquiry, cause or proceeding.
We now fall back on the provisions of the
Inquiries Act.
A slight amendment to section 27 of the
act provides that the commissioner shall deliver into the custody from which they came
all documents, etc. Section 8(2) of the bill
reads:
Within thirty days following the transmission
of such report to the minister the commissioner
shall cause to be delivered into the custody from
which they came if not already so delivered, all
books, papers, records and other documents in
his possession as evidence relating to the investigation, except that if the commissioner lias reported that in his opinion an offence bas been
committed, be shall retain as evidence for the
purpose of prosecution such of the said books,
papers, records and other documents for such
further time as may be directed in writing by
the Attorney General of Canada or by the
attorney general of any province within which
the offence is reported to have been committed.
The only remaining section of importance
is the one dealing with patent rights. The
Combines .Act of 1937 dropped the section
dealing with this matter, and it is now restored.
The only change in the former section is in
connection with the powers of the Exchequer
Court to deal with persons charged with
using patents in any way to restrain trade.
The court would have the authority not only
to revoke the patents, but to apply any one
of five or six other remedies, thus avoiding
the potential dangers of the former section.
This part of our law is alrcady in the International Code.
We alone could not deal
with patents, bcrause they are already under
international supervision.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Does that
section permit cancellation of a patent?
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: I think it does;
an order may be made declaring it void in whole
or in part, but the court may make orders
of lesser severity.
Section 12 of the bill withdraws from the
courts of minor jurisdiction the power to try
certain offences under the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. LEGER:
Has the honourable
gentleman not missed a page? What about
section 10?
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: Section 31(1)
under section 10 of the bill reads:
Whenever in the opinion of the commissioner
an offence bas been committed against any of
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD.

the provisions of this Act, the commissioner may
remit to the attorney general of any province
within which such alleged offence was committed,
for such action as such attorney general may be
pleased to institute because of the conditions
appearing, any records, returns, evidence or report relevant to such alleged offence.
There is not any great difference between
that section and the present section. The
only change of any importance is the deletion of the provision that after the documents
have been sent to the Attorney General of
the province three months must elapse before
the Attorney General of Canada may take
action.
Coming back to section 12, I may say that
the only courts which would have jurisdiction
to deal with offences under section 32 of the
act. as under section 498 of the Criminal
Code, are the superior courts or, as they are
called in some provinces the supreme courts.
Section 13 of the bill repeals section 42 of
the act and section 28 of the amending act
of 1935, which are replaced by sections 6 and
11. respectively, of the bill.
After the bill has been read the second
time. J will move that it be referred to the
Standing
Committee
on
Banking
and
Commerce.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, may I congratulate the honourable gentleman from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Beauregard) upon his explanation of this
important measure, and the government upon
having brought it forward. I suppose that
no one in this chamber is more impressed than
I am with the evils involved in international
and other cartels, and certainly no one bas
had more reason to appreciate the difficulty
encountered by public authorities in their
endeavour to suppress illegal operations by
such organizations. Many years ago-I tbink
it was in about 1920-I was briefed by the
government of Ontario to prosecute a charge
of conspiracy against a large and powerful
alleged combine in the wholesale grocery trade
of Ontario. For two years it was my duty
and privilege to carry on that prosecution,
and I was impressed then, as I still am, with
the technical difficulties in the way. On every
side I was hampered by the apparent insufficiency of the lawv to carry out the purpose
of the prosecution, and to give the public the
protection which appeared to be necessary.
While I have net studied the details of this
bill so completely as has the honourable
gentleman who bas just explained it, I am
sufficiently familiar with it to be able to
say that its general drift is in the right direction. It will remove certain technical difficulties and, I hope, make it possible for public
authorities to maintain wiat the honourable

503

JULY 25, 1946
gentleman referred to as a more alert attitude.
Later in sny experience I was further irmpressed with the evils of combines and cartels
when, as a commissioner of the Hydro-Electric
Power Commission of Ontario, I had the
duty, along with my fellow commissioners,
of buying very large quantities of electrical
equipment. I observed over and over again,
when we called for tenders for electrical
equipment-supplies running into the thousands, hundreds of thousands and even millions
of dollars-that ail the tenders received were
for exactly the same amount. There was no
need to caîl for tenders, because any one of
the companies, if asked for a price, would
have given the same quotation as ahl the rest.
That was a perfecly clear indication of a
price-setting agreement among ail the manufacturers of the type of supplies in question,
and while 1 was no authority on the cost of
producing such goods, 1 was quite sure that the
tendered price was far beyond the true competitive value. On one occasion we received
a tender for electric light bulbs--the same
little bulbs that are sold 'by the hundreds of
thousandsr because they are used in ail Canadian homes equipped with electricity, and that
is a very large proportion of our homes. The
tender was considerably lower than any we
had had previously, sa we accepted it and
planned to seil the bulhs at pri-ces much below
what we had been charging. A short time
afterwards the tenderer came to us and said
that he found it impossible to fulfil his contract, as he could no longer purchase supplies.
Realizing the difficulty he was in we released
him froma his contract. H1e was paid a higher
price and then had no difficulty in obtaining

supplies. The general result was that the
people of our province paid more than the
competitive price for the hulbs. That is but
one illustration of thousands of su-eh arrangements made hetween large producers of goods
which are necessary in our modern life. The
basis of the cartel to which 1 refer was the
use of patents to exelude others from entering
the indu.-try.

Sometimes one may well wonder whether
we should flot be better off without any patent
laws at ail than we are now, with these restrictions gathered into the hands of very large
operators of capital who use themn to exact
unwarranted price increases. It is a grave
question whether the impetus that invention
is supposed ta receive fromn the granting of
patent rights is as heneficial in the encouragement of investors as it is harmful in placing
oppressive powers in the hands of international
cartels and combines. One could not read the
recent report-published over the name of Mr.
Me.Gregor. the commissioner in charge of the
63268-34

investigation-with regard to the operations of
international combines and cartels without
being impressed with the necessity of what my
honourable friend has termed a greater alertness on the part of the law enforcement to curb
their n-efarious practices. I wish Mr. MeGregor
and his staff more success than perhaps I
aehieved myself, and that they may have fewer
difficulties to overcome than were thrown in
my way as a result of the then defective and
inadequate law. This bill is a step in the
right direction, and I hope the authorities
will he encouraged by the readiness of parliament to deal with the measure. I arn very
happy ta vote for it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Cornmittee on

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I want ta thank the house for its kindness yesterday in allowing me to adjourn the
debate on this bill. I amn agreeable to the
suggested reference to cominittee, but on the
distinct understanding that in giving the bill

It is moved by myscîf and seconded by the

ta speak on it.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
members, the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roehuck) has
aiready spoken in this debate, and therefore

JULY 25, 1946
CRIMINAL CODE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 303, an Act to amend the
Criminal Code.
He said:
Honourable members, I have
asked the honourable senator fromt East York
(Hon. Mr. MeGuire) to explain this bill.
Hon. W. H. McGIJIRE:
Honourable
senators, this is a short, simple bill, and needs
littie explanation. When the provinces of
,Saskatchewan and Alberta were created in
1905 it was provided that the Northwest
Territories Act as of the lst of September of
that year should apply to, the two provinces.
Under that act, the jiury in criminal cases is
limited to six men. The Attorney General of
Saskatchewan hias requested that his province
be permitted to return to the twelve-man jury
system, and this is the purpose of section
4 of the bill. By section 3, however, the
six-man jury is retained in Alberta. The
object of section 5 is to permit the accused
in Alberta-where, as I have already stated,
the six-man jury is retained-to have haîf
the number of peremptory challenges which
hie would have if the jury consisted of twelve
persons. In effeet the proposed amendments
will make the Criminal Code applicable uniformly, so far as possible, to ahl the provinces.
I amn advised that there is some, urgency
about passing this bill; therefore, with the
consent of the house, I shahl explain the purport of it-s six main sections, and then, if
honourable members are satisfied, it will not
be necessary to send the bill to committee.
Section 1 of the bill would repeal subsection (c) of Section 9 of the Criminal Code,
chapter 36 of the Revised Statutes of Canada,
1927, which states that the provisions of the
Code shaîl, under certain conditions, extend
to and be in force throughout Canada, except
(a) in thte Northwest Territories, (b) in the
Yukon Territory, and (c) in the Province of
Alberta. The effeet of this repeal would be
to put Alberta on the same basis as the rest
of Canada except the Yukon and the Northwest Territories.
Section 2 of the bill further amends the
Criminal Code by adding immediately after
section 581 the new section 581A. Section 581
cornes undýer the heading of jurisdiction and
reads as follows:
Where an indictmnent ie found against any
person for any of the offences mentioned in section four hundred and ninety-eight--

This section deals with conspiracies, combines,
etc.
-the defenbtnt or persun accused shall have the
option to be tried before the judge presiding at
the court at which the indictmnet is foimnd, or
63268-341

the judge presidi .g at any subsequent sitting
of such court, or ,.t any court where the indictment cornes on for' trial, without the intervention of a jury; and in the event of such option
being exercised the proceedinge subsequent
thereto shaîl be regulated in so f ar as may be
applicable by Part XVIII. R.S., c. 146.
The proposed section 581A reads:
Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Act, any person charged with an indictable
ofleace in the province of Alberta may, with lis
owa consent, be tried by a judge of the superior
court of criminal jurisdiction of Alberta without the intervention of a jury.
The wording of this section applies to Alberta,
and preserves the right of a person accused
of an indictable offence to be tried before a
judge without a jury. I may say that the
Attorney General of the province of Alberta
hias agreed to these proposed amendments.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Would that provision
apply to any indictable offence or only to

certain classes of offences?
Hon. Mr. MeGUIRE: Indictahie offences.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: To evcry kind of indictable offence?
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE:
indictable offence".

The bill says "an

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Before the honourable gentleman leaves 581A, would hie please
explain to the members why it departs s0
radically from section 581, which deals only
with trial by judge without a jury in conspiracy cases? I understand that if this section is passed, any indictable offence in the
province of Alberta can be tried by a judge
without a jury if the accused consenits. Why
is it necessary to go that far? I arn rather
suspicins of that amendment.
lit.
Mr. McGUIRE: The section being
amended is 581, which refers to cases of conspiracy. As far as I can see, the amendmeu.t
dýoes not make any difference in. that section,
but it provides for -the systemn which bas been
in effeüi in Alberta under the ternis of the
Northwest Territories Act. In other parts
of Canada, except the Yukon and Northwest
Territories, there are juries of twelve. In
Alberta the wish is, and the Attorney General of that province lias so indticate-d,, to
carry on with a jury of six. Consequently,
thii: sectionHon. Mr. ASELTINE: I arn not satisfied
with that explanation. Does the 'honourable
member not think that section 581A refers
not only to indictiments in conspiracy cases
but to ail indictments?
Hlon. Mr. LEGER:

Even to murder.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Yes. Ilf th&t is what
it means, it should be redrafted.
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE: I understand that
these amendments are satisfactory to the
Attorney General of Alberta.
Hon. Mr. ASEiL'INE:
about that.

We d'o flot care

Hon. !Mr. MëcGUfIRE: I su.bmit that I bave
no authority to suggest that they be 'amplified to include ail offences. Alberta bas carried on under the Northwest Territories Act,
but section 1 of tbe bill brings the province
under the Criminal Code of Canada. Tbe
Attorney General of Alberta lias ernphasized
bis deýsire to continue witb a jury of six, and
therefore nlot only tbe cbange under section
581 but suibsequent changes ini the Criminal
Code are made to satisfy Alberta.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I think the point
taken by the bonourable gentlemian opposite
is quite in order. lis it flot agreed that the
word'ing of that new section would enable a
pe-rson cbarged with any indicta:ble offence,
including murder, to clect to bc tried by a
judge witbout n jury? 1 bave flot tbe Criminal Code before me, but would ask if the
intention of the amendment wouLd flot be
effected if tbe words "indict-able offence" were

14 section 581 tbe section uýnder wbicb they
wish tie person cbarged to inake bis election
for trial witbout a jury?
Hon. Mr. McGUIRE:
Honourable mierbers, as 1 sta.ted before I bave 'been advised
tlitit becauso this legisiation is to Uc avniled
of iii Alberta there is a desire that it be
paîsýsed spccdily. Ail the subsequent sections
of the bill have 'been drawn up after consulta-t on wi(li the Departiment of Justice, and
1 c:innot spcak for tbat departimont. If bionommable members tlink the section under
discussion ashould be amended, it is quite useless for mie to explain the other sections. In
mîîy op)inlion it woulýd bc necessary .10 send the
bill to a comniitee wherc officiais from the
iDepartmcint of Justice could tell us wbat
thmeir instructions are and, wliat Alberta
desires.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Will honourable
senators permit me to make a statement? As
1 bave not the legal knowledge posscssed by
many honourable members, I tbougbt this
measure was one on which there would be very
little question or further information required.
My sugg-estion w-as tbat, with the agreement
of the biouse, it might reccive third reading
this afternoon.
The lionourable gentleman
from East York bas pointcd out that the
passage of this bill is somewbat urgent. Aftcr
11011.

Mr-. I.EGER.

speaking to tbe bonourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) it bas occurred to me that
the bill migbt be sent to tbc Committee on
Banking and Commerce, wbicb could arrange
to meet tomorrow morning. If the explanations given in committee were satisfactory,
the bouse could convene bomorrow afternoon
at 2.30 pm. and reconsider the bill.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: If the bill is
amended bere it will bave bo go back to bbe

sec bow w-e can pass it in its present formn.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The bonourable gentleman
from West Central Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) intcnds to speak on the bill, but I
should like to answcr my bonýourable friend
opposite. We bave been worricd about tbe
section under discussion. If the bill goes to
committce and is amended, il will then have
to go back bo bbc Hotîse of Commons.
Hon. Mr. COPP: If there is no amcndment
to tbe bill, it will go tbrougb.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I arn not speaking on bbe
bill now, but on a point of order.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, if tlucre is subject matter in the bill Ibat
does not. meet witb the approval of the
Senate, honourable members are only dischiarging their dnty in taking- the stand bbey
do0, irrespective of the inconvcnience wbicb
may be caused to tlie province of Alberta.
Tbc position would be no worse if the bill
were rcfcrred to committce for furtbcr cxplanation tomorrow morning. If the information given then is satisfactory, bbc bill could
get third reading and be ready for Royal
Assent bomorrow afternoon.
On tbe other
baud, if amendmcnt is required, tue bill will
bave to stand over.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Thiat is satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. MeCUIRE: Honourable members,
il woîmid appear bliat some membcrs are vcry
anxious to bav e this legisîstion considcred
now, but I do flot tbink anytbing can be donc,
except in committce, wbcre wec can bear officiais of the Departmcnt of Justice. In view
of tbc circumstances, I suggcst that it would
be superfluous for me to give any furtbcr
cxpianation of those sections whbich modify
certain sections of the Code so as to make
tbem applicable to Alberta.
Hon. W. M. ASELTINE:
Honourable
senators, my cliief objection is to the amendment to section 581 of the Code. Perbaps the
malter bias been (liscusscd hîcre as fully as it
can be for the time being, and it may be
that in commit tee theme will be some explana-

JULY 25, 1946
tion or amendment satisfactory to us ail. I
do flot know why there should be such a
great rush to put the bill thwough. Section 7
of the bill statee that the act shall flot corne
into force until a date fixed by proclamation
of the Governor in Council published in the
Canada Gazette. I presurne that a special
issue of the Gazette could he printedHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is the
intention.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: With regard to
ihe other parts of thc bili, I think I arn
correct in saying that when the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta were first forrned
their junies consisted of 12 persons, and that
this rcmained truc until sorne years ago when,
for purposes of economy, hoth provinces
decided te try eut the six-man jury. In
Saskat chewan that was feund unsatisfactory,
and wc are no-w reverting te a jury of tweive.
Hon. Mr. MUrRDOCK: Please say why it
was found unsatisfactory.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I understand the
leader on this side (Hon. Mr. Haig) is geing
te speak on that part of the question, se I
wviil only say that wc found twelve good rnen
and true werc more iikciy te arrive at a
proper decision than six. Right from the
beginning the iawyers in our province were
absolutely against the change te a six-man
jury. and wantecl a return to the nid systern.
Hon. A. L. BEAUTBIEN: Have we a six-man
jury in Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: No. I de net think
Manitoba has ever had anything but a twelveman jury.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Oh ycs. We had a sixman jury. I votcd for it. I wiii tell you the
story when 1 speak on the bill.
Hon. Mn. ASELTINE: I think that in ail
the provinces except Saskatchewan and
Alberta the jury is now composed cf twelve
persons. I have no objection to Saskatcbewan
returning te thc twelve-man system, ner te
Alberta continuing with the jury cf six men.
1 think that in the end Alberta will revent te
the oid systern.
Hon. Mr. XINLEY: Docs this refer to the
petit jury or the grand jury?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: This. has nothing
te do with the grand jury.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Must net a truc bill
be rcturned by the grand jury before a person
is tricd by a judge or jury?
Hon. Mr. ASF>LTINE:- I amrn ot aire that
I heard the question correctly.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have ne grand jury
in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: I realize that this
matter is largeiy anc for the legal members
cf the bouse, but ail through my public life
I have obscrved certain invasions cf that
great bulwark cf British justice, trial hy jury.
In the province cf Nova Scotia at one time
there was a mevernent te aboiish the grand
jury. It seerns te me tbat if we are geing
te ailow persons charged witb senieus cifences
ta eleet te be tried before a judgc without a
jury, that is an invasion cf the systern cf
trial by jury, and for that reason I think the
pneposcd amendrnent should be vcry carefuliy cxarnined.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: We have ne grand
jury in Saskatchewan.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I arn against the six-man jury. Some
years 'ago Manitoba had the grand jury as
weil as the petit jury of twelve. For reasons
cf econorny the grand jury was aboiished,
and there bas been ne demand to have it
brought back. The need for it was largeiy
evercome by having only barristers appointed
as magistrates. The number cf aur magistrates bas been considerably reduced, and that
cf course means a wider arca cf jurisdiction
for each of tbem. Tbey are practicaiiy fulltime employecs cf tbe provincial government.
The systern wonks extremely wcil, except'for
the fact that public institutions such as mental
bospitais, j ails and reformatories are ne longer
visited and inspected by the grand jury, and
on that account there bas been some iittia,
compiaint.
Whiie I was a memben cf the Manitoba
legislature the petit jury in aur province was
reduced frorn twelve men te six. I may say,
if you wiii pardon a persenai reference, thair
1 was one of those who vcted for that change.
There soon arose a dernand for a rcturn te
the former system. The legisiatune then vcted
for the tweive-man jury, and that is wbat
Manitoba bas had ever since. At tbe time
cf the second vote 1 was net a memaber cf
the legisiature, but 1 was then, as I arn now,
heartily in faveur cf the twcive-rnan jury.
The dcmand for its rcturn carne principahIy
from accused persons and those associated
with tbeir defence, and was bascd rnainly on,
the contention, which I think is weii fcunded,
that the judge on the bench has greater influeDce over a jury cf six men than over onecf twclve.
I agree witb wbat was said by my honourable friend from Queen's-Lunenberg (Hon.
Mr. Kinley) about the importance of the
jury. Wc want tc sce to it that any person

SENATE
accused of a crime is given every opportunity
for a fair trial by bis peers. In Manitoba,
and 1 believe also iii Saskatchewan, there is
a steadily growing fe-ling that frorn the point
of view of both law enforcernent and defence
of the innocent, a jury of twelve men is fairer
than one of six. I vsnture the suggestion that
witliin five years Alberta will be asking for a
return to the twelvt'-ran jury.
In reply to the
Hon. Mr. MeGUIRE:
hionotîrable gentlernuin frorn West Central
Saskatchewan (Hon Mr. Aseltine), I rnay
say that the only ihange affecting bis province is the retura to the twelve-rnan jury.
Hon. Mr. ASELTfNE: 1 understand that.
Hon. Mr. McGUIPE: I do net think we
can obtain furthcr information on the bill
except by a rcferecuce to cormîttee, where
our Parliarnentary Counsel and officers of the
Depart nient of Jus ice could be questioned.

I arn advised that the proposed arnendrnent
to section 581 has corne frorn the Attorney
General of Alberta and bas been consented to
by the Mi «nister of Justice. However, these
matters cao be gone into properly only in
committee, and I would suggest that the
reference be to the Banking and Commerce
Comrnittec which, as was stated by the honour-able leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson), will be

The motion was agreed to, and the bill xas

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: With leave of

Hon. W. M. ASELTINE: Honourable senators. before the motion is put 1 should like
to make a briof explanation. Wlîen this bill
was being eonsidered here yesterday, a number of members ob.Iected to the proposed new
section 581A of the Code, thinking that a
new principle was being adopted with respect
to Aiberta, and not realizing at, the time that
the section embodied what is already the law
in that province. The section provides that
any pet-on chargeci with an indietable offence
in the province of M\berta mav. with.bis own
consent, ho tried by a judge of the superior
court of criminal jîîrisdiction, withoot a jury.
A similar provisiîon wvas in the Northwes.t
Territorie-, Act anti ias alasbeen the law
My only objection now is to the insertion
of this provision in the Criminal Code. I
think, it should ho lefi in the Northwest
Teiritorie-. Act util soch time as Alberta
decides that its law in this respect shouid ho
uniform w'itb the iaw througbout the rest of
the dominion. At the presen.t time Alberta
is the only province in which an indictable
offence may, with the consent of the accused,
ho tried by a judgo without a jury. However,
in committee this morning we were told by a
representativo of the Department of Justice
that at a convention to ho beld in Winnipeg
soon ho woulýd ho meeting the Deputy Attorney General of Alberta, and wouid discuss
this matter witb bira in an endeavour to have
Alîberta's law as to the trial of persons
accused of indictaible offences made uniformu
with the iaw of the other provinces.
I made no0 objection to the remainder of
the bill yesterdiay, and in view of the fact
that a very important case is coming up for
triai in Alberta on Monday and it is necessary for the accused to have the privilege of
making as many challenges of jurors as is

usual in other provinces, I arn no longer
opposing the bill and shahl not objeet te its
being read the third time now.
Tlie motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.

the bill now, if the bouse so desires, or to
wait until we bave it before us. So far as
I can observe there will be very littie other
business for us to do tomorrow. The Finance
Committee wiil have a meeting at 4 o'clock,
when representatives of the Department of
Trade and Commerce will Le present. I arn
entirely in the bands of the Senate as to
whether the motion for second reading of the
Housing Bill should bie made this afternoon.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I arn in a somewhat difficuit position.
1 neyer like to discuss a bill until it bas been
distributed. Hewever, before repiying to the
honourable leader's remarks, I wish to make
a suggestion on my own responsibility, as I
bave flot consulted honourable members on
this side nor anyone else about it. It looks
to me as though the Senate, apart from. its
committees, will have no work to do ail next
week. Some ten or twelve bis concerning
veterans' affairs were passed in the other bouse
yesterday, but tbey will flot give rise to mucli
discussion here. They are the resuit of the
deiiberations of a large committee which spent
a great deal of time on the whole question,
and I cannot imagine that we ini this house
will interfere with what they bave done.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Much of the discussion on the bis ini the other house was
in the Committee on Veteran's Affairs.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Aside from those bis I
do net see any legisiatien at ail in siglit. No
progress is Leing made in the otber place, and
we might as well face that situation. I therefore suggest to the leader of the governmnent
that between no-w and next week lie censider
the advisability of having a recess cf tbe
Senate for another week. I arn not in favour
of recesses of this kind; I prefer to keep
working for a montb or se, and not te bave
an ad.ieurnment unless there is ne work in
prospect for two er three weeks. As if is now,
I cannet seé bew there will bie anything for
us te do the week after ncxt. I weuld have
suggested an adjeurnrnent fer next week
except that seine impertant cemmittees are
scheduied te be sitting then. I de net want
to be pessimistic, but I tbink we shahl Le
lucky if this sessien is over by tlic lst of
(Jctober. This merning in ànother place
ne progress of any kind was made.
Hen. Mr. HOWARD: They were talking on
agricultural implernents.
Hen. Mr. HAIG: There was ne progress
yesterday either. 1 arn net criticizing anyene;
I arn simply stating the fact.
As te the National Heusing Bill, we on
tbis side are eager te bave the legislation
enacted. In my opinion, the seoner it is put
thireugli the better it will be fer this country.
My reasons for now urging the leader of
the goverament te consider a ten day adjournment, commencing next Thursday night, are
two: first, that se far as I can see there
will then be no legisiation hefore us; and,
secondly, tbat an early announcement wotild
give those of us who live a considerable distance frorn Ottawa an eppertunity te make
necessary Pullman reservations. It is impossibýle te get sucli accommodation on short
notice.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senaýtors, I sincerely hope that the predictions of
the henourable leader oppoâite wiil net be
borne out, although I arn bound to confess
that his experience is mucli longer than mine,
and places him in a better position te form
an opinion. I sbould have te be a crystaigazer to attempt any forecast. By next week
we shall be better able te decide our course
of action, and I can assure bim that I shahl Le
prepared te take bis suggestion into cofisideration in the light of circumatances at that time.
For the present I would suggest thst wben
the Senate adjourne to--morrow it stand
adi ourned until next Tuesday evening. By
that time the work of our standing cemmitteee and the ýltgislatàon before us wili have
been deait with, and we shahl Le able to
appraise future developments witb some degree
of accuracy.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Very well.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Then I move the
second reading, and I would asl, the hionourable senator fromn Keniiebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) to explain the bill.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT: Honourable senators, in dealing with 'this bill
1 shahl not pose as an expert and attempt to
explain àt in detail. Doubticas if this motion
is agreed to the bill will be referred to ene of
our standiog committees, where experts will
attend to give honourable members ail the
information they may desire. I hope therefore that they will defer any questions until
the bill reaches that stage.
The urgency for this proposed legislation
is obvieus.
Everybody complains of the
housing shortage. There is no use raising a
centrox'ersy over it. The better plan is to
examine the situation dispassionately and try
to find a solution. This bill, is, 1 believe,' a
step in the rigbt, direction, in that it wilh help
to co-ordmnate the measures ahready put into
effect.
We have been told tbat, for the first ten
years the housing programme will cox er
700,000 units. This year it is boped that 50.000
will bo complete(l.
The question may be
asked: Wby is tberc tbh housing shortage?
One of the reasens advanced is that (luring
the war many of our people moi cd from rural
areas to urban centres. But in my opinion
the principal cause is te be found in tbe fact
that the number of marriages bas increased
tbreefold. This, of course, is a sigo of prosperity. Before the 'var most, cbildren wben
they came of age remained unmarried, and a
family of eigbit or ten persons would hive
together in tbe same bouse. But today tbe
young people get married and need houses of
tbeir own, and at once more bouses are
required to hodge tbem.
One advantage of tbe bill is tbat, in order
te carry out tbe purposes of the bill, more
expert labour wihl ho required. It is estimated
that the construction of 30,000 units will provide a wbole year's work for 143,000 people,
66,000 of whom will be engaged directly on
tbe building sites. and the remainder in the
mines, forests and factories, providing the
materials and equipment whicb enter into
building construction.
-Anotber advantage of the bill is that it combines various governmental
organizations
whicb have to deal directly or indirectly with
building, and co-ordinates their tasks. Under
Order in Council P.C. 750M, of December 30,
1945, administration of the emergency shelter
reguhations was transferred from the Wartime
Prices and Trade Board tc, the Central Mortgage and llousing Corporation.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Tbis bill codifies ail tbe previeus laws, and
brings tbem more into conformity witb the
actual needs. The few changes which have
been made are the result of experience in the
application of the law, and follow ecenomie
and social conditions of the present time.
Thiese amendments are also necessary for the
transfer of tbe administration of the Nà.tional
Housing Act fromn tbe Minister of Finance te
tbe Central Mortgage aad Housing Corporation.
This haw may be divided inte four parts.
Under Part 1, the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation may offer hong-termn
boans te individuals who wisb te buihd houses
for tbeir own use. The boans are divided
inte tbree categeries: Joint loans made througb
Iending institutions; direct boans for the construction of dwellings; boans for additions te,
or for thé~ conversion of large lieuses into
several small apartments.
boans may be
made te individuals for a period of 25 years
instead of 20 years, as previously. The rate of
interest is 4ý per cent. Loan6 may be granted
te tbe extent of 90 per cent of tbe flrst $4,000
cf tbe lending value of tbe preperty, and
70 per cent of the mortgage value for the
amount in exccss of $4,000. Tbus an individual
may berrow $6.000 on a bouse witb 2 bedr-oems, $7,000 on a bouse witb 3 bedrooms
and $8.000 for a bouse with 4 or more bedreoms. Tbe period of the boan bas been
extendcd frema 20 te 25 years, tbe reasea being
that, it is casier for tbe borrower te repay it
oivcr tbc longer pcriod that is, the montbly
payments are smabber-and that the cost of
construction bas increased considerab]y during
tbe hast few years.
Thle bill amnends Part II cf tUec act authorizing boans te an individual who wisbes te
build a duplex, prexided he intends te
occupy one of the apartments himsehf and
te rent the other. In sucb cases boans are
:îutborized te tbe extent of 80 per cent of
the mertgage value, up te a maximum
amount of $10,000. Under part IIl bans up
te 90 per cent of tbe mortgage value may be
made te limited dividcnd bousing corporations
at a rate of interest. net exceeding 3 per
cent. The main piirpose of tbis provision
is te permit tho building cf bow:es containing
several lew-rental lodgings fer people wbe
cannot afferd te build their owa bouses. Sncb
boans may extend ex er a period cf 50 vears.
Loans allowed for the conversion of large
bouses into apartmnent buildings arc aIso at
tbe rate of 4-i per cent, and the maximum
loaned must. net exceed $5,000 for eacb
apartment.
The National Housing Act, as anîended, wihl
allow the corporation, under certain terms and

515

JULY 31, 1946
conditions, to grant loans on houses built
on leasehold land, and also authorizes loans
to mining companies lumbering companies,
and even to borrowers in fishermen's centres.
In remote regions, such as mining and lumbering districts, it is becoming increasingly difficult to secure stable and permanent labour
because of the almost insurmountable obstacles
in the way of securing convenient lodgings
for employees in these areas. To attract married men who wish to live with their wives and
children, it is necessary to provide them with
good housing. It is needless for me to give
any more details; the argument must appear
irrefutable to everyone.
Part III of the National Housing Act
authorizes loans on rural property. To date
operations under this provision have not been
very successful, but it is believed that the
amendments will be very useful to the
farmers, and to an even greater extent to
veterans. Let us not forget that under this
act veterans always have a preference.
Part IV of the act, which is still operative,
applies mainly to home improvement and
the conversion of large buildings into suites
of lodgings.
Finally, Part V authorizes the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation to make
investigations and to carry on research for the
improvement of housing conditions in this
country from a technical point of view as
well as from the point of view of townplanning. Research and study are essential
if we wish to develop throughout the country
an understanding of town planning which will
render our cities and even our villages more
attractive and beautiful, and make our homes
more comfortable at no additional expense.
While I have presented a brief statement

of interest on government loans and the 5
per cent or thereabout charged elsewhere. In
my city, and it is not very attractive from a
loaning standpoint, one can get lots of money
for housing-millions of dollars-at 5 per cent.
Anybody can get it.
About seven miles north of Winnipeg, at
a place called Middle Church, the government
has built some thirty homes under the
Veterans' Land Act. Some of the houses are
built on an acre of land, others on half an
acre, and the ex-soldier is supposed to live
there, work the land, and also work in the
city. My information is that those houses
are complete, except for a sewer connection
to the river which, at the farthest point, is a
mile away. Soil pipe cannot be secured and
the houses, completed in every other respect,
stand unoccupied. In that instance somebody

of the aims of the National Housing Act, I

are those who cannot get any other living
accommodation at all, except perhaps in barns.

am not in a position to give you technical
details on its operations. I suggest that you
attend the meetings of the committee, where
you may ask questions of the experts who
will be there for the purpose of supplying
necessary information.

Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable members, it is my intention to make a few re-

marks and then ask that the debate be
adjourned because the bill is not down. We
are to have the pleasure in committee,
tomorrow afternoon, of hearing the Minister
of Reconstruction, the gentleman who has
been in charge of housing up to the present
time.

The bill, as I read it, is largely devoted to
the

arranging of loans

and

the terms of

financing. These provisions are very necessary, but they do not solve our problem.
Financing is altogether too easy. There is
little difference between the 4½ per cent rate

slipped badly.

Had those thirty houses been

built in the city of Winnipeg they would have
been occupied for at least the past two
months; but they remain empty because the
sewer cannot be constructed.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: The reason is that men
do not want to work in foundries.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: If these houses had been
built in Winnipeg, or in the suburbs of St.
Boniface, St. Vital, Tuxedo, Assiniboia or
Brooklands, all of which have water and. sewerage services-

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: My honourable
friend knows that, according to the Veterans
Land Act, it is necessary to have half an
acre of ground for each of these houses?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that, but my point
is that veterans do not want these houses
where they are; they want them close to the

city.

The only people who would take them

The other day a seventh child was born to a
family that is living in one room in a barn.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: In Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; in St. Boniface.

We

are not quite as bad as that in Winnipeg, but

we are close to it. St. Boniface is just over
the river.
The things we need are nails, cement, and
dry lumber instead of green lumber. Plumbing supplies are also difficult to obtain. These
are the things the government should have

been looking after. In Winnipeg on the first
of July there were 3,300 houses in various
stages of construction, which means that some
of them were not advanced beyond the excavation. There is a new kind of housing project
there-I cannot recall the name of it at the
moment.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Pre-fabricated.

516

SENATE

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No; we have ithat kind
too, but there is another kind of project for
which you cannot get a permit unless you
build at least 15 houses. On the last Sunday
that I was in Winnipeg I drove out to have
a look at these places. Believe me, honourable members, it would make you sick to see
what human beings will be asked to live in.
The houses are not more than five or six feet
apart. Instead of directing its attention to
getting cheap money, the government should
have had nails, cement, dry lumber and other
supplies made available for building. Some
aluminum houses, pre-fabricated, have been
erected in Winnipeg, and I also looked oveir
them the last Sunday I was there. Well, I
would not like to have one built next door to
me. They are rectangular, with flat roofs, and
look like nice little garages. They are a bad
type of building 'to have in a residential
neighbourhood. There has been terrific opposition to them in Winnipeg, but the city council
is more or less helpiess in the matter because
of the clamour for accommodation.

their younger days, when they were working.
There are thousands of people in this country
who saved small sums and invested them, and
who now find they are worse off than old age
pensioners.
The government has got to take a firm
stand on its price control policy. It cannot
leave the responsibility to Mr. Gordon or to
a parliamentary committee.
You cannot
increase wages without increasing costs. No.
argument by the Government of Alberta or
the C.C.F. party can change that fundamental
law.

Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Can my honourable friend offer any remedy for the shortage
of nails and cement and dry lumber?

Hon. Mr. HAIG: The government has taken
over the steel plant at Hamilton. If I were
the government of this country and had taken
over that plant-I am not saying that I
would have taken it over-I would run it.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. I ask the government to direct its attention to having nails,
cement and proper lumber produced. I say
to the government that if labour is going to
be allowed to control this country we ought
to get out. When a government can take over
an industry like the steel industry and be
defied by strikers, there is sornething wrong.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is the backbone of
the whole trouble. I am willing to give labour
every dollar it can get. I did not like Mr.
Gordon until the other day, and then I got
my eyes opened. Labour is entitled to a
share, just as anybody else is, but when prices
start to spiral upwards you cannot keep up
with them. That is the situation we are facing.
The employees in the packing plants made a
wage agreement last fall, and now they find
that the money they get will not buy as much
as it would a year ago. I can understand the
men's position. The steel workers will make
the same discovery, if we leave them to go on,
and the whole thing will go around in a circle.
The government bas got to take the situation
in hand and control it. In the meantime it is
not the people at the top nor the ones at the
bottom who are being smothered to death; it
is the white-collared classes in between, the
people with fixed incomes. Included among
these are large numbers of people who are
trying to live on money that they saved in
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I would like to hear
the honourable gentleman suggest how these
people can be got to go back to work.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: That is the "$64 question."
Hon. Mr. BEN CH: I thoroughly subscribe
to the fundamental principle which my honourable friend Pas stated, but how can the
workers be persuaded to accept it?

Hon. Mr. BENCH: And put 15,000 people
in jail?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I don't care; I would run
it. I lived through the general strike at Winnipeg, in 1919, when the bread wagon and the
milk wagon could not go down the street
without the permission of the strike conmittee. The government of the day said, "No;
this must stop." It did stop, and we have not
had another strike of that kind out there
since. These are serious words, but we are
faced with a serions situation in this country.
It is all right to talk about what we want to
do, but in the meantime people have no houses
to live in. I mentioned a St. Boniface family
whose seventh child was born the other day,
and who are living in a barn. In case anyone
wishes to check up on it, I may say the
family's name is Wolinski. Just before the
last baby was born a taxi called to take the
mother to a hospital, and the driver went up
to the front door of the house at the address
that had been given to him. A boy who was
standing there said, " The people are not in
the house; they are at the back, in the stable."
These are conditions existing in this country.
Your boy and mine, who went over to Europe
to fight, are entitled to have a decent place
to live in when they come back. Despite the
great shortage of living accommodation in
Winnipeg, houses are being built seven miles

517

JULY 31, 1946
outside the city limits; but they cannot be
occupied because there is no sewerage or water
supply. That is the result of a haphazard
policy. The thing to do is to make materials
available for house building. We already subsidize this and that, and if we cannot get the
materials we want in any other way, let us
subsidize the nail makers, the cement producers and the lumber manufacturers.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: The trouble is the increasing cost.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Cost?
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: The cost of many
things.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly, because every
time you boost wages up goes the cost of
everything. And the men are not doing as
much work to-day as they did ten years ago.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Wages have increased
40-1 per cent since 1940.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. But the trouble is
that you are not getting the equivalent in
production. Go to any building contractor
in the city of Winnipeg and he will tell you
that to do the same work it takes twice as
many men to-day as it took in 1929. That is
the existing situation. I cannot change that.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Nor anybody else.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But there should be no
such thing as defiance of a government order.
True, the government did not take over the
rubber companies and a lot of other industries,
but it did take over the steel plants so that
production might not be interrupted, and the
workmen simply walked, out.
Hon. Mr. HARMER:
men to work?

Can you compel

Hon. Mr. EULER: No; but they are keeping others from working.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: If you will open the
doors and let those that want to work go into
the plant, they will go in.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: The men that go
in may not be competent men.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: They might be a lot
better than the men who are striking.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We have this condition
to-day, that men in this free country cannot
walk into a factory, although it is under
government control. That is a fact which it
is no use denying. Unless the country is in
a state of rebellion-and we seem to be reaching that stage-you have got to give men
who want to work the right to do so. A
friend of mine, a doctor in the plant, tells

me that a lot of men want to work, but
they cannot go in and then venture to come
out. Why not in a free country? Because
somebody stands ready to smash them over
the head. That is the answer.
I move adjournment of the debate.
The motion was agreed to.
PRIVATE BILLS
REFUND

OF FEES

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN moved:
That the Parliamentary fees paid upon Bill
K7, an Act respecting the Army and Navy
Veterans in Canada, be refunded to the association, less printing and translation costs.
The motion was agreed to.
RENT CONTROL
DISCUSSION

On the orders of the day:
Hon. J. A. LESAGE: Honourable senators,
I should like to direct your attention and that
of members of the government to a serious
situation now confronting the owners of houses
throughout the country. They are a numerous
class of people, and their capital investment
may well be regarded as essential to the econr
omic soundiness of this country. During the
depression, particularly between 1932 and 1939,
they had to let their bouses at rentals much
below anything like a fair return, fully expecting that when prosperity returned they would
be able to get back to a reasonable rental
scale. But wartime rent control has kept
rentals down to the depression level. New
houses containing five small roons and a bathroom rent on the average at about $55 a
month. On the other hand, old houses containing from six to seven large rooms and a
bathroom must be let at about the same rental
as is received for the smaller and newer type
of houses.
To-day the owners of these old houses are
in a most unenviable plight. Coal, although
the price is only ten per cent higher than
before the war, is of such poor quality that
they have to burn at least twenty-five per cent
more than they did seven or eight years ago to
produce the same heat. Moreover, instead of
paying furnace men $8, as they did in prewar days, they now have to pay them from
$12 to $15 a month. Besides these added
expenses, the cost of building materials has
increased substantially, and labour has risen
from sixty cents an hour to between ninety
cents and one dollar an hour. Naturally, old
houses constantly need repairs, and honourable
members will appreciate how much more costly

518

SENATE

house repairs are to-day than they were before
the war. Yet witýh ail these increased costs the
rentais board wilýl flot permit these property
owners to, raise their rents. In the depression
years few of 'them were getting aýny return
on their investment; today they cannot meet
their expenses.
I submit that commissioners should be
appointed in ail our cities to investigate the
rentai situation, se, that where warranted they
might recommend an increase of from five to
ten per cent in the rentais of pre-war bouses.
The granting of such an increase wouid at least
bring some measure of relief ta these un-fortunate ýproperty owners. The owners of new
buildings are rnaking money and have been
doing so during the war. They are permitted
to get 5, 7 or even 8 per cent on their investment, but the proprietors of aider properties
are losing money. A tenant mnay rent a sevenroom fiat for $58 a month and sublet two
rooms at $25 ýeach per monkhi. Therefore the
fiat is costing him only $8 a month, and in
effeet -the proprietor is pay;ng for it. I believe
this situation should be studied and corrected
so that owners will be treated fairiy and wil
be able ta meet the expenses of maintaining
their propert.y.

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Han. JAMES MURDOCK presented the
report of the Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour on Bill 243, an Act ta
amend the Unemployment Insurance Act,
1940.
He said: Honourable senators, the coinmittee have in obedience ta the order ai
reference of 24th ai July, 1M4, examined the
said bill and now beg leave ta report the
same without any amendient.
Han. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable menbers, I arn sorry I was unable ta ha in the
committee this marning, but I was very busy
in another committeeHon. Mr. MURDOCK: Bei are my honourable friend proceeds further, perhaps he would
like me ta repeat the statement which I made
ta the committee this morning, and as a
result ai which the bill was passed in about
llfty-five minutes?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: AIl right.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: The Unemployment
Iusurance Commission, an important department ai the governinent employs 8,275 persans.
Iast May we had before us a bill ta amend
the Unemployment Insurance Act, but after
we had considered the measure for saine wceks
we were iniormed that the government, for
the purpose ai bringing in iurther classes of
workers, .proposed ta recommend additional
amendinents which would involve substantial
charges an the Consoiidated Revenue Fund.
Since this would make the measure a money
bill, which ai course cauld nat be introduced
in the Senate, it was withdrawn, and a new
bill was introduced in the House ai Commons
and is now before us.
This bill may be described briefiy in this
way. Nearly two-thirds of the proposed
changes have been made necessary by
rearrangement ai saine ai the sections, and
by minor clarifications which experience has
shown ta be desirabie in saine ai the aid
sections. Clause 3 permits the caverage ai
persans whose status as empioyees has given
rise ta saine argument; for example, men paid
an a commission basis, who may be either
employees or independent contractors. On
the other hand. clause 36 excepts frnm caver-

1

age a persan who is virtually an employer;
for example, a man who owns more than haif
the registered stock of a corporation.
Clause 6 permits repeal of section 23 (2)
if the present proposai in the bankruptcy
bill on priority of dlaims is approved.
Clause 7 is a major rearrangement of the
present section in order to set out in a more
straightforward manner the conditions on
which benefit will be paid. It also increases
fram $1 to $1.50 a day the earnings permitted
from subsidiary employment; widens the
group oi dependents in respect of whom the
increased benefit rate may be paid, and authorizes benefits ýta be calculated ta the nearest
five cents. It also permits sinall errors ta
be cleared from the books af the fund. Clause
7 takes up about one-third af the bill.
Clauses 10 and 11, together with part of
clause 7, clarify the question of appeals ta
the umpire.
Part of -clause 14 assures that benefits
acquired by false pretences will flot be retained
by the claimant.
Under clause 16 proceedings against an
offender must be taken within twelve manths
of evidence sufficient to justify prosecution
coming to the knowledge of the commission.
Formerly the period was three months.
Part of clause 18 permits benefit ta be
paid when, due ta an erroneous decision af
an officer ai the commission, contributions
were not macle.
Clause 20 grants authority ta pay expenses
which may be incurred if it becomes necessary
ta, pledge securities held in connection with
the fund.
Clause 21 mnakes the date af the report of
the advisary committee the sarne as that of
the commission report.
Clause 22 permits the graduaI extension of
coverage ta persans engaged in lumbering
and logging.
Clause 23 makes the -National Employment
Service responsible ta the minister-that is ane
important change-and permits the serv ice ta
carry out adiditionjal duties not within its
i armai functions.
Clause 24 transees ta the Unempioyment
Insurance Act sections af the Veterans' Relhabilýitation Act dealing with unemployment
insurance, with saine enlargements relating ta
vet.erans ai allied nations and certain merchant
seamen. In this connection I may say that
clause 32 repeais the relative sections of the
Veterans' Re'ha)bilitation, Act.
Part ai Clause 25 continvués the requiremenit
that employers report the engagement of
ernployees, and that persans seeking employment notify the emDloyment service.

SENATE
Clauses 33 and 34 extend coverage to merchant seamen.
It will be noted that this bill places the
Unemployment Insurance Commission under
the direction and ýauthority of the Minister
of Labour. The plan follows the systems in
effect in Great Britain, the United States and
New Zealand, whe.re measures somewhat
similar to, the one before us nave been enacted.
It is stated that 60 per cent of the money
voted by parliament for the activities carried
on by the staff of the Unemrployment Insurance Commission is spent, not on work covered by the act, 'but rather on reconversion
and re-establishment activities of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Departmen.t of
Reconstruction, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture and
the Department of National Defence. If the
minister is to be responsible for this 60 per
cent. surely it is his duty to exercise a proper
supervision of the employment service, because
it is on account of that service and its staff
that the meney is: vetcd.
Perhaps bonourable senaters would like
some information as to the numbcr of persons
engaged in the work of the Unempîcyment
Insurance Commission in varions parts of
Canada.
Commencing with the Maritime
Provinces the figures are as follows: Moncton,
175; Halifax, 106; Charlottetown, 23-and at
various other places there are
smaller numbers.
In the province of Quebec there
are
real, 1,805; in Quebec city, 517-and in Montin addition there are 30 or 35 places throughout the
province with smaller staffs employed. For
Ontario the figures are, Toronto, 1,123; Hamilton, 177; Ottawa, 142; Windsor, 154-and
there are about 50 other centres with varying
numbers of employees. In the prairie region,
Fort William bas 48, Winnipeg 539, Calgary
169, Prince Albert 23, Moose Jaw 36, Saskaàtoon 79, Regina 94. In addition, there are
other places where the commission has offices.
Ont in British Columbia, Vancouver bas 702,
Victoria S6, New Westminster 69, and so on.
One important amenament, which may be
referred to by ethers who were et the committee meeting this morning-, is in favour of
returned men. Let us suppose that a man
who enlisted on the lst day of February, 1942
or 1943, came home and started to work on
the lst of February last. If after he bas
worked fifteen weeks lie is laid off and cannot
get another job, then for the purpose of comnputing the insurance benefits to wbicb bie is
entitled, the three or four years that he
served in the arme(l forces will be added to the
time that he bas worked since bis return. The
government pays into the Unemployment
Insurance Fund the wbole amcunt of the
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

contributions necessary to cover tbe period
wbile bie was enlisted; tbat is to say the
government pays the employer's share of the
contribution for tbat period as well as the
employee's sbare.
I was told this morning tbat the Department of Labour is anxious to bave this bill
passed today. I do not know wby that is, but
I presume there are some particular phases of
it wbicb tbe department wa-nts to put into
effect. In any event, we decided in committee
that we had better pass the bill, feeling that
if it did not work out as it sbould, it would
probably be back before us for reconsideration
at a later date.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I have no desire to delay passage of tbis
bill, and I want to thank tbe honourable
cbairman of the committee f Hon. Mr. Murdock) for bis fuill explanatien. I am not
going te repent the objections tbat I bave bad
to tbis act right fromn tbe start. It is an act
for taxation.
It taxes thousands of people
in this country who by ne streteli of the
imagination could regard theîinselves as ever
likely to receivc any henefits under it. The
bill tends, to extend that territory, for power
i8 given to the government to bring additional
classes, under the act by order in council.
Hon. Mi'. HUGESSEN: That power was in
the original ct of 1940. The bill makes no
change in tbat respect.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I ohjcct te the net on
the ground tiîat it taxes people whio cannot
pos'sibly benefit from it. If it applied only to
persons who are subjeet te seasonal unemployment. and to persons wxho, if they lost, their
jiobs, would bave a chance of re-emplovment,
I could understand it. But it geoes far bcyond
that. For instance, it taxes bank clerks. Now,
if a r'lerk employed by one bank is let eut,
there is aîbsolutely Po chance of bis getting
what the bill refers te as "suiita.,ble employmient". beuene
othier bank will take him.
The same argument applies to employees of
real estatc offices and law stndcnts. E%-en
lawye rs cmploycd in law offices-not partners
in firms.,, but tiaid partners. as wve cail themare taxed by thie net. Yet if n lau' firin let
sncb a man out of its employ the govecînment
would flot be able te find him anether "suitable" job. Except in a ual' period wlien there
is a great deaî'tl of legally trained men, there
is no "suitable emplovment" fer any lawyer
who happens te lose liii position. There is
ne dearth of lawyers nec', and it is certain
that there will he none ia the near future.
However. I will not pursue this. point further,
since the principle of the bill bas been
adopted.

AUGUST 1, 1946
I arn glad to, see that the administration of
part of the act is brought under the Minister
of Labour. When the original legisiation was
introduced in 1940 1 was opposed to the
independent commission, and so expressed
myseif. I arn opposed to, ail commissions
that are flot completely under the control
of a minister. Such commissions are the very
opposite of democratie. We had a few of
them in my own province of Manitoba, and
they were always giving us trouble. There
will be trouble over some of thein here too.
The members in another place can hardly find
out anything at ail about these bodies. For
instance, the government will flot state wbat
salaries are paid to officiais of the Canadian
National Railways. A great deal of information about these independent commissions is
flot available to, members of parliament.
I arn glad to see that in this bill there is
a drif t in the right direction-towards placing
control in the minister. It was inevitable
that the minister should be made responsible
when we began to bave some unemployment. Anybody could have administered the
act during the war years, when employment
was at a peak and you had to beg men and
women to work for you. Any group of commissoners could carry on under such conditions. Ail they had to do was to see that
everybody covered by the act paid up. An
office boy could have administered the act
then. But now, when we are starting to run
into unemployment-not anything diastrous,
sncb as we had in the "thirties", but ordinary
seasonal unemployment-the administration
must be brought under a minister who can se
to iý that people thrown out of employment
are rcquired to take another job.
I arn coming now to the main point that
I want to mention. A question was asked
about it in committee by my honourable
friend from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr.
Borner). The new section 27 of the act, on
page 3 of the bill, provides that every unemployed person who is "unable to obtain suitable employment" shaîl be entitled to receive
insurance benefits. I caîl particular attention
to, that word "suitable", and I venture to prediet that inside of two years the government
will be asking for an amendment to that
section.
Suppose an office clerk loses lis job and is
unable to find work in another office. He
May bave been brought up on a farm, but
why should hie admit that a farma job that is
offered to him is suitable? If he admitted
that, lie wokuld have to, work long hours every
day, whereas by denying it hie could continue
to draw his insurance benefits. The story
goes that a farmer came into an Ontario town

521

and got a job which paid pretty fair wages
f or eight hours a day. He met a friend on
the street and said to him: "How long has
this kind of thing been going on? Why didn't
you tell me about it?" During the war a
young fariner came into Winnipeg and joined
the army. On the farm, he and his wife had
been paid a total of $75 a month, but as soon
as hie enlisted lis wife alone got that much
fromn the government, and he got his clothes
and board and was paid so much a day
besides.
.l'le word "sýuitable" in that section is
partly responsible for the shortage of labour
in the bush today. But for the tbree or four
thousand German prisoners of war much less
pulpwood would bave been cut last year.
Who are looking after the sugar beets in my
province today? German prisoners of war.
Who are weeding the market gardens in my
province? German prisoners of war. Yet
there are large numbers of people unemployed
in the city of Winnipeg. Who will be doing
the harvesting work in that part of the
country this year? German prisoners of war.
That word "suitable" is causing the trouble.
I do not blame anyone who says that certain
work is not "suitable" for him. I would take
the saine attitude myseif, and I rnake no
pretence to the contrary. If I thought I
could. get unemployment relief by claiming
that liard work on the farm was not suitable
for mec, that is the attitude I would take.
But if I refused to take work, why should
people who could neyer draw any benefits
under tbis act be taxed to support me?
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Would you delete
that word "suitable"?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: "Suitable" is the word I
want out. I base my wholie address on that
one word.
Bon. Mr. MURDOCK: Buman nature being
wbat is it, tbough, I think my honourable
friend will admit, that there sbould be something there to permit the exercise of reasonable and consistent judgment on the part of
the officers who are handling the matter.
Bon. Mr. HAIG: Quite right. Suppose a
young woman who had been a stenographer
in a bank was offered a position in a law
office, she might) say, "That is not suitable
employment. It does not give me the so>cial
standing of a stenographer in a bank. -Theref ore the position is not, suitable, and I will not
take it."
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: That is limited.
Bon. Mr. BAIG. No, the word is "suitable." A man who has beýen working on a
farni and is offered a job in the bush will say,

522

SENATE

"I arn a farmer, and that is the only kind of
job I will 'take."
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Agricultural labourers do nlot come under this bill.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: But you are putting
lumbermien under it. In my city we have a
large number of people I'ooking for jobs, and
a large number of jobs looking for people.
Under this bill they cannot be brought
together. That is my objection.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I would suggest substituting for tbe word "suitabie" the words
"according to his or her qualifications."
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That would be better. but
I do not know why the word "suiitable" should
have been put in at all. I do flot believe any
government officiai wou'ld ask an inexperienced
man of sixty ycars of age to acccpt. a hard
labouring job.
Hon. Mr. DEPUIS: I liave personal knowledge of a stenographer who lost lier job and
was asked by the unempicyment office te go
to work as a washer-woman. Wouid that be
a suitable job for thc girl?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Noý.
Hon. Mr. DEPUIS: Then there mnust be
some qualification for the kind- of cmipieyment
offered.
Ho.n. Mr. HAIG: Suppose the girl was
twýenty years of age and iîad gene througli
high school, and there werc no other stenographer jobs available; I imagine that if she
were the right kind of girl -lhe wouid accept
a position as housemaid.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Hear, hear.
lon. -. HAIG: But, let me tell You. under
%r.
this bill she would not do 3o. I amn speaking
of things withi whichi I arn familiar. I know
young men who started life with me and who
were wiliing to take- the first jobs that came
along, aind thcY got ,crne p;ace; but the felIows who waite*d and waited until the particular kind of jobs they wantcd came aiong
are stili looking for those jobs.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That. word "suitable"
gives a gove.rnmcnt officiai a chance te decide
the wrong way. I amrn ft
a bit afraid of
offlcial, asking people to accept jobs that they
cannot do. We are ahi human, and I arn sure
none of thcrn would be so unreasonable. But,
remember, if that word is struck out people
will ho more anxious to hoid on to the jobs
they have got. As I said yesterday, wc in this
bouse muit face that fart, and uve are the men

AUGUST 1, 1946
In other 'words, after a reasonabie time the
Unempioyment Insurance Commission may
require an unemployed person to take work
of a kind other -than ithat of bis usual
occupation.
The honourable gentleman stressed the
argument that this is a taxation bill, and that
many people who neyer expcct to get any
henefit from the fund will have to pay into it.
But is flot that the generai practice in al
kinds of insurance? We ail take out lire
insurance for the protection of our property,
and hope that it will neyer be destroyed by
lire. Similarly, we ail have to pay unemployment insurance, because in this way we are
pooling our resources for the purpose of protecting those who are unfortunate enough to
be unemployed. We consider that it is in
the interest of society generally, as well as in
our own personal interest, that there should
he a fund of this kind. In these circumstances it seems to me that the wider the
coverage the better it is, both for the purpose of protection and of efficient administration. 1 do not see any real objection to the
inclusion of protected employment, such as
that in banks, where there is very littie hazard
,of unemployment. I have seen a good many
young bank employecs who got tired of bank-ing, its routine and slow promotion; they
usually went into brokerage houses and financial institutions. I have known them to fail
in these new jobs and become in need of
unemployment insurance benefits. Is it not
better for the banks, even if their employees
as a class do not need assistance, to pay their
share of the cost of this protection to society?
Contribution to unemployment insurance is
no more taxation than is the payment of
premiums for ire insurance. It is simply, as
I have said, the pooling of funds for the
general good of ail. The unfortunate ones
collect. 1 agree that our unemployment
figures are higher by reason of unemployment
insurance legisiation. We are ail human, and
when benefits of this kind are availabie everyone who can get thema will do so. I have no
doubt that many of our farm friends wbo
took employment in towns are now back on
8mali farms earning less than a dollar a day
in cash, and are taking temporary advantage
of unemployment insurance.
I do flot think our statistics on unemployment, which are greater by reason of this
legisiation, indicate grave danger. The unemployed had to pay -towards the insurance
fund when they were working, and thýey now
expect and are entitled to, receive some benefits, even if for a time thiey do sorte work
with small returns. It is a wartime legacy.

This legisiation is in keeping with the
policies of nations wbo are in the forefront of
industrial and social progress. While the
law is not perfect and wili have to be amended
from time to time, it is legisiation which we
should be glad to see come before this bouse
for amendment at the present time.

NATIONAL HOUSING BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday, July
31, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Robertson for the second reading
of Bil. 306, an Act to amend the National
Housing Act, 1944.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I will not delay the house at any length
in discussing this measure tonight, for I took
the liberty of speaking on some phases of it
on Wednesday last. The honourable gentleman who explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) dealt with it fully, but I am not sure
that he dealt with it in what I might call
popular or every-day language.
One of the great problems in Canada today
is the shortage of housing accommodation.
That shortage can be traced to a number of
causes, and I am going to list some of them.
The first is the period of depression that this
country went through, in common with the rest
of the world, from about 1930 to 1936 or 1937
-in fact, right up to about the outbreak of
war in 1939. During that period there was no
inducement and no need for much building.
Young men who had married and had set up
homes of their own lest their jobs and came
back to live with their parents, and frequently two or more families lived in what
was ordinarily a one-family house. Then with
the war came a challenge to housing in the
form, of rent control. I admit that we are
putting up a great battle to maintain price
control. Those of us who last week attended
the sittings of the Industrial Relations Committee in another place heard price control
discussed very fully and very ably by the
Chairman of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board. We may not agree with him as to

AUGUST 6, 1946
Hon. Mr. BENCHI: May 1 interrupt the
honourabie gentleman? Wili my friend be
specific as to how he would control a strike
in a government-owned institution? What
would he do about it?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: How d-id you do it during
the waïr?
Hon. M.r. ASELTINE: You took the plant
over.
Hon. 'Mr. HAIG: You took it over and, told
the men what to do, and if they did not do it,
you chucked them out. That is what you have
to do now, because this material rnust be
produced.
In the city of WinnÀpeg there are 3,300
houses at various stages of construction, and
neariy ail of tbern are tied up for supplies.
Yet the government cornes forward and says
it wiiI build another 300 houses for veterans.
That is just a politicai gesture. The Winnipeg
city council wants to make it appear that it is
getting the bouses. Both -it,and the goverament
are trying to take the credit. No organization
has been set up, such as we had during the
war, to sc that the production of building
materiais is rnaintaincd. I can welI rernember
the honourabie senator frorn Aima (Hon. Mr.
Bailantyne) asking in this bouse if we couid
flot make tanks in this country. The answer
was that we couid not; that we did not bave
the equipment, the engineers or the standards.
But, gentlemen, before we were througb with
tbe war we did make tanks and mýany other
tbings as weii. llousing is as serious a problem as any we faced during tbe war.
I may say that I ar nfot entireiy in favour
of catering to tbe young men who served in
tbe war. Honourable members wiIl pardon
the personal reference. I arn remainded of
what my boy said to me. He said,' "Dad, it
is -my turn." He was tben nineteen, and -it
was bis turn. I do not believe boys and girls,
because they went overseas and fougbt, shouid
be pampered and spoiied wben they corne back
heîre. 1 do not say tbat in a year or two the
people who are now clamouring for houses
wiil not be out of jobs and returning to the
farrns, leaving bebind themn ernpty bouses in
tbe cities. But at the present rate of construction we are flot holding our own.
About six years ago we made an atternpt
at siurn clearance in the city of Winnipeg. At
that time it was ýobserved tbat one area alone
had as much sickness and hospitalization as
ail the rest of the city.
We wili not get buildings unless we first
arnend the municipal tax laws. For instance,
under the present syste~m the landiord pays
ail tbe sehool taxes; the tenant pays no part
63268-35*

529

of thcrn. In Manitoba it is now possible to
apply the increased tax against the tenant,
but that is ail.
May I now attempt to repiy to the question
by the honourabie member frorn Peterborough
West (Hýon. Mr. Duffus)? The present legislation will not increase construction by one
single bouse; it does flot supply any material
for building purposes, and tbat is the basic
solution of tbe problem.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Does rny bonourable
friend say that the governrment should makie
men go to work and do what is required?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Tbe governrnt of
Canada bas got to do just as it did in wartirne. It bas got to ask, tbe people to produce
certain things. The production. of butter and
rnilk had to be subsidized in order to rnaintain tbe price ceiliug on these commodifies.
It ray becorne necessary to subsidize the
production of n-ails and cernent, but the fundamental necessity is to organize tbeir production.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
bonourable gentleman if ho can refer to any
period in the bistory of tbis country wben
more bouses were being constructed in bis own
city or aayiwbcre cisc than at. present?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That is a bard one.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: More bouses were bcing
erected in 1927, 1928 and 1929 than now, and
they were being finisbed.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: How many?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: More than at present.
I arn talking, not of bouses merely commenced,
but of the numýber finisbed. Wben a bole is
dug in the ground now it is counted as a
bouse under construction. Ia 1927, 1928 and
1929 more bouses were completed in Winnipeg
thon are being completed there today.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Is be aware that
during the past year more tban 30,000 bouses
were constructed in Canada? That statement
was made in another place.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That may be, but we
needed 60,000 to kee:p pace witb ordinary
demands, to say nothing of catcbing up with
the shortage.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Does my bonourable friend not realize that factories producing
plumbing supplies and other materials are
working at capacity today, except wbere there
is a shortage of raw materiais arising out of
strikes, sucb as the steel strike?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: My honourable friend is
simply saying tbat tbe factories would be producing at capacity if tbey could get the raw
materials to enable tbern. to do so. That is
true.

the numbor of these xvas a more bagatelle.
For some ovorseas squadrons net more than

leeked after tbem. Befere the 6th of May,
1945, wc knew Ihat we were running inte this
housing shortago-Ibat was plain te everybedy-and tie minute the Germans quit we
shdculd haxve started te organize this job that
xvc have got te organize now. 1 say that the
goernmcnt is te be criticized for the year's
delay in net roalizing the problem tbat we
facod. The situation is partly due te our
unentality. People have always said that if
money was cbeap and there was lots of it,
bouses would ho built; but there is lots of
cheap meney today, and houses are net being
built. We have lest a year, and now the
goxvernment is taking some action, probably
unider the stress of demand from the people
of tbis country te have tbings organized.

I amn quite willing that this bill should ýpass,
but I bave ne hopes that il will do any good
at ail. If anybody thinks il is an answer te
the demand for bouses, I arn sorry' for tbem.

Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. The sentiment is

years. The people want housing, and they are
prepared to support adequate meastires to get
it. The govcrnment lias to put its back into
the job and do it. Its present piecemeai effort
is getting the country nowhere. There cannot

WAR VETERANS' ALLOWANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 331, an Act respecting Allowances for War Veterans and Dependents.
He said: Honourable senators, I would ask
the honourable senator from Summerside
(Hon. Mr. Robinson) to make a brief explanation of this bill.
Hon. BREWER ROBINSON: Honourable
senators, this is a bill to amend the War Veterans' Allowance Act of 1930. That act was
pioneer legislation and met with general
approval at the time it was passed. It was
amended in 1936 for the purpose of -facilitating
administration, and in 1938 veterans of the
South 'African War were adimitted to its
benefits.
The purpose of the present bill is to provide
for the maintenance of Canadian veterans and
veterans of His 'Majesty's Forces or veterans
of His Majesty's allies who were domiciled in
Canada at the time of their enlistment.
Some honourable member has asked about
the benefits under this bill. It provides an
allowance for married or single veterans who
have attained the age oif sixty years, irrespective of their physical or mental condition,
and for those under sixty years who are permanently unemployed or incapable of maintaining themselves.
These allowances are
payable only when the applicant is in necessitous circumstances.
Since 1939 various orders in council have
been passed to meet changing conditions and
to provide for new classes of veterans or
dependents. Bill 331 incorporates these orders
in council in the statutes and provides for an
increase in the amount of allowances payable.
The following classes of veterans are eligible:
(1) Veterans of the Canadian expeditionary
forces in World War I.
(2) Veterans of His Majesty's forces or His
Majesty's allies who were domiciled in Canada
at the time of their enlistment.
(3) Veterans of the South African war.
The proposed bill incorporates into the
statutes the orders in council covering the
following classes of veterans or dependents:
(1) Veterans of the Northwest Field Force
(Riel Rebellion).
(2) Veterans of World War IL.
(3) Veterans who served in both World War
I and World War II, irrespective of the theater
of service.

(4) Widows of veterans who were in receipt
of war veterans' allowance or who would otherwise have been eligible to the benefits of the
act during their lifetime.
(5) Orphans of veterans as defined in the
act, subject to conditions with regard to age.
The major change effected by the legislation now under study is the increase in the
amount of allowances payable. At the present
time a recipient is entitled to the following
allowances: Single-$20 per month or $240
per annum; Married-$40 per month or $480
per annum. In addition, both married and
single recipients are entitled to casual earnings of $125 per annum plus $25 per annum
unearned income. Supplementary allowances,
not exceeding the amount of $10 for a single
recipient and $20 for a married veteran are
provided in cases where the non-payment of
this supplementary allowance would cause
hardship or distress. Under the proposed
legislation the supplementary allowance becomes part of the basic allowance, thus
raising the latter from $20 to $30.41 per
month, or $365 per annum in the case of
single recipients, and from $40 to $60.83 per
month, or $730 per annum for married
recipients.
This bill further permits other
income in the amount of $125 per annum for
a single recipient and $250 per annum for a
married recipients or a recipient with dependents. Casual earnings of $125 and the $25
unearned income per annum, permitted to
both married and single recipients under the
act, are retained in the proposed legislation.
Thus the maximum income permissible from
all sources, including the allowance, will now
be $640 per annum to single recipients instead
of $390, and $1,130 to married recipients
instead of $630, except in cases where supplementary allowances were paid in part or in
full.
Provision is made in the bill for the enactment of regulations. It also provides for
the continuing of the allowance at "married
rates" to a widower or widow with an invalid
child, over the age of 21 years, where such
child is residing with his or her surviving
parents.
In answer to the question concerning the
expenditure required to meet the provisions
of this new legislation, I understand the
approximate amount to be $3,500,000.
The motion was agreed to, and the
was read the second time.

VETERANS'
SECOND

LAND BILL
READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the second
reading of Bill 336, an Act to amend the
Veterans' Land Act, 1942.
He said: Honourable senators, I have
asked the honourable member from Summerside (Hon. Mr. Robinson) to make a brief
explanation of this bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: Honourable senators, this bill. which proposes to amend the
Veterans' Land Act of 1942, lias been examined
by the Veterans Affairs Committee. In order
to giv e accurate information, with the permission of the bouse I will stiek fairly close to
my notes.
This bill contains four separate amendments to the Veterans' Land Act of 1942.
The first is of an administrative nature and
is self-explanatory.
The second amendment provides for an
alternative method, of establishing a veteran
as a farmer. The present act makes provision
for the establishment of a veteran on a purchased farm or small holding o.r by way of a
mortgage loan on land owned by the veteran,
or by way of a grant up to a niaximum of
$2,320 to help a veteran to settle on land
provided by one of the provincial goveronients.
In some provinces a veteran can obtain Crown
lands from the provincial government, which
will if necessary advance him money up to a
certain amount for the purchase of implements.
In view of the present difficulty confronting
the administration in purclasing lands in certain districts where substantial increases in
land values have occurred, it lias been decmed
wise to make provision for loans for the purchase of farming equipment to facilitate the
establishment of qualified veterans on farm
aroperties which they may rent or purchase
on terms or at prices satisfactory to the administration. The subsidy feature which exists in
connection witlh the purchase of land by the
administration is carried forward into this new
arrangement. This gives a veteran another
opportunity of establishing himself as a
:armer.
The third amendment confers on the minister
-liscretionary power to authorize loans or
advances under the Veterans' Land Act to
persons who obtained loans or advances under
the provisions of the Soldier Settlement Act
and whio are indebted to the Director of
Soldier Settlement. It has corne to the notice
of the department that certain soldier settlers
established under the Soldiar Settlement Act
l-on. Ar. ROBERTSON.

following the First Great War found it necessary, for reasons beyond their controI, to discontinue farming operations, and to surrender
their properties to the board. Other soldier
settlers disposed of their land to third parties
under term agreements. In a number of these
cases the third party has not yet completed
payment, and technically the soldier settler
concerned ,is still indebted to the Director of
Soldier Settlement. To meet a limited number
of cases in these categories, it is felt wise to
make provision for discretionary power te
deal with them under the provision of the Vetcrans' Land Act, because the veterans concerned also served during the last war.
The fourth amendment deals purely with
administrative matters with respect to the
formulating of regulations and the designating
of persons to exercise or perform the duties
conferred or imposed by the act on the
director.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.

REVISED EDITION

SENATE
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: I crave the
indulgence of honourable senators who listened
to me in committee for a brief period this
morning while I again go over part of the
ground I then covered.
At the outset I desire to move, seconded by
Hon. Mr. Murdock, the following amendment:
That the report of the committee be not now
received, but that it be referred back to the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce
for further consideration.
I hope my reasons for doing this will appeal
to honourable senators. This bill is one of the
most important to be introduced in parliament in a very long time; as a matter of fact,
I cannot recall another of greater importance.
As honourable senators know full well, this
is not a government bill, but a public bill
introduced by a private member. This was
made abundantly clear by the leader in the
other house when the bill was introduced; but
there was some confusion, and the members
of that house did not expect the bih to make
the progress it did. In an exceedingly short
time several votes were taken, and eventually
the bill was passed with I think I ma'y say
quite fairly-little consideration or none whatever. It was then referred to this house.
As we ail know so well, for about seventy
years Dominion Day has been celebratcd in
Canada on the lst of July. During our early
yo.uth we were taught about the glorious and
important work the Fathers of Confederation
did in su;ccessfully bringing about the great
and historic event whereby confederation
was accomplished and this fine country of ours
becarne the Dominion of Canada.
This bill now propose to change the name
of our national holiday. During the long and
erx intelligent debate on the subject many
arguments pro and con were advanced. There
were two principal arguments against the bill.
Some of those who spoke urged, after consulting many dictionaries, that the word
'dominion" meant domination; others thought
it meant thatiwe were still a colony. While
listening to those arguments, I was unable to
recognize tle force of them, because I know
full well that by the Statute of Westminster,
passed in 1931, Canada became a free and
self-governing nation in every respect.
Whether the name is changed or not will
make no difference whatever insofar as
Canada's nationhood is concerned. Like most
honourable members of this bouse, I was
bon and brought up in Canada, and am
prend of it. We are ail Canadians and all
for Canada. I cannot follow the argument
that the passige of this bill will create in
our breasts a greater enthusiasm for Canada,
because there is alreadv present such a love
and enthusiasm. Aiso it must bu remembered
Hon. Mr. FOSTER.

that we are British. It bas been argued that
the 1st of July has not been very enthusiastically celebrated as a national holiday; it
bas been pointed out that it bas not been
declared by statute to be a national holiday,
althougb in bygone days such a request was
made by honourable members of this house.
Be that as it may, for nigh unto seventy years
July 1 has been celebrated with greater or
less enthusiasm from one end of this country
to the other. It bas also been celebrated in
London. As I stated in committee this morning the 1st of July is regarded in London as
a day commemorating a great attainment.
Once or twice while there I have attended
dinners leld on the 1st of July, when leading
men of the British Parliament, and on occasion some members of the Royal Family, w%ero
present as well as a large number of Canadians who live and make their livelihood in
tho United Kingdom. Ail are proud to celebrate Dominion Day in the grcat commercial
me tropolis of the world.
If a change is made and Dominion Day is
called "The National Holiday of Canada" I
fail to sec that it will cause us to throw our
caps higher in the air or sbout more lustily
than before. Furthermore, the bill bas its
complications, for wherever in the statutes
passed over the last century there is reference
to Dominion Day a change will bave to be
made.

May I again refer to the Statute of Westmîins-ter? Canada today bas only two or three
links with the United Kingdom. First, if we
decide that we want to change the Canadian
constitution, commonly known as the British
North America Act, we secure the approval
of t he Imperial Parliament. Whien thec Statute
of Westminster was drawn up a great and
very able statesman from my province, the
Right Honourable Ernest Lapointe, insisted
that any change in our constitution must
receive the approval of the Imperial Parliament. In this be was stoutly supported by the
Honourable Howard Ferguson, then Premier
of the Province of Ontario. It was the wish of
these men that that condition should stand,
for the protection of the minority. Secondly,
we have the righît of appeal t the Judicial
Cornmittce of the Privy Council. Thirdly-and this link we honour most--we have His
Majesty the King.
If Canada wishes to dispense with the approval of the British parliament or the right of
appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy
Council, as provided by her constitution, all
she bas to do is say that she no longer desires
those perquisites and the United Kingdom will
readily agree. Therefore, as a nation, we could

AUGUST 7, 1946

not be more free than we are now and have
been for a long time, and will continue to be
in the future.
We all desire to maintain unity in Canada.
Honourable members will pardon a reference
to the Right Honourable Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
I know of no other Canadian who preached
more and did more for the unity of Canada.
Sir Robert Borden also took a similar stand.
This bill is a highly controversial one. A number of people in Canada, probably for the most
part from my proviùce, are undoubtedly in
favour of the change; on the other hand,
there are also many people from the province
of Quebec who are against it. Why then
should we fan afresh national fires? Why
create more disunity by forcing on the people
of Canada a bill which received only a few
hours consideration in the House of Commons
and then was promptly sent over to this
house?
To my mind the governrment should have
asked the honourable member who introduced
this bill in another place ta withdraw it. Then
if the government believed in the measure it
should have brought it forward as a government bill and asked for its approval by parliament. I would go further and say that the
bill ought ta be submitted ta the people of
Canada. Honourable senators, we are being
asked ta approve of a bill which the people
of this country have had very little time to
ronsider. True, this chamber has had the bill
before it for a considerable period, but public
opinion is slow to grasp all that takes place
here. Therefore I shall regret it if the bill is
forced through.
I do not know that I need say anything
more, except to again express my surprise at
the suggestion that the Canadian people are
not as truly Canadian as they should be, that
they are not possessed of a sufficient degree
of national enthusiasm, and that they lack an
appreciation of the significance of the first
of July, but that if this bill is passed ipso
facto something surprising will happen-like
the magician pulling a rabbit out of his hatand thereafter on the first of July bands will
be playing and flags flying and everyone of
us will be a better Canadian than he is now.
I do not hold to that view at all.
Honourable senators can tell from the tenor
of my remarks that I am against the proposed
change in the name of the holiday. I should
like to see a recorded vote, so that every

honourable member will show whether he is
for or against the bill. I am not very confident
that my motion will carry, but "hope springs
eternal in the human breast", and I have not
given up altogether.

I thank honourable members for their kind
attention.
Hon. JAMES MURDOCK: Honourable
senators, in a world beset with unrest and
dissension, what is it that we need here in

Canada more than any other one thing? In
my judgment it is unity and reasonable
co-operation. Many of us think we knowwhy this bill originated.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: You may think so.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Yes; I am including
myself in "we".
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: You may be taking
in too much territory.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: We may be mistaken. However, we do know that for some
weeks a good deal of time has been spent on
this bill in the Senate. The bill proposes to
say to us who have been regarding Dominion
Day as a day commemorating the birth of
Canada, "The day is no longer to be known as
Dominion Day, but henceforth is to be called

Canada Day." That does not seem to be altogether unreasonable, but in my judgment the
bill does not use the proper language for
recognizing the views of those sponsoring the
bill as well as of those of us who find, fault
with it.
I was at the committee this morning and
paid attention to alil that was said, andi I have
given the bill about as much consideration as
anybody else, yet a few moments ago I was
surprised to learn that the title of the bill
has been changed. I am told by my honourable friend to my left (Hon. Mr. Sinclair)
that that was done by the committee this
morning. In my humble judgment the bill
should have been amended differently, and
I am going to put on record for future reference the form I think it should take:
BILL 8
An Act respecting the Dominion of Canada Day
His Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate and House of Commons of
Canada, enacts as follows:Short Title
1. This Act may be cited as The Dominion
of Canada Day Act.
Canada Day a legal holiday
2. Throughout Canada, in each and every year,
the first day of July, not being a Sunday, shall
be a legal holiday, and shall be kept and observed as such, under the name of the Dominion
of Canada Day.
When 1st of'July is a Sunday
3. When the first day of July is a Sunday, the
second day of July shall be, in lieu thereof,
throughout Canada, a national legal holiday,
and shall be kept and observed as such under
the same name.

SENATE
Repeal
4. The Dominion Day Act, chapter forty-nine
of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is
repealed.
If the bill had been amended to read in
that way it surely could have satisfied the
aims ami claims, and the best hopes and
wishes of those who favoured the original bill
as well as of those who were opposed to it. It
seems to me, though I may be mistaken, that
the bill as amended by the committee is more
complicated than it was before. I have seconded the motion, that it be referred back to
the eommittee for further consideration, and I
hope a vote will be taken upon that motion.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable members. I have npt had a chance to sec the
motion, but there is a point that I wish to
bring up. A motion to refer a bill back to a
committee should contain instructions as to
how the bill is to be amended. In the motion
before us there are no specific instructions.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: There is no
necessity whatever for giving instructions.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: When a bill is being
referred back to a comniittec, the motion
should contain instructions as to what amendment the 'committee should make. I rise to a
point of order on that, Mr. Speaker.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The motion is to refer the
bil back to the committee for further consideration.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: There is no specific
instruction in that.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, there is-a specific
instruction to give the bill further consideration. The house can refer a bill back with
instructions to strike out this or that clause,
or to amend the bill in any other way, or it
can si'mply refer a bill back for further consideration, as we have donc times without
number. I submit that the motion is quite
proper and within our rules.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: I rise to a point of
order, Mr. Speaker.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When a bill is
referred back it is usual for an instruction to
be given te the committee, but there is nothing in our rules requiring that this be donc. A
bill may be referred back simply for further
consideration. I sec no objection to the
motion.
Hon. FELIX QUINN: Honourable members, when this bill reached us from the other
House I was rather impresseod by the attitude
of the honourable gentleman from Saint John
-9u. Mr. MURDOCK.

(Hon. Mr. Foster) who, regardless of whether
it was a government or a private measure,
undertook to sponsor it.
At the outset I felt inclined ta support the
bill. Believing that twenty years ago Canada
became an autonomous nation, I felt that our
country had grown from a colony ta the status
of a dominion, and finally ta the full stature
of nationhood. It will be recalied that prior
ta the arrival of the bili in the Senate a joint
committee of both houses was appointed ta
consider a distinctive national flag for Canada.
After many meetings that committee recommended a design for such a flag. Yet by
recommending that we should have, not a
distinctive Canadian flag, but a flag with the
emblem of another nation in its superior quarter, the committee implies that this country is
stilil a dominion, and consequently not an
autonomous nation. If we adopt a flag whi-ch
denotes that Canada is still subservient ta
another power, then I say we must be consistent and retain the old title of Dominion Day.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. Mr. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable
members, as I have not spoken on this bill
before I now desire ta address myself ta the
report of the committee. I have had a good
deal of difficulty in deciding what is the best
thing to do in the circumstances, but having
listened to the arguments advanced on the
motion for second reading and to those which
were presented in oommittee, I am convinced
we are a hittle premature in attempting ta pass
legislation of this kind.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I was greatly impressed hy some of the speeches which honourable senators from the province of Quebec
delivered during the debate on the motion
for second reading of the bill. If I feit that
the adoption of the mensure would bring
about a better understanding and promote
greater unity among the people of this country I would s1pport it; but, as I have said,
I arn convinced that ils introduction is somewhat priemature. I do not think the amendiments ircuommendel
by the committee are
anyting more than a compromise or an
attempt to get rid of a pince of legislation
which probably is emibarîrassing to sorne honourable members. I believo in dealing with
the matter a little more directiv, by considering flie bil on its merits and voting for or
against it.
I do not tihink the change from "Dominion
Day" to "National Holiday of Canada" will
persuade any person that the first of July will
become a more distinctive national holiday
than it has been in the past.

AUGUST 7, 1946
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I do not think it
will cause any Canadian to celebrate the day
with any greater enthusiasm. To my mind
Dominion Day is our national holidayalthough it is not so declared by legal enactment. In my province the first of July is
celebrated as "Dominion Day." I am sure that
any Canadian when abroad is proud to say
that lie comes from the Dominion of Canada.
Surely no one need feel for one moment
that by linking the word "dominion" to the
name of our country there is the slightest
implication of subserviency to any other
country.
In view of the very close vote in the committee this morning on the proposal to postpone consideration of the preamble to the
bill, I feel that we should now consider the
motion to concur in the report. I feel that
postponement of the bill would be in the best
interest of this country and would serve to
promote national unity. I am of the opinion
that we should adopt the motion and thereby
refer the report back to the committee for
further consideration. I shall support the
motion of the honourable gentleman opposite
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne).
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators, is it your pleasure to concur in the
amendment, moved by Honourable Senator
Ballantyne and seconded by Honourable
Senator Murdock. that the report of the commitee on this bill be not now received, but
that it be referred back to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Some Hon. SENATORS: No.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Yes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those who are
in favour of the motion will say "Content."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Those who are
opposed will say "Not content."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Not content.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: In my opinion
the Non-contents have it.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let us have a vote.

AUGUST 7, 1946
a bill should have leave to exercise the inherent right of the mover of the second reading
to close the debate. If the leader of the government requests a senator to explain the purpose of a bill, that senator should have the
right to close the debate.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I am glad this point bas come up. My
practice with regard to the explaining of bills
is to avail myself of the experience and
knowledge of other honourable senators. It
bas been suggested to me that the honourable
senator who explains a bill at my request
will presumably have informed himself as
to the different features of the bill and be
in a better position than I would be to reply
to any crticisrm or comments.
It seems to me that we have a choice
between two courses. When the 'Clerk calîIs
the order for the second reading of a bill
standing in my name, and I have asked an honourable senator to explain the bill, the house
might perhaps agree to permit him to make
the motion, and from then on he would be
technically in my position. That would be
one course. The alternative course is that I
move the second reading of every bill standing in my name, as I do now, but that there
be a general understanding on the part of the
house that if another honourable member
explains the bill at my request he is to have
the right, which otherwise wouldi be mine, of
closing the debate. The honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) is undoubtedly right
in his contention that the honourable gentleman from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt),
having explained, the bill, is entitled to speak
on it again, but that when he does so he closes
the debate. I think that at some time in the
future we should consider which of the two
courses suggested would be the better for us
ta adopt.
Hon. Mr. HA'IG: If I may be permitted to
speak again, I will suggest what I think is the
proper procedure.
When the honourable
leader of the government asks another senator
to explain a bill, that senator should move
the second reading, and in doing so should
say, "On behalf of the leader of the government I move the second reading of the bill."
Then there would be no question as ta what
was being done. I do not like the amendment
suggested by my honourable friend from De
Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien). A couple of years
ago we went over our rules very carefully. If
you depart from the general principles of
parliamentary practice you are liable to get on
dangerous ground, for you no longer will have
precedents to guide you. Furthermore, men
and women appointed here after having served

541

in the House of Commons or one of the legislatures would be liable to find our procedure
confusing.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: Just to clear up a
point, may I ask the honourable gentleman
a question? Suppose a bill is on the order
paper for second reading, in the name of the
honourable the leader, but the motion is made
by someone else, would the honourable senator who made the motion have the right
to close the debate?
Hon. Mr. HMG: Yes.
Hon. A. L. BEAUBIEN: The leader then
would have no right to speak on the motion
more than once.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: He would have the same
rights as any other member.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Honourable senators, I
want to correct a misinterpretation of my
remarks by the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig).
J did not suggest an
amendment to our rules. As to the two possible courses suggested by the honourable
leader, I think it is preferable that the motion
for second reading of a government bill be
made by the leader himself, and that if any
other honourable senator explans the bill
he should state that he is doing so on behalf
of the leader; and it seems to me that the
one who explains the bill should, by unanimous
consent of the Senate, have the right to close
the debate.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, it should be understood that when
the honourable gentleman who'explained this
bill (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt) speaks again he
will, with the consent of the bouse, close the
debate. Therefore, if any other honourable
members desire to speak on the motion they
should do so now.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, in view of the ruling by His Honour the
Speaker, I have a few remarks that I wish
to make now. I do not entirely agree with
the honourable leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that a house built on farm land has
no value at all. But I am alarmed, as I
have said before, about the building of houses
by the government in cities, where there is no
assurance that the men who occupy the houses
will find work. If a man has a bouse in the
country he at least bas a chance of keeping
a goat and some chickens, or of managing in
some other way to make a living; but if he
lives in a city and is unable to find a job
ho is up against it.
I am entirely opposed to the principle of
the building of houses by the government. I

SENATE
do not wish to be unkind, but I think that
the government, by what it is doing, is helping to ruin the young men of this country.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: You are "agin the government."
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I am certainly against
that part of its policy. Apparently the government, from leaning over backwards to
Socialists, "Pinks" and Communists, has weakened its spine, until now it is just a push-over
for anybody who comes along. As a result,
the people who build their own homes are
going to be taxed to build homes for other
people all over the country.
We have heard a lot about the need for
nails, and I think I should tell bonourable
senators that the best bouse I ever owned did
not bave a nail in it.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That was built of sods.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: If i gave a short description of the place, perhaps sorne young
fellow may hear of it and take heart. It was
built of logs by people froi a Dukhobor village, and tiere were two or three ply of sods.
The windows were all made by hand; there
were two in the east end of my living room
and two in the south end; in my kitchen,
which was divided, off, there was one facing
north. The legs were plastered, and it was
the best house in the township, being cool in
summer and warm in winter. The door was
made of lumber sawed by hand, and there was
a wooden pin for the hinges, to keep the door
closed there was a wooden hasp which was
lifted by a babiche-a rawhide tbong. The
total cost of the house was thirty-one dollars
and some cents. As the place was all paid
for I had- no interest payments te meet, and
I had capital left te buy machinery for breaking my land. I may say that in those days
I was prouder of that house than I would be
now if you gave me title to the Chateau
Laurier here.
The government is asking our young people
to start off with a S6,000 home, on which they
will bave to pay interest, and I doubt if they
will be as confortable as I was in the house
that cost me just about thirty-one dollars. I
am not being unkind to our young people
when I say this. On the contrary, I think that
the unkindest treatment they can get is paternalistic assistance from the government.
As I said before, the goverrnment has leaned
over backwards so long that it has no resistance left. It took over a steel plant, where
there is a strike, and one of the fellows who
wiisbed to work was hi-jacked, taken to the
hills, beaten up and left unconscious. The
wives of the men who wish to work go in fear
of 'their lives, and still no action is being taken.
Hu.

Mr. HORNER.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: Where is the Attorney
General of Ontario?
Hon. Mr. HORNER: The best way to assist
our young men is to let them get their own
houses. The young fellow who is capable
enough to be able to pay off any loan that ho
requires willî have no difficulty in obtaining
the necessary money and finding suitable land.
The house that I have described suited me at
the time. I had a certain plan in my mind,
and I needed my money for something else
than a dwelling.
I wish to record my opposition to this kind
of legislation. The money that is lest on
houses built by the government will have to
be replaced, and eventually the workers of
Canada will have to pay the shot.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
I should like to say a few words, not so much
witb direct reference to the merits of the
bill as by way of rebutting the charges levelled
by honourable members opposite against the
government in respect of the obligation which
they allege is upon it in connection with strikes
in critical industry. It was suggested by the
honourable leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig)
when lie spoke on this bill the other day, and
it lias jtust now been suggested by the bonourable gentleman from Saskatchewan North
(Hon. Mr. Horner), that the Government

of

Canada is lax, is failing in its duty in net
repressing incidents of lawlessness arising out
of the strikes which unfortunately are gripping
the ceonomy of our country at the present
time. The honourable gentleman froin Saskatchewian North cited an instance where a
worker in a plant said to be strike-bound was
hi-jacked, as he put it, taken up into the
hills and beaten, apparently because of his
desire to go to work. The honourable senator rather suggests that the GoNcrnm ent of
Canada is somehow at fault for net taking
some punitive steps to repress that sort of
conduct.
Now, I should like to point out to the
house, and especially to the honourable gentlemen who have made these charges, that the
enforcement of the criminal law of this country is entrusted to the Attorneys-General of
the provinces. If any man was taken into the
hills and beaten up because of his desire to
work, tien it was for the Attorney General of
the province in which that incident occurred
to proecute-first of all te find out the individuals wlio committed the offence and then
to prosecute them in the courts, in order that
they might be punished. Thtere is a lot of
loose talk as to whiat is the responsibility of
the Government of Canada in matters of this
kind.

AUGUST 7, 1946
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Whose responsibility is it to decide what is a legal or an
ilýlegal strike, and what is legal picketing?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The Parliament of
Canada in the relevant section of the Criminal Code has declared what type of picketing
may be allowed. As I recall it, the section
states that "peaceful picketing" may be carried
on, that it is an exception to what otherwise
wouid be "watching and besetting"-I think
those are the words used. The Parliament of
Canada has declared what the offence is, but
it is for the Attorneys-General of the provinces to enforce that law. I do net think any
honourable senator here will dispute that
statement.
My only purpose in rising was to clear up
the inference which may have been left in
the minda of some honourable members as
regards the alleged responsibility of the Domimion Government in matters of this kind.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question? Is there any
difference between the legal position of the
Steel Company of Canada at Hamilton, say,
and that of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber
Company at New 'Toronto in regard to the
operation of their plants?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I assume that what is
meant by the honourable gentleman is that in
the steel industry the government bas taken
over controlHon. Mr. HAIG: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: -and bas appointed a
controller. I understand that is net so in the
case of the rubber industry.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Is there any difference?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It is still a matter for
the Attorney General of Ontario to safeguard
the situation in Hamilton, and to enforce the
criminal law.
Hon. CYRILLE VAILLANCOURT: Honourable senators, I should like to summarize
the discussion on this bill and to clarify certain facts. The main argument brought forward against this measure is that, though we
are willing to lend money for building purposes, there is a lack of goods-nails, sheeting,
piping, sewer-piipes, cement, and so forth.
Therefore it is claimed that it would be advisable to co-ordinate financing and production.
Those who have listened to the speech made
in another place by the gentleman responsible
for the administration of this act have realized
how wise the government has been in bringing
forward this bill and in co-ordînating financing
and production.

543

If it is proposed to increase production of
naile, sheeting, cement, in fact of everything
needed for building, it becomes necessary that
the producers of all these goods be assured
that the amount of .money they invest in the
purchase of new machinery or the extension
of their factories in order to increase production will net be too considerable and likely to
be lost, in great part, in two years' time.
To-day the government tells the producers of
goods: "We are now submitting to you, a five
year plan. Through this plan you can increase
production." At once the cernent producers
will work 24 hours a day and produce three
times as much cement as they did before the
war. It is a well-recognized' fact that those
concerns which produce goods needed for the
building of bouses must at the present time
work 24 heurs a day. As far as nails are concerned, it bas been ascertained that the main
obstacle to increased production bas been the
low price level. An increase in price bas now
been authorized, and, twice as many nails are
being manufactured now as in 1939. Should a
shortage of labour eccur, National Selective
Service will take the steps necessary to remedy
that condition.
I do not think that loans to farmers will
function much better than in the past, since
we already have the federal tarm loans and, in
certain provinces, local agricultural Joans.
Moreover, credit unions already make loans.
However, even though no wonderful results
may follow, such loans can do no harm. As
far as the rate of interest is concerned, it bas
been set at 4j per cent. It could have been
set even lower, but it was not considered
desirable to destroy private initiative in this
field.
(Translation):
There is, however, another obstacle to full
production-strikes. We are told that the
federal government should put an end to them.
It is said that during the war the governrnent
made this or that work compulsory, so why
net carry this compulsion into peace time activities? During the war we had to carry on a
struggle against dictatorships and use dictatorial methods to defeat them; but now the
war is over, and the government does not
wish to use the methods that Hitler or Mussolini, or even Stalin, would have resorted to.
According to our democratic principles it is
preferable to try to solve this strike problem
by conciliation, persuasion and common sense.
The government is pointing out to workers as
well as to employers that if both have rights
te preserve, both also have duties to fulfillsomething that is too readily forgotten.

SENATE

One desire predominates these days-to
make money and to enjoy life. You would
think you were back in the days when the
Romans asked their Emperor to give them
bread and games. The Roman Empire was
then at the height of its glory, yet it was
already declining. Certain circles are too apt
to forget that above material values-money
and pleasure-there are spiritual values. When
these are subordinated to the material it is
time to wonder whether our civilization is not
already on the decline. In spite of all material
progress, in spite of all the great discoveries
that enable man to enjoy an casier physical
existence, if spiritual values continue to be set
aside-I go further-if God continues to be
set aside, tomorrow no one will be able to
prevent strikes and men will destroy one
another like wild beasts in the jungle.

COMBINES INVESTIGATION I3BL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

lon. Mr. BEAUREGARD moved thlat the
report of the Standing Conimittee on Banking
and Commerce on Bill 193, an Aet to amend
the Combines Investigation Act, be concurred
in.

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I desire to move the following amendment, seconded by the honourable senator
from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard):
That the report from the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce on Bill 193, intituled
an Act to amend the Combines Investigation
Act, be not concurred in, but that it be amended
by striking out the fourth and fifth amendments to the bill contained in the said report.
The two anendments now in question, made
by the Banking and Commerce Committee by
a vote of nine to seven, affect section 9 of
the bill. Perhaps I should explain that this
section adds a new section, No. 30, to the act.
The general purport of section 30 is to give
power to the Exchequer Court to deal with
patents and trade marks wben that court has
been satisfied that such patents or trade marks
Hon. Mr. VAILLANCOURT.

have been minused to the detriment of the
public by an unlawful combination in restraint
oif trade.

No doubt ionourable senators are fully
aware of the investigations made during the
last few years, particularly in the United
State-. which have disclosed that combines,
inopolies, and international cartels have
been able to use the right to patent an article,
or to register a trade mark with respect to
an article. in illegal ways for the purpose of
stifling competition. In that connection may
I quote fron the report made to the Minister
of Justice bhy the commissioner under the
Combine- Investigation Act?
Hon. Mr. EGER: I rise to a point of
order. I the honourable senator moving an
amendment now?
Hon. Mr. HIGESSEN: I have moved an
arnendment.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not think this is
the proper plice to do so. The bill should be
refer'ed to committee of the whole house,
thn t lihonourable gentleanint
could liore his
amiiet, liinint and it could he di-îscus'ei freelv.
Or he might mîîove liat the bill he referred to
tie Standing Commiîî
ee on Banking and
Comierie, -o that we niav consider the
amendimnt te.
Certinly tlhe aiendment
catnnt he ioved in this wav.

lHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I must say that I
disagree witi
the lionourable gentleman.
What have we got before us? The report of
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerea recommending, by a small majority,
two specific amendments to the bill. I have
moved that those two amendments be struck
out.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I rise again to a point
of order. It is a well-recognized rule that no
member should state what has transpired in a
committee. I submit the honourable gentleman shîould not state the number of votes for
or against any amendment.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Very well. Is my
honourable friend willing to withdraw his
objection and permit me to proceed?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I have no right to
permit or prevent the honourable gentleman
from proceeding; that is for his Honour the
Speaker to do. It seens to me the proper procedure would be to move the house into committee of the whole, so that we could have a
free discussion on the report. At the present
stage a member can speak only once to the
question before the house. I have no objection to the honourable gentleman moving his
amendment, but it seems to me he should
follow the course I have suggested.

AUGUST 7, 1946
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, there were several alternatives open to
me in this matter. As the honourable gentleman bas said, I could have moved to refer
the bill back to the standing committee. But
I took the precaution of submitting my amendment to the Law Clerk of the Senate to ascertain how I should proceed, and be placed in
my hands the motion I am now moving to
carry out the objects I have in mind. I wish
to comment in this bouse on two amendments
made by the Banking and Commerce Committee to the Combines Investigation Bill. I
submit that is my right, but I will gladly bow
to any ruling His Honour may make.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I ask the honourable senator if the House of Commons bas
ever permitted an amendment to be moved
to a bill when the Speaker was in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The proposal is not
to amend the bill but to amend a report.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: If the proposal were to
amend a report, instead of the bill, it would
be all right. The honourable gentleman is
attempting to amend the bill by amending
the report. That is quite different.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I think my honourable friend has entirely misconstrued the
matter. The report which is before us for
consideration recommends five amendments.
I am suggesting that the house should reject
two of these, and I know of no other procedure by which that can be accomplished
than the one I now propose. However I shall
be glad to submit to any ruling His Honour
may make.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman appears to be in order. We have
before us the report of a comnittee which the
honourable senator says is not satisfactory,
and he proposes to move an amendment to it.
The honourable senator from L'Acadie (Hon.
Mr. Leger) bas suggested that it would facilitate matters and that honourable members
would have a clearer understanding of the
amendments if the bouse went into committee of the whole. This would allow an
opportunity for discussion of the amendments
and their implications. However, my bonourable friend may proceed.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, if after my motion has been put any
honourable member wishes to move that we
go into committee of the whole to consider
the amendments, I shall support him. I submit that my motion is perfectly legal and
that I should be permitted to proceed with
my explanation. I object to a part of the
report which the Banking and Commerce

545

Committee bas submitted to us for approval.
This seems the proper time and place to
make my observations.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: During the past
few years evidence has been brought out in
the United States concerning abuses of patents
and trade mark rights by international cartels
and monopolies. In that connection may I
read to the bouse a short extract from page
52 of the report which was made to the
Minister of Justice by the Commissioner
under the Combines Investigation Act on
October 10 of last year? He said:
The patent pool is a typical form of agreement between individual holders of different
patents to eliminate competition between them
or to keep their inventions away from outsiders.
If the members of a patent pool have agreed to
eliminate competition between themselves, as
by restricting production or fixing prices, and
have proceeded to carry it out by such ways as
inserting restrictive conditions to that effect in
the reciprocal permissions, or cross-licenses, to
use one another's inventions or by seeing that
the holding company to which each has transferred his patents inserts similar conditions in
the licenses it gives back to each member, the
agreement is in no basic way different from any
other agreement to eliminate competition, and
is punishable as such when against the public
interest.

Further on the same page the report reads:
The patent Act does indeed give to a patentee
a "monopoly" in the sense that it gives him
"the exclusive right, privilege and liberty of
making, constructing, using and vending to
others to be used the said invention," but it
nowhere authorizes him to agree with other
patentees to eliminate competition between
them or to conspire to keep their inventions
away from outsiders.
I should now like to discuss in detail two
amendments made by the Banking and Commerce Committee to section 9 of the bill.
The new section 30 of the act is as follows:
In any case where use has been made of the
exclusive rights and privileges conferred by one
or more patents for invention or by one or more
trade marks so as:
(a) unduly to limit the facilities for transporting, producing, manufacturing, supplying,
storing or dealing in any article or commodity
which may be a subject of trade or commerce;
or
(b) to restrain or injure trade or commerce
in relation to any such article or commodity;
or
(c) unduly to prevent, limit or lessen the
manufacture or production of any such article
or commodity, or unreasonably to enhance the
price thereof; or
(d) unduly to prevent or lessen competition
in the production, manufacture, purchase, barter,
sale, transportation or supply of any such
article or commodity;

546

SENATE

This section employs the language of section
498 of the Criminal Code, which makes these
operations a crime. The new section goes
on to say:
-the Exciequer Court of Canada, on an information exhibited by the Attorney General
of Canada, may for the purpose of preventing
any use in the manner defined above of the
exclusive rights and privileges conferred by any
patents or trade marks relating to or affecting
the manufacture, use or sale of such article or
commodity, make one or more of the following
orders:
(e) declaring void, in whole or in part, any
agreement, arrangement or licence relating to
such use;
(f) restraining any person from carrying out
or exercising any or all of the terms or provisions of such agreement, arrangement or
licence;
(g) directing the grant of licences under any
such patent to such persons and on such terms
and conditions as the court may deem proper,
or, if such grant and otier remedies under this
section would appear insufficient to prevent
such use, revoking such patent;
(h) directing tiat the registration of a trade
mark in the register of trade marks be expunged
or anended; and
(i) directing that such other acts be done or
omitted as the Court nay deeni necessary to
prevent any such use.
May I now deal with the amendments made
by the Banking and Commerce Committee,
both of which are designed to restrict the
right of the Excliequer Court to take action
in these particular cases?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Read tiem.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The committee
las taken out of paragraph (g) of the new
section 30 the right of the Exciequer Court
to revoke a patent if that court finds that any
other remedy is not sufficient.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do not think my
friend's statement is complete.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: If my honourable
friend will permit me to finish my explanation
I am sure lie will be satisfied with it. The
comnittee lias removed from paragraph (g)
tie right of the Exchequer Court to revoke
a patent.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Will the honourable
gentleman pardon me? The power of the
court to revoke a patent has been taken out of
that paragrapli as a result of an amendment,
but the power of the Exchequer Court to
revoke a patent under existing legislation is
not taken away.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I was about to
make that explanation, if my honourable
friend lad waited. I was going to say that
under the Patent Act the Commissioner of
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN

Patents has the right under certain specifie
circumstances to revoke a patent in cases where
he is satisfied it has been abused. The effect of
the amendment by the Banking and Commerce Committee is simply to make the procedure for the revoking of patents more
complicated. Instead of proceeding under this
section, the Exchequer Court would have to
proceed under the Patent Act. The only
result of the amendment is that when the
Exchequer Court finds that an abuse exists,
and the only proper remedy is the cancellation of the patent, the procedure is more difficult and complicated.
TIse second amendment to which I wish to
refer is the one eliminating paragraph (i)
of section 30. It reads as follows:
(i) directing that such other acts be donc or
omitted as the Court may deem necessary to
prevent any such use:
That paragraph, honourable senators, contains
the broadest general language, and we do
sometimes object te putting such broad
language in the statutes. But may I point out
to the house that here we are dealing with an
illegal combination in restraint of trade?
Human ingenuity is a wonderful thing, lionourable senators, particularly when it is
employed by enormous corporations exercising
monopolistie privileges. Under those circumstances I think it is wise that this legislation
sliould give general power to the Exchequer
Court to make such order as it may deem to
be fair and proper, in addition to those powers
specified under paragraphs (e) and (h).
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would the ionourable
senator care to suggest a type of order the
court might make under paragraph (i) which
it could not make under paragraphs (e) or
(h)?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I have one or two
cases, but I do not want to weary the house
with them. It is sufficient to say that nobody
can tell what may happen, and that the
Exche.quer Court should have a general power
to exercise controls and apply remedies to
meet any particular case which may come
before it.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That does not answer
my question.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: May I empiasize
tiree points concerning the powers of the
Exchoquer Court? The power granted to the
court by paragraph (i) is not a power which it
is sought to confer upon a minister, a member
of the civil service or a government board. I
am as much opposed as any member of this
iose to legislation wbich gives broad and
general powers in vague language to a min-

AUGUST 7, 1946
ister, a civil servant or a board. In this
instance the power is granted to the Exchequer
Court. Second, it is a power that can be
exercised by that court only after a full and
open trial at which ail the interested parties
are entitled to be hpard. Third, it can b
exercised by the Exchequer Court ýonly if that
court is satisfied that one of the offences iisted
in the first part of the section has been
committed.
H-on. Mr. ILAMBERT: May I ask my honourable friend a question? I appreciate the
distinction he makes with reference to paragrapja (i), but does the initiation of action,
before it get.s to the Exehequer Court, lie
with the officiai in charge of the Comibines
Investigation Act?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It does.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I think that is a very
important point.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The initiation of
action in the criminal court gives the parties
the fuliest opportunity to explain their
position.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: May I link up that
question with an observation the honourable
senator made a moment ago? In the event
of a corporation being found guilty of restraint
of trade, wouid the Exchequer Court exercise
its powers on the basis of evidence heard by
the court or on information from the commissioner in charge of the Combines Investigation Act?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I do not think there
is any doubt about the answer to, my honourable friend's question. The Exehequer Court
would obviously not take any action under
section 30 unless a decision of a criminal court
showed that one of these crimes had been
committed. It would not act on information
supplied by the Commissioner under the Combines Investigation, Act, because at that stage
there w.ould be no proof that a crime had been
conimitted.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Is it correct that
corporations against which action bas been
taken, and whic'h have been prosecuted and
adjudged guilty of restraint of trade under the
Com.bines Investigation Act, have had no right
of recourse? I think it is a question of estabIishing the evidence ini the case before the
Exehequer Court. It may be that I arn not
welI informaed in this field, but in years gone
by I had some experience cf cases where corporations were charged with restraint of trade
and had absoiuteiy no chance of proving that
the charge was not justified.

Hon. Mr. IHUGESSEN: Action could be
taken in the criminal courts under section 498
of the Criminal Code.
Hon. Mr. LMBERT: The matter did not
even get to, the criminal courts. A charge
was brought by the officiai administering the
Combines Investigation Act and- the corporation was summoneL to, appear and give evidence, without baving a chance to know what
the charge was.
Hon. MT. HUGESSEN: This section deals
with a much more remote part of the proceedfings. It only goes into operation after
th e charge bas been proved, after the
Exehiequer Court has fouod to its satisfaction
that one of the things referred to in this
section has heen dione. Until this condition
is fulfilied the Exchequer Court bas no power
whatsoever in the matter.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Can my bonourable
friend inclicate where in this section or elsewhere in the bill it is stated that these proceedings can only be commenced and carried
along after criminal proceedings have been
taken and guilt establisbed?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: If my bonourable
friend is as apt in construing statutes as I think
he is, he wilI realize, when be ýreads section
9, that the Exchequer Court is not going to
take upon, itself any powers under a section
which begins by saying:
In any case where use has been made of the
exclusive rights and privileges conferred by one
or more patents for invention or by one or more
trade marks so as-to do any of the tbings stated, in paragraphs
(a), (b), (c) and (d).
Hon. 'Mr. McGEE'R: The court must make
the finding first.
Hon. Mr. BIENICH: But that can be done
independently of any criminal proceedings
under section 498.
Hon. Mr. :MeGEER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HUGE'SSEN: Perhaps I misled
my honourable friend. I did not mean proceedings under section 498 of the Criminai
Code were a necessary preliminary to action
under section 9.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: The court, baving
made the find.ings, would have the power to
make an order.
Hon. Mr. H-UGESSEN: Exactiy. That is
what I said.
Honý. Mr. LjAMiBERT: Let me put a suppositious case. If an officiai of the department, under instructions by the commissioner,
investigated the character of a corporation's

548

SENATE

business and reported back that in his opinion the corporation was guilty of restraint of
trade, could a case then be brought before the
Exchcquer Court on the basis of the investigation made by the junior official?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Honourable senators,
we are having a free discussion all over the
chamber, and it scems to me we could proceed
more intelligently by having the bill committed to a committee of the whole house.
In support of my contention may I quote
May's Parliamentary Practice, 13th edition,
page 396:
If it should be desired that a bill which stands
conmmitted to a standing committee should be
considered in comrnittee of the wlhole houseThis bill still stands committed to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:
reported back.

The

committec

Hon. Mr. LEGER: It rcported, but its
report has not been accepted, so tle bill is
still standing committed to that committee.
-or by a select committee a motion is made
for discharging the former conmittal of the bill
and for connitting the bill to a connittee of
the whole house or a select coinntttee, as the
case may be.
I suggest that the proper procedure would
be a motion to discharge the comnittal of
the bill to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to which the bill still
stands committed, and that then there should

be another motion to commit the bill to a
committec of the whole bouse for consideration forthwith. If we did that we would be
proceeding more intelligently than we are
at present. It is true that the report of a
committee may be amended, but here we
have more than an amendment to the committee's report; in other words, we have an
amendment to the bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Well. there is a question
whether a certain thing should be in the bill
or not. I do not want to emphasize the point
too much. but I think the honourable gentleman would be well advised to move that the
committal be discharged and the bill committed to a committee of the whole house.
I do net think we are procceding very intelligently at present.
May goes on to say:
Motions for the committal of a bill to a conmittee other than that first ordered by the
bouse would not be subject to the conditions
placed by standing order No. 46 upon the original motion, but debate thereon would be restricted to the effect or expediency of the
reference of the bill to the proposed committee.

and general debate upon the merits or clauses
of the bill would not be permitted.
Hon.

Ir. LAMBERT.

According to that authority, general debate
as to the merits of this bill should net be
permitted at the present stage, but if the bill
were referred to a committee of the wlole
house we could procecd to make any desired
amendments.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: In answer to uny
honourable friend, I can only say that I rely
upon His Honour's ruling that I am in order.
Hon.
that.

Mr. LEGER:

I

am net discussing

lon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Further, I am
rather surprised at my ionourable friend's
suggestion that this ionourable body is not
proceeding intelligently, for I thought we were
having an intelligent discussion.
I was about to reply to my bonourable
friend from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), who
asked whether a case could bo brought before
the Excbequer Court upon the finding of a
junior official of the department.
lon. Mr. LEGER: May I explain what I
meant by the word "intelligently"?
Hon. Mr. HU7GESSEN: Mr. Speaker, may
I demand your protection against these continual interruptions?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I be permitted to
rxplain what I meant by the word "intelligently"?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Will my honourable
friend please postpone his explanation until
I have finishîed?
In answer to my honourable friend froin
Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert), I would say
that under section 9 the Exchequer Court acts
oenly on an information exbibited by the
Attorney General of Canada, who is the
Minister of Justice. The preliminary information may be obtained by a junior official, but
the Minister of Justice is the man who takes
the responsibility of placing the matter before
the Exchequer Court for the purpose of finding out whether a patent or trade mark should
be cancelled or dealt with in one of the ways
provided for in this section.
I have nothing further to say in support of
my motion. I think honourable members will
see that there is a good deal of substance in
my complaint against the Banking and Conmterce Commtittee's proposed amindments for
limiting the Exchequer Court's power to deal
in any just way that it sees fit with violations
of the Combines Investigation Act or section
498 of the Criminal Code.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
becauue I concur in the view expressed bv the
committe to which tIis bill was referred, I am
compelled to oppose the motion now pre-

AUGUST 7, 1946
sented by the honourable gentleman from
Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). I am sure
that every honourable member is in favour of
the basic scheme enunciated in the Combines
Investigation Act, which is to put down combines in restraint of trade and to hunt out
nefarious transactions of this kind wherever
they may be found. On the other hand, I conceive it to be the duty of this chamber to see
that there is some regularity, shall I say, in the
legislation adopted by parliament; that there
is no confusion as to the purpose, intent or
meaning of the law. I conceive that it is also
the duty of this branch of parliament, no less
than that of the other branch, to sec that the
rights of individuals under the civil and criminal law are reasonably protected, so that peo,ple who come to Canada to do business, or
people already here who desire to do business
in this country, may proceed with some rea-

sonable measure of certainty that what they
propose to do is within the law.
I had the privilege of attending the sittings
of the Banking and Commerce Committee
when this bill was under consideration by
that very learned and able body, and, though
not a member of the committee, was permitted to take some part in the discussions.
Without in any way impinging upon the rule
that committee discussions shoul:d not be
adverted to directly in this chamber, I should
like to say that the bill was given very careful consideration there over a period of some
three days. The Commissioner of the Combines Investigation Act was in attendance and
had with him independent counsel, a member
of the legal profession of Ottawa, for the purpose of advising him and assisting the committee in understanding the commissioner's
point of view.
I thirk it is fair to say that the reason why
the committee recommended the deletion of
the last two and a half lines of paragraph (g)
of the proposed new section 30 was that the
committee felt that in the Patent Act there
is already a remedy which is available to the
Attorney General of Canada or to any other
person who may be interested in having a
patent revoked. I do not think the honourable gentleman frorn Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) will contradict me when I say that
in any case where a combine is found to exist
or is alleged to exist, and a patent is employed
as a basic feature of the unlawful agreement,
the Attorney General of Canada or any other
person who is interested may apply to the
Commissioner of Patents to have the patent
revoked.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: If the facts are found
to warrant revocation of the patent, why
should it not be revoked?

549

Hon. Mr. BENCIH: My honourable friend
from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer)
is leaping to a conclusion. If he will allow
me to explain why I suggest that the only
remedy that should be available is the one
under the Patent Act, and that the situation
should not be complicated by an additional
remedy under the Combines Investigation Act,
he perhaps will agree with me.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I say that under the
Patent Act there is already a remedy available to the Attorney General of Canada, or
to any individual who may be affected by a
combined, to have the patent revoked, or
licensed, or treated in some other way. Truc
enough, if a patent is in fact found to be
the basis of an unlawful combination, then
it ought to be revoked or restricted in some
way, but, as I have said, that remedy is
already at hand under the Patent Act.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Why should not the
Exchequer 'Court have it?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The first reason why the
Exchequer Court should not have it is that
in the Statutes of Canada there should not be
a multiplicity of remedies to meet the same
situation. The second reason is that in order
that the Commissioner under the Combines
Investigation Act may proceed against a
patent he must first of all find the existence
of an unlawful agreement or combination in
restraint of trade. Having found such agreement, he can, under this section, as amended,
apply to the Exchequer Court to have the
agreement declared void in whole or in part,
or to restrain any person from carrying it out
or exercising all or any of its terms or provisions. This bill is aimed, not at the patent
itself, but at the existence of the unlawful
agreement or combination of persons to
restrain trade, and I thoroughly agree that
the Attorney General of Canada should have
the right to go to some jurisdiction and attack
that agreement-which, after all, is the fundamental harm.
As this section of the bill originally came
before the committee, the Attorney General
could apply to the Exchequer Court to have
the patent revoked if, upon investigation, it
should be reported that there existed an
agreement in restraint of trade founded upon
that patent. I suggest to honourable senators
that to have such a provision written into
our statutes would be alarming to persons
who have discovered a new process or a new
mechanical device and want to bring it into
this country as the subject of a patent. We
do not want to frighten away persons with

good ideas; we want them to develop their
inventions here.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: We want to give them
the protection of their patents so that they
may be made available for the use of our
people.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Why should they not
be disciplined?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As the honourable
senator from Vancouver-Burrard knows, there
is a provision in our Patent Act which can
be used to revoke a patent right which is being
abused.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: What about finding
the facts?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: You have two jurisdictions-the Commissioner of Patents under the
Patent Act andHon. Mr. McGEER: But surely the honourable gentlemanHon. Mr. BENCH: I cannot answer the
Vancouvergentleman
from
honourable
Burrard unless ie permits me to do se. I
repeat, you would have two jurisdictions-the
Commissioner under the Patent Act and the
Exciequer Court under this act. I suggest to
him that that is a very undesirable situation.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Having given the
court this power, why would you deny it the
rigit to discipline offenders?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Under this section I do
not want to give the Exchequer Court power
to revoke patents, and I suggest that the
committee's report in that respect is perfectly
sound. I do not want to give it to the
Exchequer Court for this further reason: The
Combines Investigation Act is criminal in
nature and purpose. I am not sure about this,
but I think the statute was attacked in a
case that went to the Privy Council, and one
of the grounds upon which it was ield to be
intra vires was that it is legislation of a quasicriminal nature.
If under the Combines Investigation Act the
commissioner finds there is in existence an
unlawful agreement in restraint of trade, and
the basis of sucih agreement is a patent, I suggest it is his bounden obligation to prosecute
under Sections 498 and 498A of the Criminal
Code. As the section stands in this bill, even as
the committee bas left it, the Commissioner
of Patents could go to the Exchequer Court
and apply for a disciplinary order, notwithstanding that there is no prosecution in progress, and notwithstanding what may be the
result of a prosecution if subsequently undertaken.
Hon.

NIr. BENCH.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Is there any reason
to place greater confidence in a criminal
court composed of County Court or High
Court judges than in the Exchequer court?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I cannot follow the
relevancy of my honourable friend's question.
Of course, I do not think there is any reason
to repose more confidence in the criminal
courts than in the Exchequer court. I should
be very happy if the honourable gentleman
would indicate how his question is relevant to
the issue I am discussing.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The honourable
gentleman has said that the Attorney General
may apply to the Exchequer Court for cancellation of a patent on criminal grounds, even
though there be nio criminal prosecution in progress. I am trying to find out why he thinks
it is wrong to apply to the Exchequer Court
rather than to the criminal courts. Is there
any reason to suppose that greater confidence,
can be 'placed in the criminal courts than in
the Exchequer Court? Or to put it another
way: Is there any reason for applying to the
Exchequer Court rather than to the criminal
courts?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: My answer is this. The
Combines Investigation ActThe Hon. the SPEAKER: I must remind
the honourable gentlemen that the conversation they are now carrying on is not in order.
If they desire to continue the discussion by
way of question and answer there should be a
motion to resolve the house into a committee
of the whole.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Your Honour, I most
certainly do not desire to transgress the rules
of the Senate. I believe I am perfectly in
order in speaking on the motion which has
been presented by the honourable gentleman
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen). If I
have given offence it has been due to my
desire to meet the barrage of questions which
has assailed me from the other side of the
house.
Perhaps I may be permitted to explain my
position, having regard to the question which
bas been put to me by the honourable gentleman from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). This legislation, I submit, is of a
criminal or quasi-eriminal character. I think
it is indisputable that it contemplates a criminal prosecution under the relevant sections
of the Criminal Code, sections 498 and 498A,
if the commissioner upon investigation finds
the existence of a combine. If, therefore, any
case of unlawful combination is found to
exist, the Commissioner under the Combines
Investigation Act must prosecute the persons

AUGUST 7, 1946
whom under the Criminal Code, he thinks are
guilty of that combination. Section 9 of the
bill would permit him, quite independently of
the criminal character of the investigation and
of the prosecution which should follow, to
apply to the Exchequer Court in what is really
a civil proceeding and ask the court to revoke
the patent. I am submitting to honourable
senators that this would be a very undesirable
state of affairs, because, first of all, it would
provide a very nice little short-eut for the
Commissioner under the Combines Investigation Act to go to the Exchequer Court and to
ignore entirely the criminal character of the
unlawful combination. Secondly, he could go
to the Exchequer Court in advance of a
criminal prosecution, get a declaration that
in fact an unlawful combination existed, and
have the patent revoked. In the later criminal
trial against the persons allegedly guilty of
the unlawful combination, you might very
well have a jury acquitting the accused on
the ground that there was no unlawful agreement or combination in restraint of trade. I
submit that in a matter of this kind that is
a very undesirable condition in which to leave
the statute law of this country.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Would there be any
difference between the procedure in the criminal courts and in the Exchequer Court?
Would not all the rules of evidence and procedure apply in the one as well as in the
And why has not the Exchequer
other?
Court, which is the investigating body
created by statute, the power?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Again, I quite agree
that the Exchequer Court is perfectly cornpetent to pass upon a matter properly before
it. I also agrec that the criminal courts of
the country are perfectly competent to pass
upon matters put before them and within
their jurisdiction. I am simply urging that
there should be no split jurisdiction in a
matter of this kind which, fundamentally, is
criminal in character. The reason I am sugam sorry to have to repeatgesting it-I
is that you could conceivably have two different results in the two courts. I cannot be
convinced that that is a desirable state of
affairs, and I urge upon honourable senators
that it is a major duty of this chamber to
look at legislation in order to be sure that
it will b orderly on our statute books and
readily understandable, and so that it will not
lead to conflicts in jurisdiction or to confusion
in practice.

There is just one other feature that I wish to
touch upon before I take my seat. I am
visualizing the case of an inventor from, say,
the United States of America, who has

551

developed a very useful process or a mechanical device but does not wish to manufacture
under that invention. His intention is to
license other individuals to use it in return
for a royalty. Honourable senators know
that this procedure is sanctioned by our law.
He is confronted. with this proposed section of
the Combines Investigation Act which makes
it clear to him that if he licenses five or six
people in the Dominion of Canada to use that
patent, and they, not he, engage in an unlawfuil combination to restrain trade, the patent
may be revoked by the Exchequer Court.
I suggest to honourable senators that that
provision might very well frighten people who
would otherwise come to this country with
their inventions. A young and progressive
nation like 'Canada needs new inventions. On
the other hand, under the provisions of the
Patent Act that inventor would be entitled
to have notice of the charges concerning his
patent, and he would be entitled to appear
and make the defence that he was not a party
to an unlawful combination. At the sarne time,
under the provisions of the Patent Act the
Attorney General of Canada has every
remedy he needs to deal with the unlawful
use of patents in restraint of trade. For these
reasons I am opposed to leaving those words
in the bill. apd I agree with the recommendations made by the Banking and Commerce
Committee.
May I make the further point that if there
is any merit in the argument I have put forward as to the fear which the wording of
paragraph (g) might create in the minds of
inventors coming to Canada, one can imagine
what an inventor would think when he looked
at paragraph (i) which gives the Exchequer
Court power to do any other act or thing
which it thinks ought in the circumstances
to be done. I submit, honourable gentlemen,
that his last-mentioned paragraph employs
much too broad language, and under the circumstances the Banking and Commerce Committee took pro-per action in striking it out.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I did not have the advantage
of listening to the discussion of this bill in
committee, but I have found the debate in
this chamber very informative. After reading with some care the particular section under
consideration, and notwithstanding my great
respect for the committee, I believe that a
good case has not been made out in favour
of its amendments.
My honourable friend from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bench) pictures a hypothetical case of an
inventor from the United States licensing his
invention to several parties in Canada who
enter into a combination in restraint of trade.

552

SENATE

The penalty for such practice would be the
cancellation of the patent, as my friend intimates, without notice to the inventor. My
answer to that proposition is that a patentee
from the United States must decide whom he
is going to license to use his patent in Canada.
If he grants a licence to Canadians who abuse
the patent, then he had better look out for
bis rights. The government has given him
monopolistie rights, and lie should he very
carefuil to sec .that his patent is not abused.
He would be wise to insert in his agreement a
prohibition against a combination of that
nature. and then see to it that the provision is
carried out.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: How would a prohibiting clause in an agreement protect him
agaiiit a licensee joining in an illegal
combination?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It might b that an
illegal combination could exist notwitbstanding the opposition of the licensee.
MY next point is that our courts have a
natural sense of ju-tice. Our judges do not
lightlv destroy the property of an innocent
individua. MY experienco bas been that they
are very tender toward vested rights, particularly those of innocent parties. It should
not be presumed for one moment that the
Excluquer Court would 'elect the remedy
of cancellation of a patent in the case of an
innocent patentee who had licensed his invention to criminal licensees. The remedy would
be suited to the crime, and the penalty xwould
be applied to thie licensee and not to the
patentee.
No American patentee need be
afraid of our courts doing lhim an injustice.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Will the honourable
membe permit one question? If his statement that the courts afford protection to the
rights of the pntentee is correct. does not the
iniester have ail flie remedies he needs under
paragraphs (e) and (g)?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes, but there are
other types of cases than the one instanced by
mv friend. In some cases the court would act
under paragraph (e) which provides for:
-declaring void. in whole or in part, any agreement, arrangement or licence relating to such
lise:
That of course would be the first remedy
that the court would make use of.
Paragraph (g) now provides for:
-directing the grant of licences under any%
such
patent to sucl persons and on such terms and
conditions as the court nay deem proper.
That paragraph permits the taking away of
the licence from the criminal licensee and
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

allows the patentee to grant it to someone
with more scruples. Section 30 says:
In any case where use has been made of the
exclusive rights and privileges conferred by one
or more patents for invention or by one or more
trade marks so as:
(a) unduly to limit the facilities for transporting, producing, meanufacturing,And so on. My friend's argument was that
we should leave the rights with the Patent
Commissioner and net extend them to the
Exchequer Court. The Attorney General of
Canada may find that some licensees or
patentces have unduly limited facilities for
transportation and so on, and it is to obtain
the remedy of declaring void, in whole or in
part, some agreements that it is proposed
that lie be permitted to apply to the
Exchequer Court. Usually at the end of a
trial the parties know a good deal more of
xwhat happened than they do at the commencement. Therefore at the end of the
hearing the court might conclude that the
remedy sought in the first instance was not
appropriate, and that the patent should be
cancelled. Myr friend would thon sav to the
court, "You cannot cancel the patent."
Let us face this problem. The Attorney
General of Canada may go before the
Exchequer Court to obtain some remedy which
is not available from the Commissioner of
Patents, and at the conclusion of the case it
may he apparent to all disinterested parties
that the remedy that should be applied is cancellation of the patent. My friend says in
effect that in such case the proceedings should
fall flat; that by a proposed amendment the
court should be restrained or prevented from
rendering the appropriate remedy, and the
Attorney General should start all over again
in the criminal court or shonuld go to the
Commissioner of Patents under an entirelv new
proceeding.
I can see no objection to the Excliequer
Court being allowcd the power to cancel
patents. It is one of the highest courts in
Canada and it bas been a competent court
for a long time. Its jurisdiction has grown; its
business bas multiplied; and additional judges
are being appointed. If we cannot rely on
that court, what court can we rely on? Why
should we have to leave the court and apply
to a Commissioner of Patents in an office
downtown to do a judicial act? My friend
behind me suggests that we go to the police
court. The suggestion of my friend. who spoke
previously was that the powers shou'ld be sidetracked to a Commissioner of Patents and the
facts should not be presented to the court for
adjudication. Those things should be done in
open court. I can appreciate how utterly

ridiculous it would be for the Commissioner

AUGUST 7, 1946

under the Combines Investigation Act ta go
to the Commissioner of Patents for a judicial
remedy. A situation would prevail in which
one civil servant would have to apply to
another civil servant of co-ordinate jurisdiction
to have something done which neither of them
should have the power to do.
My friend also says that by applying to the
Exchequer Court to have the facts determined
before a prosecution is launched we are multiplying procedure. My answer is that one may
apply to the Supreme Court of Ontario for an
injunction to restrain any of the acts mentioned
in section 30 of the bill. Upon the determination of the facts a restraining order may be
given by the civil 'court. You may then proceed to prosecute. If the principle of applying to the Exchequer Court is wrong, would
my friend suggest that we provide that there
shal be no remedy against the patentee until
criminal proceedings have been instituted and
carried through to completion?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I would suggest that,
under this act.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I think that by making such provisions my friend would recast
the judicial system in Canada.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I mean only in connection with the combines, because they are a
criminal matter.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The words used in
the first part of section 30 of the bill are the
same as those used in a section of the Criminal
Code whieh has been in force for many years;
they do not add one iota to the substance of
the law as it now stands. It has been possible
to apply first to the civil courts, and having
exhausted the remedies there to turn to the
criminal courts; or, vice versa. I sec no
difficulty or damage as a result of extending
these powers to the Exchequer Court.
My friend has also said that it is unreasonable to give to the Exchequer Court the right
provided by paragraph (i) which reads:
-directing
that such other acts be done or
omitted as the court may deem neeessary to
prevent any such use:
The words "such -use" appliy to the criminal
abuse of patents.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Misuse.
lon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Misuse in the hands
of the patentee. Will any honourable senator
tell me why a patentee should be fearful of
the remedy that may be applied by a Canadian court when somebody is convicted of a
After all, that is what my
criminal act?
honourable friends are nervous about. The
broad wording in the section suggests what
you will find in every properly drawn statement of claim, which, after making certain

553

specific claims, asks for "such further relief
as to the court may seem just." That wording
constitutes about as broad a claim as one
can imagine, and it is adjudicated u-pon in
almost every civil case. Section 9 of this
bill says that the Exchequer Court may, under
certain conditions, ideclare the agreement void;
it may restrain any person from carrying out
or exercising any or all of the terms or provisions of such agreement; it may direct the
grant of licences under any such patent, and
so on, and it may direct anything else which
to the court seems just. If Americans who
take out patents in Canada are afraid of legislation of that kind, interpreted by our
responsible courts, they had better not come
to Canada. We would lose little by their
staying away, for then any of us could use
the rights which otherwise they would monopolize, and manufacture would be free instead
of restrained.
In my judgment the proponents of the
amendments suggested by the Banking and
Commerce cominittee have not made out
a sufficient case.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN: Honourable
senators, may I for a moment direct the attention of the house to the realities of the committee's report? For some time now we have
been discussing situations that are not at all
affected by the committee's report either in
its original form or as it would be if the
amendments proposed in this chamber today
were adopted. First of all, may I say that
proceedings under section 9 of the bill, whereby
at the instance of the Attorney General of
Canada an information may issue out of the
Exchequer Court, are not predicated or conditional upon the taking of any criminal proceedings whatsoever. For an alternative or
independent remedy, in the event of any of
the things enumerated in section 9 being dons
by owners of patents, an application may be
made to the Exchequer Court, which is given
the power to make certain orders.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Pardon me, but
have the criminal courts power to cancel
patents?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. I am just trying
to deal with the matter one step at a time,
so as to get back to the realities. Section 9
gives authority to the Exchequer Court,
which functions independently of any criminal
proceedings. I think it is contemplated that
there may be cases where the combinations
do not partake seriously of the character of
a criminal offence, and in which the official
in charge of administering this act would not

554

SENATE

want to take criminal proceedings; yet what
we have .proposed here is an almost quasicriminal procedure.
The section gives the Exchequer Court certain authority, but what the committee
thought the court should, not have is the power
to revoke a patent. That is one of the matters now before the Senate for consideration,
because my honourable friend from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) bas moved that the
power to revoke a patent be restored under
this particular section.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Why not?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That question has
been asked before, but apparently was not
satisfactorily answered. I will deal with it
now, perhaps not in an entirely satisfactory
manner, but I wiii do my best. Under the
Patent Act there is set up a procedure
for granting exclusive riglts to persons who
invent processes which are sufficiently novel
and ingeniouîs to satisfy the requirements of
the law. The statute authorizes the issuing of
patents to such persons. In the same statute,
in sections 65 to 71, there are provisions for
dealing with abuse of rights under patents.
For instance. section 65, subsection (2), paragraph (b), provides that the exclusive rights
under a patent shall be deemed to have been
abused "if the demand for the patented
article in Canada is not being met to an adequate extent and on reasonable terms." That
language is about as broad as one could find
anywhere. The Commissioner of Patents, if
satisfied tuat the abuse of rights bas been
such that the remedies provided in the
statute are not sufficient to cope with it,
may set in motion a procedure for revoking
the patent. That is one reason why I say
we have not been discussing the real situation.
In certain circumstances the commissioner
may refuse an application to revoke a patent;
or if the application is contested and it
appears that a great deal of evidence will
be offered in the case, or if the interested partics so request, he may refer the whole matter
to the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Is it possible to get to the Exchequer Court under the
Patent Act except by action of the Commissioner of Patents?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: No.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Under the Patent Act
the commissioner is the official empowered
to deal with abuse of patent rights. As I stated
before my honourable friend asked bis question, the commissioner may in certain circumHon. Mr. HAYDEN.

stances refuse an application. If there is
likely to be a good deal of evidence, perhaps
lengthy cross-examination of witnesses, and
the interested parties desire to go before the
Exchequer Court, the commissioner may refer
the matter to that court.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is, you cannot
get to the Exchequer Court except with the
consent of the commissioner.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is so.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Then the Commissioneiof Patents may be a fence.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The commissioner is
a court of first instance. Section 71 of the
Patent Act says:
All orders and decisions of the commissioner
under sections sixty-five to seventy, inclusive,
shall be

the Exciequer

So in the first instance the trial of the issue
may be by either the commissioner or, in
certain circumstances, by the Exchequer
Court, which would report its judgment or
opinion back to the commissioner. And in
matters which come before the commissioner
in the first instance there is a right of appeal
to the Exchequer Court.
That is the procedure provided under the
Patent Act. My consideration of it leads me
to the conclusion that when dealing with
patent rights we are dealing with fundamental
rights. Further, they are international in
character, because with respect to patents there
are reciprocal arrangements between Canada
and other countries of the world.
lon. Mr. McGEER: Will the honourabil
senator permit a question before lie goes 0o
te his next point? Does section 9 of this bill
confer any powers that are not already given
elsewhere?
Is the section not merely a
codification?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. In my opinion
certain powers given by section 9, particularly
those in paragraphs (e) and (f), austhorizing
the Exchequer Court to set aside and declare
oid pirire agreiemits, etc., are not given in
that form in the Patent Act.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: But in a form very
close to it.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Pretty close to it, yes.
That only lends strength to the point I am
trying to make, that in the Patent Act we have
a structure for dealing with patents. As I was
saying, patent rights are fundamental rigbts,
and also they are international in character.
In the Patent Act we have set out conditions
mder which these rights may be interfered
with or revoked.

AUGUST 7, 1946
That is the background which we have for
our consideration of this bill. The question is
not whether the Exchequer Court is competent
to deal with an application for the revocation
of a patent. Of course it is competent to deal
with that, and no person would suggest otherwise. The point made by the committee is
that there is already a recognized procedure,
set up by the Patent Act, for dealing with such
matters.
Hon Mr. HUGESSEN: My honourable friend
is simply insisting on a more complicated
process-two procedures instead of one.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: What I am trying te
point out is that, under the Patent Act, the
Exchequer Court already has power to deal
with applications for the revoking of patents.
If to section 9 of this bill we restore the part
which the committee struck out, we will simply
be giving the Exchequer Court, under this
statute, what it already has under another
statute-the power to revoke patents in certain circumstances. I say, first of all, that
from the point of view of legislative enactment that is bad. In my opinion, and I think
in the interest of the public whose rights are
concerned, it is better that the procedure for
revokihg patent rights should be put in motion
by an independent authority, such as the
Commissioner of Patents, at the instance of
any person concerned, rather than at the
instance of a body authorized to investigate
alleged combines.
If we wish te pile up similar provisions in
one statute after another, regardless of the
resulting confusion, we should support the
amendment moved by my honourable friend
from Inkerman. By putting the same provision in a multiplicity of statutes, we could
make the remedy available wherever one might
turn, if that is what is required. Apparently,
it is not sufficient to have it in one place; we
must cover every corner in order to be sure it
is the law of the land. That is not my conception of the draftsmanship of statutes. Once
we accept the principle that the matter is
sufficiently covered in the Patent Act, then,
I submit, it is entirely unnecessary, inadvisable and improper to attempt to cover it anywhere else. As to paragraph (i), which the
committee also recommended should be
struck out, my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has asked, what
is the use of withdrawing it when statements
of claim usually ask "for such further or other
relief as te this court may seem advisable"?
But here, if this general, broad and vague section-to borrow the language of my honourable
friend from Inkerman-is adopted, we are
giving to a court power te take away rights.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: After investigation.

555

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: First of all, we are
giving the power to take away rights that
have been granted, that power to be exercised
in the event of abuse being found by the
court to exist under the provisions of section
9. It is all very well to give that power as
completely and definitely as possible, but to
go on and provide for such a broad and vague
authority as the mind of man in any circumstances whatsoever may conceive is, I again
submit, improper legislation. The right should
be clearly defined; the abuse or the offence
or the violation of this right should be clearly
defined; and the power of the court to deal
with it should be just as clearly defined.
When you add such an ambiguous power as
this, I submit you are violating a very sound
principle in the draftsmanship of statutes if
your purpose is to get a proper enforcement
of law.
The committee considered this matter very
carefully and made its report. It is for the
Senate to say whether in the circumstances,
having all the facts before it, the amendments
have been properly made or not.

Final Report of the Senate Commilice on Taxation
PART TwO
Wednesday, 31 July, 1946.
On October 31, 1945, a Special Committee of
the Senate was constituted with the purpose,
as expressed in the terms of reference, of
examining into the provisions and workings
of the Income War Tax Act and the Excess
Profits Tax Act, 1940. and formulating recomniendations for improvement, clarification and
simplification of the methods of assessment
and collection of taxes thereunder.
On November 15, 1945, the terms of reference were amended by the addition of the following words after the word "thereunder":
"and the provisions of the said Acts by>
redrafting them if necessary."
Part one of the Final Report of your committee was presented to the Senate by the
Chairman, the Honourable W. D. Euler, on
May 28, 1946. Senator Euer then indicated
that Part Two would deal with the necessary
changes to the Act recommended by the committee and Part Three would relate to the
administration of the taxing statutes.
The Hon. the SPEAKER.

Since the adoption by this chamber of Part
One of the report, the Minister of Finance has
inîtroduced certain resolutions indicating the
propositions upon which the government proposes to found its amending legislation in
respect of the Income War Tax Act and the
Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940. In the speech
introducing the Budget Resolutions the Minister of Finance stated that "instructions are
bleing given to the inter-departmental drafting
comnittee to explore carefully the possibility
of reducing the number of discretions now
vested in the minister or at least of providing
for thoir exercise under regulations approved
by the governor in couincil." It bas also been
indicated that such an inter-departimeintal
drafting committee bas been requested to consider the possibility of generally clarifving the
Income War Tax Act.
Since the government proposes to take certain measures, as described above, which will,
it is hoped, to some extent achieve the objects
for which your committee has been constituîted, it is thought desirable to direct the
second part of the Final Report to assisting

AUGUST 7, 1946
the government in carrying out its intention
in this direction. In doing so, however, your
committee wishes te go on record that although
it here confines itself to a number of limited
suggestions regarding the treatment of certain sections of the Income War Tax Act and
the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, it requests
the opportunity of reviewing whatever proposals may be made by the inter-departmental committee in order to determine
whether in its opinion the proposals might
benefit from further study or from additional
recommendations by a committee of this
chamber.
As stated in Part One of the Final Report,
your committee heard briefs from twentythree organizations and individuals. Your
committee has considered the representations made in these briefs insofar as they
relate to certain aspects of the appeal provisions in the two statutes, and in a more
limited manner insofar as they refer to the
desirability of specific changes in the legislation and improvements in the administrative techniques employed by the Taxation
Division of the Department of National
Revenue.
It is proposed, therefore, that Part Two of
this report be confined to a statement of
those sections which in the opinion of your
committee, after giving study to the briefs
and representations made to it, require
amendment, clarification or repeal.
Insofar as the details of administration
within the department are concerned, which,
it has already been stated, will be dealt with
in Part Three of this report, your committee
feels that it requires further opportunity to
hear witnesses andi to study their representations with a view to making an analysis of the
methods of operation and administration of

Section
2(1) (j)
6(1) (a)

the department before making recommendations in this connection.
After hearing the statements of a number of
witnesses on the question of the remuneration
now being paid to various classifications of
the staff of the Taxation Division, however,
your committee is impressed with the fact
that current salaries appear in the main to be
inadequate in view of the national importance
and the high degree of responsibility inherent
in the nature of the functions performed by
officers of that division.
In view of the impossibility of completing
its task in this connection before the end of
the present session o Parliament, your committee recommends that, if it is the wish of
this chamber that Part Three of this report
be made, your committee be reconstituted for
that purpose.
Insofar as the desirable changes in the legislation are concerned, the representations made
may be divided into three broad categories:
(1) Those recommending that certain sections of the taxing statutes be amended in
certain directions.
(2) Those recommending that certain sections be clarified and more particularly with
regard te the exercise of ministerial discretion thereunder; and
(3) Those recommending
that
certain
sections be repealed.
Accordingly, your committee recommends
(i) That a complete review of the taxing
statutes be effected, to the end that net only
may clarity and coherence be achieved but
that their provisions may be brought into
conformity with modern business practice. In
this connection it is recommended that the
following sections of the Income War Tax
Act be amended te reflect the above principle:

Subject Matter
Definition of self contained, domestie
establishment.
Expenses not laid out to earn income.
Reserves, Contingent Accounts or Sinking Funds.
Allowance for depreciation.

It is pointed out that the foregoing sections
should not be regarded as necessarily comprising all the sections which require amendment, clarification or repeal. The list above
set forth is composed of those sections which,
in the opinion of your committee, and of the
witnesses who came before it, are most
urgently in need of attention by the governmental draftsmen in order to facilitate a
uniform, clear and reasonable administration
of the taxing statutes as they presently exist.
Your committee wishes to go on record in
connection with any revision which may be
proposed or effected by the government in
respect of the two taxing statutes above mentioned as being in complete accord with the
statement of the Minister of Finance with
respect to bis instructions to the interdepartmental drafting committee regarding the
reduction in the number of discretions now
vested in the Minister of National Revenue,
and wishes further to endorse his desire to
explore the possibility of providing for their
exercise under regulations approved by the
governor in council. Such a limitation of
ministerial discretion becomes all the more
necessary, since, much to the regret of your
committee, the Minister of Finance has not
seen fit to adopt the recommendations made
by your committee in Part One of this Report

relating to the establishment of a Board of
Tax Appeals with authority to review administrative discretions.
Al which is respectfully submitted.

BILL
EXPLANATION

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, hefore the Orders of the Day are
called I desire to bring a rather important
matter to your attention.
I believe that my hearing is good; but it
would seem that yesterday it must 'have been
defective. When His Honour called the division on the Canada Day Bill the bell was
sounded in the usual manner, so as to be
perfectly audible to everyone; but when the
division was called on the Combines Investigation Bill, although I was in my office with -the
door wide open, I did not hear the bell. Had
I heard it I should have been in my, place to
record niy vote.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I missed the division in
the same way.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I ani advised that
the bell was rung. Then the Whips returned
to the chamber and the vote was proceeded
wit~h in the usual manner.
Ion. Mr. MURDOCK: I do not think the
bell was sounded. Was it?
An Hon. SENATOR: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It must have
been a very faint tinkie. My -office door was
wide open and I did not hear the bell.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Honourable senators,
the bell was ýrung at about six o'clock and
continued ringing for a considerable interval.
It may be that some members who were in
their rooms at the time took it to be the
adjournment bell.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Exactly. I did
hear a bell at six o'clock and assumcd it was
for the adjournment of the afternoon sitting,
so I did not corne down to the chamber.
DIVORCE BILLS
On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, may I suggest to the honourable, leader
of the government that the house pass over
the first six items on the order paper and
deal first with divorce bills and reports. With
the kind permission of the house I would
ask that all divorce bills be given third reading today. The reason for my request is that
unless these bills reach the House of Commons
shortly they will be lost, and the evidence
will have to be heard again next session.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I arn quite agreeable to the honourable gentleman's suggestion.

CANADA-UNITED
KINGDOM
SUCCESSION DUTY AGREEMENT
BILL
SECOND

READING

On the Order:
Second Reading of Bill 30,1, an Act respecting
a Succession Uuty Agreement between Canada
and the United Kingdom, signed at London, in
England, on the fifth day of June, 1946.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I have asked the honourable senator
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to
handle this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: The general purpose of this bill is
one with which J think all honourable senators
will be in sympathy-to avoid the levying by
both the countries concerned of succession
duties on the same property when estates of
people dving in one countrv include property
in the other.
The bill in itself is verv simple. All that it
does iS to ratify the agreement which appears
as a schedule te the bill. It provides that in
the event of any inconsistency between the
terms of the bill or of the agreement and any
other legislation, the bill and the agreement
shall prevail; and it authorizes the Minister
of National Revenuc to make the necesszary
regulations.
The meat of the matter is to be found in
the schedule which. as I say, consists of the
agreement, and if honourable senators will
bear with me for a few moments I will
direct their attention to the principal articles
of the agrefement. It affects the following
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE.

taxes: in Great Britain, the estate duty; and
in this country, the federal succession duty.
It will be realized that in the nature of
things a bill of this kind cannot apply to the
succession duties levied by any province of
Canada. That is a matter which has to be
left to the different provinces and the government of Great Britain. Honourable senators
will be interested to know that already three
of the provinces-Quebec, Nova Scotia and
British Columbia-have made agreements with
the British government, substantially for the
same purpose as the agreement in the schedule
to this bill.

One of the most important sections of the
agreement is Article III, which defines the
situs of property for purposes of succession
dutty. Any honouiable senator who is in the
legal business and tas had anything to do
with estates will know that in cases of succession one of the most difficult problems to
solve is that of the situs of any particular
piece of .property for purposes of succession
duties. Let me take an example. Suppose a
man dies in the province of Alberta holding
in that province a share certificate of a conpany whose head office is in Toronto but
whose sh-ares -arc transferable on a share
register in Montreal. Now where, for purposes of succession duties, are those shares
located? Are they located in Alberta, where
the man died, or in Toronto, where the head
office of the company is, or in Montreal,
where they can be transferred? As a further
example, take the case of a promissory note.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman tell the non-legal members of the
house where the tax should be paid in such a
case as te mentions?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am coming to
that. I hope to explain to the house how these
particular questions have been solved in this
agreement.
I was just about to take as a further
example the case of a man who dies in British
Columbia holding a promissory note given by
a person resident in Halifax and payable at a
bank in Toronto. Now where, for succession
duty purposes, can that debt be said to reside?
Is it in British Columbia, where the creditor
was, or in Halifax, where the debtor lives, or
in Toronto where the debt is payable? There
have been almost interminable discussions and
decisions by our courts on these problems.
Article III of this agrement aims to set at
rest, as between Great Britain and Canada,
all such questions with respect to the situs of
property in connection with succession duties.
I will now deal specifically with the results
of this agreement as they affect particular

AUGUST 8, 1946~
classes of property, all of which are set out
in article III. Real estate of course has its
situs in the place where it happens to be.
Moveable property including currency or
coins, is considered to be in the place where
it was actually located at the time of death
of the person who owned it. Debts are to be
located at the place where the debtor resides.
Bank accounts are deemed to be situated at
the bank where the account was kept. Government securities-victory bonds and so onif in bearer form, are deemed to be where they
happen to be at the time of death; and if in
registered form, at the place where they are
registered. Shares and bonds of commercial
corporations are deemed to be situated at the
place where the company was incorporated,
and insurance moneys at the place where the
policy says they shall be payable. For the
most part these decisions as to the situs of
different classes of property follow the provisions of the common law, I am informed;
but with respect to some types of property a
special understanding as to the exact situs
has been arrived at between the two governments.
Article IV is of some importance. It says
that where a resident of one of the countries
dies owning property in the other country,
that other country will only collect duty upon
the value of the property situated therein,
without regard to the value of the whole estate.
Let me give an example. Suppose a resident
of Great Britain dies owning an estate of
$1,000,000 of which $100,000 is situated in
Canada. Under the present rule Canada would
charge succession duty upon the $100,000,
but at the rate of duty applicable to an
estate of $1,000,000. Under this agreement
Canada will still collect succession duty on
the value'of the property situated in Canada,
but only at the rate applicable to an estate
of that amount, which in the example given
would be one of $100,000.
Article V is perhaps the most important one
in the agreement. By it one country allows
credit for duties paid by an estate in the
other country on property in that other country. Take the last example that I gave. Suppose a resident of England dies leaving an
estate of $1,000,000, of which $100,000 is situated in Canada. Let us assume that the
English duty on that Canadian property is
$25,000 and the Canadian duty on it is
$10,000. When the executors of the estate
come to pay the $10,000 duty in Canada they
are given credit for the $25,000 already paid in
England.
63268-37à

Article VII provides for the exchange of
information between the taxing authorities,
in order to enable proper administration of
the agreement and to prevent fraud.
Article VIII permits extension of the agreement in certain circumstances to British
colonies or dependencies.
Article IX extends the agreement to
Northern Ireland.
Article X provides that the agreement shall
come into force on the date when the necessary legislation has been adopted by both
countries, and that it shall affect the estate
of any person dying on or after that date, and
the estate of any person dying before that date
and after the 31st of December, 1944, whose
personal representative elects to have the
agreement made applicable to such estate.
Article XI contains provisions for the termination of the agreement, with respect to
which it is unnecessary for me to go into
details.
I have pleasure in moving the second reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: By Article XI the agreement is to remain in force for at least three
years, and may be renewed for another three
years. In section 5 of the billHon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Of the agreement?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: No, of the bill. Section 5 says that it shall come into force by
proclamation and may be terminated at any
time by proclamation. That seems to be
unnecessary.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: If my honourable
friend will read a little further he will find
that the act terminates on proclamation following the termination of the agreement.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I know. But I thought
that had reference to the first three years.
When the agreement is terminated surely
there is no need of a proclamation to terminate the act.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: The agreement
would come to an end; but I expect that technically the act would still be on the statute
books, and it would be necessary to terminate
it by proclamation.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The proclamation on
termination of the agreement is not intended
to operate as notice.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I do not see the necessity of an order-in-council if the agreement is
terminated.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: My question may not
be absolutely relevant to the subject matter of
the bill, but as I live on the border, I should

SENATE
like to know if my hionourable friend is awarc
of any such legisiation between Canada and
the United States?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: It slipped my mind
that this agreement follows the lines of a similar agreement between. Canada and the United
States with respect ta succ~ession duties. It
was approved *by this parliament two years
ago.
lion. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
when, that agreement was made with the
United States we raised the question: Why
could flot a similar agreement be mnade with
This prompts me ta ask:
Great Britain?
Why cannot an agreement such as this be
made between the dominion and the variaus
provinces? I arn ail for the bill, but it will
flot; affect nearly as many people as wouid
dominion-provincial agreements along this
line. For instance, generally stock is registered
either in Toronto or Montreal. I have always
thought that registry offices should be maintained in the capitals of the other provinces.
For the life of me I have neyer been able ta
understand why a persan who bought stock
in Vancouver, Toronto, Halifax, or Winnipeg,
should have ta pay succession duties in the
province of Quehec because that is where the
company happened to be registcred. Let us
suppose that a man or woman in Manitoba
leaves an estate of 3100,û00ý-we have no millionaires in the province-of which $10,000
represents stock registered in Quehec or in
Ontario. At the present time either of the two
last mentioned provinces would levy succession
duties on the basis of t.he whole estate. Manitoba would do exactly the same were conditions reversed. Now that the dominion is
in the succession duty field, apparently ta stay,
I think it is time that an agreement was
worked out between the federai government
and the various provincial gavernments so
that there may ba no duplication of taxation.
As honourable members; are aware, there hias
recently bean in the courts an important case
involving payment of succession duties on an
insurance policy. The policy was issued in the
province of Quebec, and the insured lived in
the province of Manitoba. On his daath the
governments of bath provinces claimed succession duty, and eventually the exacutors had
to pay.
This duplication of succession duties bas
become a very serious matter, especially during the last twanty-five ycars. Prior ta that
tirne, in my province, property consisted
mainly of real estate; but since World War I
many people in Manitoba have acquired considerah]e capital and have invested it in other
parts of Canada. In my province I have sean

cases in whichi as many as five sets of provincial succession duties have had to he paid on
estates of $100.000 and under, to say nothing
of the dominion levy. I would suggest that
the Department of National Revenue, which
is charged. with. the collection of succession
duties, try ta arrange some agreement with
tlie variaus provinces in order ta avoid this
duplication.
In what I arn about ta say I probably speak
marc as a lawyer than a senator. In windinig
up cstates you frequently meet with the
diffieulty thiat two sets cf persans are valuing
tlie cetate-and thcy do not always agree on
the valuation.
That is right.

Hon. VINCENT DUPUIS: Honourable
senators, as a m.ember from Quebec I arn
interested in this question. There may be
other features of the bill which. will greatly
affect the estates of deceased persans. 1 arn
rot familiar with the common law of England
as it affects estates, but across the border the
law of some of the states provides that when
a deceased persan is survived by a father and

AUGUST 8, 1946
mother, or a father or mother, or when he is
survived by a father-or a mother-and 'brothers and sisters, the father and mother or
either of them shaîl take the whole of the
estate. In the province of Quebec the assets
are divided amongst the father, mother,
brothers and sisters.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Irrespective of
whether there is a wlll or not?
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: No, only when there is
no will.
I have in mind the case of a person who
died in one of the Ujnited States -where the law
is to the effect that the father and ýmother, or
either of them, shaîl inherit the whole estate
irrespective of brothers and sisters. The estate
totalled several thousand dollars, of which
$1,000 were on deposit in a bank in the province of Quebec. Now, should there be heirs in
Quebec, for instance, what arrangement could
be made? I understand that the province is
going to charge duties for the entire estate,
notwithstanding the fact that the greater part
of it is in the United States.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: At the rate which
would be chargeable for the whole estate?
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: The rate will be the
same as if the whohe estate was in that
province. If there are brothers and: sisters,
and a mother and father, the colaeteral line
will pay at a, much higher rate than the
direct line. I should like to hear from the
honourable member from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) whether the same problem wil
occur under the present agreement with
Er-gland.
1 agree with everything the honourýable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) has said,
but would add that the United States agreement should go further, and should cover not
only the provinces of the diominion but each
and every state, notwithstanding the agreement with the Government of the United
States. I think Michigan is the state in which
the father und mother inherit to the exclusion
of brothers and sisters, whereas in Quebec
they share proportionately. Some agreement
should be made to remedy the situation I
refer to; otherwise smialh estates are going to

INCOME TAX AGREEMENT
BILL
SECOND

READING

On the Order:
,Second reading of Bill 300, an Act respecting
an Income Tax Agreement between Canada
and the United Kingdom, signed at London, in
England, on the fifth day of June, 1946.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have asked the
honourabie senator from Inkermnan (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) to take charge of this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESS-EN moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
in very much the samne forma as the one just
considered by the house. Attached to it as a
sehedule is the agreement arrived at between
the two countries. The bill itself merely
ratifies the agrement and provides that any
inconsistencies between the agreement and
any other legisiation shall be resolved ini
favour of the agreement; and it gives the
Minister of National Revenue power to make
regulations necessary to, carry the termas of
the agreement into effect.
I arn sure the bill and the agreement will
have the sympathy of every member of this
house. The purpose is to prevent double
taxation on the incomç of a person who is
resident in one country and derives an income
in another country.
Referring to the remarks of my honourable
friend from Essex (Hon. Mr. Lacasse) in connection with the other bill, 1 may say that
this agreement is vcry similar to one made
two years ago between Canada and the United
States, and which. was confirmed hy parliament in the session of 1944. 1 think ahi will
agree that arrangements of this kind are
excecdingly desirable, particularly at this time,
whcn we are trying to clear the channel for
international trade, and 1 should like to
emphasize the effcct of agreements of this
nature ýupon international trade. Business
enterprises are being encouraged to extend
their operations into other countries, and if
they do so they shouhd not find themselves
hiable to double taxation on profits by reason
of the income tax haws of the country in whieb
they are doing business.
I hope that this agreement, which deals with
business profits as between Canada and the
United Kingdom, will be a pattern for future
agreements of the samne kind with other countries. In view of Canada's position as a great
trading country, and since a considerable
portion oif oiir revenue and national prosperity
derives from international trade, it is most
important that such agreements be made.

SENATE
May I turn to the agreement itself, which
as I have said, is a schedule to the bill?
Article 1 sets out what taxes are affected by
the agreement. In Canada it is the income tax,
including surtaxes and exceass profits tax; in
the' United Kingdom if is the incom
tax,
including surtax, the excess profits tax and a
national defence contribution.
Article III is important in view of what lias
just been said about international trade. It
provides that the industrial or commercial
profits of an English concern shaîl flot be
subject to tax in Canada unless the enterprise
is engaged in trade or business in Canada
through a permanent establishment situated
here. If the company bias such permanent
establishment, then it pays taxes only on the
profits earned by that establishment; and of
course there is a similar provision the other
way.
It mnay interest honourable m:enators to -ce
what the termi "permanent estab]hýIii.hent'
în.cludes--or perhaps if would bc nmore interesting to sec what it do-es flot include. According to the definition in paragraph (1), on page
3, for the purposes o-f thiis bill a Canadian
comipanv which carnies on buîsiness in En-gland
will flot he hiable foi' any income tax if its
business is carried on iee 'lv t1rougli a bona
fide broker or- commission agent, or- if it ha"
simply an agency in England, or even if it
hias an office in En-gland, so long as tlîat is
maintaincd exclusively for the purcbase of
goods. In other words, under this agreement,
in order to be liable to taxation in England a
Canadian company would really have f0 be
carrying on permanent business in tliat, country, and in such event it woruld be subject to
income tax onîx' on the profits earned within
England.
Article V dweals wifhi ships and aircraft. If
states that the country of residence of an
owner of ships or aircraft shaîl have the sole
right to colleet income tax. even thoîîgh the
profits froma the ships or aircraft are partly
derived fromt the ofher couîntry.
Inder article VI Canada agrees nt to levy
anr income fax of more than 16 per cent on
the investment income of a resident of the
Initeil Kingdom derived from sources within
Canada.
Ilon. Mr. HAIG: That is tlic same as a prox ision in the United States agreement?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Yes. And ini return
tHie United Kingdom agrees nof f0 le.x'y its
normal surtax on investmcnf income derived
b ' a resident of Canada fromt souirces within
the UTnited Kingclom.
Under article VII each counfry agrees thaf
it will not levy a tax on income, derived by a

gox eruiîent is flot liable to thiat fax.
Article IX is a nîther intet csting one. If

(2) thiat the service- are performed for or on
belialf of a person resident in the United
Kîngdonî. and (3) tlîat the profits or remuneratin aie stîbject f0 tax in the United Kin-dom.
Then. of course, there is a corresponding
clau"e exenipting a resident of Canada from
United Kingdom tax. This article does not
ah)ply to profits or remnuncration from public
entertainmcents, such as those given by stage,
motion picture or radio artists. musicians and
athletes.
Under article X an annîîity derived from
sources vvithin Canada bY' a resident of the
United Kingdiomt wihl not ýbe taxed in Canada,
provided it is taxcd in the United Kingdom.
There is a similar provision for the exemption
of an annuity derived from sources within the
United Kingdoma by a resident of Canada, and
subjeef to Canadian fax.
Articles XI and XII are desig-ned to assist
%vlhat one miglît caîl educational exclianges
between the two countries. Under article XI
a professor or teaclier living in one country
whîo go"s to teach in the other country for a
period of not more fhian fwo vears is not hiable
to tax in the country wlîere lie is temporarily
residen t.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: It works cither way?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Oh, ycs; ail these
provision-, work eithuer way. Under article XII
a student, of one country going to study in a
uni ersify of flic other couîntry is not hiable
for income tax in that othier country on
ainouints sent to hlm froin huis home counfry
to mainfain him whihe hie is away studying.
Under article XIII there is an ahlowance as
a credif by one country for tax in respect of

AUGUST 8, 1946
the income derived from sources within the
other country. Let me give you an example to
show how that works out. Suppose a resident
of the United Kingdom holds Canadian securities fromn wbida hie derives an income. As I
said -a few minutes ago, article VI provides
that Canada will not levy tax of more than
15 per cent on that income. W'hatever tax
Canada does Ievy within that 15 per cent
limitation will, once it is .paid, be credited
against the United Kingdom tax umder this
article XIII. And of course there is the saine
operation, vice versa, in the case of a Canadian
deriving income froin investinents in England.
Article XIV contains a provision similar to
one in the succession duty agreement bill,
which we considercd previously, for the
exchange of information between the governments of the two countries in order te, prevent
tax evasion and to enable the carrying out of
the provisions of the agreement.
In article XV also there is a provision similar to one in the other bill, for extending the
operation of the agreement to British colonies
and protectorates.
Under article XVI the agreement cornes into
effect when the necessary legislation bas been
adopted in both countries, and it shail thereupon have effect as from the year 1946 and
following years.
Article XVIII contains the usual provision
for terminating the agreement.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

MERCHANT SEAMEN COMPENSATION
BILL
SECOND READING

McL. ROBERTSON
Hon. WISHART
moved the second reading of Bill 302, an. Act
for
Merchant
'Compensation
respecting
Seamen.
He said: Honourable senators, the object
of this bill is to make statutory provision for
the payment of workmen's compensation to
merchant seamen, including those employed
on shipe engaged in foreign, trade as well as
those on ships plying home waters, and more
particularly seamen not now covered by pronhe principle of workvincial legisiation.
men's compensation was recognized in the
Governinent Eiuployees' Compensation Act,
1925, and during the war years that principle
was extended to cover war workers and other
groups. On August 1, 1945 an order in council
was passed extendiig it to merchant seamen.

The purpose of this bill is to give statutor5'
authority to -the regulations made under that
order in council, and now in force.
The bill provides for a workmen's compensation board of three members, and covers seamen working on ships registered in Canada.
It does not cover pilots, apprenticed pilots or
fishermen, or seamen protected by the Government Employees Compensation Act or any
provincial act, or seamen entîtled to elaim
compensation for injuries resulting from enemy
action.
Compensation is payable where there is
personal in.iury by accident in the course of
emrpinyrnent, except where the disahility lasts
less than seven days or where the accident is
attributable sohely te, misconduet and does not
resuit in death or serious disability. The
question of negligence does flot enter into
the matter. The widow of a searnan killed
in the course of bis employment would receive
a lump -umi of $100, a payment of $45 a
month during widowhood, and $10 a month
for each child under eighteen, the total
amount of monthly compensation being subject to certain limitations. Burial expenses up
to $125 are to be paid by the employer. The

expense of transporting the body froin the
place of death to place of interment is also

payable, the amount not to exceed $125, A ses,

non-fatal

injuries receivem

two-thirds of bis average earnings, with a

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have flot studied
the details of the bill, but 1 think that is the
common practice.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: It is, under the
ordinary workmen's compensation legisiation.
If I arn in the building business and have
thirty or forty men working for me, I pay
ta the Workmen's Compensation Board a
certain sum of money for each employee.
Then if any employee is injured the board
pays out compensation, based on a medical
examination and that sort of thîng. Throughout this bill it is stated that the employer
shahl pay.
Hon. Mr. ýGOUIN: 1 wauld refer the honour-able gentleman ta Section 7.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The section says
that the employer shahl psy. Under the usual
workmen's compensation acts the payments
are made by the board. If-as this bill provides the employer pays, he must carry insurance ta, caver ail of this Iiability. An employee injured. ta such an extent that ha is
unable ta do any further work would for the
rest of his life get compensation equivalent ta
two-thirds of his wages. How \vould it be
practicable for the employer ta carry insurance ta caver such a liability?
Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: I presume insurance campanies wvould be in a position ta
assume that risk along with others. If in
some respects this bill departs from the custamary principles underlying workmen's compensation legislation, I assume there, must be
some good reason for it. At the moment I am
flot in a position ta answer the honourable
gentleman's question; but it is most pertinent
and can, I hiope, be deait with satisfactorily
when the bill is befare one of aur standing
cammittees.

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: The employers pay

Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: There will be an

ta the mani himself if he is totally disabled,
the assessment will be made against ail

Hon. Mr. FOSTER: Right.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: This will be a terrific burden on an employer.
Hou. Mr. ROBERTSON: The primary
function of the compencation board wouild be
ta see that the seaman la cavered. There are
two ways in which it couid be done. The board
wvould set up the necessary machinery ta
assess the employer. If it, followed the practice

the employer for the cost nlot anly of ad-mini-iration but of variaus other details that prev-ede the actual paymenýt of claims. If my

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: That is true.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Is it flot the intention here that the cornpany shall pay awards,
but shall make no contributions?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Sehedule 1 of the
Ontario act contains an insurance provision
whereby employee and employer pay into a
fund wbich spreads the risk over a period of
years andi over the varions individuals concerned. Schedule 2 covers the railways, and
prolbably some other organizations which pay
awards directly. They do not seek insuran-ce
henefits, but pay the charges, whatever they
may be. As 1 remember, under Sehedule 1
em.ployees contribute just, as do the employers,
but here, as far as I can sec, the employees
make no contribution, and the expense is
borne by the employers.
My objection to the bill is that the employee enjoys the benefits if he happens to
be injured, but has no rcsponsibility. As a
resuit, there wilh ho a lack, of proper cmployeerecords, and there certainly will hoe a lack of
responsibility in carrying ont the purposes
of the act in the way that the provincial
legisiation is carried out hy reason of the fact
that contributions corne from both employer
and employee.
Thcre is nu provision in this bill for appeal;

in accordance with the practice in thec province

I arn wondering if that feature lias been canvassed. The province of Ontario maintains a
very expensive organization for the adrninistration of its act. It comprises the members
of the board. doctors, accouintants, advisers,
stenographers and others who go ýto make up

authorities a long time to build up such an

Hon. GE-ORGE P. BURCHILL: Hunourable senators, mnax I say a few words with
respect tu what lias heen donc hy the Workmen's Compensation Board in the province
of New Brunswick? It operates under an
arrange ment simil'îr to th-at mentioned by the
last speaker. and the employer pays the
entire cost. The New Brunswick measure
was put thîrough wlien the hionourable senator

AUGUST 8,1946
from Saint John (Hon. Mr. Foster) was
premier of that province, and hie will confirîn
what 1 say.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck). I
think that aIl avenues should be explored to
see whether this legisiation could nat be
administered by one of the provincial boards,
which, in my opinion, have gone a long
way towards perfecting their administrative
machinery.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Heýar, hear.
Hon. Mr. BURCHILL: Prier to the establishment of the Workmen's -Compensation
Board in the province of New Brunswick the
employers were obliged to carry liability insurance ta protect their employees in the
event of injury. That situation, I believe, wias
general across Canada. In some cases there
were complaints that the insurance companies
did not treat the employeeýs justly, and that
criticism wvas re.sponsible in large measure, I
think, for the movement xwhich hroughit about
the Workmen's Compensation Board.
I notice that under this bill -employers are
not assessed, as they are in the provinces, but
are obliged to carry insurance satisfactory to
the board in order to pay any losses which
may occur. I presume therefore that to secure
coverage an employer would have to go to
some liability insurance company, as lie was
obliged to do before the Workmens' Comnpensation Board was established. As has been
pointed out by the honourable senator from
L'Acadie (Hon. Mr. Leger), the employer also
bas to pay ail costs and charges of the board.
1 am wondering, therefore, if this is not going
to be an expensive business for the employer.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) that the
committee to which the bill is referred should
examine it closely and sec if it is not possible
to devise some more practical method of
carrying out its purpose.
Hon. ýG. LACASSE: Honourable senators, I
do nlot challenge the authority with which my
hon-ourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roehuck) speaks when hie says that in
Ontario the emplayee makes a contribution ta
the Workmen's Compensation Board. 1 must
humbly confess, however, that I was not aware
of that situation. The honourable gentleman
should know, having been in charge of the
administration of the Ontario Workmen's
Compensation Act.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I am suibject ta a
mistake, as anyone is.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: I would ask my
friend how the contributions are collected?
e3268-381

al

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: They are collected
fromn the employer, but I understand hie collects
from the employee.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: Whiat concerns me is
that when one looks at a cheque of the Ford
Motor Company, for instance, one will notice
that there are various au-tomatie deductions
for unemployment insurance and income tax.
After ail, those employees enjoy an advantage
in having their income tax returns prepared
for them by the company accountants. I envy
them that advantage, because it enables them
to escape one expenditure that we have to
meet. 1 have neyer known, however, of any
deduction hein-. mnade from employees' cheques
specifically for any contribution to the provincial Workmen's Compensation Fund. That is
why I took the liberty of putting a question to
the hionnurable senator. I do not doubt his
word, for he -mist know ivhat is being donc
under the Ontario act.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: No.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I think the honourable gentleman fromn Toronto-Trinity is mistaken, and that no deduction is made from an
employee's salary for workmen's compensation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I know that none is made
in Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: And there is none
in Saskatchewan. The employer makes the
contribution to the board, and the board pays
out the compensation.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: In the province of
Ontario the employer pays the compensation;,
based on the number of bis employees. 1 was
under the impression that in my own and other
offices part of this expense was passed on ta
the employee, but I may be wrong.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, this measure is captioned "An Act to

On the flrst day of August the Standing Comnmittee on Immigration and Labour presented
a report on the Unemployment Insurance

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to.
CANADIAN COMMERCIAL
CORPORATION BILL
SECOND

READING

Hon. WISH'ART MeL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 251, an Act
to establish the Canadian Commercial Corporation.
He said: Honourable senators, the Canadian
Commercial Corporation was set up under
order in council 'P.C. 1218, dated :March 29,
1946. Under present disturbed conditions of
world trade there are many transactions
which cannot be handled entirely by private
business. In order to deal effectively with
the numerous urgent transactions on band it
was necessary to bring the corporation into
being as rapidly as possible. The order in
council became effective the first day of May,
and on that date the property, obligations, and
rights of the Canadian Export Board were
assumed by the Canadian Commercial
Corporation.
The object of this bill is to enable the corporation to continue to serve the needs of
Canadian business so long as may be required
in the interests of international trade. The
corporation is empowered to assist in the
development of trade between Canada and
other nations, to assist persons in Canada to
obtain goods' and commodities from abroad,
and to dispose of goods and commodities
available for export from this country.
One of the principal duties of the Canadian
Commercial Corporation will be to carry on
the work formerly- done by the Canadian
Export Board, which made purchases in
Canada for foreign governments and for the
United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation
Administration. Since this board was established, in January 1944, to buy essential nonmilitary supplies in Canada for other governments, its work bas developed steadily in
scope and importance. It bas made purchases
in Canada for the United Kingdom and the
Crown colonies, Australia, India, Southern
Rhodesia, France, Russia, Norway, South
Africa, New Zealand, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Netherlands East Indies, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, China, and also, as I have
said, for UNNRA. The actual value of the
contracts placed by the board as of April
30, 1946, totalled $404,274,550. The value of
goods on requisitions raised by the board and

571

transferred to the Canadian Commercial Corporation for future action is estimated to be
$41,142,310. In order to handle the shipment
of large quantities of goods purchased by the
board on behalf of UNNRA, several packaging and storage warehouses were established.
It is beyond question that the services
rendered during difficul-t war years by the
Canadian Export Board, in obtaining essential civilian goods for members of the British
commonwealth and foreign governments, were
of great importance to the export trade of
Canada. Wartime restrictions made normal
trade activities impossible in most instances,
and consequently the establishment of this
government agency was invaluable both to
buyers and sellers. In many cases the purchases made by the board for the governmental agencies of other countries provided
the only means whereby Canadians were able,
at least in part, to supply traditional markets.
The purchases assisted in introducing Canadian goods into new export markets.
The work of the Canadian Commercial
Corporation will embrace both the export and
import fields. All contracts placed by the
Canadian Export Board and not completed
as of May 1 were automatically transferred
to the corporation without specific amendment. It should be emphasized that, while
the corporation is government owned and controlled, the contractual relationship between
buyer and seller is greatly im'proved by the
establishment of the corporation.
In general, the corporation acts only as an
agent and, does not of itself initiate purchases
in Canada. Nevertheless, at the request of
Canadian suppliers, it will bring attention to
commodities available in Canada. Should
inquiries result in orders, contracts would then
be let by the corporation.
The corporation will not encroach upon the
activities of private business. In fact one of
the primary objectives would be to assist it
directly in many important ways. For example,
in the import field it will aid Canadian traders
in obtaining essential supplies from ex-enemy
territory under military occupation. It is
impossible now, and may be for many years,
to permit private business to be transacted
in a normal fashion between the nationals
of ex-enemy countries-particularly Germany
and Japan-and private concerns in Canada.
During this period the occupation administrations will control all industry in these countries, and foreign commerce will be conducted
by government agencies. The measuring-rod
for the entrance into Canada of supplies from
these areas will be the needs of Canadian

572

SENATE

business, it being berne in mind that experts
froma such ceuntries must be permitted in
order te pay for nrressary imports.
With regard te possible imperts of goods
froma ex-enemy countries, the corporation is
at present endeaveuring te arrange for representatives abread through whom specific information will be ebtaieable in response te
inquiries from Canadian business men.
As far as these ex-enemy areas are concernied, the corporation would net as an intermediary assisting the Canadian imperter in
obtainieg the necessarýy expert, licence and
foreign exehanige from the foreign er occupation goverument.
The corporation will award ceetracts on the
basis of competitive sealed tenders in ahl cases
where it is practicabie te do se, having regard
of course for the utilization of surplus stocks
field by the crewn. Except where geods are
je free supply, clearance must first be obtained
froma the expert permit brancb of the Department of Trade and Commerce before purchases are made, in order te preteet the suppiy
of geods for the domestie market. Te Services of the corporation will be eoffered for a
small fee for the purpose of covering its
administrative expenses.
The minister stated ini anothier place thiat,
tue preposed corperation was net looked upon
as being a permanent organization by any
means, but te cover the extraerdinary cirdumstances incident te the transition peried.
I have endeavoured te outie breadly the
gencral desirability of sucb an organisation,
fer the time being at least. As te the many
details which undeubtedly ieterest bonourable

which %ve would ail giv e eur appreval, we fiud
a broader power requestcd-a power whicli
would enable the corporation te, enter into

te leok beyend this v.ear or next when creating
a. corporation of this kiud by net of parliement, for ýticli art remains a statute of
Canada until repealed ho both houses of
paridia ment.
Under section 5 of the bill the authority

explanatien vo bave, heard of the funictieus
whichi the corporation is new performing. and
n hich were formerly carried on by the Export
Boardi. On the coutrary, the section reads:

of th is act; and, for greater certainty but net
se as te restrict the generality of the f'oregoing.

(b) exporting goeds or commodities frein
Canada, and
(c) storing and processing geods or commodities, either as principal or as agent, je sucli

1 duo neut think yen could concrive of a
broader power being given any corporation.
Ie fart. the corporation is given the broadest
power te engage ie eny kied of importing or
exportiug bu.siness, includiug the processing of

There is some kied of limitation suggested
by reference te section 4. You xvili notice that
subsectien 2 of section 5 is in this form:
he generality of subseetion eue of this section is net restricted by auy provision of this
act other tbau section four thereof.
Let me quote section 4:
The corporation is established for the f ollowing purposes:
(a) te assiat in tbe development of trade between Canada and other nations,-

AUGUST 8, 1946
There again you have the broadest sort of
power conferred-"to assist in the development
of trade." That is, for the purpose of international trade the government itself, through
this corporation, may for all time, if the bill
becomes law, set itself up in business. As a
matter of fact, under a socialistic state it would
conceivably set itself up as the corporation
which would be the sole exporting and importing agency between Canadian trade and
any international trade connections we might
have.
There is no limitation of the time the bill is
to run, and once a measure of this kind is
enacted it remains on the statute books until
some future day when you can get both
houses of parliament to agree to its repeal.
If you insert a time limitation, the bill expires
when the time is up, unless both houses of
parliament agree that it shall be renewed. So
if you want to have some check or safety
device on broad legislation of this kind a
definite term should be specified.
I su'bmit that a very important principle is
involved in a measure of this kind, which
gives broad authority to the government "to
assist in the development of trade between
Canada and other nations." I am not reflecting on those sponsoring the bill. Their purposes no doubt are of the soundest kind and
intended to promote the best interests of
Canada. But we are creating a kind of machinery that may seriously embarass us in the
future, unless we surround its operation with
all the safeguards that will retain some measure of control in parliament. Only by such
means can we hope to prevent the exercise
of power being carried to extremes which, I
submit, are not and should not be contemplated by the representatives of the people in
parliament at this time.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable members, the honourable gentleman who has just
taken his seat has stated the main criticisms
I bad intended to offer with regard te this
measure. Consequently I shall not repeat
them. But I should like to draw attention to
the principle embodied in the bill, for I think
it is important that we should clearly understand what we are being asked to approve.
The -corporation to be set up has the power,
unquestionably, as stated by my honourable
friend who has just preceded me, to go into
the export and import business of this country
in a very large way.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: And the manufacturing business.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: And the processing or
manufacturing business as well. Let us con-

sider for a moment just what that means.
For years the C.C.F. party has advocated this
very thing, and its leaders have declared that
if it secures a majority in the other house it
will bring down legislation to ensure that the
international trade of Canada shall be carried
on through import and export boards. Now,
is not this bill the first steip in that direction?
I may not be strictly in order, but I would
remind honourable members that another
measure will presently be before us, and the
powers asked for in the two bills, if comibined,
could put the business of this country in a
complete strait-jacket if any government so
wishes. I do not for a moment think that
was in the minds of the sponsors of this billHon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -but in considering
measures of this kind we must look ahead and
see whaýt the consequences may be. We are
asked to accept here the principle of state
trading. I can see it in no other light. The
explanation given by the honourable leader
of the government indicated that this legislation was intended to meet specific purposes.
During ithe war we had a Canadian Export
Board. It was felt, and I think wisely so,
that in the tremendously disturbed conditions
of wartime, when shipping and exchange were
under control everywhere, the purposes of war
could be better served by having this sort of
control. But it was purely for war purposes.
There is a possible argument, I admit, in
the fact that we will have dealings for some
years with occupied enemy countries such as
Japan, Germany and Austria, where ordinary means of trading are not available. There
might be an obscure argument in faveur of a
corporation of the kind envisaged here being
set up temporarily for the purpose of carrying
on trade with these occupied countries. But
when the bill goes further, ands gives such
powers as were outlined by the senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), I think the committee to whom it is referred should require
a very full explanation of the purposes behind
it. I agree with the suggestion made by the
honourable senator that the corporation should
have a limited period of operation.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: In my opinion this bill
could be amended in two ways. First, an
effort should be made to circumscribe the
operations of the corporation-for instance, to
trading with occupied countries; and secondly,
to put a limit on its period of operation, so
that if its continuance was deemed necessary
the measure could again be brought before
parliament for review. If the measure is
passed in its present form it may remain on

574

SENATE

our statute books for all time to come. In a
few years we might have, for instance, a
Progressive-Conservative government in this
country.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: That government
might be tempted by the opportunity offered
by this legislation to embark on a large scale
on the state control of our international trade.
Personally, honourable senators, I do not wish
to provide any government with permanent
facilities for such a purpose. If the life of
this measure is limited, and later it is thought
that it should be extended, I say that whatever government is in power should come back
to parliament and ask for the legislation necessary to continue it. It could then be reviewed,
and its value to the business and industry of
this country could bc assessed.
I say without equivocation that I do not
like the tendency to increase the powers of the
state, which seems so goneral]v in vogue today.
Every step in that direction is a lurking
danger to the freedom and liberty of the
citizen. This measure appears to me to be a
substantial step towards centralizing power in
the state and giving it a greater control over
the people. I think I could make a strong
argument that the principle underlying this
measure has been repudiated by the Canadian people, but I do not intend to take the
time of the house now to do so. I know
that when the bill goes to committee it will
receive careful consideration.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I wish to be associated with
the views expressed by the honourable member from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) and
the senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden).
This legislation appears to me to be of a
highly dangerous character. I am not particularly concerned about power being placed
in the hands of the government to enter into
manufacturing or processing. provided I know
what it is permitted to make and am sure
that it is in the public interest. But to hand
to a department of government the power
to enter into trade and commerce, to import,
export and process without any supervision as
to what it will import or export, or the extent
to which it will manufacture. is like giving it
a blank cheque, and to me appears very
dangerous.
Let us get down to cases. Suppose some
person in Canada wanted to obtain boots and
shoes. Under the provisions of section 4 (1) (b)
of the bill that person could be assisted in his
importing and processing; the Department of
Trade and Commerce would have power to
buy hides abroad and bring them here to be
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

processed by the government into boots and
shoes. That would be all right if it were in
the public interest. If such a situation were
to arise we should examine into it, and if the
action proposed appeared to be in the public
interest, we could then give the specific power
required. But to give power cloaked in general terms of this kind, which could apply to
anything, would almost abrogate parliamentary control, and place in the hands of the
executive the power to establish a completely
new system of trade and commerce. This is
dangerous legislation.
I would prefer sending the bill back to the
House of Commons for redrafting to sending
it to a committee of this house. If the bill is
intended to accomplish what the honourable
senator who explained it said, then it has been
improperly drawn. There is great divergence
between the explanation and the measure
itself. They do not coincide at all. I think
we ought to defeat the bill and send it back
to be re-drawn. Let us have a new billt
It is said that power of this kind is necessary in order that the state may assist in the
development of trade and commerce. Canada
already has a Department of Trade and Commerce engaged in that work, and we have
agents in occupied countries. As far as credit
is concerned, our chartered banks will guarantee the accounts of their customers. In the
past we have had no difficulty arranging
credit abroad. Through our banking system
those with sufficient credit at home have
always been able to change it into foreign
credit. It is not necessary, in order to carry
on foreign trade, that there should be government interference between the purchaser
and the vendor abroad. Before this bill is
given second reading I should like to be
satisfied as to what is intended.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
it was my intention to have said some of
the things the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden), the honourable
gentleman fron Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. 'Roebuck) have said, and
then to move that the debate be adjourned. I
am in favour of the bill going to committee
for the reason that I agree with its principle,
but should it come back in its present form I
would certainly vote against it.
The honourable leader said that as we are
going through a transitory period this is a
transitory bill. I think we as a body should
consider the measure, and make sure that it
does not go beyond what is required. We are
here to do that kind of thing.
I have a stronger reason for disliking the bill
than any urged by the honourable gentlemen

575

AUGUST 8, 1946
who have spoken. I feel that we are tending towards a hierarchy here in Ottawa. The
allegation has been denied by the government, and only yesterday it was denied
by one of its leading members in another
place. He may have been sincere in what he
said, but it is truc that since the war, on the
ground that we are passing through a transitory period, bills have been coming along in a
steady stream to continue a systern which was
Of
established solely for war purposes.
course that is a perfectly human tendency.
During one's parliamentary life, for instance,
one may see a new department formed. One
is told that it will not be very large; it will
have only a minister and a couple of secretaries. But the next year the department has
ten secretaries, the year after it has fifty, and
in less than five years it is one of the biggest
departments in the government service. That
is what this kind of legislation tends to bring,
about.
I know I am out of order, Mr. Speaker, as
was the honourable gentleman from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar)-and he knew it too-but
there are other bills coming forward which
embrace this same principle. I am not saying
these things against the government. The
honourable leader has explained the situation
correctly: there is a hiatus today and he
wants to establish the proper trade connections so that we may take full advantage of
opportunity that is now open to us. But if
this bill is to go through, I want its authority
limited so that it will not continue for an
indefinite period.
A similar problerm arose last year when the
reconstruction bill was passed. The minister
was perfectly satisfied with the bill when this
bouse was through with it, although it did
not go nearly as far as the original bill. I
think the same thing is happening again.
The government has instructed someone to
draft a bill to do so and so. It is like a
lawyer drawing up a charter for a corporation.
The client says lie is going to engage in the
shipping business, but three or four additional
clauses are slipped in just for weight, and
he finds he has power without end.
I am not going to ask that the debate be
adjourned, because the matter has been fully
dealt with. I think the bill ought to go to
committee, where the operations to be
carried on under it can be limited to say
two years, or perhaps five years. I want
the officials to tell me why a five year period
is not sufficient. If in five years conditions
are the sane as now, there is no reason why
the parliament of Canada cannot again consider the measure at that time. My honour-

able friend frorn Churchill mentioned a certain party that might be in power, but I am
a little afraidHon. 'Mr. CAMPBELL: That it will not
be in power?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am a little afraid that
the honourable gentleman had another party
in mind, and just mentioned the wrong name.
If the Progressive-Conservative party do
get into office I would not want them to
have the kind of power .provided for by this
bill. I think that power of that kind is
dangerous. If the governiment wants it, let
it come back to the representatives of the
people and ask for it.
Personally I do not think a government is
ever beaten by the opposition; it is beaten
from within. If we go back in the history of
parliaments in Canada we will find that that
is true. If Canada has a Labour-Progressive
government in power-and the Labour-Progressives are ambitious enough to be in
power-our experiences of the last year and
a half would indicate that we would soon
become one of the Soviet republics instead
of a part of the British Empire.
As I have said, the officials will have to
put up a very strong argument to show me
why the provisions of this bill should not be
limited to, say, five years.
An Hon. SENATOR: That is too long.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: One year.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Maybe three years
would be sufficient. One might think that
the succession duty agreement with the
United Kingdom was a kind of thing which
could safely be allowed to run on indefinitely;
yet both sides wanted it limited to three
years. I think that a limitation should be
specified here.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on

WAR CRIMES BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 309, an Act respecting
War Crimes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I would ask the honourable gentleman
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) to move
the second reading of this bill.

576

SENATE

Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL moved the second
reading of the bil.
He said:
Honourable senators, thas as a
very short bill, censisting of only three sections. Its purpose is to validate, if necessary,
the War Crimes Regulations passed on August
30, 1945. Prier to the passage of those regulations it was st.at.ed by the President of the
United States and also, I think, by the Prime
Minister of Great Britain that the United
Nations intended to prosecute war criminals,
persons alýleged te be guilty of offences ýagainst
war usages and customs. Many people questioned whether or not under the provisions of
international law any partieuýlar country had
power to prosecute an enemy accused of bcbng
a war criminal. The question was considered
an tiais country, and the opinion was that His
Excellency the Governor General, as the chief
of the armiv and upon the adx ice of the cabinet, bad full power to delýegate anyone ýto try
war criminals. A similar question was raised
in Great Britain, and the procedure followed
there was to issue a royal warrant constituting
an authority for trying war criminals. As that
was not in conformity with our practice, an
order in council was passed. Although the
order was flot specifically ýpassed tandýer the
provisions of the War Measures Act, it did
make reference te that sect. Later on attention was called ýto the fact that the nmaximum
penalty that could be imposed under the W/ar
Measures Act was five years or a fine of $2,000.
The Department of Justice was then asked for
an opinion as to wbether or flot a sentence of
more than five ycars on a e-onx icted war crrnmnal would be valid; and the opinion given was
that by virtue of the order in, counceil, irrespective of the provisions of the W/ar Measures
Act, thc regulations were sufficient to validate
such a sentence. However, the question baving been raised, and -the authority set up
under the provisions of thae order in council
having held trials and sen'tenced convicted
war criminals to terms of imprisooment longer
than five years, it was consiýdered advisable to
ne-enact the regulations in statuýtory form,
retroactive to tie 3Otlî of August, 1945, so
that no tecbnicnl question could be raised by
anyone serving a sentence imposed under the
regulations.
Section 1 of the bill simply provides that
the W/ar Crimes Regulations, recited as a
sebedule te the bill, are re-enacted. Section 2
makes the re-enactmaent retroactive to the
30th of August, 1945.
The tlaird and last section of the bill reads:
This act shiah continue in force until a day
iixed ýby proclamation of tlîe Gox ernor iii Coco2il andi frorn and after tîsat (lite shaîl be deemed
to be repealed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

In other words, anything done within the
scope of the regulations prier to the repeal
of the net weuld be valid.
Briefly stnted, the whole purpose of the bill
as to put inte statutory form the regulations
passed by order in ceunicil.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: May I point out te the
bonour1lable gentlemen that section 3 seems te
be n departure froma the language previeusly
used ini statutes. Whien it is desired to fix a
date for the ceming inte force of a statute,
we uscally say tbat the act shaîl ceme inte
force tapon proclamation; and when a statute
as no longer useful we repeal it by legislation.
But here pow er is sought for the repeal of the
statute by order in council. That is certainly
a departure, and I cannet understand why it is
necessary.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I think the explanation is this. It is centemplated that at soe
future date the act may no longer be required,
but juat now it is impossible to fix that date.

Hon. Mr. LEGER: W/bat harm would ha
done if the act remained in force for two
months longer tban was necessary?
Hon. Mr-. CAMPBELL: 1 do net suppose
tbat wo.uld make any difference at aIl.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Then wbyv de.part from
tlae uctial method of reipealing a statute?
Hon. Mi. CAMPBELL: Tlie original measure xvas the order in counicil, whicbi xas
considea'ed to be sufficient at tbe time.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Tliat
under the Wai' Measures Act.

was passed

Hon. Mr'. CAMPBELL: No.
Hon. Mr. ROEBLÎCK: Bot the autbority to
îiass it was obtained uoder tlîat act.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Referencewasmade
in the order te the W/ar Measures Act, but the
order was intended te be a general provision
in substitution foer a royal warrant sucb as
was issued in England, net under any statute,
buit by His Majcsty. It wa considered tlaat
Ris Excellency tbe Governor in Council, upon
the advice of bis ministers, ceuld by order in
ceuncil constitute tbe autberity teo try war
eriminals. Tlîat autbority, having bcen censtituted by order in council, coffld be repealed
by order in council. The object of tbe bill is
simpîly te confirm the regulations which were
passed by erder in council and will remain an
effect until repealed by order in council.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: If the erder in
council was net passed tinder the authority of
the W/ar Measures Act, under wbae authority
was il passed?

AUGUST 8, 196
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I understand the
Department of Justice gave an opinion that
there was general authority vested in His
Excellency the Governor General to deal with
the matter upon the advice of his ministers.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Under the Army Act?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes, as chief of the
army.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Then it would lie
under the Army Act?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Under the Army
Act, I suppose. In England, as I say, His
Majesty issued a royal warrant for setting up
a similar autliority.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Perhaps I misapprehend
the wording of section 3. This is how it reads:
This act shall continue in force until a day
fixed by proclamation of the Governor in
Council..
That means, if I read it rightly, that the
Governor in Council lias to proclaimn the act
in force until a certain date?
Hon. Mr. CAMP-BELL: No. The set comes
into force immediately and continues in force
until a day fixed by proclamation.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It is not stated that the
act cornes into force immediately.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: With ail respect, I
submit that is the only interpretation that
can lie placed upon the words.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: When you limait one
way you should limait lioth ways. I think the
committee to whicli this bull is referred would
be well advised to amend this section to
provide that the act shail come into force
when it is assented to.
HIon. Mr ROEBUCK: Section 2 states wlien
the act cornes into force.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: Oh, yes, that is right.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: It is retroactive.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The honourable
gentleman who moved second reading (Hon.
Mr. Campbell) said the bull was a very short
one, containing oniy three paragraplis. But
the purpose of the bill is to put into force a
long series of regulations, running to no less
than five closely printed pages, with regard to
wax crimes. Every section in these regulations
deals with the liberty of the subjeet, a very
important matter. The gentleman lias given
us very little explanation with regard to wliere
these five pages corne from, though their
wording would indicate that they are part of
some order-in-couneil. I wouid liesitate to

bii.

enact five pages of criminal law without the
most careful scru'tiny unless I knew there was
some experience behind them.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I lied a.ssumed that
these regulations were pretty well known.
Ail they do, in effect, is to constitute an authority similar to a military court, with the full
procedure set out for the trial of war criminals.
As I said, before, they are an exact copy of the
provisions of the order-in-council which was
passed in August, 1945. That order has been
tabled and its provisions have been acted
upon in the form. in which they now appear,
and have been treated as valid in every respect. The sole purpose of this Iegislation is
to put those provisions in statutory form, sn
that there can be no question of validity of
the actions which already have been taken by
the .authority set up under them
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: We can go into that
in committee.

CANADIAN NATIONAL RAIL WAYS
FINANCING AND GUARANTEE BILL
SECOND READING
Bon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 346, an Act
to authorize the provision of moneys to meet
certain capital expenditures made and capital
indebtedness incurred by the Canadian
National Railways system during the calendar
year 1946, and to authorize the guarantee by
Bis Mai esty of certain securities to be issued
by the Canadian National Railway Company.
He said: The purpose of this bill is to provide authority for the financing of capital
expenditures of the railway system and the
retirement of miscellaneous maturing obligations, either by way of boan fromn the dominion
or the issue to the public of securities of the
company guaranteeci by the Dominion Government. The total amount to be provided for
this purpose is limited to $22,550,000, made Up
as follows:
Additions and betterments (less
$14,000,000
retirernents> .................
8,863,000
New equipment .................
7,000,000
Acquisition of Manitoba railway..
410,000
Acquisition of securities ...........
Retiremnent of maturing capital
including sinking fund
obligations
and equipment principal pay9,777,000
ments ........................
$40,050,000

Less: Available from reserves for
depreciation and debt discount
amortization.................

17,550,000

$22,550,000
Total.....................
This capital budget was approved by the
Standing Committee on Railways of the other
bouse. Honourable members will observe that
this total of $22,550,000 includes $9,770,000 for
the retiremnent of obligations now outstanding,
so that the actual net increase in the railway
company's debt will be only $12,773,000.
I may point out that from 1941 to 1945
inclusive the railway earnings showed a surplus
of $112,000,000, and this was usèd in reduction
of government boans.
Repairs and renewals are provided for out
of current earnings and, of course, do not need
the approval of parliament; but, as honourable
members will recali, capital expenditures must
ho authorîzed. This measure covers capital
expenditures for the present year.

SENATE
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I ar n ot objecting
ta the bill, but wbhen it is being deait with in
committee I should like ta bave a statement
showing the bonded indebtedness of the railway system ta the public, with details of the
proposed expenditures on additions, betterments and new equipment. As ta the $7,000,000
for the acquisition of the Manitoba railway, it
is probable that 1 kn'ow more about this railway than any other of my colleagues here, for
1 was a member of the Manitoba legislature
wbhen the ninety-nine year lease was under
discussion. 1 fully approve of the purchase of
this railway, but-while I do flot want ta be a
pessimist-I fear that the falling off in frcigbt
earnings as indicated by current reports,
wbicha will be aggravated by the presenit strike
situation, will not enable the system in the
next five years ta show another net surplus of
Si 12,000),000.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMM ITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I mnove that this

tbat for the rernainder of the secýion the time

CIVILIAN WAR PENSIONS AND
ALLOWANCES BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART
McL.
ROBERTSON
moved second reading of Bill 335, an Act
respecting Civilian War Pensions and Allowances.
He said: Honourable senators, as alrcady
indicated, withi your indulgence I will give
a brief explanation of what is involved in the
several buis dealing with veterans affairs. I
wxould suggest that any questions, apart. from
the financial aspect cf the bis, be dcferred
until the meeting of the committee, when
experts wilI be present to give details concerning any particular measure. My understanding is that, w-bat honourable members
desire is an indication of the additional expense ta which the country will be put by
reason of thiese measures.
Honourable senators, may I revert for a
moment to the tbree buis already referred ta
the committee? The first is Bill 329, an Act ta
amend the Pension Act. The estimated additional cost under this particular measure is
$250,000 annually.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

I should say tbat it was my intention ta
have bad prepared for honourable senators a
typewritten liaI of the buis ta whicb 1 have
referred. Unfortunately I did not bave time
ta do so, but I arn baving typewritten copies,
prepared for the memýbers of the Banking and
Commerce Committee when they assemble
tomorrow morning.
The second bill referred ta the cammittc
ia Bill 331, an Act respecting Allowances for
War Veterans and Dependeots. The estimated annual cost under this bill is $3,650,000.
The third bill ta wbicha I wish to refer is
Bill M36, an Act ta amend the Veterans Land
Act, 1942. The estimated coat of this legislatian is $3,000,000. I would point out that
this is nýot an annual cost, as in the case of
the twa previous bills, but a nan-recurring
expenditure.
These veterans hbis vary cnnsiderably as ta
thme increased demands they impose upon the
national revenue. They may be divided ino
the following classifications: (1) Those wbich
show a specifie annual increase in expenditure;
(2)
those
whîcb
involve
nan-recurriog,
increases; (3) those whicb merely provide
statutory authority foi- existiag arders in council and resuit in no increase in expenditure;
and (4) thase wbich it is expected will affect
rclatively small numbers, and as ta whicbi
there bias been little experience and the departmuent iinust mnake the wildest gmcs.s. 1 believc
that pretty well cavera the classification,,.
May I naw refer ta Bi3ll 335, an Act respecting civilian War Pensions and Aliowances?
This measure is designed ta confer pension
rights upon certain groups of persans wbo
ýserved in variaus capacities during the w-ar
but were not members of His Majesty's farces.
These groupa are as follaws. (1) Merchant
searnen; (2) commercial fisbermen; (3) auxiliary services personnel; (4) Canadian avecseas fire fighters; (5) Royal Canadian Maunted
Police; (6) air raid precautiona workers; (7)
members of the Voluntary Aid Detacbmcnt,
scrving with the R.C.A.M.C. in Canada; (S)
certain overseas welfare workers, sucb as Red
Cross and Saint Johin Ambulance Brigade
personnel; (9) ortbopaedic nurses sent by the
Red Cirosa Society for service overacas witl
tbe Scottish Ministry of Healtb; (10) Canadian civilian air crew of the Royal Air Force
Transport Coininand.
The c-stimateml annmal ca, of the new legi-lation cantained io this bill is $50,000.

SUPERVISORS WAR SERVICE BENEFITS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 325, an Act
respecting benefits to certain supervisors in
the auxiliary services.
Hie said: Honourable senators, this bill deals
with auxiliary services supervisors and gives
statutory effect to order in council P.C. 3228
of the 3rd of May, 1944, whereby these persons were given certain rehabilitation benefits, namely, a gratuity of $15 per month of
service, the right to insurance under the
Veterans Insurance Act, the right to reinstatement in employment under the Reinstatement
in Civil Employment Act, 1942, and, if a
pensioner, the right to benefits under the
Veterans' Land Act, 1942, and to vocational
training.
The present bill extends to supervisors ail
the benefits available to persons who served
in the naval, military or air forces of Canada,
except incomne tax exemptions. The estimated
non-recurring cost of additional benefits, avaitable to supervisors is $500,000.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

Veterans Insurance Act, a rehabilitation grant
as if the fire fighter had been a member of
the military forces of Canada, and, in the
case of a pensioner, the benefits of the
Veterans' Land Act, 1942. Additional benefits
given by this bill consist of vocational training benefits and the benefits of the Unemployment Insurance Act.
The estimated annuai cost of these additionai 'benefits is quite small, because the number of men affected is not -more than about 400.
The only new financiai commitmnents involved
are for vocational training or unemployment
insurance, and but a small fraction of the 400

advantage of these benefits.

FIRE FIGHTERS WAR SERVICE
BENEFITS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 326, an Act
respecting benefits to fire fighters who served
in the United Kingdom.
He said: Honourable senators, it will be
noted that for one reason or another, which
I shahl state as I go along, there is no specific
estimate as to the increased cost involved in
this and the folhowing six bis, but after I
finish exphainîng themn I shall present for your
consideration some fairiy accurate figures of
the total financiai implications of the whole
programme.
Bihl 326 gives statutory effeet to the provisions of order in counicil P.C. 3229 of the

He said: Honourabie senators, this bill witl
enabie the minister, wîth the approval *of the
Governor in Councit, to make money grants to
universities to help defray extraordinary expenses on their facilities under the rehabilitation programme. These grants have been
prýovided in the past under authority *of order
in councit P.C. 215/4940 of the 1Sth of Juhy,
1945, and the effect of the bill is simply to
provide statutory authority for them. There
is no change in the conditions under which
funds may be granted to the universities, and
the expenditure per unit is not to excecd that
which is already being made under the order
in council. So there is no estimate -of new
cost in this case at ahi.

ALLIED VETERANS BENEFITS BIIL

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the bill
be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved the second, reading of Bill 328, an Act
respecting veterans of forces alliedi with
Canada.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill
deals with persons domioiled in. Canada who
joined and served with the forces allied with
Canada in the war. It gives statutory effect
to the provisions of order in council P.C. 7516
of the 22nd of January, 1946, but has certain
new features which will be noted hereunder.
The order in council gave such veterans all
benefits under the Veterans Rehabilitation Act
and the Veterans' Land Act, the right to
medical services, hospital treatment and other
benefits available under the Department of
Veterans Affairs Act, as wel'l as the right to
gratuity and re-establishment credit under the
War Service Grants Act on resumption of their
domicile in Canada.
The bill provides that where an allied
veteran dies after discharge leaving a widow
who was rnarried to him at 'the time he joined
the forces and who was domiciled in Canada
within two years from the date of his death,
she shall be entitled to the benefits under the
War Service Grants Act which the veteran
would have received if he hadi lived'. It goes
further to provide that where the deceased
veteran leaves no widow, but leaves a mother
resident in Canada who was dependent on
hini immediately prior to his death, the
benefits heretofore mentioned under the War
Service Grants Act become ava.ilable to ber.
Another new feature is that the administration facilities of the Department of Veterans
Affairs are made available to allied governments in carrying out plans for the rehabilitation of allied veterans. The minister is authorized to make adjustments te ensure that an
allied veteran does not receive a duplication
of benefirts.
The estimalted annual cost of the new features in this bill is expected' to be relatively
small. The numiber of eligible allied veterans
is only 1,167, and the only financial commitment in the bill not previously covered by
ord-er in council is for certain benefits te the
widow, or te the dependent mother of an
eligible veteran who dies. The number of
such widows or dependent mothers is likely te
be very small.
The motion was agreed te, and the bill was

READING

Hon. WISHART M'L. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 330, an
Act respecting benefits to certain persons who
were recruited in Canada by United Kingdom
authorities for special duty in war areas.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
designed to give statutory effect to the provisions of order in council P.C. 988 of the 19th
of March, 1946. By this order certain persons
domiciled in Canada and enrolled by the
United Kingdom authorities for special duty
in war areas were given all rehabilitation
rights available to Canadians who served in
the regular armed forces.
These persons,
after undergoing rigid training in England,
were dropped by parachute into enemyoocupied territory.
No additional expenditure is involved. The
number of persons eligible for these benefits
is only 52, and the total cost is not great.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

VETERANS' BUSINESS
AND PROFESSIONAL LOANS BILL
SECOND

READING

McL. ROBERTSON
WISHART
Hon.
moved the second reading of Bill 332, an Act
respecting Loans to Veterans to assist in their
cstablishment in business or professionally.
He said: Honourable senators, this legislation is designed to encourage 'banks to provide
additional funds for appropriate periods and
at a comparatively low rate of interest to
veterans seeking to establish thenselves in a
business or profession. It is considered to be
supplementary to the War Service Grants
Act. 1944, which makes available to veterans
re-establishment credit for certain purposes,
including the purchase and repair of tools,
instruments and equipment, and for the purchase of a business or the commencement of
a professional practice.

AUGUST 12, 1946
The bill provides that a veteran may apply
ta a bank for a business or professional boan
up ta t.wo-thirds of bis proposed total expenditure, but not exceeding $3,000. The boan is
ta be paid back within ten years. The termas
and conditions of repayment are ta be covered
by regulations. The security, if any, will be
on the praperty acquired with the proceeds
of the loan. The government will pay any
lasses suffered by a bank up ta 2Mper cent
of the first $1,000,000 of boans, plus 15 per
cent of any additional loans. This limited
guarantee is avnilable in respect of $25,000,000
of boans made by ahl banks within a five-year
period from the date of commencement of
the act.
The total cost of this business boan plan
is somewhat uncertain, but it should not be
very large. The only cost involved is that
of reimhursing the banks for any loans whicb
are not repaid up ta the extent of the limited
guarantee wbich I have mentioned. If we may
judge from experience witb the Farm Loans
Improvement Act, tbere will be few defaulters.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: Have the baniks been
consulted on this bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I cannat say
definitely that they bave been, but I think it
probable that tbe department bas consulted
thema on the details of the measure.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: The banks would
have no objection.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: I think, before a measure
of this kind is enacted, the trust and boan
companies and the banks sbould be consulted
Tbey in the end will bave ta lend the mone.
Hon. Mr. HAIG:; I am afraîd I cannot
agree witb the honourable gentleman. The
banks will not be compelied ta make boans.
For the banks the Home Improvement Act
was a "lead-pipe cinch"-if I may use tbe
terra. Under that begislation tbey could pick
and choose ta wbomn they would make boans.
Hon. Mr. R{OBERTSON: The hankg are
protected up to twenty-flve per cent of tbe
first 81,000,000 loaned.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The banks are webl protected. They do not have ta make boans;
they may refuse ta lend on an-y proposed
security.
But this bill is different from the other
veteïrans bills. Tbose bibis are for tbe purpase
of assisting soldiers by way of pensions and
s0 forth. This particular legislation is ta
enable veterans ta secure boans up ta $3,000 on
the purchase of a business or practice. The
value of a business or practice baving been
buibt up by tbe personality of the owner, I
am afraid that if we run into a slowing-off

583

period the purchaser may find it difficuit to
carry on, and that any losses on loans will
have to be shouldered by the taxpayers, not
the banks.
Hon. Mr. NICOL: 1 quite understand that
this bill does flot force the banks ta make
loans. But there is something more than the
law. Banks and trust and boan companies,
want to do what is fair to the community
which they serve, and naturally they must do
one of two things: either refuse to make any
loans at ail or go into the business.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: The banks are protected
ta the extent of 25 per cent of the flrst $1,000,000, plus 15 per cent of any additional loans.
You are flot likely ta have any trouble inducing the banks to make loans. On the contrary,
they are likely ta, be clamoring for the business. The banks are always trying ta make
their money earn interest, and the happiest
man in the world is the bank manager who
is asked for a boan of 810,000, $20,000 or
$25,000 on good security. H1e just beamns at the
prospect of being able ta get interest on the
money in bis bands. We have no inflation of
goods; but, whether we care ta admit it or
not, we certainly have a terrifie inflation of
money. It is a question whether the dollar
today is worth seventy cents in actual goods.
1 arn not at ail iineasy as ta the banks, but
1 am about this type of boan. A boan on a
farm bas good security. but trouble begins
the minute you lend money on chattels. My
honourable friend from Biaine Lake, Saskatchewan (Hon. Mr. Horner)-that should be
bis designation anyway-is a farmer, and he
will admit that within the last flfteen years
it did not pay him ta, ship cattle from bis farm
ta the Winnipeg stock markets because be was
not sure they would bring him enough money
ta pay the freigbt charges. Today, on the
contrary, an animal is worth anywbere from
$100 ta $150. Wben you make boans on a
practice or a business you are on dangerous
ground. In committee proper safeguards must
be provided ta reduce to a minimum the losses
wbicb may resuit from such boans.
Hon. Mr. NIýCOL: I do not want ta discuss
the merits of the bill, but I should like the
minister ta ascertain wbether or not the banks
were consuited before the bill was drafted.
The difficulties that were disclosed when the
Home Improvement Act was put into operatien could bave been avoided had the boan and
trust companies and the banks been consulted
beforehand. I think that before this measure
is enacted the banks should be consulted as ta
bow the proposais will work out in practice.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The honourable leader
opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) spoke about safe-

584

SENATE

guarding the working out of this proposed
legislation. J think we shall have an ample
safeguard against losses in the fact that the
loans will be made by men qualified by long
experience in this class of business. In the event
of a loan becoming a total loss the bank will
get its money back, because the fifteen per
cent guarantee is figured on the aggregate
loans. There is nothing new about this type
of legislation. I recall that in other sessions
bills were enacted to provide loans to fishermen and others who wanted to engage in
various industries.
The danger is that easy money at this time
might bring uneconomic or other unhealthy
forces into industry. We are making the loans
to returned men, whom we especially want to
help re-establish. Under the circumstances we
must accept the risk and .proceed along unorthodox lines. I believe the provisions of the
bill will make for progress and stability. The
banks will do as they have done before. They
have an abundance of money and will welcome
the loans, for, as the honourable leader has
said, they carry the guarantee of the Dominion
of Canada.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on

VETERANS REHABILITATION BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. WISHART McL. ROBERTSON moved the second reading of Bill 333, an Act to
amend the Veterans Rehabilitation Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill provides that the government may advance
money to universities for the making of loans
to student veterans, under regulations to be
established for that purpose. The loans shall
not exceed $500 per year or a total of $2,000
during the whole course.
Veterans approved for vocational training
but who through lack of facilities or the necessity of conforming to entrance dates are delayed in entering upon that training may
receive out-of-work benefits while waiting, and
the period during which they receive such
benefits shall not count against the time for
which other benefits are available under the
act. The minister is given power under certain
circumstances to make regulations providing
Hon. Mr. KINLEY.

for the extension of university training beyond
the period equivalent to the veteran's period
of service. Veterans who are receiving educational and vocational benefits shall not be
eligible for benefits under the Veterans' Land
Act. with certain exceptions in the case of
agricultural training.
Disabled pensioners who require re-training
on account of their disabilities may obtain it
without adjustment of their re-establishment
credit.
Cut-off dates for accumulation of
benefits respecting veterans who serve in the
interim or permanent forces are made the
same as those under the War Service Grants
Act.
Compensation is made available to
veterans who are injured while in receipt of
vocational training.
The estimated annual cost of this new legislation is uncertain, but it will be relatively
small. Past experience of universities indicates that the number of students who are
likely te default on loans is not large, and
the number of veterans who are awaiting the
commencement of vocational training courses
and cannot get work is small.
These are the main financial commitments
embodied in the bill.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: Do I correctly understand that the loans are to be $500 per year?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They may be
$500 a year or $2,000 during the whole course.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: And the students are to
repay them?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR:
student?

That is for each

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, within those
figures.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:. Honourable senators,
I am wondering whether with a bill of this
kind there should not be some special provision to ensure that the students seeking
loans are advised for what course they are
best fitted.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, the officials who appear before the committee will no doubt be able to answer such
questions much more fully than I can. My
information is that the department has gone
into the matter very fully and has endeavoured
to advise prospective students as to the courses
which they should choose. As honourable
senatois know, this is a matter that requires

AUGUST 12, 1946-58
the greatest tact and judgment. From personal
experience in that connection-not entirelY
with members of my family, but with others
-I know a great deal is being done to advise
students as to the field in which they are most
likely to succeed.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on

WAR SERVICE GRANTS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON
moved the second reading of Bill 334, an Act
to amend the War Service Grants Act, 1944.
H1e said: Honourable senators, this bill provides that the supplementary gratuity of a
veteran who reverts to a lower rank on joining
the permanent force shahl be calculated on the
basis of the higher rank formerly held by him.
Cut-oif dates are fixed for the accumulating
of gratuity and credits under the act. By this
bill the widow or the dependent mother of a
veteran who dîed without having received ahl
of has re-establishment credit, may receive the
balance to whjch the veteran was entitled at
the time hie died. The bill extends the purposes for which credit may be used, so, as to
enable the veteran more readily to take
advantage of benefits under the National
Housing Act.
The number of persons eligible for the
benefits provided by the bill are few. It is
expected, therefore, that the annual cost of
this legislation will not be large.
Hon. Mr. HAIG- Honourable senators, I
should like at this time, on behaîf of the house
to convey our thanks to the honourable leader
of the government for the very careful statement hie has given us concerning each of these
bills dealing with veterans. I took the liberty
the other day of asking himi to prepare such a
stateinent. In the other house there was talk
of an expenditure of 81,500,000,000 resulting
from these bills, but no clear details of the
cost. To me the cost is very important.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

REFERRED

TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.
H1e said: Honourable senators. before this
motion is carried I should like, for the information of the house, to give a summary of the
total expenditure involved by these bis and
the acts they amend. My remarks will of
course appear in Hansard, but I shall supply
typewritten copies of the information to the
members of the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Much confusion lias existed concerning the
over-ail cost of veterans rehabilitation. The
various classes of legislation which are concerned with rehabilitation of veterans and
related problems are as follows: (1) The
rehabilitation programme proper; (2) The
Veterans' Land, Act; (3) The War Veterans'
Allowance Act; (4) The Pension Act.
Honourable senators wilI understand, that
reference to the first classification does not
necessarily refer to the other three. An
attempt lias been made by the Department of
Veterans Affairs to estimate the present and
future eosts of ail legisiation relating to veterans. In most cases the estimated costs cover
the next six years; in other instances the period
is longer or shorter, depending on the nature
of the legislation. It is interesting to no-te that
the main estimates for the Department of
Veterans Affaira for 'the year 1946-47 amount
to $f9l,600,000, and the supplementary estimates to approximately $176,000,000--a total for
the fiscal year 1946-47 cf U869,600,000. These
estimnates include additional. costs resulting
from buis now beîng considered hy parliament.
The total amount covers ail phases of rehabilitation and allied legislation.
The total estimated cost for the rehahili'tation programme of Wurld War II, over a sixyear period covering 194445 to 1949-50G inclusive, but exclusive of veterans' land expenditures and veterans' allowance, is approximately
$1,500,000,000. 1 have here a schedule, which
I shaîl neot read, showing the breakdown of the
figures generally referred to as a billion and a
hall dollars.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Will the honourable
gentleman put that sehedule on Hansard?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I shaîl be pleased
to do so.

It is estimated further that the

pensions it is $37,000,000. The amount this
year la practiically the same for veterans of
World War Il as for those of World War I.
'More than one million .Canadians en'listed in
World War Il1, as comp>ared with 628,000 in
World War 1. Unless there is some change in
the present legisiation the pensions bill for
World War II should reacli a peak in the next
five or six years, and because of the larger
number of enlist'ments in the lait war it is
cxpected to be somewhere around $60,000,000
per yeur. Accord.ing to experience fthe peak
would probably r'emain statie for some time
and then there would be a graduai dieciease.

CANADA-MEXICO TRADE AGREEMENT
CANADA-COLOMBIA TRADE
AGREEMENT
RESOLUTIONS OF APPROVAL

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved:
Resolved that it is expedient that the Houses
of Parliament do approve the Trade Agreement
between Canada and Mexico signed at the City
of Mexico on February 8. 1946, and that this
house do approve the same.
He said: Honourable members, I have asked
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar) to explain the subject matter of
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

this resolution and the one immedately following. For the most part they are similar
in character.
Hon. THOMAS A. CRERAR: Honourable
senators, these two resolutions were considered
togetier in another place, and I would suggest that we also take them together.
The resolutions are for the approval of
trade agreements between Canada and Mexico,
and between Canada and Colombia. Broadly
speaking, the agreements provide that Canada
on the one side and Mexico-or Colombiaon the other, will each accord the other most
favoured nation trcatment in the matter of
their mutîual trade. During the past seven or
eight years similar agreements have been
entered into with other Central and South
American countries, namely, with Uruguay in
1937; with Guatamala and Haiti in 1938; with
the Dominican Republic in 1940, and with
Chile, Brazil and the Argentine in 1942.
The two agreements now before us are to
remain in effect for two years. They are then
to continue from year to year, subject to
termination on six months notice by either of
the parties to them.
The agreement with Mexico was signed on
Februarv 8, 1946, and came into effect provisionallv as of that date, pending of course
formal approval and ratification. The agreement wiîh Colombia was signed on February
20, 1946, and comes into effect thirty days
after the exchange of ratifications.
Mexico agrees to impose no discrimination
against Canadian products; and of course
there is a reciprocal undertaking on our part.
It touches taxation, sale and distribution or
use of imports in either country. Any tariff
reductions made by either Mexico or Canada
are automatically extended to the other country. It will bu observed that Canada, under
these agreements, gives the two countries concerned the benefit of its intermediate tariff.
As honourable senators know we have a general
tariff, an intermediate tariff, and what are
known as British preferential rates. Britain,
and countries subject to the British crown to
which the preferential rates apply, are not
affected in any way by these agreements, and
Canada still bas complete liberty to increase,
extend or limit preferential rates.
Provision is made that nothing in the way
of quantitative restriction shall bu done by
Canada or either of the other parties to the
agreements without prior consultation with the

AUGUST 13, 1946
country affected. In other words, we agree
flot to apply any quota system. to imports
from. Mexico or Colombia until the matter
bas been discussed, and as to imports from
Canada those countries agree to a like
condition.
The trade between Canada and <Mexico
though nlot great in value is substantial. Our
total exporta to th-at country in '1945 amounted
to $8,165,058. The principal items of export
were newsprint, wood pulp, copper wire,
asbestos, bars of iron or steel, electrical
wheat, -machinery and, parts,
apparatus,
materials for ship repaira and several other
items. In that year 'Ganadta's importa from
Mexico amounted to, $13,508,165, represented
by the following items: sisal, istle and Tampico fibre, raw cotton, tomatoes, peanuts,
bananas, rubber, -glucose or grape sugar, boots
and ahoes, wax, both vegetable and mineral,
and fluorapar. The total annual trade between
Canada andi Mexico is therefore approximnately
$21,000,000.
Colombia, being a tropical country, has
about the saine exehange of products with
Canada as bas 'Mexico. In. 1945 we exported
to Colombia goods to the value of $5,010,701,
the principal items being wheat, wrapping
paper, newsprint, copper and 'brasa manufactures, flour, asbestos and its manufactures,
machinery and parts, oatmeal and other
smaller items. In the samne year our importa
from Colombia amounted to $11,678 076 and
consisted mainly of crude petroleum, coffee,
butter and casinghead gasoline.
Honourable senators will observe that Canada'a volume of trade witb these two countries is flot large; nevertbeless it is important.
The character of the trade is roughly the
exebange of products of a temperate zone for
those of a tropical zone, which is in accord
with the sound principle that trade naturally
I need
tends to move nortb and south.
scarcely remind the house that these trade
agreements are in keeping with the Liberal
policy of expanding and increasing international trade wherever possible. Looking to the
present and to the future, nothing is more
essential for Canadian prosperity than profitable markets for our producta. Thèse agreements t.ouch only a smaîl segment of our total
trade, but they are a move in the right dïrection. I am sure it is the wish of all honourable
mem'bers that the future trade between
Canada and thèse countries may increase and
grow to, the benefit of all concerned.
Tbe motion was agreed to.

Hon.,Mr. ROBERTSON moved:
Resolved that it is expedient that the Houses
of Parliament do approve the Trade Agreement
between Canada and Colombia signed at Bogota

FOREIGN EXCHANGE
MOTION FOR

SECOND

CONTROL BILL
READINO-DEBATE

ADJOURNED
On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 195, an Act respecting
the control of the acquisition snd disposition of
foreign eurrency and the control of transactions
involving foreign durrenc-y or nonresidents.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I have asked the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) to handle
this bill.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN moved the
second read'ing of tbe bill.
He said: Honourable senators this bill incorporates some of the main features of the
Foreign Exchange Control Order, which came
mnto force in September, 1939, by virtue of
an order in council made under the War
Measures Act; it also incorporates moat of
the provisions contained in the War Exchange
Fund Act, passed by parliament in lI35, and
provides for the repeal of that act. The War
Exchange Fund Act provided for the establishmnent by the Minýister of Finance of an
account which came to be known as the
Exchange Fund Account.
Authority was
gîven to the minister to make use of the
moneys in that account from time to time,
as and when lie deemed necessary for the
purpose of controlling fluctuations in our
monetary unit and to control the extemnal
value of our monetary unit, and the power
was exercised by him.

SENATE

In dealing with this measure I propose to
refer in a general way to the powers that it
confers, to call attention to some of the
variations between the bill and the present
law as enacted by order in council, and, then
to point out some of what I may describe as
the unusual or extraordinary features of the
bill. Following this I will express my own
opinion with respect to one or two matters,
since that is still a right that we have in this
chamberHon. Mr. CALDER: Hear, hear.
make brief
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: -and
reference to what lias been accomplished
during the war by the Foreign Exchange Control Board. I may say here that during the
war it became necessary for me to have professional relations with the board in a number
of instances, and it is my opinion, which I
think agrees with the general experience, that
the board functions efficiently. capably and
expeditiously in dealing with the commercial
and business problems presented to it for consideration. I am not saying that it has always
produced the result or answer that you sought,
but at least you got expeditious consideration
and disposition of the matter, something
whicb is very important to business people.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: And courteous con:ideration.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes, the board was
alvays the essence of courtesy.
Hon. Mr. McGEER:
of bankers.

That is always true

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do not think it is
confined to bankers; I find it even in this
chamber.
The scope of the bill is outlined in the
preamble. The bill purports to bc based on
the desirability of providing means for
achieving orderly exehange arrangements and
discharging the obligations of Canada as a
inember of the International Monetary Fund,
for maintaining a fund to aid in the control and
protection of the value of the Canadian
monetary unit in relation to foreign countries,
and for supervising and controlling transactions between residents of Canada and
non-residents. The reason put forward in
support of the control of transactions in
Canada between residents and non-residents
is that Canada must know at all times what
ber external liabilities and obligations are.
We are told that the main purpose of the
bill is to guard against what is ordinarily
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

called a flight of capital. I freely admit, and
it will be seen in a few moments, that the
provisions of the bill are much broader than
necessary for that purpose, and that if the
legislation were permitted to remain in effect
for ever it might conceivably be used for
purposes other than the control of the flight
of capital. However, that is what bas been
designed and avowed as the main purpose of
the bill. For instance, in relation to exports,
it is intended to make assurance doubly sure
that when goods are exported from Canada
an adequate consideration is received by
Canada. so thbat the transaction is not made
use of as a nedium for the export of capital.
Coming to the bill itself, one might ask:
What is exchange control? So far as Canada
is concerned, excbange control is simply a
nethod by which the government takes power
to fix the rate of exchange. It agrees to buy
and sell foreign exchange, and the bill gives it
exclusive rights in that field.
As to the necessity for the bill we are told,
as I think we can appreciate in these times,
that there are few if any stable currencies in
the world today, and that in these circumstances Canada must safeguard the external
value of its monetary unit. The bill is put
forward as part of the government policy for the
purpose of assu.ring a stability in these uncertain days of international currency and trade
relations, so that at all times Canada will be
able to know approxiiately what lier international liabilities are.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Would the honourable
senator permit a question?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Would he explain why
this bill is necessary, in view of the fact that
xve bave put up $300,000,000 as our share under
the Bretton Woods proposals for the International Monetary Fund? I thought that
fund was the stabilizing force for Canadian
and aIll other currencies.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do not pose as an
economist, but I will try to answer the question as I see it. The International Monetary
Fund was designed as part of the Bretton
Woods agreement to bring about a stabilization of international currency. The agreement
provided that each member of the fund was to
make a contribution in gold and in the currency of the country at a certain valuation, to
assure that the fund would have the moneys to
provide the necessary clearances as between
Canada, for instance, and seme other country.
In the event that the other country made
default and was not able to meet all its requirements to Canada, the fund would stand

AUGUST 13, 1946
there. But as I have digested the matter there
seems to be this difference. The nations who
subscribed to the agreement to establish the
International Monetary Fund undertook not
to impose ýrestrictions in respect -of current
obligations. There is a provision in the agreement that without the approval of the other
member-nations, and on satisfying certain conditions therein set out, a member-nation may
vary its exchange up or down without being
limited to ten per centHon. Mr. MeGEER: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: -but if it desires to
do more than that the consent of the other
member-nations must be obtained. That, as I
have said. is for the purpose of meeting current
obligations. If my honourable friend will be
patient I shall endeavour to point out as I
proceed that this bill is designed to deal
mainly with the export of capital, and is not
intended to interfere with the orderly payment
of the obligations of Canana arismg as tue

result of its international transactions.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: What does the
honourable gentleman mean by "capital"?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If, for instance, some
person in Canada wants to get his assets out

of the country, we have to concede as a
matter of policy-that, first of all, the government should be in a position to say whether

or not he may remove them; and, secondly,
the extent to which this may be permitted.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Do you mean his
securities?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: His securities-any
property or assets he may have that may be
capable of being moved out of the country.
To me there is a difference between meeting
our current obligation and the export of
private capital.
Rightly or wrongly, during the period of the
war the government's policy was, so far as
private capital is concerned-and it is proposed to continue it under this bill-to control
such capital and, if necessary, prohibit its
export.
As I pointed out a few minutes ago, a person
might engage in the export of a certain
product, and under some arrangement receive
therefor a grossly inadequate consideration,
or no payment at all, as a result of which an
asset would be lost to Canada with no compensating element coming back here.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: But the bill is by
no means confined to that proposition.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If my honourable
friend had been listening to me a few minutes
ago he would be aware that I made a similar
63268-39

591

submission in slightly different language. I
said that while this is the avowed purpose
of the bill, its provisions are much broaderas I am going to point out. It will be for the
Senate to say whether we are prepared to
accept the broader terms of the bill, and under
what conditions. But my duty and function is
discharged if I give what I hope may be an
adequate explanation of the provisions of the
measure.
The Foreign Exchange Control Board consists of six persons. They are not named;
they are persons who from time to time hold
certain offices. For instance, you have the
Minister of Finance, the Under Secretary of
State for External Affairs, the Deputy Minister of Trade and Commerce, the Director of
Operations of the Post Office Department,
and the Deputy Minister of National Revenue
for Customs and Excise. Originally the bill
provi«dd that the Deputy Postmaster General
should be a member of the board, but by
amendment the Director of Operations of the
Post Office Department was substituted.
Since all six persons are incumbents of various
public offices, they are to serve without
remuneration. There is provision for the
appointment of alternate members, with the
approval of the Minister of Finance. Then
there is a flexible provision for meetings of the
board.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Is there no provision
for anybody but public officials to serve on
the board-no representatives of industry or
trade or commerce?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. The membership
of the Foreign Exchange Control Board is to
consist of persons who from time to time are
incumbents of the various offices mentioned.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: All of whom are
officials of the governiment.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is right. Then
it is provided that the Bank of Canada shall
act without charge as technical adviser and
agent of the board, shall deal in foreign
exchange on behalf of the board, and shall
provide "such officers, clerks and employees,
premises and office supplies and equipment as
may be required" at the cost of the bank.
Further, by section 13, the costs of administration are to be provided by parliamentthat is, out of unappropriated moneys in the
Consolidated Revenue Fund. This is where
some control seems to be given to parliament.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I notice that the Auditor General has to report to the House of
Commons.

EVISED EDITION

SENATE
Hon. Mz. HAYDEN: I will deal with that
in a moment, if my friend will permit me to
proceed in definite order.
Under Section 17 remuneration for the
functions of the board that are performed by
authorized dealers-that is, banks-is to be
paid out of the Exchange Fund Account. That
is the only money to be so paid. The costs of
administration, other than for the services and
premises iprovided by the Bank of Canada, are
to be voted by parliamient. This means that
the estimates for 'this expenditure will have to
come before parliament and will afford members full opportunity to obtain information
on the operations of the board.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: What are the payments to the authorized dealers?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The authorized dealers
are agents of the Foreign Exchange Control
Board in the buying and selling of foreign
exchange.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Really the banks.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes. Invoices and
clearance papers for imports are furnished to
the bank, which iprovides them for the Foreign
Exchange Control Board, and then if payment
bas to bo made ahcad of the actual import of
the goods it is the function of the bank, as the
authorizrd dealer of the board, to sec that the
goods paid for actually corne in.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Does this bill make any
change in the present practice in that regard?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No.
Section 10 deals witi

the consitution and

administration of the Forcign Exchange Control Board. Undir thaï section tlic board bas
two fonctions. The section reads:

Act.
The other is:
iaie. exercise aifd perforn the rights,
-to
powers, duties and fuictiois conferrced on it by
this act.
Adverting to an explanation I gave a
moment ago, I may say that the second power
brings in the function heretofore exercised by
virtue of the Foreign Exchange Control Order.
The first function of the board, which is to
manage and operate the Exchange Fund
Account, is incorporated in this bill. By secHon. Mr. BENCH.

tion 5 of the bill the Exchange Fund Account,
which was originally set up in 1935, shall be
continued, and the minister is given powers
to operate that account for the purpose of
stabilizing exchange and the external value of
our exchange. Limitations are prescribed
within which he may from time to time, with
the money in that fund, buy or invest in
foreign and domestie securities. The limitations are all set out in section 5.
Section 10 of the bill provides for two of
the powers of the board. I propose to deal
in the main with powers formerly exercised
by the board under the Foreign Exchange
Control Board order, and I have no hesitation
in saying that those powers are very, very
broad. They relate to any export or import
of goods or property, to any dealings in Canadian currency as between a resident and nonresident, to any dealings in securities as
between a resident and a non-resident, and to
any dealings with regard to the provision of
services on a remunerative basis as between
a resident and a non-resident. The bill
requires that no person shall do such things
or perform such services, except in accordance
witi a permit from the board. Broadly speaking, that is the effect of a nunber of the sections of the bill, and I do not propose going
into thein in detail. Were it not for some
limitations in other sections. even with the
record of administration of the present board
one niiglt find difficulty in accepting such
broad provisions.
Honourable senators will observe that sections 25 and 26 deal with exports and imports.
Section 25 reads:
No persion shall, except in accordan with a
pernit, (a) exporit any property froii Caiada;
Section 26 similarly reads:
No person shahl. except in accoridancie witl
a periiit (a)

iiiport any property iiito Caiiada;

Paragraphs (b) of sections 25 and 26 place
limitations upon a resident in the importing or
exporting of goods. Section 26 (1) reads:
No person shall, except in accoidance witih
a permit,
(b) beiiig a iesident. eithier in Canada or elsewliere purchase or agree to piirchase froi a

connîîec-

Let us consider paragraph (b) for a moment.
The limitations are in respect of fair value,
which is to be determined by the board, and
the currency designated by the board. Subsections (2) of sections 25 and 26 provide that
if the importer or exporter meets those two

AUGUST 13, 1946
requirements, the issue of a permit is automatic. The board may not in those circumstances refuse a permit.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: But the board has the
right to determine what is fair value?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I had so stated, and
I will come to that matter in a moment and
enlarge upon it.
The present practice of the board is to
designate two sets of currencies. For the nonsterling area the US. dollar, or any currency
convertible into U.S. dollars, is designated;
for the sterling area we have sterling or Canadian funds. So if an exporter or importer
indicates that the currency to be used at the
other end of the transaction is one approved
by the board, he has satisfied that requirement, and if lie is able to satisfy the requirement as to fair value, the board has no
authority for refusing a permit.
The power of determining the fair value
seems to me to be a very broad power to give
to a board, especially when it relates not only
to imports and exports, but to services. Under
that power the board in fact becomes a taxing
officer in respect of professional services which
may have been rendered a non-resident client,
by a resident lawyer, or by a resident doctor
or engneer.
Frankly, I was shocked when I first read that
provision. One shudders to think that in
rendering an account to a non-resident client
without first having consulted the Foreign
Exchange Control Board as to what the fee
should be, one may be committing a violation
of the law should some member of the board
think the bill was not as big as it should have
been. If honourable members will permit a
touch of humour, I would say that if the
lawyers could be assured that the board would
look with a generous eye on bills, and scale
then upwards, there might be no opposition
from the professional point of view.
There is a right of appeal to the Exchequer
Court from any determination of fair value by
the board. That procedure may not be as
expeditious as one would wish in the carrying
on of commercial transactions; but there is
that salutory check upon the possible arbitrary
exercise of powers by the board.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Before the honourable
senator leaves that point, may I ask him if in
the Customs Department we have not got a
board of appraisers and valuators who are
thoroughly competent to estimate the value
of goods to be imported?
Hon. iMr. HAYDEN: I was about to refer
to that situation. I find that, by statute at
least, the Customs Department has had authority over a long period of time, to determine
63268-39à

593

the fair market value of goods for the purpose,
of applying the customs duty, and also thepower to disregard the value put upon goods
as expressed in the currency of a particular
country and to fix a value in terms of Canadian currency on certain imports which seek
entry into Canada. We have in the Customs
Department the machinery for appraising and
determining those things.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Is there any appeal from
that determination?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Under this bill there
is an appeal to the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: What about an appeal
under the Customs Act?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The proced.ure would
be an appeal to the minister, which I should
think would be final.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Why duplicate it in
this act?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: First of all, I assume
that if fair value is to be the one determining
factor, there has to be provision to make it
a determining factor. I am informed that
during the period of the war the power of
determining fair value under the Foreign
Exchange Control Board operation was largely
in the hands of the Customs Department, as
agents. The Customs officials are agents of
the board and their determination is accepted.
Only in rare instances, when some warning
or intimation had been received that an effort
was being made to evade or defeat the provisions of the order, would the attention of
the board be specifically directed to a case.
May I answer my friend's question by saying
that when we dealt with the Combines Investigation Bill recently I raised the same question as to why there should bc a duplication
in the Combines Investigation Act of the
power contained in the Patent Act.
My
honourable friend saw no difficulty in it, and
as a matter of fact voted against the position
that I was taking.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The position is very,
very different here. That was not a precedent.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If I may quote my
honourable friend against himself, I would
cite that as a precedent, for whatever value
it may have in this argument.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Perhaps I am anticipating what my honourable friend is going
to say, but may I ask him if lie can clear up
a point that has occurred te me? I understood him te say a few moments ago that the
bill of a Canadian lawyer for services rendered
to a United States resident would be subject
to approval or disapproval of the board.

SENATE

lion,

Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.

Hon. Mr. EULER: What would happen if
'the situation were reversed and a United
States lawyer submitted a bill for services
rendered to a Canadian citizen? Would that
also be subjeet to ,approval or disapproval?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes. As an example,
I put this to the board. Suppose I got a
travel permit and went to the United States,
and while there required treatment by an
Amorican doctor, who insisted on being paid
promptly. I said to the board: "If I paid
him, I would possibly be infringing the principles of this bill, because his charge might be
higber ýthan the board would consider fair.
The provisions of the bill in relation to services
are so broad that in such circumstances I
would-in theory, at least-be guilty of a
violation of the law."
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Under this bill you
would be guilty. There is no theory about it.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: On a strict interpretation of the provisions of that section relating
to services I should be guilty of an offence if
it were afterwards determined that the amount
of the bill that I paid was greater than the fair
value of the services as ultimately determined
by the Exchequer Court of Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Would you have to ask
permission of the board to pay the bill before
you paid it?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. In such circumstances I would, pay the bill.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: You must have a
permit before you can pay.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: In the ordlinary case,
having got a permit for travel, I do not suppose an unexpected ýillness would be regarded
as one of the incidental purposes covered by
my application for foreign exchange; but I
think a very good argument could be made out.
It may be that in such circumstances a person
would commit a violation of the law. Well,
I am presenting and exposing the provisions of
the bill for ithe considieration of the Senate.
I am not attempting to argue with my honourable friend that the section needs to be as
.broad as it is.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: In the example given,
my honourable friend would be committing
an offence against section 25 (1) (a) by exporting, without a permit from the board, the suit
that he wore to the United States.
lon. Mr. MeGEER: Of course ho would.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do not mind answering questions, but I want to get through without taking up too much time.
Hon. Mr. EULER.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: This is going to bind
the people of Canada for ever; make no
mistake about that.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I would prefer not to
have my explanation interrupted by statements. Honourable members who wish to
make statements may do so after I have
finished. I have dealt with the permit requirements, and the fair value of property, services
and so on.

There is a provision for appeal from the
board's decision in other matters. The explanation offered is that in exercising their functions in connection with those other matters
the authorized dealer and the board are
attempting to interpret government policy
within the limits of the bill, and that in so
doing they exercise discretionary powers, for
which the minister should be finally responsible. We have already had some discussions
here on the question of discretionary powers,
and my views on that question are too well
known to make it necessary for me to say
anything about them at this time.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Would the board have
power to make regulations modifying to some
extent the provisions of the act itself?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. The board has
power to make regulations for carrying into
effect the provisions of the act. In making
regolations it could not go beyond the authority which is given to it under the act.
Hon. Mc. MeGEER: Under section 35 the
board could go all the way.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am simply expressing my own opinion. If my honourable friend
had paid attention to my statement he would
know that I said the board's power to make
regulations is limited by the authority which
it receives from the statute. Section 35 sets
out the powers of the board to make regulations; and certainly these are blanket powers,
as broad as they possibly could be. For
instance, the board can say with respect to
any person or class of persons, or any transaction or class of transactions, whether or not
the provisions of the statute shall apply. You
that.
sthan
could not ask for anything broader
May I be allowed to make an observation
right here? Frankly I would prefer to have a
statute of this kind flexible rather than inflexible, even though in enacting a flexible statute
we confer a lot of discretionary powers upon
a board that is, as in the present case, a board
that the elected chamber and the Senate cannot get at directly and easily. I think that
when a statute in its operation enters into
the daily business life of the people so much

AUGUST 13, 1946
AUGUST 13, 1946
as this one does, a flexible statute which permits some give and take is better than a rigid
one. However, that is just my own opinion,
for what it may be worth.
I have already pointed out that the regulations cannot become effective until approved
by the Governor in Council and published in
the Canada Gazette.
I should like to call particular attention to
section 34, which I wil deal with later as one
of the sections conferring extraordinary powers
upon the board. Under that section, if a
resident bas an interest in a company,
partnership or busines outside of Canada, the
board can ask him to do everything within
his power to see to it that that foreign
entity makes payment of any dividends,
income, revenue or earnings of the company
to which he may be entitled. That looks like
a pretty broad power. At the outset it
struck me that that section, to the extent to
which it empowers the board to say to a
resident who is a director of a foreign cornpany, "You must see that the company
takes steps to pay dividends." is an interference with the discretion of a board of
directors to decide when dividends shall be
paid and when they shall be permitted to
accumulate in the earned surplus of the conpany. But in actual fact, if the company had
a number of directors the Canadian resident
could not by himself do much to carry out
any order issued by the board. So in practice
the section is perhaps much less ominous than
it may seem to be.
Section 36, administration section, empowers the board to determine not only the
fair value of property, services and so on, but
whether for the purpose of the statute any
person is a resident or non-resident, and the
time at which the change of status became
effective. That is, it can determine for the
purposes of the statute whether or not-and if
so, when-a person who was formerly a resident.has become a non-resident. There is no
provision whereby any person who is out of
the country. and is granted a change of
status from a resident to a non-resident, may
receive as of right any part of the assets he
bas in Canada.
As a matter of practice,
where the board bas granted such a change
of status, it bas been very generous in permitting the non-resident to draw out his
Canadian bank account and also to take out
any securities that he may have had in this
country; but that bas been done by permission in each case and not as a matter of right.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: In my honourable
friend's example of a Canadian who goes on
a trip to the United States and while there

becomes liable for medical fees, would the
board have the power to decide that for the
purposes of that transaction the Canadian
was a resident of the United States?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. The persons subject to the provisions of this law are those
who for the purposes of the statute are
regarded as residents of Canada. A person
may be an American citizen and yet a resident
of Canada. A man who was ordinarily living
in Canada and carrying on his business operations here on the 15th of September, 1939,
and had been classified as a resident, would
remain in that classification until such time
as the board granted a change of status. If
in the meantime he left Canada and took
the necessary steps to become a citizen of
the United States, for instance, it would be
incumbent upon him to obtain from the
Foreign Exchange Control Board a determination of change of status. Otherwise, even
though for citizenship purposes, and possibly
even for income tax purposes, he was an
American citizen, he would still be regarded
under this statute as a resident of Canada.
In dealing with the enforcement sections,
commencing with section 40, J can speak witli
something akin to glee. Honourable members;
who were at some of our committee meetings
last session will remember how I raised my
voice against certain bills which contained sections depriving citizens of Canada of all their
ordinary rights. For instance, in one bill it
was provided that a person could be apprehended at any time, detained, refused counsel
and examined, and that the evidence he would
give later on could be used against him in
criminal proceedings. I thought that was not'
right; that the power to treat a Canadian
citizen in that way should not be continued
into peacetime. I find that the principle for
which I contended bas been observed in the
enforcement sections of this bill. I am not
saying that any heed was paid to what I
said. The point is that the principle has
been recognized, and I think that may be
a sign that we have made a start along the
road back to the ordinary way of looking at
the rights of citizens in our country.
Under this bill, while any person may be
required to appear before the board or an
inspector authorized to conduct an inquiry,
and be compelled to answer questions, he
will be given the protection of the Canada
Evidence Act with respect to any answers
he may make, and which otherwise might have
tended to incriminate him. When the bill
was up for second reading in another place
a change was made in the provision respecting
counsel for a person required to attend at an
inquiry. The bill as it originally stood

the inquiry if a charge hiad already been laid
against him, but except at the discretion of
the examining officer hie was flot allowed
ccîinsel on any exarnination that preceded the

an inquiry is entitled to he represented by

that our gold reserve is not back of our

In other words,
we have our gold as security behind our international obligations in the Exchange Fund
Account, but no gold in the Bank of 'Canada
as security behind our domestic currency.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Did we not have that
clause in the Gold Clauses Act of 1937?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
have had it since 1935.

I do not think we

Hon. Mr. McGEER: I think it was 1937.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Possibly that is so.
You would know more about it than I do.
Section 72 continues the Foreign Exchange
Control Board, so there shall be no gap
between the functions of the board under the
order in council and its functions under this
bill. Similarly, the regulations are also continued.
Finally, you have provision for the repeal
of the Exchange Fund Act.
Broadly speaking, I have touched on most
of the features of the bill except those having
to do with reports. These are really three in
number. Section 7 empowers the minister to
make advances to the Exchange Fund Account
out of unappropriated moneys in the Consolidated Revenue Fund on such terms and
conditions as the Governor in Council may
prescribe. Subsection 2 of this section requires
the minister to report to parliament within
thirty days after the thirty-first day of March
each year, or, if parliament is not thon sitting,
within thirty days after the commencement
of the next ensuing session, the amount of
:advances to the Exchange Fund Account outstanding on the last day of the preceding
calendar year. In the other place an amendment was added providing that if parliament
is not sitting at the time the minister is
required to make this report it shall be published in the Canada Gazette. Of course, in
the next ensuing session the report must be
made to parliament.
Under section 9 you find that the provisions
of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act,
1931, shall not apply to this Exchange Fund
Account; but it is provided that the Auditor
General shall make an annual audit "in such
manner as he thinks proper with a view to
ascertaining whether the transactions in connection with the account have been in accordance with the provisions of the act and he shall
certify to the House of Commons" whether or
not the records of the account truly show the
transactions. I have not been able to appre-

ciate why the Auditor General should certify
to the House of Commons. Surely, he should
certify to parliament. Yet I find a similar
provision is contained in Section 9 of the War
Exchange Fund Act, which was passed by
parliament in 1935. But I am still curious and
interested to know why in respect of the
operations of this Exchange Fund Account,
which is just as important to this house as it
is to the other, the certificate of the Auditor
General should be directed to the House of
Commons only.
The other report is under section 39. The
bill as originally drawn provided that the
-annual report of the operations of the
Exchange Fund Account should be submitted
to the minister within six months after the
thirty-first day of December each year. By
amendment in the other house that was
changed to five months. A further amendment was added to subsection 2, providing
that in any event the report must be published
in the Canada Gazette.
I might point out that any accretions to the
fund-that is earnings or interest credited to
the account in 1946 and succeeding yearsshall at the end of each year be paid into the
Consolidated Revenue Fund.
That takes me in a general way, and perhaps
in a very inadequate fashion, over the provisions of the bill. If I may still have your attention and not be regarded as trespassing too
much upon your timeHon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: -I
should like to
direct your attention by way of recapitulation to what I regard as some of the extraordinary features in the bill.
Section 43, which makes available any
information obtained under the Income War
Tax Act, is a serious departure from the
principle that such information shall be
regarded as secret. I find a similar departure
was made during the war years by virtue of an
order in council.
It is for this house to say whether information concerning private business dealings, as
disclosed in returns made to the Income Tax
Department, should remain secret or should be
made available to this board. It may be
thought that it should be made available. I do
not know. I have my own views on it.
Then I think the fair value section is extraordinary. It is for this body to determine
whether in the circumstances, by providing the
safeguard of an appeal to the Exchequer
Court, any arbitrary exercise of the power of
determining fair value will be effectively controlled. In that connection I think we should
keep in mind the fact that fair values are

SENATE
determined all the time by our customs
officials for the purpose of entry of goods in'to
Canada. So in the provision itself there is
nothing unusual. Everything in relation to
these foreign transactions is, I submit, unusual,
but it may be that the bill takes care of any
possible misuse of power.
I think the provisions of section 52, whereby
a person who leaves Canada to avoid answering questions which some inspector of the
Foreign Exchange Control Board might want
to ask bas his property impounded while he
is put through bankruptcy, so that he does
not get possession of it until he complies with
the statutory requirements, is at least an
extraordinary and unusual power. Whether
it is necessary or not is for us to say.
Section 71 of the bill, which amends the
Bank of Canada Act by suspending one of
its provisions, is an unusual way of attacking
property. We may decide in the circumstances that it is quite proper to do this,
but I must direct the attention of honourable senators to this unusual provision.
Section 34, by which the board can reach
out through the medium of a resident who
is a director or an official of a foreign corporation and attempt to force the payment
of dividends or other income to Canadian
residents who are partners or shareholders in
the corporation, is a bit novel and unusual,
and it is for us to decide whether the ramifications of the Foreign Exchange Control
Order go that far.
I bad intended to tell honourable members
about the ways in which the bill cuts down
some of the broader powers exercised by the
board under the order in council; however,
I do not think it is necessarv for the understanding of this bill that I do so.
Some question bas been raised about the
dollar parity as it relates to the operations
of the Foreign Exchange Control Board, and
the loss which it is suggested the board
incurred by the recent governmental action
of restoring our currency to a parity with the
li.S. dollar. If honourable senators are interested in that question, I can supply sone
information which shows that there was a
substantial loss by the reason of the revaluation of the gold and currency in the Exchange
Fund Account. The total loss, having regard
to the position of the Exchange Fund Account
at December 31, 1945, would amount to about
$140,000,000.
As against that I must point
out that in 1935, when the Exchange Fund
Account was established, the gold beld by
the Bank of Canada was revalued upwards
from $20.67 per ounce to $35, and there was
a profit on the transaction of 83 or 85 million
dollars, which started this account.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

It was not in exist-

Hon. Mr. McGEER: I do not see why the

Hon. Mr. HORNER: Did that not happen

established?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

It happened in 1935.

Hon. Mr. MeGEER: And bas nothing to
do with the board.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The original Exchange
Fund Account, in which the loss recently
occurred by reason of the revaluation, carne
into being and got its first financial resources
as a result of the rating up of gold in 1935
from $20.67 to $35. That increase in the
value of gold gave the account some 83 or
85 million dollars with which to commence
operations.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: While the honourable
senator is on that point, would he please
explain why this billion dollars in American
currency was not invested in sound securities
on the other side. instead of being held idle
here?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I cannot answer my
bonourable friend's question. After all, I am
just a senator, as be is, and have no control
over the investment policy of the Foreign
Exchange Control Board.
Hon. 'Mr. McGEER: You are speaking for
the board.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The other item which
I suggest should be considered is that the
Foreign Exchange Control Board had a reserve
representing the surplus of revenue over
expenditures since December 1939, when it
started operations. That reserve arnounted: to
49-3 million dollars. If we add the profit on
the revaluation of gold in 1935 to the reserve
representing the surplus in revenue over operating costs for the period during which the
board has been in operation, we will get a
total of about 133 million dollars. In one fell
swoop, on a certain Friday not so long ago
when the dollar parity was restored as between
Canada and the United States, thus necessitating the revaluation of gold and foreign currency
in the Exchange Fund Account, that reserve
was wiped out by a loss of 140 million dollars.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Before my
friend leaves that point, may I

of foreign exchange control? It would seem
that the prevailing custon in legislation is to
attempt to take as broad powers as possible,
no matter what the purpose in mind. The bill
therefore asks that the board be empowered to
do the things it is now doing, and much more.
It would permit of a situation, if one can
envisage it, in which there might be some
misuse or misapplication of the powers at
some future date. If we were disposed legislatively to carry on business and, trade relations on a different economie basis, the
machine we are creating and; setting up is more
than ample to meet the needs. Yet, as I sec it,
there is positive difficulty in trying to confer
the actual powers that are necessary to do
the job at this time.
My position is that inherently I am opposed
to the giving of broad powers. I believe that
the paramount consideration is to have a flexible statute, so that transactions can be dealt
with on a day-to-day basis. Our currency
changes from day ta day; our policy of today
may net be our policy of tomorrow. In the
interests of securing a good and flexible statute
I do not quarrel with the broad powers that
are sought; but I do point out that there is a
real danger of writing into the statutes something which will perpetuate for ail time a form
of machinery which may be put to a use never
contemplated by those who approve of the
bill. Its purpose is to tide us over a period
when international relations are unstab!e. It
is net intended to be, and should not be, a
permanent part of our economy. I do net wish
to eut off the exercise of these powers at any
definite date, but I believe there should be
seme limit to the period of operation. I want
to be sure that parliament-the other house
and the Senate-will have an opportunity of
reviewing the whole situation at some time in
the future in the light of the information then
available, and of saying to the board: "We
think you need these powers for a longer time
and we are prepared to give them to you," or
"It

is our opinion that you do not need these

powers; they are interfering with the orderly
conduct of international relations and domestic business and should net be continued." If
we enact the broad powers in this bill and
place no time limit upon them, we shal1 have
parted indefinitely with our right to review
them. a right whieh parliament could get back
only by majority action of both houses.
Regardless of how strongly we in the Senate
might then feel about the powers exercised by
the board, we could do nothing by ourselves.
We are going into a future whose economie
aspects are more or less uncharted. The international field in particular bas all sorts of
Hon. Mr. H tYDEN.

possibilities. Therefore, I think we should
have an unfettered right to review the whole
matter at a definite time in the future.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Does the honourable
gentleman suggest that this bill shoulýd be sent
to committee, -in order that we may be able to
question departmental officials?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If the bill is given
second reading, I will move that it be referred
to .the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. MeINTYRE: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? Suppose a
resident of Canada desires to move with his
assets to one of the states in the American
Union, and sells bis house and property here
for $8,000. He goes to his bank and is told
that the regulations of the Foreign Exchange
Control Board are still in effect, so le cannot
get more than $250 in American funds. If he
wishes to buy a property in the United States
he may get permission from the board to
transfer his Canadian funds to the state where
te intends te live. If that happens to be a
state where the discount on the Canadian
dollar is 4 per cent, he will lose $320 on his
88,000; and if it happens to b one where the
discount is 10 per cent, his loss will be $800.
Is there anything in the bill which woul'd
authorize the Foreign Exchange Control Board
in a case like that to sell American funds at a
premium of one-half of one per cent?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The Foreign Exchange
Control Board bas power to grant a permit
for the expert of Canadian currency and securities, and for the conversion of Canadian
funds into United States dollars. But in each
particular case the board bas to decide whether
or not it should (a) grant a right to expert
Canadian dollars and (b) convert Canadian
currency into United States dollars and grant
an export permit for them. The consideration
whieh it gives to the case must be, first, in the
light of the over-all position of Canada, because the main purpose is to prevent the flight
of capital from Canada, so as to maintain the
external value of Canada's monetary unit.
I eau tell my honourable friend that whexre
a resident of Canada bas changed his status
and bas been recognized, by the board as a
non-resident, the board bas followed a generous policy in permitting the person concerned
to remove his Canadian bank balance by a
draft through a United States bank. But, as
I see it, in the case mentioned by my- honourable friend there is no reason why the Foreign
Exchange Control Board, which represents
the people of Canada. should give the man
more than he has. What he lias in his bank
account is Canadian dollars, and I cannot

bill is in effect in the United States. In relation to the rest of the world our position is
comparable to that of the United States, as
Canada too is now a creditor country, and, our
ambitions-our professed ambitions, at any
rate-are to export capital and as far as posible stimulate world trade. In view of that
fact and what was said by the honourable
senator as to the United Kingdom and the
countries that are tied to ber on a sterling
basis, I think analysis will show that the powers
of this board are intended to apply to relations
between Canada and the United States, and
they may possibly be applied in such a way
as not to work out for the enlightened development of Canada.
Hon. G. G. McGEER: Honourable senators,
at the outset I want to congratulate the bonourable senator who has explained this bill
(Hon. Mr. Hayden) for the very easy and
comfortable way in which be has carried
through so far. I was almost overwhelmed by
his delightful expression "unusual or extraordinary." Of all -the kindly expressions ever
used in the Senate to describe something
otherwise than as it should be described, this
should probably be regarded as marking the

alongside the United States, and I think the
honourable senator who last took his seat
(Hon. Mr. Lambert)' raised before us a. sign
of warning that we should carefully consider
when dealing with this bill. What would be

Canada and the United States? That I believe
is the most important item for our
consideration.

Hon. Mr. LAM'BERT: I did not want ýto group of men that are not responsible to the
electors of the land! I have no hesitation in
embarrass the honourable senator by asking the
question, which I do think is a very pertinent
saying that I am a firm believer in the just
and proper regulation of foreign exchange and
one. I know that nothing approaching this
63268-401

understand- why these should be converted
into United States dollars at a loss to Canada.
If the board wil. sell him all the United States
dollars that 'his Canadian funds will buy, the
question that then has to be determined is
-the over-all need of Canada for United
States dollars, and whether the national
account should be depleted in the interests of
an individual. The board has to bear in
mind that his application will not be the only
one of the kind, that there will be many of
them. I cannot interpret the policy of the
board; I can only attempt to state what has
been donc. In the past, when a resident has
had his status changed to that of a nonresident, the board has been generous in permitting the removal of the funds froma his
Canadian bank account to the United States,
and also the export of any securities that he
may own.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Is the honourable
senator in a position to say to what extent
similar powers have been granted in other
countries, particularly the United States which,
like Canada now, is a creditor country? Is
there any information which would enable us
to appreciate the position of the Foreign
Exchange Control Board as compared with
any such boards in other countries?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The discussion is
getting into a broad field, and one that I had
not contemplated. So far as the United
Kingdom is concerned, my honourable friend
knows as well .as I do that the foreign exchange restrictions there are much more
stringent than they have ever been in Canada,
even at the peak of our necessities.

foreign trade, but I have never come to the
conclusion that in order to reach that end
parliament must abdicate, that we must divest
the people of their freedom and vest in a
groip of men the extensive powers that this
bill contemplates.
I hesitate to believe that the Prime Minister
has ever seen or approved this measure, or
that it bas the sanction and approval of the
majority of the cabinet. You know, I had
something to do with creating public ownership of the Bank of Canada. I believed that
.once we owned the bank it would operate as
a publie utility. I am afraid that now the
Bank of Canada is almost the sarcophagus of
Canadian democracy.
Let u.s take a look at Section 11 of this
bill. Who arc to be the members of this
Foreign Exchange Control Board with all these
powers?

They are:

The Governor of the Bank of Canada.-Whoever he may be.
the Deputy Minister of Finance.Whoever he may be.
the Under Secretary cf State for ECxternal
Affairs. the Deputy Minister of Trade and Coimerce, the Director of Operations of the Post
Office Departmeint, and the Deputy Minister of
National Revenue for Cistoins and

xise.

Among the nin composing this group is there
anyone representing the industry of this
country? In flic Bank of Canada wxe lad at
least a group of directors supposedly representative of all types of trade and industry
and commerce. But here you have not a
single nian with anything but the exporience
or the interest of a civil servant. Take the
men filling these positions to-day, not one of
them lias any experience other than that
gained from a ceollege education or as a banker
or a public servant.
When you come to transfer the powers contained in this bill to the group of men who
drafted it, ore of the startling features-I can
hardly confine myself to "iinusual" and "extraordinîary"-I say one of the startling features
we find in Section 71 is that the Bank of
Canada will not need to maintain the minimuim gold reserve required by the Bank of
Canada Act unless the Covernor in Council
so provides.
That is exactly the position
to-day. You see, wien we suspended the
reserves of the Bank of Canada and transferred ilieni to the Exchange Fund Account.
as we did during the war, we did so by order
in council, as provided under the Bank of
Canada Act. That practice can be continued
by order in council. In short, the section
does not mean anything. And retaining the
gold reserves in the Bank of Canada does net
mean anythîing eitlier, because in 1937 parliament passed an act, called the Gold Clauses
lon. Mr. McGEER.

Act, which made it illegal and against publie
policy to settle any obligation of Canada,
past, present or future, in gold. The only
contracts whiel the people of Canada are
interested in with regard to 'the gold reserves
of the Bank of Canada are the promises to
pay in Bank of Canada notes; that is, the
promise to pay $5.
Well, if that $5 ever
meant $5 in gold-which it did not-the Gold
Clauses Act cancelled it. So this provision is
one of the strange and startling things that
ycu find only in the mumbo-jumbo nonense
of that mumbo-jumbo world that lias taken
us througli depression without war and tlirough
war witli such an abandon of spending that,
although one of the winning powers, we are
loaded with so colossal a debt that it is a
crushing burden today and will be for mauny
years to come. It was not the Department
of Finance that won the war; it was the
industrial capacity and the building and fighting power of the peopleHon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear, hîear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: -the power to go out
into the world and use fie weapons that were
produced in abundance. What nonsense is it
te say that this group of men, who could find
no money for flie unemployed during the
depression, but who foundîîî an aibundance during the war, and are given credit for winning
flie war, should lb granted tli powers lhey are
asking for in fhis Bill!
I want for a moment to refer to the easy
way in which the honourable senator who
explained the bill went through it. He said,
"Now, of course, they have got power to fix
the fair value." Who? The board. What
experience bave the members of that board
got in fair values? "Oh," he says, "If yen are
not satisfied with them you can go to the
Exchequer Court." What experience has the
The
Court in fair values?
Exchequer
Exchequer Court is a court of law.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: The court could bring
experts before it.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I quite appreciate that,
and I think every honourable senator knows
it too. But let me point this out. In dealing
with the movement of property into Canada
we bave a long experience of the customs
administration. Is thuere an appeal from the
customs valuation? The honourable senator in
explaining the bill says, "I don't know." But
there is an appeal, and it is first to the minister and then to the Tariff Board. The Tariff
Board is appointed by parliament, is independent of the Customs Department, and is
engaged unceasingly in the study of trade problems. It is a court specially qualified to deal
with matters of that kind, and with all its

AUGUST 13, 1946

experience as a court for the purpose of
fixing fair values it is infinitely superior to this
board which is to be set up, and to the
Exchequer Court, which is already overloaded.
Why is it necessary now to burden the country further with a court, double-decking in
an inferior way the courts already in existence
and functioning constantly? If this kind of
thing must go on, may I suggest to the
Senate that the proper course to follow would
be to have these particular functions of fair
valuations carried on by the customs authorities, who are trained and competent and
experienced. Let the power be where it is
today, and where it should remain-in the
officials of the Customs Department; and let
the appeal be where it should be-to the
Tariff Board.
Now, I come to the powers contained in
the bill. I think that "unusual" and "extraordinary" are hardly applicable, because this
group of civil servants will be able to say to
you-and, mark you, this language is rather
extraordinary that I read from Section 25:
No person shall, except in accordance with a
permit,
(a) export any property from Canada;
What does this mean? Neither "person" nor
"export" is defined, so both take their common
meaning. You cannot move your own valise
out of this country without a permit.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Or a suit on your back.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: This board bas taken
power to prevent you from going out of this
country unless you go out naked.
Hon. Mr. DESSUREAULT: You would be
arrested.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh! Oh!
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Read the section yourself. The honourable gentleman who explained
the bill said that was only "unusual", only
"extraordinary". Why, I think the only country in the world where powers of that kind
would be handed over to civil servants would
be pre-war Nazi Germany, or Moscow today
under Stalin. Just imagine, we have to get a
permit to cross the boundary in our own
clothes!
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: What is this country
coming to if that is only "unusual"? Unusual
is .a lovely expression.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh! Oh!
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The explaining was
done so smoothly that it almost convinced
me that I was unduly agitated about the
whole thing.

Section 26(1)(a) of the bill reads:
No person shall, except in accordance with a
permit,
(a) import any property into Canada;
The word, "property" is defined, so perhaps they have left a shirt or two on our
backs. Let us see. At page 3, paragraph (s)
"property" is, defined as follows:
"property" means every kind of real or personal, movable or immovable property;
No, they do not leave us an undershirt. No.
person can import even his neck-tie without
the authority of this board. And the Governor of the Bank of Canada is going to be
its chairman; he is moving right along.
"Upon what meat doth this our Caesar
feed?" We made him Governor of the Banc
of Canada, and gave him certain powers. He
marches along, and now he says that he wants
control over the people of Canada forever.
Has any serious mistake been made in this
bill? An honourable member has asked a question about our relations with the United
States. If we cannot even get out of the
country without a permit, what about anyone
coming in? When we examine the extraordinary provisions of section 26, we must ask,
"What does that mean to our tourist trade?"
Is every tourist who comes across the 4,000
miles of boundary line to be called upon to
write in advance for a permit to come in with
his clothes on? He cannot do it unless he bas
a permit from this new ivory tower. Let me
ask the honourable senator who explained the
bill about that feature?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It is unusual.
Hon. 'Mr. 'McGEER: I say it is more than
extraordinary, unusual, startling; it is a
violent mistake. Wben men so far lose themselves as to draft legislation to give them
power by which they would destroy the tourist
trade of the Dominion of Canada, and when
the other bouse passes that legislation, surely
the Senate bas an opportunity to demonstrate its place in the political life of Canada,
and a duty to fulfill in protecting the security
and freedom of the people of our nation. The
provision that "no person shall, except in
accordance with a permit, import any property
into Canada," demonstrates how carelessly this
bill bas been drafted, and how appallingly
easily it must have gone through committee
in the other place and passed through the
other chamber.
May I come to another unusual provision?
Section 27 (1) (a) reads:
No resident shall, except in accordance with
a permit,
(a) either in Canada or elsewhere sell, assign,
transfer or deliver any securities-

Liberis must figbt this sort of thing. This bill
ca.sts a.siuio every sacrifice that wvas offercd in

AUGUST 13, 1945
the recent war. We fought that war for freedom, 'but what does it d& for our international
relations?
I remember well hearing the beloved and
late lamented President of the United States,
when speaking on his good neighbour policy
and freer trade, proclaiming that when the
barriers were down there would be freer access
for ail of us to the good things of oe
another. Yet before, the guns have cooled we
are asked to fashion the most, arbitrary piece
of legisiation that ever was presented te any
parliament or congress on the North American
continent. Even in South America they do neot
do that sort of thing.
Where was this boasted dream, this grand
hope of freer interchange of trade? It was
'n the mind of everybody. But it is now
proposed te throw ail that away and to set
up a piece of legisiation directed straight at
the trade of the United States. Is that the
kind of relations we want upon this North
American continent? Think carefully about
what this means te the United States of
America. The arbitrary act which resulted
in a loss of $140,000,000 te the Foreign Exchange Centrol Beard cost the people of this
ceuntry many hundreds of millions of dollars.
And let me say that the hringing of a billion
dollars of American cuirrency here and holding
à~ idie in the coffers of the Foreign Exchange
Control Board wvas neither ,,ound inte~rnational
finance nor sound ecenemics. However, I do
net want te go inte that.
In moving that this bill be net read the
second time new but six months hence, I
urge each honourable senater te ask himself:
Cao I vote te place in the hands of a group
of public officials the power te administer a
statuite which says that "ne person shail, except
in accordance with a permit, expert any property from Canada," and that "ne person shail,
except in accordance with a permit, import
any preperty inte Canada"? Are you ready
te put that trade policy inte the hands of a
group of officials? Wliy, if that becomes law
and yeu happen te be told by experts that you
need an eperatien down at the Mayo Clinic,
yeu wîll have te ask that the operation be
postponed until yen get a permit frem the
Foreign Exchange Control Board in Canada.
You could net get a permît if you were
unable te notify the board what the operation
was geing te cest; se yeu would have te go
down to Mayo's for examinatien, come back
here te gct your permit, then return te the
clinic for the operation-and it might be
necessary te make ahl the trips by ambulance.
What nonsense!1
That is cartoening the
beard's powers a little, but net misrepresenting
their effect.

605

I believe the bill should stand over and the
group of men responsible for it made te
understand that these powers are net the
kind we give te civil servants, but are such
as ceuld be entrusted only te the highest type
of independent citizen, selected hecause he
knows something, net about finance, but about
Canadian trade and the rights and liherties
of the Canadinn people.
Hon. Mr. BENCU: I have been troubled
by one phase of the problema arising eut of
the honourable gentleman's motion, and I
would like te get lais vicws upen it. Considering that already under order in council there
is a control more drastic perhaps than that proposed in this bill, and conceding the possibility
of reasons for centinuing it for a limited time
-I may say in parenthesis that I personahly
would be epposed te extending it indefinitely
-might it net be as well te pass the bill but
limait its operatien te say one year? After
all, the order is in effect new. Why net allow
the power te remain in force for a year and,
if parliament is net in session at the expiratien of that term, for a furthcr period of sixty
or ninety days after the opening of the next
cnsuing session of parliament?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I want te thanc my
henourable friend fer the oppertun-ity te
explain that situation, which I perhaps should
have done in meving that the bill stand over
for six months. As heneurable members know,
under the Emergency Pewers Act aIl the
pewers that this board and others enjoy today
are continued until sîxty days after the opening of the next parliament of Canada. Se
this is certainly a case where nothing would
be lest by aur taking time. There is ne urgent
necessity for these extraordinary pewers,
which should neyer be granted under any
circumstances. This bill sheuld net go upen
the Statute Book. Den't let it get there, for
once a measure of this kind is enacted it
becomes almest impossible te have it repealed.
Why sheuhd we hurry about this thing now?
We have the security of the Bretton Woods
agreement, and the world is net yet in a
settled state of peace. Let us take our time.
Six months from now we shaîl be back in
session, and nothing will have been lest by
standing the bill ever. We may have a very
different outhook then. 1 am hopeful that the
great forces new at work are geing te coe
together, and I believe we are gomng te see
the negetiatiens for peace bringing about a
much freer and more generous outlook than
there is new. If that happens we will neyer
dream of passing legislation of this kind.
There is ne hurry te have the bill passed, se
let us stand it over.

SENATE

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON:
Honourable senators, I would regret it very
much if any members of the Senate, under
,the spell of the eloquence of the honourable
senator from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
McGeer), became alarmed by the dangers
that he suggests are inherent in the powers of
the Foreign Exchange Control Board and
voted for the six months hoist of this important measure. I listened very carefully to his
remarks. One could not but be impressed
with what he said were the risks of interference with the tourist traffic and with the
personal convenience of travellers from Canada
to the United States. But I would point out
to him that we have been living for some
months under these regulations, which were
enacted by order in council, and up to the
moment I have not observed any great barm
to the tourist traffic in my province or in the
province in which we now are. I cannot
believe for one moment that the motive
behind this bill is the striking of a death blow
at the tourist traffic.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The board has got the
power.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend says the board has got the power. I
should think it would be well to find out if
that is the lhidden intention of the bill. If
it is, we could take some reasonable precautions in connittec to sec that a death blow
is not struck at the tourist industry. As was
said by the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) and by the honourable gentleman
from Vancouver-Burrard himself-and I think
every honourable senator will agree-there
must be some control of foreign exchange.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: There is no such control as this in the United States.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am not talking
about degrce of control.
My honourable
friend said there should be some control.
Thien it becomes a question of the degree or
mîethod. I cau assure my hionourable friend
that this measure is not advanced with the
idea of destroving tourist travel between
Canada and the United States.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I did not say it was.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
friend spent a lot of time
danger of the bill in that
knows as well as I do that
danger at all.

on the alleged
respect, and he
there is no such

Hon. Mr. MeGEER: You have given them
the power.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Just a minute. I
listened to my honourable friend without
interrupting him. If perchance the bill does
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

contain some clause or provision whereby some
evil-intentioned person might attempt to
destroy the tourist business, let us exercise
our rights and powers to see that the clause
or provision is amended.
My honourable
friend knows just as well as any other senator
that
there is nothing whatever to his
contention.
The control of foreign exchange is undoubtedly a very serious question. I am no expert
on the matter. I do not know one half as
much about it as my honourable friend who
explained the bill (Hon. Mr. Hayden) in a
way that I am sure greatly pleased and
enlightened the house. To disregard our
responsibilities and throw the bill out before
even hearing all that can be said by its sponsors would not be a dignified procedure. If,
after hearing the explanations of departmental
officials in committee, honourable members
desire to make some amendment, that of
course is within their rights. But to say at this
stage that we are not to hear anything more of
the bill is. I think, very unreasonable, because
after all these provisions with regard to export
and import. which my honourable friend condemned with all his eloquence and skill as a
pleader, seem to me-and I am only a layman
-to have their genesis in an effort to frustrate
those who desire to escape taxation. So far
as I am concerned, I will never lend my hand
te make it any easier for people who have
made their money in this country to evade
taxation that rightly they should pay here.
I should bo very careful indeed before I would,
consciously or unconsciously, do anything to
aid them.
I wouldi ask honourable senators not to accept
my honourable friend's suggestion to give the
bill the six months' hoist at this juncture.
Ralither, I wiouild ask them to vote for second
reading, so that the bill may be referred to one
of our standing commiýttees. There is no such
motive bchind the bill as my honourable
friend suggests, and I think every honourable
senator must realize that.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: If the bill is given
second reading, is it proposed to send it to
committee?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The honourable
gentleman who is handling the bill so stated.
Hon. Mr. 'CAMPBELL: Is it not truc that
under the present Emergency Powers Act the
Foreign Exchange Control Board could be
granted by order in council, for the period of
a year, powers which would enable it to exercise all the necessary controls until parliament
is again in session and for sixty days thereafter?

AUGUST 14, 1946
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Probalbly that is
t
so. I know nothing ·o the contrary. We have
heard a very full explanation of the bill, and
the honourable gentleman from VancouverBurrard (Hon. MIr. 'MeGeer) has clearly and
aloquently argued against the measure; so
what is the necessity of further debate?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Some of us do net
like to vote on the prinoiple.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I may say at once that I think this measure
should be ýthoroughly discussed. After all,

IMMIGRATION
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. JAMES MURDOCK presented the
report of the Standing Committee on Immigration and Labour, which was authorized to
examine into the Immigration Act. (See
Appendix A at end of today's report.)
He said: Honourable senators, this report
of the committee covers ten hearings, each
of which lasted more than two hours. The
report, which would require nearly an hour
to read, will be printed, and it is hoped that
honourable senators will take the opportunity
of reading it.
Last evening we were fortunate in having
twenty members of the committee present for
consideration and adoption of this report.
Some five or six other senators also were at
the meeting.
May I suggest that in order to ascertain
something of the conditions in the displaced
persons camps in Germany, honourable senators read No. 7 of the printed proceedings of
the committee, commencing at page 191.
There they will find the brief presented by
Lieutenant-Colonel Hicks, of Three Rivers,
Quebec, who recently returned from Germany.
where he was one of those in charge of displaced persons and refugees found in that
country after the war.
The adoption of this report will be moved
at a later sitting.

Lateiy there has been somne discussion in
the nowspapors as to when the first divorce
xvas granted by thu Sonate. 1 noticed in the
Ottawa Joturnal cf May 24, 1946, an item
reprintcd from the Journal of May 24, 1921,
stating:
The flr,,t dixvore te 1)0 granteil te a resident

Titat is net correct. The first divorce granted
by parliament te a residont cf the province of
Quoboc xvas in 1868. Thiat was the only divorce
by parliament that yoar. In each of the years
1869, 1873 and 1875 there was again only one
divorce, ail heing- granted to Ontario petitioners; and in 1877 three couples were
diverced, ail from Ontario. The next divorce
grantod to a resident cf Quebeo was in 1878.
un whvli ycar txve Ontario applications were
granted.

Since 1930 applications for divorce in the
province of Ontario have been dealt with by
the'Supreme Court of that province. Since
1919 divorce applications by persons domiciled
in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta have been dealt with by the
courts in those provinces. Applications by
persons domiciled in Prince Edward Island
are now dealt with by the court in that
province.
Inasmuch as eight of the provinces now have
divorêe courts, the Divorce Committee limits
itself to the hearing of divorce petitions from
persons domiciled in the province of Quebec.
It may be interesting to honourable senators to know the amount of fees collected on
divorce and other private bills for the session
of 1946. The receipts amounted to $57,149.16,
mostly in connection with divorce bills. Certain fees, to the amount of $2,255.45, were
ordered by the Senate to be refunded, so that
the net receipts from private bills during the
session have been $54,893.71.
Before I take my seat there is another
matter that I should like to deal with, if
honourable senators will permit me. A short
time ago the Minister of Justice is reported
to have suggested in another place a remedy
which he thought might, if adopted, relieve
parliament from the drudgery of hearing the
evidence in petitions for divorce coming from
the province of Quebec. His suggestion, as I
understand it, was that the husband or the
wife desiring the divorce should first take
action in the Superior Court of Quebec for
a judicial separation, and if the court granted
the separation on the ground of adultery, a
certificate to that effect could be obtained;
upon presentation of this certificate to parliament, along with the petition for divorce, the
bill of divorce would go through as a matter
of course. If this could be done it would
certainly relieve parliament and the Senate
Divorce Committee of a great deal of unpleasant work.
However, I am informed by lawyers from
the province of Quebec that, in their opinion,
the suggestion would not work out because
of Article 188 of the 'Civil Code of Lower
Canada, which is still in force in the province

609

of Quebec. In order that this Article may
appear in its proper setting I will first of all
read the preceding Article:
'187. A husband may demand the separation
on the ground of his wife's adultery.
The wife, however, is not given similar relief,
as will be seen by the following Article:
188. A wife may demand the separation on
the ground of her husband's adultery, if he keep
his concubine in their common habitation.
In other words, a husband could obtain a
certificate from the court if his wife committed
adultery anywhere, but the wife could not
obtain any such certificate unless the husband
committed adultery in the house where he
was living with his wife. This, in effect, would
in nearly every case bar a wife from obtaining
a divorce. The proposition of law found in
Article 188 is eertainly contrary to the principles of common law governing the subject
matter. I am advised that even the old, law
of France, from which Article 188 is derived,
has been modernized to remove this impediment and disability from a wife.
The courts of Quebec, under Articles 189.
190 and 191, have power to order separation on
many grounds less serious than adultery; for
instance, outrage, ill usage, grievous insult; but
even in such cases they are required to take
into consideration the rank, condition and
other circumstances of the parties.
There is also this further objection, that in
the province of Quebec actions for separation
as to bed and board are non-summary proceedings, which. if contested, usually take a
year or more to be brought to trial; and even
after judgment is rendered an appeal may be
lodged, and very lengthy delay may be incurred before final judgment. Honourable senators will gather from what I have stated that
the suggestion of the Minister of Justice is
not a solution of the problem facing us.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Would the honourable
gentleman agree that there is another possible
objection to following the course suggested in
another place? Assuming a certificate were
granted by the Superior Court of Quebec for
a judicial separation on the ground of adultery,
and that certificate were then presented to
a committee of this parliament,.would not
that committee have to inquire into the question of subsequent condonation? And if such
condonation were established, would it not
wholly wipe out the ground upon which a bill
of divorce could be founded here?
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: There might have
been connivance also.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I suggest that condonation is one feature that would have to be

SENATE
inquired into by some body of this parliament
to determine whether or not the ground for
divorce still subsisted.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: I do not pretend
that my statement on the matter is final. I
have just mentioned these points to show
honourable members that we are still confronted with grave difficulties in so far as this
question is concerned. I hope that between
now and next session honou.rable members
will consider the matter carefully with a view
to arriving at some solution of the problem.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Apart altogether
from the various points involved in the very
excellent report ,which the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee has just presented to the
Senate, I should like in my official capacity
and on behalf of honourable members generally to express our appreciation of the work
of himself and the members of his committee
-work
which they have cheerfully and uncomplainingly taken upon their shoulders at
great personal inconvenience, in order to
discharge a responsibility which is ours
collectively.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Honourable senators, I
should like to point out to the honourable
Chairman of the Divorce Committee that
under Article 188 of the Civil Code of Quebec
it is trufi that unless the husband comnmits
adultery in his own home his offence is not a
grournd upon which his wife can base a demand
for separation. But adultery in itself is an
insult to the wife, and insult is sufficient
ground upon which to base such a demand.
Therefore, in an action for separation before
the Superior Court of Quebec, if a wife could
establish that adultery had been committed
outside the common habitation, since this
would constitute an insult to her, the court
would grant a separation from bed and board.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: But in the case the
honourable gentleman mentions the wife
could not get a certificate from the trial judge
that the separation was granted on the ground
of adultery.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: No. But the separation
would be granted to the wife on the ground
of the insult constituted by the adultery.
REDISTRIBUTION
BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT, 1946

Hon. WISHART MeL. ROBERTSON: I
beg to lay on the table a copy of the statute
enacted by the Parliament of the United
Kingdom on July 26, 1946, entitled, "An act
T

ton. Mr. BENCH.

to provide for the readjustment of representation in the House of Commons of Canada on
the basis of the population of Canada."
In order to complete the record for future
reference I think, honourable senators, it
might be well if this statute were incorporated
in the Debates cf the Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
(Sec Appendix B at end of today's report.)
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
APPROvAL

OF

CONSTITUTION

Hon. WISHART
McL. ROBERTSON
moved:
Resolved, that it is expedient that the Houses
of Parliament do approve the constitution of
the World Health Organization signed at New
York, on July 22, 1946, and that this House do
approve the same.
He said: I have asked the honourable senator from Gloucester (Hon. Mr. Veniot) to
speak to this resolution.
Hon. C. J. VENIOT: In speaking to this
resolution, honourable senators, I shourld like
to summarize the constitution of the W orld
Health Organization and yet give sufficient
information for a clear understanding of this
important world-wide undertaking. Hoonourable senators who desire more dctails concerning this resolution and the constitution
of the whole organization can find them in
the addendum to the Votes and Proceedings
of the House of Commons under date of July
24, 1946, at page 9.
The first step which led to the eventual
signing of the constitution of the World
Health Organization was taken at the United
Nations Conference in San Francisco last year.
A resolution was adopted at that time calling
for an international conference for the purpose of setting up a. world-wide organization.
On February 15, 1946, the Economie and
Social Council of the United Nations Organizaton established what they called a technical
preparatory committee to draft an agenda
and proposals for consideration by the
conference.
The International Health Conference met in New York on June 19 last,
and Major Gencral G. B. Chisholm, then
Deputy Minister of Health for Canada, as
secretary of the Technical Preparatory Committee, presented the report of the Technical
Preparatory Committee, which included proposals for the constitution of the World Health
His report summarized the
Organization.
deliberations of the committee at its meeting
in Paris in March 1946. The constitution was
adopted and signed in New York on July
22 and, as I have already stated, printed in
the Votes and Proceedings of the House of
Commons on July 24 of this year.

AUGUST 14, 1946
For the information of the general public
as well as of the members of this house, it
might be well to enumerate the basic principles as given in the preamble to the constitution. They are as follows:
Health is a state of complete physical, mental
and social well-being and not merely the absence
of disease or infirmity.
The enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights
of every human being without distinction of
race, religion, political belief, economic or social
condition.
The health of all peoples is fundamental to
the attainment of peace and security and is
dependent upon the fullest co-operation of individuals and states.
The achievement of any state in the promotion
and protection of health is of value to all.
Unequal development in different countries
in the promotion of health and control of disease, especially communicable disease, is a conmon danger.
Health development of the child is of basic
importance; the ability to live harmoniously
in a changing total environment is essential to
such development.
The extension to all peoples of the benefits of
medical psychological and related knowledge is
essential to the fullest attainment of health.
Informed opinion and active co-operation on
the part of the public are of the utmost importance in the improvement of the healtir of
the people.
Governments bave a responsibility- for the
health of their peoples which can be fulfilled
only by the provision of adequate health and
social measures.
Chapter I of the constitution provides that
the objective of the organization shall be "the
attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health."
Chapter II indicates the functions of the
organization, and I should like to put them
on record to show the high standards the
United Nations Organization had in mind.
They are as follows:
In order to achieve its objective. the functions
of the organization shall be:
(a) to act as the directing and co-ordinating
authority on international health work:
(b) to establish and maintain effective collaboration with the United Nations, specialized
agencies, governmental health and administrations. professional groups and such other organizations as may be deemed appropriate;
(c) to assist governments. upon request in
strengthening health services;
(d) to furnish appropriate technical assistance
and, in emergencies, necessary aid upon the request or acceptance of governments:
(e) to provide or assist in providing, upon
the request of the United Nations, health services and facilities to special groups, such as the
peoples of trust territories;
(f) to establish and maintain such administrative and technical services as may be required, including epidemiological and statistical
services;
(g) to stimulate and advance work to eradicate epidemic, endemic and other diseases:

611

(h) to promote, in co-operation with other
specialized agencies where necesary, the prevention of accidental injuries;
(i) to promote, in co-operation with other
specialized agencies where necessary, the improvement of nutrition, housing, sanitation, re-

creation, economic or working conditions and
other aspects of environmental hygiene;
(j) to promote co-operation among scientific
and professional groups which contribute to the
advancement of health;
(k) to propose conventions, agreements and
regulations, and make recommendations with
respect to international health matters and to
perform such duties as may b assigned thereby
to the organization and are consistent with its
objective;
(1) to pronote maternal and child health and
welfare and to foster the ability to live barmoniously in a changing total environment;
(ni) to foster activities in the field of mental
health, especially those affecting the harmony
of human relations;
(n) to promote and conduct research in the
field of health;
(o) to promote improved standards of teaching and training in health, medical and related
professions;
(p) to study and report on, in co-operation
vith other specialized agencies where necessary,
administrative and social techniques affecting
public health and medical care from preventive
and curative points of view, including hospital
services and social security;
(q) to provide information, counsel and
assistance in the field of health;
(r) to assist in developing an informed public
opinion among all peoples on matters of health;
(s) to establish and revise as necessary international nomenclatures of diseases, of causes
of death and of public health practices;
(t) to standardize diagnostic procedures as
necessary;
(u) to develop. establish and promote international standards with respect to food, biological, pharmaceutical and similar products;
(v) generally to take all necessary action to
attain the objective of the organization.
It will be noted that by Article 3 of Chapter
III the membership is open to all states.
The conditions of admission to membership
are set out in Articles 4. 5 and 6 of the same
chapter. Article 19 deals with the powers of
the Health Assembly to adopt conventions,
or agreements with respect to any matter
within the competence of the organization.
Article 20 imposes an obligation upon the
membership to accept or reject proposed conwithin eighteen
ventions or agreements
months after their adoption by the organization. A member is not bound: to accept any
convention or agreement, but if he does not
do so within the time limit he is required to
furnish to the Director-General a statement of
his reasons for non-acceptance.
Article 21 gives the Health Assembly
authority to adopt regulations concerning the
following five subjects:
(a) sanitary and quarantine requirements
and other procedures designed to prevent 'the
international spread of disease;

SENATE
(b) nomenclatures with respect to diseases,
causes of death and public health practices;
(c) standards with respect to diagnostic procedures for international use;
(d) standards with respect to the safety,
purity and potency of biological, pharmaceutical
and similar products moving in international
commerce;
(e) advertising and labelling of biological,
pharmaceutical and similar products moving in
international commerce.
Sucli are the highlights of the resolution
before us. It bas receivod the unanimous
approval of every nation and of every
government body to which it bas been submitted. It is the most comprehensive and
progressive health programme of modern
times. by which all nations of the world
eventually may share on equal terms all tbe
present and future advances of medicine and
scientific research for the preservation of
health and the prevention and cure of disease.
Sickness and disease-particularly contagions
diseases and epidemics-have no respect for
international boundaries. As a corollary to
this truisn, there should be no barriers to
the exchange between nations of the newest
and best methods of combatting sickness and
ill-health.
There is no field of endeavour in which
nations can labour together more amicably
than the field, of health. It is a common
ground where human beings of all colours,
all creeds and all parts of the world can come
to understanding and work together for the
good of all mankind.
The la-t two wars thrcatened humanity
with destruction. It is time that al nations
directed their efforts to works of construction,
not destruction-to the restoration of human
happiness by peaceful methods and harmonious
exchanges of thought such as those suggested
by the World Health Organization, and I
feel confident the Senate of Canada, will consider it a duty to subscribe to this resolution.
The motion was agreed: te.
UNITED NATIONS EDUCATIONAL,

APPiOVAL OF CONsTITUTION

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved:
Resolved that it is expedient that the Houses

the United Nations Educational, Scientific and

lon.

Ir. VENIOT.

Hon. ATHANASE DAVID: Honourable
senators at all times there have been men of
good will who have thought that permanent
peace could be established in the world. Is
this a Utopian dream or an objective capable
of being realized? Whatever our own idea
may be, there can be no doubt that everything
which can possibly be done to make the present generation, the youth of today, peaceminded, must at least be triedi. Whether the
men and women of tomorrow are peaceminded or war-minded depends upon the kind
of education that is given to the young people
in our schools today. In the past education
bas played a tremendous part in stimulating
international batred, and as a result the world
bas been scourged by wars.
Thougb it may be Utopian te believe in
permanent peace, it is our duty to try by
every possible educational menus to liad
humanity towards the achievement of that
great goal. I believe the first person who publicly proposed that we should endeavour to
bring about world peace through the schools
was the former great preside.nt of the United
States, Mr. Roosevelt. In so doing ho was,
if I may say so, adiopting the attitude of a
French statesman, Jules Ferry, who declared,
after the war -of 1870:
Give nie the supervision of the schools of
France for ten years, and J will change the
mentality of the French people.
The men and women of tomorrow will
reflect the education which now. as boys and
girls, they are receiving at school. If children
are taught the great truth that in addition to
being citizens of their own countries they are
citizens of the world they are more likely
when they- grow up to be supporters of international amity and peace.
We do not need to search into the distant
past to sec the dmeadful results of wrong
education. Is there anyone who can helieve
that Germany wouldi have given to Hitler and
the Nazis complete control over its mind,
heart and soul, had it not been for the teaching of Arian and super-men theories in the
schools of the country for many years? Could
Mussolini have become the dictator of Italy
batd it net been for his control over the Italian
schools, where the children were taught the
famous slogan, "Let us become again the
Roman Empire of the past."
If education can be such a powerful source
of evil, surely it can be converted into an
equally powerful force for the welfare of maokind. I do not need to remind honourable
members how greatly the dictators of Europe
feared the schools and other institutions for
the spread of education, science and culture.
Wherever the invading arnies went, their first

AUGUST 14, 1946
task was to destroy schools, universities, libraries and museums, to steal every work of
art they could find, and to send teachers and
professors to concentration camps. Why was
this done? Because the dictators knew that
they could not truly conquer a country until
they had gainec control over its educational
system.
There is no doubt that the education now
being given to our youth will determine
whether the world of the future is to be peaceful or warlike. It is not surprising to find that
article I of the Charter of the United Nations,
signed at San Francisco on June 26, 1945,
states it is one of the purposes of the United
Nations:
To achieve international co-operation in solving international problems of an economic, social,
cultural, or humanitarian character. and in
promoting and encouraging respect for human
rights and for fundamental freedoms for all
without distinction as to race, sex, language,
or religion.

On the 16th of November, 1945, the constitution of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization was signed
at London by the representatives of fortyfour nations. A conference for the establishment of an educational, scientific and cultural
organization of the United Nations was convened by the government of the United
Kingdom in association with the government
of France. Invitations were sent out in accordance with the recommendation of the San
Francisco conference , and upon the request
of the conference of the allied Ministers of
Education, in order to promote the aims set
out in the charter of the United Nations. The
representatives of forty-four countries were
in attendance.
At this stage I wish to draw your attention
to something that is of great importance in a
country like Canada. In 1920 or 1921 the
government of Ontario invited the ministers

of education of the various provinces to
attend a meeting in Toronto to discuss plans
for the establishment of a national council of
education. At the opening session the Provincial Secretary of Quebec-he has charge of
education in my province-presented an important resolution. I cannot recall the exact text,
but it was to this effect:

It has always been acknowledged that the

provinces enjoy absolute control in matters of
education, and on no account will any province
be prepared to surrender its autonomy, either
wholly or in part, to any incorporated body,
whether federal or provincial.
The resolution was seconded by the Minister

of Education for the province of New Brunswick, and adopted unanimously. I cite this
resolution lest any honourable senator may
deem it necessary to warn the members of

613

this house and the people of Canada, particularly the people of his province, that the
proposed organization will interfere with provincial autonomy. To guard against any such
interference Section 3 of Article I of the
constitution stipulates:
With a view to preserving the independence,

integrity and fruitful diversity of the cultures
and educational systems of the states members
of this organization, the organization is prohibited from intervening in matters which are
essentially within their domestie jurisdiction.

It seems to me that we ought to ask ourselves whether there are any serious difficulties
which may doom the organization to complete
failure so far as Canada is concerned. In this
connection let me quote Section 1 of Article
VII of the constitution, dealing with national

co-operating bodies. It reads:
Each member-state shall make such arrangements as suit its particular conditions for the
purpose of associating its principal bodies interested in educational, scientific and cultural matters with the work of the organization, preferably by the formation of a national commission
broadly representative of the government and
such bodies.
Evidently I need not draw the attention of
the government to the difficulties that may
confront the organization. In the matter of
education it may be pretty difficult to form a
national body in Canada. I would suggest
that before taking any steps to this end the
government might well consider the advisability of asking the Royal Society of Canada

to appear before the conference as this country's representative body interested in educational, scientific and cultural matters. I think
such a choice would meet with more general
approval than the formation of a new
educational body.
I need not attempt to describe in detail the
composition of the organization. Suffice to
say that there is to be a general conference
composed of five delegates from each of the
forty-foiur member-states. This general conference is to elect an executive board and, on
the recommendation of the board appoint a
director-general. I need not remind you that
the director-general of such an organization is
the principal or pivotal officer. The directorgencral and such staff as he may require will
form the secretariat.
The elected members of the executive board
are to serve for a term of three years, and
are to be immediately eligible for a second
term, but are not to serve consecutively for
more than two terms. At the first election
eighteen members will be elected, of whom
one-third will retire at the end of the first
year and one-third at the end of the second
year, the order of retirement being determined

SENATE
immediately after the election by the drawing
of lots. Thereafter six members will be
elected each year.
In order to become effective, the organization nust have received the approval and
signature of at least twenty of the state-members. In fact seventeen-or eighteen if Canada
approves-hav-e alrcady accepted the -constitution. It may be of interest to honourable
senators to know that these are the United
Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New
Zealand, Brazil, China, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, France, Iran, Mexico. Norway,
Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkcy, Sout-h Africa,
India. Canada is the only member of the
British Commonwealth of Nations that has not
yet ratified and acccpted the constitution.
The first meeting of the general conference
is to take place in November, 1946, at Paris,
which is to be the permanent home of the
organization. To ]end point to what I intend
to say a little later I im-ay state that French
and English ire to be the official languages
and that the text of the constitution will be
regarded as equally authoritative in either
language.

Documents which reach the members of the
Senate must liave certain characteristies of
authenticity. May I draw the attention of
the honourable leader of the government to
the fact that section 4 of Article XV is omitted
from the French version of No. 18 of the
Treaty Series. It reads as follows:

I do not nake this observation in a reproachful manner, but I think it is proper that the
attention of the government be called to an
error in an official document which is circulated througliout Canada at the rate of 25
cents a copy.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE
MOTION

CONTROL BILL

FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Hayden for the second reading of Bill 195,
an Act respecting the control of the acquisition
and disposition of foreign currency and the
control of transactions involving foreign currency or non-residents.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: Honourable senators, my first words this afternoon are by
way of compliment-not to the measure we
are considering, which I believe to b open to
very grave criticisn, but to the honourable
senator froin Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) Who
yesterday afternoon in a very lucid manner
explained the measure to us. I observed tiat
while my honourable friend gave a very clear
explanation, he maintained a rather neutral
attitude so far as the principle of the bill was
concerned. Knowing my honourable friend as
I do, and as a good LiberalHon. Mr. HAIG: Is there any other kind
of Liberal?
Hon. Mr. COPP: Sone have slipped.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I have great regard
for the honourable leader of the opposition
but there are occasions when his interruptions
are scarcelv to the point. He objects to the
word "good", so I shall say I have always
regarded mv hvonourable friend from Toronto
as a sound Liberal who uînderstands what
Liberalism is about, and wiat is the mcaning
of freedom and liberty. A Liberal is always
opposed to auy unnecessary exercise by the
state of arbitrary powers against the individual.
I believe the strong convictions of my lionourable friend are what made it possible for
him to take a somewiat neutral attituce with
regard to the principle of the bill.
He
described the bill as having some "extraordinary" provisions.
Thsat is putting it
mildly, to say the least. Indeed, for peacetime legislatiin this is one of the most extraordinary bills that bas ever come before the
louses of Parliament. In principle it proposes to confer upon a board of civil servants
absolute power over the imuport and export
trade of the country and over the movement
of funds across our borders, a power unlimited
as to time, and unrestricted as to the scope
and sweep of its operations.
I
would
ask honourable
senators to
scrutinize the preamble to the bill very carefuilly, because it contains the principle upon
which the succeeding sections are based. If
there is any power over international trade,
or over the right of an individual to travel
to another country to seek medical aid or

AUGUST 14, 1946
even to buy a newspaper, this board will
have it; it will have the authority andi power
to say that one cannot do any of these things
without a permit. For many years I have
been a subscriber to the National Geographie

magazine.
and I desire to renew it, I must go to same
representative of this board constituted under
this bill and- get a permit to bring the magazine into the country, -and authorizing me to
secure the funds necessary to pay the subscription price.
I quite understand that the board does not
contemplate, nor does the government anticipate for a moment, that these restrictions will
be put on the individual. But that is not
the point. By this legislation we are giving
a board power to do these things, and as the
representatives of the people we are nat justified in doing it on the pretext that we can
trust the board to administer the law fairly
and justly. That is a dangerous step to take.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: This board will have
power to prohibit imports and exports.
Should a man wish ta buy a watch while on
a visit to the United States, or should his
wife desire to purchase a gown, he or she
could not do so lntil a permit was secured.
I say that such a proposal as a peacetime
measure is an unnecessary and unwarranted
interference with the basic rights of Canadian
citizens.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
'Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I should like to draw
the attention of honourable members to one
or two specific powers in the bill. Section
35 authorizes the board to make regulations.
It reveals to me, in the limited time I have
had to study the measure, a very extraordinary position. Section 35(1)(d) provides
that the board may make regulations:
-prescribing that persons who would otherwise
be residents shall be deemed to be non-residents
or that persons who would otherwise be nonresidents shall be deemed to be residents for
any of the purposes of this aet.
I do not know the purpose behind that
provision, but obviously it confers an extraordinary power.
I should like also to direct the attention of
the house to paragraph (e) of this same section 35, which authorizes the board to make
regulations,
-notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this act, exempting any person or any class of persons or any transaction
or class of transactions from any provision of
this act.
Let us admit that the board intends, as I am
sure it does, to function honestly and in the

61

interests of the public of Canada. Nevertheless, the power is there and the board can
discriminate. If it is critical of some person,
under this section it can penalize him. That
power should not be given by this Parliament.
These powers are subject to the usual formula that they shall not be effective until
approved by the Governor in Council and published in the Canada Gazette. But may I
bring before this honourable house one or
two considerations that should be taken into
account when we consider the protection that
may reside in approval by the Governor in
Council. I have had several years experience
as a member of the government, and know
the problems that face the members of the
present administration. I sympathize with
them in their heavy task, as every honest
Canadian must, irrespective of what his political convictions or views may be.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I first became a member of parliament thirty years ago, and the
functions of the government of that day as
contrasted with those of the administration
today represent a complete transformation.
The government of Canada today is in the
wheat business, up past its ears. It is the only
buyer and seller of wheat from the primary
producers in this country. Regulations have
been passed governing the sale and the handling of other grains. The government is in the
housing business to a most extensive degree.
Some people think it is not doing a very good
job, but I say that is an unfair criticism. It
is in the transportation business, by land, sea
and air. It is operating a transcontinental air
service, ships on the sea and the national
railways. The government is in the broadcasting business on a very large scale. Many
Canadians today think that parliament has
given too much power to the broadcasting
corporation.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The government is in
the motion picture business, and is producing
films. It is also in the business of operating
crown companies such as Polymer Corporation.
It is in the business of dispensing public information, for we have a public information
board, the vote for which is passed by
parliament.
The point that I am making is that all these
activities have completely or at any rate very
largely changed the functions of government
in this country.
Let me make it clear that in these remarks
I am not implying any criticism of the government. I put it to honourable members of

SENATE
this hou-e that these things have been more
or less pushed upon governments of this
country, who often have not had sufficient
backbone to stand up against certain proposalS and frankly discuss their implications
with the Canadian people. But I will say
from experience that the ultimate decisions
in regard to wheat, transportation, the film
board. broadcasting, the Polymer Corporation
and all such government activities have to be
made around the cabinet council table. Now
let me remind honourable members that for
five full months the cabinet has been under
the strain of heavy parliamentary work,
answering questions in another place, endeavouring to guide the country wiscly in all the
intricate and difficult international situations,
confronted with labour problems ail over the
country, and having to deal witlh maany other
important ma t ters. That is the kind of pressure that i- on a cabinet todav, and the inevitable ra-ult is that the government has to
depeni more and more upon its civil service
advi-erS. The dadisers in the present instance
will bu the members of the Foreign Exchange

able to make a reasonably correct statement
of its important provisions. Yet the Great

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I would not say that.
Hon. Mr. QUINN: There is a danger there.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: It is to me rather
significant and a cause for concern, that 80
per cent of the people of this country do not
know the source of their many frcedoms and
liberties.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: Why is that so?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I am not going into
the reasons why that is so now. I referred to
the poll in support of my remark that it is a
comparatively easy thing to forget the value
and importance of these freedoms and liberties which we have long enjoyed and to allow
them to slip away from us.
Why are these extraordinary powers being
asked for in this bill? In the preamble we are
told they are required to protect the external
value of the Canadian dollar. I would like
to niake a comment or two upon that. I put
it to this honourable house:
What would
endanger the external value of the Canadian
dollar? What would cause-if I may employ
the words that were used, and used rightly,
by thelihonourable gentleman who introduced
the bill (Hon. Mr. Hayden)-what would cause
a flight of capital from Canada? Why would
the Canadian dollar fly away? The only possible reason couldý ibe that the people had lost
confidence in their country.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: For instance, our large
expenditures and the possibility of unbalanced
budgets might be contributing factors in inducing a Canadian to transfer his funds or property and securities to another country. But
where could he send them today to be safer?

AUGUST 14, 1946

In what country would they be safer than
they are in Canada, so long as we govern ourselves with reasonable common sense?
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mt. ORERAR: That is what is needed.
I have faith in Canada, and I know that the
overwhelming majority of Canadians have
faith in this country. Why it should be stated
as a reason for this bill that we have to protect the external value of our dollar by setting
up a board with power to pass all sorts- of
regulations to prohibit Canadians-except
under permit-from sending money or goods
out of the country for any laudable purpose
as they have been accustomed to doing in the
past, is beyond my comprehension. In saying
that, may I take occasion here to pay a tribute to the government's advisers in financial
matters during the war? I shall not name
them, but if I may say se, most if not all of
them are friends of mine, and I think they
rendered a great service to Canada. But I will
offer this criticism, that they do not understand the Canadian people. You can probably blue-print an economic theory, but you
cannot blueprint in advance the reaction of
the individual citizens to it.
And, after
all, if we are going to retain and maintain our
democracy in this country, we cannot ignore
the thoughts in the minds of the people, from
the very highest to the very lowest. I think
that those responsible for this legislation show
a lack of knowledge of the mentality of the
Canadian people and ignore the lessons of
history. What happened elsewhere?
I do
not wish to take up too much timeSome Hon. SENATORS: Go on.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: When the German
parliament voluntarily and by its own free will
committed suicide by giving absolute governing power to Hitler, what was one of the first
things he did? He brought into effect the
very principle of this bill. He said "You cannot transfer your funds from Germany." He
prohibited imports, and he controlled exports.
He got complete control of the economic life
of the community. And that was the story in
other countries. Look at Russia today. The
individual Russian citizen cannot do many of
the things that we have been accustomed to
do in the past. His freedoms are circumscribed.
We do not want that sort of thing here.
My point is that the Canadian people will
make a very grave and great mistake if, for
the sake of what they think will be a temporary
advantage, they squander away their freedoms
and liberties. Once these things go it is
almost impossible, without revolution itself,
to have them restored.

Speaking for myself I can say that I was
never clearer in my mind as to what is the
right thing to do-and I may modestly say
I try to do the righ‡ thing-than I am as
regards this measure. This measure should be
thrown out.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If it is necessary for
the government to exercise some control in
these monetary matters, it still has the temporary power to do so, and it should not have
any power beyond tihat. I would say that,
irrespective of what government happened to
be in power. This proposed legislation, cornbined with the bill which we discussed last
week setting up the Canadian Commercial
Corporation, would in the event of their being
a government sympathetic to the development of the authoritarian idea put it within
the power of such a government and its civil
servants at Ottawa, to completely shackle the
commerce of this country and to interfere
absolutely with the. fundamental rights of the
individual citizen.
Hon. Mir. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Now, honourable senators, let me say at once that I was not
brought up in that school. It does not square
with my conception of what liberalism means.
Liberalism ýdown through the ages has been
the great liberating force responsible for every
worth-while achievement in our civilization.
When I speak of liberalism it is not in the
sense of something that distinguishes the Liberal party from the Conservative party, for
to-day those party labels have little, if any,
significance when you probe deep down into
the very fundamentals upon which ouT civiiization is based, and has developed. It is
because I am opposed to anything that undermines the spirit of liberalism, the love of freedom and liberty which is the divine heritage of
the individual citizen, that I am opposed to
this measure.
In dealing with the bill we have a serious
responsibility to discharge. We are the representatives and the servants of the Canadian
people. Let us never overlook that fact. In
certain places there is a tendency on the part
of those who may be elected. to public office
to think that immediately upon election they
are endeowed with some peculiar virtue which
qualifies them to guide the people. That is a
false and wrong conception of ouir form of
government. We are here not to exercise our
will arbitrarily, but as the representatives and
servants of the people and responsible to the
people, and we have no right either in this
House or the other by insidious means to

have been our priceless heritage for generations.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Honourable senators,

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I object. Why move

Hon. Mr. HAIG: I am quite willing that the
debate sh'ould be adjourned, but if any honourable meniber wants to speak I am prepared
to let him do so.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I may say, honourable senators, that in moving to adjourn
the debate the whip on this side (Hon. Mr.

moved the second reading of Bill 308, an Act
to amend the Family Allowances Act, 1944.
He said: Honourable senators, it is intended
by this bill to make two minor changes in the
act of 1944. The first amendment provides
that no allowance is payable unless the chiild
is attending scho'ol in accordance with the
various provincial laws. Previouslyi the allowance was net payable if the child did not
regularly attend school between the ages of
six and sixteen. Since, howexet, provincial
laws vary as to the age when a child must
attend school, the wording lias been changed
so that the allowance may be paid wherever
the provincial authority certifies that the child
is attending school in accordance with its
particular laws. The other amendment merely
clarifies the power of the authorities to make
alternative regulations when the allowance is
payable to mentally deficient parents, Indians
or Eskimos.

25,000 acres. I may tell honourable members
that this year some 1,311 acres have been
acquired at an average cost to the country of
slightly more than 85 per acre, and that the
average cost of the 16,000 acres is considerably
less than $10 per acre. With that illustration
will
members
honourable
therm
before
appreciate the careful manner in which this
whole scherne lias been undertaken and
conducted.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Honourable senators, may I be allowed to make a furier
I
observation without asking a question?
think all members of the Tourist Traffic Comittee wre greatly impressed witii tlie preMr.
sentation of the local organziation.
Sparks, tite prcsident, I believe. of the organization, expressed the fear tbat if the land to
be brought into the park area were not acquired
immediately it might fall into the iands of
private parties, and future development be
hindered in that way. From the remarks of
the honourable senator frem Ottawa I gather
that land still to ba acquired will be added to
the park.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I am very pleased
that my friend bas raised the point, because
it gives me an opportunity to say that the
work done by Mr. Sparks bas received the full
approval and support of the Federal District
Commission. He bas been a most unselfish
and devoted enthusiast in the development
of the whole park area. He is one of those
rare persons who, having independent means,
bas made the development of the area his
life-work, in the hope that the park may
become a happy vacationing ground for the
people of Ottawa and the tourists who come
here to enjoy the beauties and benefits of this
part of the country. I have seen the coloured
films of the Gatineau Park produced by Mr.
Sparks' son-in-law, an expert in that line of
work. As a result of the persistent and
devoted efforts of Mr. Sparks to develop the
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

Gatineau Hills country, I believe a sub--committee of the enlarged Federal Commission
will probably be appointed' to undertake the
supervision of the whole park area.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, I will not delay the adoption of this
mîeasure except to say that in my opinion
it is very timely. Throughout the world it is
recognized that a civilized nation should take
pride in its capital. If one visits London,
Paris, Berlin, Rome and other capitals in
Europe, or goes to see the developneint carried out at Washington, Rio, Mexico City,
Buenos Aires and other large capitals in the
American republics, one will see everywhere a
demons tration of the pride that is taken in the
development and embellishment of tiese
national capitals. I think the time bas come
wlenî Canada should take a similar pride in
the city of Ottawa, and should contribute to
its aggrandizement and beautification as generously as ber finances will permit.
I should like to suggest that in the general
scheine referred to by the honourable senator
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert) there sbould
be inclided a project for a national library.
Hon. Mr. DAVID: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: One of the sources of
pride of almost every civilized nation is its
national library. The Parlianentary Library
iii Ottawa is entirely too small.
Hoi. Mr. DAVID: And it is a fire-trop.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: One of the various roois
with the Parliamentarv Library
contains books still packed in boxes, because
of lack of space to exhibit themu. Underneath
this verv chamber there is on accumnlation
of invaluable books, some of them written byv
hand and published as far back as 1400. Tiese
volumes, in their original lcather bindings,
are stored in a dark roorn where they are
exposed te dust and humidity. It is a crime
that suich valuable books should be so poorly
housed.
Another room in connection willi the
Library of Parliament contains soine 12,000
volumes of bound copies of the newspapers
published in Canada since confederation-and
soine prior to that time. Proper storage of
these newspapers would immediately make
available sufficient accommodation for 360,000
books. It is necessacy to keep these newspapers for reference purposes, but thîey are
seldom referred to.
The libraries in the varions national capitals
are equipped to furnish research services. We
have nothing of that nature. If the University of Toronto, or any other university.
wished to secure information on some subject
from the Library of Parliament, there is no
connected

AUGUST 14, 1946
one available to assist them. The Librarian
is very anxious to create such a service, but
he has no room to bouse additional employees.
I believe that in the best interest of the
people of Canada the project covered by this
bill should include the establishment of a
national library. The Library of Parliament
could remain a separate institution for the
service of legislators and others immediately
connected with the administration of the
country.
I take much pleasure in commending this
bill to honourable members. It is a step in
the right direction towards the beautification
and development of our national capital.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: May I ask the
sponsor of the bill if he can state when it is
expected the work will be donc? I may say
that in the West there is a crying need for
the expenditure of public moneys on such
things as irrigation works and highways.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. GERSHAW: In the natural
course of events there will be periods of
unemployment. Has that thought been considered in relation to the time in which this
work is to be done?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I can only try to
answer the honourable senator's question by
saying that if the $3,000,000 of capital expenditure is to be raised by debentures, the last of
them must expire within twenty years. That
does not mean that the expenditure will be
spread over twenty years. I think the $3,000,000 is to be used largely to develop certain
properties adjoining the Rideau River, for
instance, and highway entrances into the city,
and also to improve the very bad railwayline entries into the city. The complete plan
of development for the federal district will
take many years to accomplish, and other
grants of money will be necessary in the
future. Now that this matter comes under the
Prime Minister's office I have no doubt that
a good deal of attention will be given to the
point my honourable friend raises, so as to
have development work proceed when labour
is most readily available. Just now, as everybody knows, it is very difficult to get not
only workmen but materials for a project of
this kind. The purpose of this bill is largely
to reaffirm the principle of the development
of the national capital area.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators,
once again I voice my -protest against voting
further moneys for this beautification scheme.
While I am heartily in favour of purchasing
as large an area of land as can be obtained
in the Gatineau district and leaving it in its

621

natural state, I am opposed to spending of
millions for tearing down the railway station
and other property on the canal just now.
Canada is a large country, and many of us
live a couple of thousand miles or so away
from Ottawa. The honuorable gentleman from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) referred to
the need for expenditures on irrigation and
other works. Some forms of wild-life-pheasants, chickens, ducks and so on-are dying
by the thousands for lack of water in areas
which otherwise would be ideally suited for
their propagation. If only part of the money
asked for in this bill were spent on creating
oases here and there in the West, we would
have a great increase in our wild life.
The honourable gentleman also mentioned
the need for expenditures on highways in the
West. I can tell honourable members that
a hard-surface road from the American border
to Prince Albert National Park would bring
in more money through tourist traffic than
this beautification scheme at Ottawa will. Do
not nisunderstand me. We are all proud of
these parliament buildings and their site, and
we all admit that Ottawa is a beautiful city
for a capital. My poi.nt is that this money
could be spent to better advantage just now
than in making Ottawa more beautiful. A
great deal of care bas to be used when you
are making plans for improving a city. For
example, if the present railway station at
Ottawa is torn down it might be replaced by
some such atrocity as the Canadian National
central station at Montreal, on which some
$20,000,000 was spent. It is an awful looking
thing.
I am opposed to any increase in the expenditure on Ottawa until we build better roads
in various parts of the country and irrigate
some of the western areas thiat are now badly
in need of water.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I would like to point
out to my honourable friend that no commit-

ments are being made under this bill for
changing the

Ottawa.

In its report the committee said

that one of the things needed was the formation of a terminal company to combine the
Canadian National, the Canadian Pacifie and
the New York Central interests in this city
in a more logical and orderly way than at

present, but no money bas been voted for
that and no commitment along that line bas
been made. I think that when the time comes
to put that recommendation into effect the
railways will have to bear their share of the
cost.
I agree with the honourable gentleman that
an improved highway into the Prince Albert
National Park in Saskatchewan would be a

very laudable proj oct. The same thing could
be said with respect to the Riding Mountain
Park in Manitoba. I shoold hope that notlîing
done under tlîis bill would in any way interfere with the expenditures on national parks.
lion. Mr. HAVIES: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Is Connaught square
under the Federal District Commission or the
City of Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: It is under the
Fuderai District Commission.
Hon. Mr. HAVIES: I think something

Hon. Mr. COPP moved the third reading

-The motion was agreed te, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

IMMIGRATION BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 367, an Act to amend
the Immigration Act.
Hon. Mr. COPP: The honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), before he left the
chamber to keep an appointment, informed
me that the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) would handle
this bill for him.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK moved the
second reading of the bill.
He said: This measure, honourable senators,
is neither controversial nor of great importance.
The proposed amendments are for the purpose
of co-ordinating the Immigration Act with the
new Canadian Citizenship Act.. This involves
practically no substantial change in the present
law.
Section 1 provides that paragraph (b) of
section 2 of the Immigration Act be repealed
and the fojlowing substituted therefor:
(b) "Canadian citizen" means a person who
is a Canadian citizen under the Canadian Citizenship Act.
That act was passed quite recently, and
sets forth what constitutes a Canadian citizen.
Section 2 provides that:
"Canadian domicile" means-Canadian domicile
acquired and held in accôrdance with. the provisions of section 2A of this Act.
The sections in the Immigration Act with
regard to domicile have been redrafted and
they now appear in section 4 of the bill as
section 2A of -the act. In my judgment it is
a simpler and better statement of Canadian
domicile without making any notable change.
Paragraph (a) of section 2A reads:
Canadian domicile is acquired by a person
only by having his domicile for at least five
years in Canada after having been landed
therein;
63268-41

(b) Canadian domicile is lost by a person
voluntarily residing out of Canada with the
present intention of making his permanent home
out of Canada and not for a mere special or
temporary purpose.
That is a simple factual statement of the
law as it has been and, I suppose, always must
be. There are exceptions of course and they
are provided for in these paragraphs:
(c) A person who resides out of Canada as
a representative or employee of a firm, business,
company or organization, religious or otherwise,
established in Canada, or who resides out of
Canada while in the public service of Canada
or of a province, and the spouse or child under
eighteen years of age of any such person residing out of Canada with him, shall be deemed
not to have lost Canadian domicile by reason
of such residence;
(d) No period'during which a person is confined in or an inmate of any penitentiary, jail,
reformatory, prison or asylum for the insane
in Canada shall be counted as a period of domicile in Canada for the purposes of rule (a) of
this section.
Section 5 merely extends the power to the
Director of Immigration and the Commissioner
of Immigration for Canada in London to do
certain acts which before were done by thé
deputy minister. It is a matter of convenience
and removes the restriction against the entry
of immigrants who have had their fares paid
by charitable organizations.
Sectiop 6 repeals subsection 2 of section 19
of the act and substitutes the following therefor:
(2) In the case of the appeal being dismissed
by the minister, the appellant shall be deported
and the order for deportation shall not become
invalid on the ground of any lapse of time between its issuance and execution.
Honourable members will realize that during
the last five years or more it has been almost
impossible to deport anybody to any country
in Europe, and some doubts arose as to how
long a deportation order would remain valid.
The amendment removes those doubts.
That is all the bill contains, honourable
members. I think I have justified my remark
that it is unimportant and non-controversial,
and, while necessary, makes very little change
in the law.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. -Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read thé third time, and passed.

INCOME AND EXCESS PROFITS
TAXATION
FINAL

REPORT OF COMMITTEE-PART II

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
Part Two of the final report of the Special
Committee of the ýSenate appointed, to examine into the provisions and workings of the
Income War Tax Act and The Excess Profits
Tax Act, 1940, and to formulate recommendationd for the improvement, clarification and
simplification of the methods of assessment,
collection of taxes thereunder and the provisions of the said acts by redrafting tbem. if
necessary, and to report thereon.
Hon. W. D. EULER: I move the adoption
of this report. Because I understand that a
bill amending the Income War Tax Act will
be before ie house in a day or two, I do not
propose to discuss the report at any length.
In presenting Part One of the final report
some weeks ago I stated there would be two
further parts. This second part deals with suggested amendments to the act. In Part Three
it was intend.ed to deal with the administration
of the act itself by the department.
We submitted Part One as soon as possible
in the hope that it would reach the Minister
of Finance in time for him to give it serious
consideration and take cognizance of it
I want to make just one
in bis budget.
reference to a lack of action on his part,
which, I think, all members of the committee
regretted. In his budget speech Mr. Ilsley
stated that it was his intention to appoint two
boards, in one of wbicb we bave particuilar interest so far as the committee is
concerned. We had recommended the establishing of an appeal board to deal with the
discretionary powers, upwards of one hundred
in number, now held by the minister-which
really means the deputy minister. The decisien of the deputy minister is final in these
matters. We had before us representations
from important bodies, such as the Taxpayers
Association, the Canadian Bar Association, the
Chartered Accountants Association, the Certified Public Accountants Association, Boards of
Trade, and so on. They impressed upon the
committee very strongly their desire that these
matters of discretion should be referred to an
appeal board, and that once the appeal board
gave a decision it should bc conclusive and
no longer subject to any action on the part
of the minister or his deputy. The minister
has stated that he will appoint an appeal
board, but it will be merely an advisory board.
In spite of the unanimous opinion of the
rhembers of the committee, the minister has
accepted the opinion of the deputy ministerHon. NIr. ROBERTSON.

an opinion which he expressed very frankly
and very freely at the meetings of the committee.
I must express surprise that, despite the fact
that neither the recommendation of the various
organizations which I have mentioned nor our
own recommendation bas been accepted completely, I for my part have net heard a
'single protest from any of them. I am also
surprised that, with a few notable exceptions,
the press, which bas net taken a great deal of
interest in the committee's work, bas also
made very little comment or protest.
It will be obvious to the Senate that Part
Three of the report cannot be presented at
this session. It will deal with administration.
If a new committee is appointed next session
it will be necessary to call witnesses and give
very careful consideration to any, report that
may be made later. The bouse will also note
that these committees die a natural death at
the conclusion of the session. Our committee
recommends that next session a new committee be appointed, or the present committee be reconstituted, to deal with the final
mnatters which have been under discission.
Before sitting down I want again te express
my appreciation of the work of the committee. Its members were painstaking, diligent and very careful, and I think the thanks
of the bouse are due to tben for discharging
an onerous task with efficiency and satisfaction.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. JOHN J. KINLEY : Honourable
senators, I agree with the bonourable senator
that the thanks of this house are due those
who have given so much time to the work
of the committee which considered taxation.
It seems to me tbat the report from so important a committee should not go through
witbout at least a few remarks by those
interested in it. When the first part of the
report of this comnittee was before us, I
complained that we were not given suîfficient
time to properly read and digest its contents.
I am glad the chairman of the committee
acceptcd the suggestion I made and that,
accordingly. Part Two of tbe report appeared
in Hansard several dasv ago. As the hour
is now late I shall take only a few minutes
to nako sone observations.
The bonourable senator said it was his
intention to divide the report into thrce parts.
Part Two is now before us. It reocmmends,
first, tiat certain setions of the taxing statutes
secondly, that oteîor sections be
le amende
clarified, and I presume amended; and, finally,
that certain sections be re-pealcd. The report
contains a list of the items which it is said

AUGUST 14, 1946
should be changed. These are: the definition
of self contained domestie establishment; expenses not laid out to earn income; reserves;
contingent accounts or sinking funds; allowance for depreciation.; capital stock changes
by a company with undistributed income; and
continuation of liability for tax.
Honourable senators, I believe that a committee,making such recommendations as these
should give reasons and remedies. The report,
to be constructive, ought to say in what way
the acts should be amended in order to produce
the desired results. That has not been done,
The report cites opinions of such bodies as
the Canadian Bar Association, the Dominion
Associati'on of Chartered Accountants and
certain boards of tradie, but it seems to me
that we should have the opinion of this committee in a very definite manner.
I have heard a great deal about income
tax law in relation to allowances for depreciation, and I may say that I have never yet
known of a company that was not dealt with
liberally in this respect. People who are
interested in saving money for their companies, which now are making more than they
ever made before, desire above all else to
increase the amount of depreciation. It is
a vulnerable spot and often gives good results.
The same can be said of many of the other
items mentioned in the report.
May I remind honourable senators that the
other night this house without a dissenting
voice passed bills said to represent expenditures of billions of dollars-all to come from
the taxpayers. On the other hand, we hear
people say that we must reduce 'taxation.
That is always desirable, but how can it be
accomplished? There must be an in-take
before there can be an out-flow; the one is
dependent upon the other. It would be very
refreshing if the committee would present
some constructive suggestions as to how to
improve the income tax laws of this country,
instead of giving the old and rather threadbare arguments, that we so often hear. The
report says further that the sections dealing
with the taxation of non-residents, capital
stock changes by companies with undistributed
income, and deductions from gift tax, should
be clarified, but it does not say how they
should be clarified. It suggests the repeal of
certain sections, for instance, the one dealing
with transactions to avoid taxation-something
which corporations might attempt. Every
day efforts are made to avoid taxation by
transactions that can be manœuvred through
the statute. We are told that it is difficult
to make an all-inclusive statute. This would
appear to me to be the suggestion of those
who deal with the income tax law and those
63268-411

625

who pay taxes and want to pay less. It is
their privilege to come before parliament and
make representations, but the report of a
committee should embody the decisions and
findings of its members.
The honourable gentleman who presented
the report stressed the feature dealing with
ministerial discretions. The government has
brought down its budget, and we will be
asked to approve that budget before parliament prorogues. To be consistent we should
not concur in this report. The discretion of
the minister is part of government policy;
but the Senate is now asked to subscribe to
this particular recommendation by the tax
committee. The report reads:
Such a limitation of ministerial discretion
becomes all the more necessary since much to
the regret of your committee, the Minister of
Finance has not seen fit to adopt the recommendations made by your committee in Part
One of this report relating to the establishment
of a Board of Tax Appeals with authority to
review administrative discretions.
I spoke in opposition to this point of view
on the presentation of the first part of the
report, and was subsequently justified in
my opinion. For that reason, principally, I
must vote against concurrence in the report.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, is it your pleasure to concur in this
report?
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: On division.
The motion was agreed to, on division.
CUSTOMS TARIFF BILL
SECOND

READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 369, an Agt to amend
the Customs Tariff.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senstors, I have asked the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell) to handle
this bill.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
bill to amend the Customs Tariff Act and is
in the usual form. The bill is a simple one.
It contains a schedule embodying changes with
respect to thirty-five 'items. Twelve of these
changes have been in force under order in

force by statute. Fourteen items were introduced in the budget resolutione last year but
were not proceeded with, and the remaining

PROBLEM Is

URGENT.

Your committee notes that of all the witnesses heard not one opposed the general
principle of immigration into Canada. There
was unanimous accord that immigrants should
be admitted, subject to the qualifications that
immigrants should be carefully selected and
that admissions should not exceed the number
which can be absorbed from time to time
without creating conditions of unemployment,
reducing the standard of living or otherwise
endangering the Canadian economy.
There was a consensus of opinion that immigration is of major importance to Canada, for
increases in population are necessary if we
are to hold our place abroad and maintain
and improve our standard of living at home.
Other countries are taking action and world
conditions are changing rapidly, so that the
problem for Canada is extremely urgent.
All were agreed that Canada, as a humane
and Christian nation, should do her share
towards the relief of refugees and displaced
persons.
Your committee finds that the problem of
immigration falls into three general divisions,
that is agricultural .industrial and domestic.
and in this report we will deal with them in
that order.

AGRICULTURAL PossIBILITIES.

Canada lias a vast area, given in statistics
as 3,466,882 square miles, but obviously only
a limited portion of this great space is suitable
for agriculture as the art is at present understood. There are now in Canada approximately 735,000 occupied farms with an area
of approximately 175,000,000 acres. Of these
acres, about 89,000,000 are cultivated and
53,000,000 are in prairie or natural pasture,
leaving 33,000,000 as occupied but unused.
The Canada Year Book for 1945 gives the
agricultural lands of Canada, both presently
available and potential as 350,000,000 acres,
which after deducting the occupied area leaves
175,000,000 acres as unoccupied, but much of
what is classified as unoccupied farm land is
really not presently available for settlement.
There is really little factual data upon which
to base an estimate of the amount of unused
agricultural land in Canada available for
settlement. Dr. Booth, of the Economic Branch
of the Canadian Department of Agriculture,
recently stated that there are about 27,000,000
acres of unused and reasonably accessible land
suitable for agricultural settlement, which
would provide from 150,000 to 160,000 farms.
The Canadian Pacific Railway bas still available for settlement 1,307,876 acres, a considerable percentage of which it describes as "good
land". The Hudson Bay Company bas an
unsold land estate of 822,000 acres, not all of
which is usable. Several million acres of land
in the western provinces can be made available by irrigation. Much of the land classed
as occupied is uncultivated and unused. The
census of 1941 showed more than 32,000 abandoned or totally idle farms, aggregating
approximately 5,000,000 acres.
Whatever the statistics may be, informed
witnesses who appeared before your committee were agreed that the area of Canada's
unused agricultural resources was very great
and that its development would add greatly
to Canada's wealth and importance.
AWAITING CULTIVATION.

We were told that Canada's unused agricultural opportunities are great and valuable,
and are waiting to be turned into wealth by
industry, that is to say by an intelligent application of human effort. This opinion is in
accord with our own knowledge of unoccupied areas and of the inadequate use made
of some of that which is occupied. We know
that there is a definite shortage of farm
labour.
Our present extensive. valuable and highly
productive agricultural plantation is the result
of a gradual development brought about by
much enterprise and labour, sustained over

AUGUST 14, 1946
a considerable period of time. This development is based origînally upon immigration, for
Canadians are ail, with, f ew exceptions, either
immigrants or the descendants of immigrants.
Future progress in agricultural expansion and
develppment will be undesiýably- slow if we
depend entirely upon our own natural increase,
but what has been accomplished ini agriculture
in the past by immigration, given comparable
opportunity, may be repeated in part at least
in the future. If our progress in the years
to come is to compare at ail favourably with
that of the past, it too must be based in part
on immigration, intelligently directed and
sustained from year to year.
As much of our land available for settlement
is controlled 'by the provincial governments,
and as the Provinces are interested in possible
increases in agricultural. population, consultation with the Provinces in this connection is
suggested.

productive industries of our latent resources,
for artizans skilled in new trades or mýasters
of old ones, and, for scientific technicians of
ahl kinds. Such men increase our employment
possibilities.
We speak from experience. The woollen,
fabric and pottery trades were brought ,to
England by refugees. Most qf our own industries have been founded in %e first place on
imported skills, and even during the recent
war years Canada has benefited considerably
from the special knowledge and managerial
enterprise of refugees. Your committee has
heard evidence as to the results of the creative
enterprise of some of these newcomers. They
are said to have ereated one hundred new
industries in this country . Examples were
given of the establishment of new industries
in Canada based upon scientifie knowledge
and skill brought here by immigrants.

INDUSTRIAL IMMIGRATION.

Canada has much to offer to such men. We
have raw materials in abundance, together
with power and transportation. We have local
markets and we bave access to the trade routes
of the world including those of our great
ncighhour, the United States. Industrial
opportunities arc here, but to ha accepted they
must be offered in a practical businesslike way,
baeked by a generoue and consistent immigration policy.
A settled immigration policy and a sustaîned
eff ort is necessary if any real succese is to be
achieved in attractîng immigrants of the type
indicated. Worthwhile men of skill and enterprise d'o nlot lightly pull up stakes in the land
of their bîrth in order to emigrate into new
and unknown conditions, but experience proves
that there are such men abroad and that they
are wiUling to comne to this country. The
presently disturbed condition of the world
presents an opportunity to Canada in this
regard which will ba largely lost if too long
delayed. Our agents should be in Europe
now searching out and interesting those whom
we want and preparing for the time when shipping will become available. Time is an element in such migrations for men of the type
indicated must know what they are doing.

Canadian economy bas changed greatly since
the early immigrants into Canada laid axe to
tree or struck long furrows in the Middle
West. There has been a continuous industrial
development taking place, a movement which
was greatly accelerated during the recent great
war. In 1943, manufacturing produced 54 per
cent of ýCanada's total production. Wartime
diversification 'brought about new degrees of
employment and incomre.
W-hile agriculture is still of major importance
in our economy, and will increase in importance with possible improvements in farm
practice, a concurrent industrial progress is
also important and must be sustained if we
are to maintain and improve our present coinparatively hîgh standards of living.
Your committee heard evidence to the effeet
that immigration coulds be made to aid greatly
in our industrial development and that intelligently sedected immigrants in the managerial,
technical and artizan classifications would
increase employment, rather than taking work
from those already here. We were told that
our need is for key personnel, for men who tan
do things with our resources and potentials
nlot now used, or who can improve on methods
now in use. There is evidence that we need
men willing te undergo heavy labour, as we
did when our railroads were being built and
our lands were being cleared. Those who
devote themnselves to the promotion of new
enterprise, to highly informed management,
and to technical and scientific skills, create
employmient for others, and this is particularly
the case in Canada where, se many resolirces
are unused and so many opportunîties are
lying idle. Our greatest need is for "entrepreneurs" whvo have the capatity to make

MATERIALS IN ABUNDANCE.

NEED For DoMESTIC HELP.

Your committee was advised that many
public institutions such as hospitals and homes
for aged people and other public institutions
are handicapped by a shortage of domestie
help. It was stated that in Europe there are
numbers of womnen, experienced in housekeepîng, who would ha happy indeed were they
admitted to Canada to work as domesties in
public and private homes.

SENATE
LABOUR NOT OPPOSED.

Organized labour is not opposed to immigration as has been suggested. The presidents
of the Canadian Congress of Labour and the
Trades and Labour Congress of Canada both
assured your committee that their great organizations were in favour of immigration, provided it did not reduce the Canadian standard
of living which they have struggled so long
to improve. Labour is definitely opposed to
the improper use of immigration to provide
a pool of cheap and docile workers, but it will
support a selective immigration designed to
develop our resources and thus give additional
work to our people. Labour is of opinion that
Canada should do ber share with the other
nations of the world to solve the refugee
problem, and that we should grant refuge to
our fîull quota of displaced persons, even
though it may cost something, so long as it
does not adversely affect our living standards.
RAILWAYs.

Canada's great railway systems both maintain departments of agriculture and industrial
colonization and development. These departments are under the direction of well informed
experts in farming and industry whose duty
it is to promote enterprise in Canada in
ever way that is sound and practical. These
men bave gathered a vast fund of knowledge
as to Canada's resources and opportunities for
enterprise, and they -pend t heitime in energetically bringing together the may and the
opening, the demand and the supply. It is
to the credit of both the Canadian National
Railwav and the Canadian Pacifie Railway
that this work has been maintained courageou-lv throughout even the non-immigration and stagnation years whieh followed the
outbreak of the First Great War. Canada is
indebted to its railways for the active encouragement they have given in the past to immigration and settlement, the founding of new
industries, tourist traffle and foreign trade, and
for the access which they provide to millions
upon millions of used and 0nnused acres. Your
committee is indebted to its railway witnesses
for their informed optimism as to Canada's
possibilities, which sums up in the phrase"the resources are there; thte problem is to put
them to use."
Ocean steamship companies have co-operated
with the Canadian railways in the past in
bringing immigrants to Canada, but shipping
losses during the war have been heavy. A
representative of the Cunard White Star and
Donaldson Atlantic lines expressed to your
committee bis company's faith in Canada's
resources and ber powers of expansion, but
stated that ships are costly and that an
announcer'nt by the Government of Canada

of a long-term immigration policy is necessary
to the institution by his company of a shipbuilding programme.
The Swedish-American line is now carrying
immigrants from Scandinavian countries to the
United States by the war-famous Gripsholi
and a sister ship, and a representative of that
company assured your committee that arrangements could be made to have these ships and
additional tonnage which is being secured call
at Halifax ta land immigrants so soon as
Canada is prepared to admit them.
THE ACT.
Canada's Immigration Act, as it has been
for many years past, is a non-immigration aci.
Its main purpose seems to be exclusion. The
object in view in most of its sections is to
keep people out, not let tlem in; and the
authority to amend the law which is given to
the executive has been used by order in council to prohibit all immigration, with very
restricted exceptions. Little is to be gained
by a discussion of the act in its detail. What
is needed is a new policy of selective attraction to replace that of repulsion. and a vigorois administration that wi]l
scareh out a
reasonable number of immigrants wio are
desirable and then find means of bringing
them here and of assisting them in being
successful after their arrival. They should be
welcomed and taught the advantages of life
in this country, and be made into Canadian
citizens in spirit as well as in fact as rapidly
as possible.
The unenviable task of our Immigration
Department during the past years has been
almost entirely negative. A great battery of
letter writers has been engaged in explaining
why nothing can be done and in making the
best case possible out of every excuse. Our
immigration officials would indeed be happy
to see the last of such a policy.
Any suggestion of discrimination based upon
either race or religion should be scrupulously
avoided both in the act and in its administration, the limitation of Asiatic immigration
being based, of course, on problems of absorption. Unnecessary and technical restrictions
such as the requirement of direct travel from
the country of origin, the possession of funds
when support is made available by others, and
mere degrees of consanguinity or relationship,
should be cleared away, leaving to those in
charge the freest exercise of discretion in the
choice of those desirable, when not admissible
as ,of right, having due regard for priority to
those brought liere on the responsibility of
friends or relatives.

RELATIVES AND FRIENDS.

DESIRABLE.

After a careful consideration of the evidence

submitted, your committee is of opinion that
it is desirable that immigrants lie admitted to
Canada in substantial numbers, and coinmencing so soon as possible. -Canada's ability
to support a substantial increase in population
is beyond question. The wisdom, of Canada
witliholding frbim the crowded lands of Europe
access to lier vast areas and unused resources
is at least open to doulit.
The immigrants admitted sliould be carefully selected. Canada shoulti not stand
inactively by, accepting passively those who
apply. Government agencies shoulti vigorously seardli out those xwho by dharacter and
skill in industry or agriculture may be expected
to enbance our human resources as a nation
and to add tc, our productive power.
People from. the British Isles have the
advantage of common language and a wellgrounded understand-ing of Canadian political
institutions and modes of living, but no definite rules can be laid down in this regard.
Great Britain's manpower should not lie
depleted by large scale migration, nor la anything of the kind likely to lie encouraged by
the British government. An invitation sliould
be extended and facilities afforded for those
of cliaracter and ability who care to, corne.
Gooti prospective immigrants are not confineti to any one locality. Your committee
lias been greatly impressed with the accomplîshments in Canada of the men and women
from. aIl parts of Europe wlio came liere in
considerable numbers in the 'years preceding
the First Great War.
AvAILABILITY.

Tliat desirable immigrants in considerable
numbers are available now is well established.
Europe is still ini a sadly disturbeti condition
and many good citizens wlio at one time were
engaged successfully in industry or agriculture
are now in sad pliglit, and are looking for
opportunities to start life anýew. Sucli people
cannot lie found liy office men in Ottawa,
mudli less scrutinized and assorted. They must
lie searcheti out liy agents of our government
operating in the localities where tliey are to
lie found. If Canada is to secure those wlio
are likely to prove the greatest assets, we
must take the initiative; we must go to them,
and if their migration is to lie a success for
both tliemselves and Canada tliey should lie
guidcd and assisted, and, in some degree supervised, until they bave become established. In
this way we may prevent our immigration
heing offset and ' its population lienefits
destroyed by emigration, as lias been the case
su markedly in the past.
63268-42

Immigrants wio, corne to Canada on the
responsibility Of relatives or friends already
here enjoy a real advantage over those who
arrive as complete strangers. The riglit to,
bring relatives and friends here is a privilege
whicli our government may well extend to
Canadian citizens. This principle lias already
been irecognized, by the governinent in an
order in council dated the 28th May, 1946,
P.C. 2071.
Successive orders in counicil passed in 1931,
1937 and 1944, have so altered the administration of the Immigration Act as to prohibit
the landing in Canada of immigrants of al
classes and occupations, with certain very
limited.exceptions, and to these exceptions the
order cited lias added' the following paragrapli:
(a) The father or mother. the unmarried son or
daughter eighteen years or over, the unmarried
brother or sister, the orphan nephew or niece
under sixteen years ?f age, of any person legally
admitted to and resident in Canada, who la in
a position to receive and care for such relatives.
The terrm "orphan" used in this clause means a
child bereaved of both parents.
The committee sees no good reason for the
exclusion of married sons and daughters,
brothers and sisters andi of nephews and nieces
wliether orphaned or otherwise and whether
under or over sixteen years of age. These are
but techaicalities, giving the impression of a
grudging opening of the door. What really
clounts is whether the prospective immigrants
are healthy, willing to work and capable of
taking their part in Canadian life, in whicli
case the fact of relatives already here,. assuming responsibility and guaranteeing assistance,
is an advantage, to the immigrant so great as
to justify a priority, and to this consideration
is to, be addied the freedom which. we should
give to our own citizens to, extenti the hand
of fellowship to their unfortunate relatives and
friends sabroad. Sucli privileges miglit well lie
extended to friends as welI as relatives. The
admission of sucli people so soon as shipping is
available will no doulit constitute, our first
post-war migration to this country. With the
assistance of their ýCanadian connections, tliey
can -he easily assimilated into, the Canadian
econ'omy and present no problemns of
absorption.
ORGANIZATION DISBANnxo.

The order in couneil lias meant nothing to,
date, however, for practically no immigrants
are being admitted, whetlier relatives or otherwise, nor are any steps being taken with a
view to future admission.
When the war 'broke out in 1939, Canada lad

making medtical and other inspections at Paris,
Hamburg, Danzig,
Antwerp, Rotterdam,

SENATE

Gdynia and Riga. There were also officers at
Hong Kong, as well as inspectional offices at
London, Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast in
the United Kingdom, assisted by a Canadian
roster of British medical doctors at points
throughout the United Kingdom.
This organization was disbanded on the outbreak of war and there have been practically
no new-comers from Europe or Asia since the
commencement of hostilities, nor since its
close, other than the recent arrivals of wives
and children of service men. What passenger
shipping remains from the wartime sinkings
has lbeen engaged exclusively in the task ,of
repatriation of Cana-da's overseas army and
service-men's dependents, a condition which
will likely continue until about the end- of the
year. With the greater availability of passenger shipping on the conclusion of repatriation operations, we should be in a position te
bring immigrants to Canada.
But the war has been over for many months,
and the immigration and inspection staffs
should now bc returned to their former
European stations. People desiring to immigrate should not be kept in doubt until the
last problem of shipping lias been solved. If
visas are issued, many may find means of solving their own transportation problems. The
first step is to open our Eturopean offices, an
action which should no longer be delayed.
MANY APPLICATIoNS.
At the present time there is no dearth of
applications both from Canadian citizeos seeking admission of relatives and friends, and of
persons desiring to come. Some difficulty may
be occasioned by other governments refusing
to allow their nationals to depart, but subject
to this the Director of Canadian Immigration
anticipates no difficulty in finding such immigrants as are desired, or in setting up departmental machinery for their inspection, selection and admission.
POLISH PROSPECTS.

Your committee has been informed that
there are a large number of prospective Polish
immigrants desirous of admission to Canada.
A considerable number of these are soldiers
who fought under General Crerar. At the end
of 1945 there were over 200,000 in the Polish
armed forces fighting on the Allied side. Some
of the-e men are now in the United Kingdom.
As they were of military age, they are men
in the prime of life, aboit 60 per cent being
farmers by profession, and all having some
training in the mechanical arts. All the arts
and professions are represented. Since this
committee was appointed the government
has announced that. in accordance with an
agreenent with the United Kingdom. 4,000 of
these Polish soldiers are te be admitted to

Canada under a provision that they shall
remain on farms for at least two years.
In addition there are said to be thousands
of Polish "displaced persons" and former prisoners of war who were found in German
camps or wandering about at the close of hostilities. The numbers are indefinite, but the
evideñce is that a very considerable number
of men and women of this nationality, in the
prime of life, most of them having valuable
skill and nearly all having some material
resourees, form a human reservoir upon which
Canada may draw.
UKRAINIANs

AvAILABLE.

There would appear to bc at least an equal
number of refugees and displaced persons of?
Ukrainian origin in the camps of Germany
or drifting about Europe. Some millions of
men and women were driven by the Germans
from the territories they occupied, to be used
as slave labour. The home country of these
people has been devastated, and it is thought
that many would welcome an opportunity to
re-commence life in Canada. How suitable
they are for settlement could be learned by
careful investigations where they are, and by
no other means. Our agents should be in
Europe now engaged in this work, for if they
are such people as the Ukrainian settlers wlo
came to Canada in the years preceding the
last war, they will possess characteristies of
intelligence and industry which may well contribute to Canada's development.
OTHER NATIONAL ORIGINS.

Representatives of Canadians of Czechoslovak, Finnish, Polish, Ukrainian and other
national origins testified te your committee
as to the contribution made by their people
te Canada's agricultural and industrial development and as te the desire of those who may
be described as "new Canadians" for a reasonable policy of immigration. They agreed that
it should be carefulv selective, with preference
and priority te those with relatives or friends
already established in Canada.
Well informed witnesses told your committee that immigrants from the Baltie countries, Holland and Denmark are available, and
that they are highly desirable people from
the Canadian point of view.
Representatives of the Canadian Jewish
Congress laid emphasis on the terrible losses
and sufferings of the Jewish populations of
Europe and asked that in Canadian immigratien law and administration-there be no discrimination on account of religion or race. A
plea was made for the admission to Canada
of "displaced' persons in Europe, and particularly of unfortunate children.

AUGUST 14, 1946
REFUGEES.
Canadians are a Christian people, very
human and very ready to discharge their
Canada with her vast
moral obligations.
space and great resources has surely some
responsibility for the unfortunate among the
war-torn peoples of Europe. It is not right
that we should entirely close our doors against
the victims of world upheaval, and particularly
the children.
In immigration statistical classifications the
tçrm "refugee" is not used, and there is no
way in which exact figures may be supplied.
The term "refugee" has acquired a much
wider application during the past eight or
nine years. After the First World War it
applied mostly to those who had lost both
homes and citizenship; later it applied to all
who because of political, religious, racial, or
economic troubles, actual or threatened, were
forced or induced to move. While immigrants
are net shown in the statistical records as
"refugees", it is well known that the majority
of immigrants from continental Europe in
recent years belong to that category.
In the years 1938 and 1939 many continental refugees with varying amounts of capital were admitted.
In 1939 over 300 -Czech families and about
100 single men, who had to leave the Sudeten
area on its occupation by Germany. were
brought to Canada and settled on the land.
This movement would have been considerably
larger but for the outbreak of war.
In 1940-41 individual groups of Belgian,
Czech and Netberland nationals, totalling
several hundred persons, entered Canada as
refugees.
In 1940 a considerable number of civilian
refugees, most of whom were given asylum in
the United Kingdom some months prior to
the outbreak of war, were transferred from
temporary internment camps in England to
civilian internment camps in Canada; about
1,000 of these were subsequently released in
Canada.
Following the fall of France arrangements
were made for the entry of Polish engineers
and technicians from that country. About 800
came to Canada, some with their families.
They were employed at war work.
In 1941 approximately 300 European refugees were admitted from the Far East. About
fifty have come forward following the close
of the war, they having been prevented from
sailing in 1941 due to Japan's attack on Pearl
Harbor.
In 1944 one hundred and sixty-two families,
comprising 450 persons, were admitted to
Canada from the Iberian Peninsula.
The entry to Canada from unoccupied
France of 1,000 Jewish orphaned children was
63268-42i

approved in 1942, but the subsequent control

of that country by Germany prevented t 1 e
transfer of these children being effected. During the war period many individuals and
families of the refugee class who succeeded in
getting beyond enemy control were allowed
entry to Canada; these would total several
hundred.
By order in council P.C. 6687 of the 26th
October, 1945, authority was given to grant
permanent status to refugees who entered
Canada as such subsequent ta September 1,

1939.
MINO

CONCEsSIoNS MADE.

By orders in council P.C. 2070 and P.C. 2071
of May 28, 1946, provision has been made for
the waiving of the passport requirements for
displaced persons, and an extending of the
classes of immigrants admissible to Canada
on the basis of relationship to residents of
this country. In a statement made in the
House of Commons on May 29 last, Hon. J. A.
Glen, the minister, said in part:
The action taken is intended as a short-term
measure ta provide for the admission to Canada
of approved persons who can be both maintained until established and provided with
housing by relatives, and ta meet in some
measure the pressing demands being made on
behalf of refugees or displaced persons having
relatives in Canada, anxious ta provide them
with homes.
On July 8, in the House of Commons, the
Prime Minister made reference ta the above
mentioned regulations, and added in part as
follows:
The action taken is intended as a short term
measure ta provide some early and partial relief
in a number of individual cases. The general
problem of refugees, because of its magnitude,
can only be resolved by the United Nations as a
whole. Canada participated fully .in the study
given ta it by the Social and Economic Council
-at its recent meeting in New York and will join
with other members of the council at the meeting which is scheduled for August 30, when a
recommendation is expected ta be submitted for
approval by the general assembly for the establisment of a United Nations Refugee Organization.
Your committee is of opinion that preference
should be given to those refugees who are
bona fide immigrants, and thus intend to make
Canada their permanent home.

STATES.
Other countries are giving the lead in the
matter of immigration. Since 1820 the United
States has admitted immigrants to the number of 38,461,396, a fact which explains in no
small measure the wealth, power and world
influence now enjoyed by that country. In
the years 1905-6-7-10-13 and 14, admissions

UNITED

were over one million annually.

The rate

decreased sharply with the opening of the

634

SENATE

First Great War, and a quota system was
adopted in 1924. The quota now stands at
153,774 annually, though the actual admissions between 1925 and 1944 have averaged
64,036 per annum. During the war years from
1939 to 1944 inclusive, the number of immigrants bas averaged 46,386, including the nonquota countries such as Canada, Newfoundland,
Mexico, Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic,
the Canal Zone, and the independent countries
of Central and South America.
Since the conclusion of hostilities immigration bas been a subject of extensive discussion
in the United States, and on 22 December,
1945, President Truman by proclamation
recommended the full utilization of current
quotas for displaced persons in Europe. The
President issued a directive to the appropriate
high state officials to facilitate the entry of
such persons. He mentioned the importance
of caring for the orphaned children of Europe.
Visas, be said, sh.ould be distributed fairly
among persons of all faiths, creeds and nationalities. The United States War Shipping
Administration was directed to provide the
necessary arrangements for water transportation from the port of embarkation in Europe
to the United, States, subject to the provision
that the movement of immigrants will in no
way interfere with the scheduled return of
service personnel and their spouses and children
from the European theatre.
In

purcuance

of

tiis

preidentiai

policy,

nearly 1,000 refugees from Nazi concentration
camps arrived by army transport at New York
on Miay 20 last. They were understood to be
the first arrivals only.
GREAT BRIrAIN.

Britain is a crowded country, with a population of 500-to the square mile as compared
with 44 per square mile in the United States
and 3+ to ,the square mile in Canada; yet the
United Kingdom bas never closed ber doors
against the refugee from Nazi oppression.
From the beginning of the war until now as
many as 200,000 refugees entered Britain. In
June, 1944, it was officially stated that refugees
were being admitted at the rate of 800 a month.
AUSTRALIA.

The Australian government bas already
announced a large-scale immigratÉion policy
for Australia, to commence se soon as demobilization, and re-employment of the fighting
forces is sufficiently advanced, additional
houses have been provided te meet the
demands of an increased population, and shipping to transport the immigrants bas been
secured. Australia is not satisfied te merely
wait for these things. She is reported to be
reconverting Liberty cargo ships into passenger

boats. She bas fixed a quota at 70,000 per
year and bas undertaken a publicity campaign
te explain te prospective immigrants the
causes of delay. Arrangements have recently
been made between the governments of Australia and the United Kingdom for free passage te Australia of British ex-service men and
their dependents. Assistance will also be
given te British civilian immigrants and their
dependents. The Government of Australia
has also approved in principle the bringing te
Australia during the first three years following
the war of 50,000 orphans from war devastated
areas.

CONCLUSIONs.
In conclusion, your committee expresses its
opinion that what is required for Canada is
a well-considered and sustained policy of
immigration, selective in character and pursued by Canadian authorities with initiativp
and enterprise. We should seek out the individual migrants whom we want who will contribute to our industrial and agricultural
economy and who will assist in maintaining
our high standards of living by increasing proportionately our productive power, and in
addition whose mentality and education will
fit them for taking part in Canada's political,
economic and social life. What we require is
a steady flow in reasonable number of good
settler,
oti urban and rural, raliher tian anv
excited or spasmodic rush, with regard, of
course, to the varying economic conditions and
needs of the country from time te time.
Successful immigration can be secured only
by careful and intelligent planning, and sustained over a number of years. Continuity
of policy is essential to great and lasting
success.

Nor is success te be gauged by the number
of immigrants we land at our ports, if they are
in fact but birds of passage whose ultimate
destination is some other country. Success is
to be counted in the number of people permanently and successfully settled in Canada.
This is one reason why those immigrants with
relatives or friends already here and established in Canada are se greatly te be preferred.
Continued touch with the settler after his
arrival, for the purpose of guidance, assistance
and encouragement, is important. Some means
sbould Le found of giving useful information
and sound advice to the new-comers as to
Canadian opportunities and conditions.
There are problems to be solved both at
iome and abroad. For example, the social
s;ecurity meaure,
veterans bencfits, churci,
trade union and otier relations wieh the
migrant will Icave in hi s homeland. and low
compensating benefits may be extended to him
iere, sLotildi be thorougliy studied and con-

635

AUGUST 14, 1946
sidered. Inter-governmental agreements may
be possible, so that the migrant will leave with
the approval and assistance of his national
authorities. It might be arranged that he
need not entirely abandon all his former state
benefits. Why should he not carry forward to
the new ]and the Unemployment Insurance
credits which he has built up in the old?
All such problems are largely administrative,
and they suggest what may be accomplished by
an energetic immigration department, properly
financed and intelligently directed.
Australia is already engaged in surveys and
other activities of this kind. Canada also
should be moving. The immigration problem
is urgent. Action should be immediate, as
otherwise opportunities will have passed or
been seized by others.
Canada can be well served- at this juncture
by men of action, good judgment and vision.
RECoMMENDATIONS.

Your committee therefore recommends that:
1. Announcement immediately by the Government of Canada of a policy of selective
immigration into Canada of both agricultural
and industrial workers.
2. That such immigration be limited in numbers to what from time to time appears to be
the absorptive capacity of the country, and by
practical considerations of transport and
establishment> and be subject ta the shipping
priority of service men and their dependents
and other Canadian citizens.
3. That in anticipation of shipping becoming
available for immigration purposes:
(a) Canada's immigration policy be published in appropriate foreign countries with
explanations as to the unavoidable delay.

(b) That forthwith. Canadian immigration
and inspection officers be dispatched to
Europe, and offices be opened with a view to
meeting prospective immigrants and the
selection of those most desirable.
(c) That surveys be undertaken immediately in Europe to determine the 'localities
where immigrants may be found and the 'conditions and anticipated problems to be met.
(d) That survey be undertaken in Canada
in order to determine the agricultural and
industrial resources available for use by prospective immigrants and the conditions and
anticipated problems to be met.
(e) That the Immigration Ministry at once
make studies and lay plans for an immigration movement and promptly take steps to
implement such a policy.
4. That everything possible be done to make
shipping available, subject to the above mentioned repatriation, and thereupon priority be
given to the relatives in all degrees and to the
friends of Canadian citizens who assume
responsibility for the care and establishment
of the new-comer, and, who are well able and
willing to give guarantees.
5. That the Immigration Act and regulations be revised to provide for the finding and
selection of immigrants, the admission of those
most desirable, and for the supervision and
assistance of the new-comers until established
in Canada.
A copy of the Minutes of 'Proceedings, and
evidence taken before the Committee is
appended.
All which is respectfully submitted.

Chairman.

30 & 31 Vict.
C.3.

Short title
and
citation.

"51.-(1) The number of members of the House of Commons
ha
e
shall be two hundred and fifty-five and the representation of the

section and thereafter on the completion of each decennial census be
readjusted by such authority, in such manner, and from such time as
the Parliament of Canada from time to time provides, subject and
according to the following rules:1. Subject as hereinafter provided, there shall be assigned
to each of the provinces a number of members computed by
dividing the total population of the provinces by two hundred
and fifty-four and by dividing the population of each province
by the quotient so obtained, disregarding, except as hereinafter
in this section provided, the remainder, if any, after the said
process of division.
2. If the total number of members assigned to all the
provinces pursuant to rule one is less than two hundred and
fifty-four, additional members shall be assigned to the provinces
(one to a province) having remainders in the computation under

shall be assigned to the said province a number of members
equal to the said number of senators.

respect of a province then, for the purpose of computing the
number of members to be assigned to the provinces in respect
of which rules one and two continue to apply, the total population of the provinces shall be reduced by the number of the
population of the province in respect of which rules one and two
have ceased to apply and the number two hundred and fiftyfour shall be reduced by the number of members assigned to
such province pursuant to rule three.
5. Such readjustment shall not take effect until the ternination of the then existing Parliament.
(2) The Yukon Territory as constituted by Chapter forty-one

included therein by the Parliament of Canada for the purposes of
representation in Parliament, shall be entitled to one member."

2. This Act may be cited as the British North America Act, 1946,
and the British North America Acts, 1867 to 1943, and this Act may be
cited together as the British North America Acts, 1867

The motion was postponed.
LORD ELGIN HOTEL
MOTION FOR RETURN

Hon. W. J. HARMER moved:
That an order of the senate do issue for a
return showing:1. A copy o all correspondence between any
department of the Government and the City of
Ottawa, the Federal District Commission, the
Ford Hotel Company Limited and any other
organizations or other parties; pertaining to the

2. Copy of any agreements, leases and undertakings in connection with the location, style
of architecture, class of construction and the
terms and conditions of the contract for the
construction of said hotel,
3. Copy of any agreement with the company
operating the Lord Elgin Hotel, Ottawa.
Hon. Mer. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I am advised that it is the practice to
consider correspondence between. government
departments as privileged, and I do net think
this practice should be violated. I am advised

also that there is no correspondence of the
kind I have referred to. However, with the
deletion of the words "the Federal District

Hon. Mr. HARMER: Honourable senators,
I am quite agreeable to the deletion.
The motion, amended as proposed, was
agreed to.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL BILL
SECOND

READING

POSTPONED-SUBJECT-

M ATTER REFERRED

TO

COMMITTEE

On the Order:
Resuming the adjourned debate on the
motion of Hon. Mr. .Iayden for the second
reading of Bill 195, an Act respecting the control of the acquisition and disposition of foreign
currency and the control of transactions involving foreign currency or non-residents.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Honourable senators,
I move in amendment to the motion for
second reading of this bill:
That the said bill be not now read the second
time, but that the subject matter thereof he
referred te the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce for consideration and report.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, may I say a word on the amendment
proposedi by the chief government whip?
Foreign exehange control is an important
question; one on which many honourable senators have very definite views. On the other
band, because the question is se technical and
involved, there are some who, like myself,
desire to hear expert evidence on the subject
before committing themrselves on the principle
of the bill. I am hoping, therefore, that the
Senate will approve of this suggestion.
I believe it is thoroughly in accordance with
parliamentary procedure te have the subjectmatter referred to a committee for investigation, the bill in the meantime standing until
the committee makes its report. Further, it
seems to me that not only is this procedure
desirable in the present instance, but that
we miglt well consider making more use of
it in the future. We have sometimes accepted
the principle of a bill and given it second reading on the understanding that it might be
amended at a later stage if the house so
desired. How closely that process conforms
to correct parliamentary procedure I do not
know.
We were given a very lucid explanation of
the present bill, but some honourable senators would like additional information, and
while perhaps the responsibility of furnishing
it rests primarily on me as a member of the
administration, I frankly confess my inability
to do justice te the occasion. If the motion
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

of the honourable senator from Wellington
(Hon. Mr. Howard) is concurred in, honourable members who desire further information
before voting on the second reading will be
able to obtain it in committee, and no harm
will be done to other honourable members who
feel that they are already sufficiently conversant with the subject-matter.
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
Honourable
senators, during this session on several occasions we have had to consider an amendment
moved on the motion for the second reading
of a bill. Our rules are quite definite in
regard to amendments on second reading.
The procedure now proposed is out of the
ordinary, and there is no provision for such a
proceeding or motion under the rules or
practice of the Senate or of the House of
Commons; but I find that on July 2, 1940,
a minister in another place, before there had
been any debate on the principle of the bill,
moved in amendment te the motion for
second reading:
That the said bill be not now read the second
time, but that the subject-inatter thereof he
refer redt te the Standing Ceonmittee on Banking
and Commerce for consideration and report.
This is the nearest approach I can find to
a precedrnt for te motion that bas just been
suggestedi. The bill is of such importance, and
of such a character, that I eau well understand
the desire of members to bave an opportunity
of consulting the minister and officers of bis
department. This desire having been expressed
by thie leaders of both parties in the Senate,
an
there being apparently no dissenting
voic, under the circumstances I will accept
the, motion. But I should like to impres upon
the Senate that this is not good practiceHon. Mr. CALDER:

Hear, hear.

The Hon. the SPEAKER:-and I hope it
will not be resorted to except upon rare and
unuual occasions. I will now put the motion.
It is moved by Senator Howard. seconded
by Sena tor Vien. that the said bill be not now
read the second time, but that the -ubjectmnatter thereof be referred to the Standing
Comnittee on Banking and Commerce for
consideration and report.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: I entirely agree with
His Honour the Speaker that this procedure
should not be regarded as a precedent. In
general we should adhere to our rules. In this
particuliar case, however, our group on this
side are in favour of the proposed reference to
a committee, because the matter is very difficult and complicated and already there have
been violent differences of opinion with regard
to it.

Now I want to make a few remarks as te
the bill itself. I do not intend to say anything

AUGUST 15, 1946
that will provoke further speeches at this time,
but as all honourable members who* so
far have spoken on the motion for second
reading have been on the government side,
I think I ought to make clear where. we on
this side stand, in order that there may be no
misapprehension. The bill is a most important
one. By and large, we of our party are anxious to get away from controls as soon as
possible.
We think that is fundamental. If I had
the ability to make as able a speech as was
made yesterday by the honourable gentleman
frorn Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), I would
make that very speech, because it expressed
precisely our views on the issue.
At the present time the Foreign Exchange
Control Board is operating by virtue of an
order in council. Under legislation passed last
session, that order in council remains effective
until fifteen days after the opening of the
next session; so if the session opens at the
end of January, the order in council will be
good until the 15th of February. There is
now on the order paper of another place a
bill whiqh would extend the life of the order
for an additional forty-five days. This added
to the fifteen days would mean a total of sixty
days after the opening of the next session. I
understandr-I can only speak from gossipthat ail parties in the other place are agreeable to allowing that bill to be passed. If it
is passed and the next session does not open
before the end of January, we shal be able
to *atch the operations of the board up to
the end of Mýarch, when we shouldi be in a
much better position than we are now to give
proper consideration to a bill such as the one
before us. As was pointed out by the honVancouver-Burrard
from
ourable senator
(Hon. Mr. McGeer), we are almost at the end
of a long and busy session, in which probably
more legislation has been passed than in any
other session during the last forty years except,
maybe, that of 1934. It is only natural that at
this time the members of both houses should
be a little tired.
I am opposed to the present bill-lock,
stock and barrel. There may be some need
to continue the control for a year or two,
and if the experts can satisfy us that that is
so I wilýl vote for the bill, provided a time
But as the honourable
limit is specified.
member from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
very ably-I use the word advisedly-pointed
out to this house, the powers given to the
board in the bill are extraordinary. Many of
them are not being used at present, and in
any event these must be stricken out, so that
the bill imay not confer any more powers than
the board actually needs.

641

To my mind, if the board is to be continued
the bill should provide that it is to be for only
a very limited period. We are living in queer
times. The Peace Conference at Paris bears
out that statement to a marked degree. Apparently the conference is going to break down,
and we do not know what will happen.
Throughout the difficult period of the war
our party in this house co-operated with the
government in every way possible. We are just
as willing to co-operate in this difficult period
of peace; but we do not intend by our vote,
however limited it may be, to fasten on the
people of this country legislation such as this,
which it might take years and years to get
rid of. That is our position. I state it candidly in order that there may be no misunderstanding. We will support the motion to have
this subject-matter referred to a committee.
Our group did not intend to move the six
months' hoist, but I can say that if the
motion of the honourable senator from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer) for the
six months' hoist had come to a vote we
would have supported it, because then the
question would have been clearly on the
principle of the bill.
On behalf of our group I say that we agree
to the reference, and we will help the committee prepare the best possible bill. If the
bill that comes from the committee suits us,
we will vote for it; if it does not, we will vote
against it.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I am opposed to this measure,
opposed to it outright, and I cannot imagine
any amendments which would make it acceptable to a man of my type. We know enough
about this bill to dispose of it now.
A great deal has been said, and rightly said,
about unusual and extraordinary features of
this measure. But my opposition is not so
much to minor details as to the main general
principle underlying the bill, which places in
the hands of civil servants the authority to
interfere in private business and impose their
will upon the commercial activities of the
people on this part of the North American
continent.
When war broke out in 1939, by virtue of
the emergency powers granted to the government we began to pile control upon control, to
take away the rights of the individual. There
were the Defence of Canada regulations. which
in a good many cases involved the suspension
of habeas corpus; ,there were Price Board
regulations, foreign exchange interference, and
controller after controller. At that time I
explained to my constituents that these were
all temporary emergency measures, and that
once we were free of threat of defeat in the

642

SENATE

field I was for sweeping away all limitations
on per-onal liberty, so that the people of
Canada should resume their ancient freedon
and their ancient dignity-the dignity of the
individual. But now, fourteen months after
the surrender of Germany, we are presented
with a bill that. no matter how you amend itunless you cmasculate it to the point that its
sponsors would not recognize it; uniless you
destroy its principle entirely-would fasten
around the necks of our people a civil-servant
control such as never would have been tolerated in the past. Furthermore, this measure
would form part of a broad class of legislation
that is carrying this country very rapidiy
towards totalitarian government.
Since I am utterly opposed to the bill, I do
not like the seeming compromise involved in
this proposal. We know all about the bill now
without hearing from these civil servants, who
doubtless will .make special pleas for the
continuation of their powers. Last Tuesday we
heard an explanation of the bill more comprehensive and more lucid than it bas been mv
pleasure to listen to in this or any other
deliberative assembly.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It was an admirable
presentation.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, lar.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to deal with this measure now. I was ready yesterday to speak
against the bill and to move the six montbs
boist. But in the circumstances I am net now
prepared to make a case against it because, an
honourable senator having asked for information, J can bardly stand betwecen him and
wbat seems to be his need. So, against my
will and ratier contrary to my good judgment
-and

certainly in opposition to my impulse

at this time-I shall as far as I can let this
proposal pass; but with this very distinct
reservation-that in doing so I in no way
compromise my position of whole-souled. deeprooted opposition to the principle of the bill
and all its provisions, and that when a report
cpmes" back from the committee I am at full
liberty to speak against the bill and take such
other action as on my conscience I think is
necessary in order to preserve the freedom and
liberty of our people, and so enable them to
the best of their ability to employ their individual enterprise and intelligence in the
carrying on of their business affairs. This, J
am convinced will tend to the general improvement of economie conditions in this country.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, if a vote bad been taken yesterday,
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK:

after the speech by the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), I would
have voted against second reading of this bill.
In the interval I have spent several hours in
again reading net only the evidence adduced
before the committee of the other house to
which the original bill was referred, but also
the report of that committee, in the form of
an amended bill, and the ensuing debate in
the other house. As a result I am convinced
that there is much more to the bill than
appears on the surface.
Of course, I agree entirely with the principles
advocated in this and the other chamber, that
our peacetime freedor and liberty should be
restored at the earliest possible moment. We
citizens of Canada are net school children,
we resent being subject to the control and
dictation of so many schoolmasters as to
what we shall do in matters of finance or
trade, or where we shall go. Freedom is the
very soul of democracy. In this countrywe being no longer at war-there is virtually
a unanimous desire on the part of our people
to see the restoration of that freedom of individual action and movement which is so
essential to the continuance of constitutional
government. Of course, individual freedom
must give way to whatever extent may be
necessary to serve the public interest. As a
matter of fact most legislation is in some
degree a curtailment of individual freedom.
"You must do this," "You must not do that." is
the substance of legislation. The Canadian
people willingly submit themselves to the
ordinary restrictions imposed by law, but
certainly restrictions should net go beyond
what is required to serve the common good.
My honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) says he is sufficiently
informed on this bill. I thought I was up to
last Tuesday, but having in the interval taken
the steps to which I have referred, I am net
ready at this juncture to say that all forms
of foreign exchange control should, without
further investigation, be withdrawn. I am net
now ready to vote on the principle of the
bill, and I feel that if I had an opportunity
of examining and cross-examining the witnesses who might appear before one of our
standing committees I would be in a better
position to express a considered opinion on the
very important subject-matter of this bill.
There is another point on which I should
like to offer a few remarks.
On several
occasions, as in this instance, honourable senators have net been quite ready to express
their opinion on the principle of the bill on
the motion for second reading. Under our
rules we discuss the principle of the bill, on
the motion for second reading; in committue

AUGUST 15, 1946
we can only discuss it clause by clause. Even
with reservations, honourable senators at times
find it somewhat difficult to agree to the principle of a bill at the second reading stage. I
would therefore suggest that at the opening of
another session we might very properly consider the advisability of introducing into our
rules a provision which would enable the
Senate to do exactly what it is proposed it
should do to-day, by unanimous consent-refer
the subject-matter of a bill to a committee
which will hear evidence, make a careful
study with a view to amending the bill, if
necessary, and report before second reading.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I am very strongly in
favour of the motion of the honourable gentleman from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard). I
think the -public interest will be well served
by the procedure we are now following. It
may be well to put a time limit on
the operation of the proposed legislation, but
I think you will find that a certain measure of
foreign exchange control is necessary at this
juncture in world affairs.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question?
Hon. G. G. McGEER: Honourable senators,
as one who, probably in a very small way,
may be responsible for the somewhat unusual
and extraordinary activity andi interést that
the Senate is now showing in this measureHon. Mr. HAYDEN:

Startling!

Hon. .Mr. McGEER: -I
should like to
say a word on the present position. When I
rose to address myself to the bill last
Tuesday I felt, as on many other occasions,
that mine would be just a voice crying in the
wilderness.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: But when I realized
the tremendous interest that honourable members were showing in the principles at stake,
I came to the conclusion that there would be
others who were better qualified than I was
to move the six months hoist.
There are two things that a committee might
consider between now and prorogation. One is
that as the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has said, there is now on the order
paper of another place a bill which would
extend until sixty days after the opening of
next session the life of the order in council
under which the Foreign Exchange Control
Board is operating. That order in council contains all the powers needed by the board to
protect the security of the Canadian dollar in
the meantime.

643

I made my suggestion, believing that there
was no procedure for referring a bill to a committee until after the principle bad been
adopted. I am not like the honour3ble senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck),
who is opposed to any measure of control. I
would prefer to see wartime controls changed
into peacetime regulations wherever they are
necessary.
The other thing that a committee might
consider in the short time at its disposal is the
fundamental principle of this legislation: shall
we transfer-not from parliament to governor
in council, but from parliament and governor
in council to civil servants-the control of
net only the trade but the economic life of the
people of Canada? Those two things might, as
I say, be considered; but how any committee
can go through this measure in time to report
it back in such form that it will be acceptable
to the majority of the members of this and of
the other house, I do not know. To rewrite
this bill so that it will meet approval as a
permanent post-war measure would take a long
period of time.
In every war victory comes because of unity,
and if' in reviewing our history there is one
thing we can look back to with satisfaction,
it is the unity of the people of the British
race in time of trouble. Yes, during the
period of war we suspend every security,
every check, every guarantee of our liberty
and our freedom; but we do so only because
we hope that, the longer period of peace will
restore and make secure those freedoms for
which we were willing to sacrifice everything.
This bill is a reversal of that process. If the
complexities of our economic life, the problems of our social order, the pressure of our
international obligations have brought us to
the point where responsible government must
give way and we must surrender to civil servants the powers of freedom which are crystallized in the phrase that men in parliament are
the servants, not the masters of the people,
then, some

new farr

of guarantee must be

evolved. I do not intend to speak about that
today because I have on the order paper a
resolution under which I hope to have the
privilege of discussing the need for constitutional change. We are living in a new world.
This is not the Canada of 1939.
I never thought that I would live to see
two great Canadian Conservatives-one a
former Conservative Prime Minister and now
a member of the House of Lords, the other a
Conservative member of the British House
of Commons-approve an amendment sought
by a Liberal government to the constitution,
or acknowledge the British North America Act
to be an anachronism. For thirty years, be-

SENATE
cause we stood for Anglo-American relations
and a strong and independent Dominion of
Canada, I and other Liberals have been
accused of every form of treachery, deceit and
disloyalty to the crown and the British Empire.
But times have changed. I agree with my
Lord Bennett of Calgary and my friend
Beverly
Baxter-both
one-time Canadian
Conservatives and both British Conservatives
today-that the time has come for Canada to
have a new constitution. We need a constitution which will belong to the Canadian
people, and it must contain provisions which
will guarantee forever that the government
of the people of this country will be in the
hands of those who are responsible to them in
free elections. I propose to discuss that situation, if I may, next Tuesday afternoon.
It is hard to refuse ,any request that the
honourable leader of the government in this
house may make; I find it difficult to resist
his pleasant and charming manner, especially
when be is associated with the honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard);
but I must warn him that whiile I am willing
to agree to almost anything he asks, I will
still be opposed to this bill when it comes back
if it contains any vestige of a provision
whereby the powers of the government of this
country will be transferred, from parliament to
the civil sxervice.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, may I say that at the conclusion of
todiay's sitting I propose to moye that the
house adjourn until next Monday evening?
I am therefore suggesting that the Committee
on Banking and Commerce meet at 10.30 on
Tuesday morning.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators wbo are not members of the committee
may feel that they should not attend the cmeeting; but as this is an important matter and
one wlich affects us all, I would urge every
honourable senator, whether a member of the
committee or not, to attend next Tuesday
morning at 10.30.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Howard was agreed
to.
EXCISE BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 371, an Act to amend
the Excise Act. 1934.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I have asked the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) to take
charge of this bill.
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

Hon. S. A. HAYDEN moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, the amendments contemplated by the Excise Bill are few
in number, simple in character, and in the
main unrelated. May I explain what they
are?
Under some sections of the Excise Act very
beavy penalties are provided for subsequent
offences, and where the first offence was committed tcen, twelve or fifteen years ago, it
lias been difficult to get magistrates to conviet.
The department has therefore decided that
a subsequent offence, in order to merit the
imposition of a severe penalty, must have been
committed within five years of the date of a
previous conviction. The new definition of
"subsequent offences" is as follows:
"subsequent offence" means an offence committed within five years of the date of a previous
conviction.
The bill next deals with an armendment
relating to tobacco products and spirits
brought into Canada for the use of representatives of foreign countries. Heretofore the
department bas.followed the practice of permitting the transfer of these goods from one
warehouse to another, or bas released therm as
required, without payment of duty.
The
Auditor General bas raised a question as to
the authority for such a course of action. This
bill incorporates the authority in'the Excise
Act. It is simply a reciprocation of the priviliges which other countries grant to Canadian
representatives abroad.
Section 3 of the bill amends the act by providing for a drawback of 99 per cent of the
duty paid on spirits testing not less than 50
per cent overproof, when sold and delivered,
with the approval of the minister, to government research laboratories or other laboratories sponsored by the government
of
Canada. For instance, some industrial concerns maintain rcscarch laboratories. Under
this amendment they are entitled to the benelits of this section if they.niake the results of
their research available to the public.
By section 4 hospitals or certain other institutions may obtain unmatured spirits and
hav e them released under the provisions of
the act. Under the present regulations these
institutions .could not secure release of spirits
less than two years old. They are still required
te pay duty, but for scientific purposes they
can obtain release permits that enable them te
secure unmatured spirits, the cost of which is
mucb lower than that of spirits in any other
foirm.
Section 5 of the bill lias to do with
manufacturers of domestic wines. Because of
the rationing of sugar, the manufacturers

AUGUST 15, 1946
were fl-ot able ta assure proper preservation
of wines. It was therefore necessary ta release
ta thern certain quantities of spirits in order
ta provide for the proper preservation and
fermentation of their product. The bill now
makes àtatutury what beretofore bas been
carried on by order ini eouiacil.
Section 6 relates ta specific duties an cigars.
Up ta the present time a du.ty of $3 per
thousand on cigars bas been charged irrespective of value or make. 1 amrn ot extending any hope that the change in. duty fromn
$3 ta $1 a thausand wiIl assist in the return
of the famous five-cent cigar. Honourable
senators will observe that the next bill ta
be considered provides for an ad valorem
d'uty on cigars 'which more than makes up
for the loss of revenue under this ineasure.
The amendments. as I have said, are simple
and no princîple is involved in the bill. I
would therefore suggest to the bouse that it
is unnecessary ta send it to a cammittee.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bill was
read the second time.

the Superintendent of Insurance, having regard
ta the exact language of the then definition,
sought ta impose the tax upon the grass
premiums received by the companies. Honourable senatars knaw that the practice bas been
ta charge an initial premium higher, in varying
degree, than the cost of the insurance. This
provides a margin of security durîng the first
year, at the end of wbich the company returns
a portion of that excess premium ta the
policyholder by way of a dividend. The superintendent ruled that the definition of "net
premiums", which permitted life insurance
companies ta deduct the dividends paid or
credited ta, policyholders front grass prerniums
in order ta arrive at the amount subject ta
taxation, did flot, apply to mutual insurance
campanies. The first section of this bill
amends, the definition so as ýta make clear that
henceforth mutual campanies may deduct dividends fromn their grass premiums.
In the next section a distinction is made

campanies, sucb as Lloyds, which are not incarporated. The net prerniums of incorparated

including those from investments. I understand a slight concession is made to Canadian
companies, in that when calculating the
amount of premium, income subject to taxation they are permitted to deduet the
premdums on reinsurance, whereas British and
American companies have to pay on their
gross premium income. I am not very familiar
with the matter, but I have reason for
strongly doubting whether the concession will
compensate Canadian companies for the discrimination to which I have referred.
Let me repeat. The British and American
joint stock companies will pay a 2 per cent
tax on their premium income but will entirely
escape any tax upon their investment income.
The profit made by some of these companies
on investment income is probably greater
than their underwriting profit. I do not see
how the discrimination can be justified in any
way.
Again, mutual life companies transacting
business in accident and sickness insurance as
well as life insurance will pay only the 2 per
cent tax on premium income, and will be
entirely exempt from income and excess profits
tax. I say that that discrimination is utterly
unfair.
Hon. 'Mr. VIEN: May I ask the honourable
senator if the investment income referred to
is the income from Canadian or foreign
investments.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is the income from
Canadian investments. The Canadian mutual
fire insurance companies will, pay not only
a tax of 2 per cent on their premium income,
but also the regular income tax, as well as
the excess profits tax, if they make any excess
profits. All their profits from every source
will be taxed.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: But are British and
American companies not taxed on income
derived frorm their Canadian investments?

•

Hon. Mr. EULER: No. We have the
amazing spectacle of certain life insurance
companies enjoying a distinct advantage over
Canadian mutual fire and casualty companies
competing for the same business. I might
mention one of these life companies--the
Metropolitan, which is a very good company
and has a fine office building in this city.
A further surprising thing is that British
and American marine insurance companies
pay no taxes in Canada at all.
I think honourable senators should note
this fact. Purely Canadian companies do only
about 20 per cent of the fire insurance business in Canada and, about 30 per cent of the
casualty business.

In effect this bill, by what I consider to be
its inexcusable discriminations, stimulates the
activities of British and foreign insurance companies and mutual life companies doing casualty business, and discourages Canadian companies fram seeking the business to which
they are entitled. It is entirely unfair not
to accord to Canadian companies the same
tax exemptions as are * accorded to their
competitors.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The principle involved is
justified on the ground that since these British and American companies have to pay
income tax in the countries where their head
office is located. it would be double taxation if they also had to pay income tax to the
Canadian government on their Canadian
investments.

Hon.

Mr. EULER.

As my honourable

friend knows, it is pretty much the same as
the taxation principle in the Income War Tax
Act. If, for instance, you receive dividends on
securities in the United States and the American authorities deduet 15 per cent. tax at
source, the present arrangement between Canada and the United States allows you to
deduct that 15 per cent from your Canadian
income tax. Similarly, the profits made by
British and American insurance companies on
Canadian business should be taxable. If those
profits are includedi in the company's total
profits in London, New York, or elsewhere,
they would presumably although that is not
our affair-deduct the tax they paid in Canada
on the profits made on their Canadian business from the total profits which they had
made on business wherever it might be
located. That is all I have to say to the honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You did not answer my
question as to whether life insurance companies pay tax on both.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Oh, yes, they pay on
both. I think I dealt with that point.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I think we had better send
the bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I think the point raised by
the honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler) should be investigated in committee. I am not well posted on the point
raised, but I understand that in respect of
British or American companies we made an
arrangement with a view to avoiding double
taxation, so that on their investments in Canada they have to pay 15 per cent to the
Canadian treasury on what they withdraw by
way of revenue from Canada, and they are
authorized to deduct it in the country where
they have their head office. Likewise, if a

SENATE
Canadian company bas investments abroad, it
pays fifteen per cent tax on whatever income
it draws from its foreign investments. Then by
this reciprocal arrangement when it pays
income tax in Canada it can deduet that
fifteen per cent which it bas paid to the foreign
treasury.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I made reference to
that. If my honourable friend is fortunate
enough to own securities in the United States,
and gets $2,000 by way of dividends, he wili
find that the American company in which he
bolds the stock will deduct fifteen per cent.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The anomaly referred to
is not only in respect of insurance companies.
If we want to correct that situation we should
have to deal with all financial and industrial
concerns that have investments in Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That may be, but my
chief objection is to the double taxation. Why
in the world should a mutual fire insurance
company pay tax on its premiums, and in
addition pay the ordinary income tax and
excess profits tax that any other commercial
company would pay? I sec no reason why an
insurance company, mutual or otherwise,
should net be placed on exactly the same basis
as any other commercial concern which is in
business for gain. It is double taxation, and
I have never been able te get any reason
for it.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I have been trying to find
out whether it was the case, and it does not
appear to be so. It seems to me from what
has been said that an insurance company
which does business in Canada and derives
income from Canadian investments is on all
fours with an industrial or financial concern,
British or American, that bas investments in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It is net on all fours
with Canadian companies with which it is in
competition. That is my point.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: It is, because we have an
arrangement whereby a Canadian industrial
or financial or insurance company which bas
investments abroad is net taxed in excess of
the fifteen per cent referred te. If the insurance company, British or American, bas investments in Canada, it is in exactly the same
position reciprocally. I may be mistaken, but
that is the situation as I understand it.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I do net agree with my
honourable friend, but it is no use continuing
the argument. The facts can be ascertained
only if the bill goes te committee. That was
going to be my suggestion.
Hon. Mr. VIEN.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am proposing to
refer the bill to committee, but one or two
things have been said on which I think there
should be an explanation. First of all, we are
dealing with the Special War Revenue Act, net
the Income War Tax Act. The Special War
Revenue Act imposes a premium tax. That
tax existed in the period when my honourable
friend from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) was
the minister of the department collecting the
tax.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is what I am criticizing.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Since that time we
have had a premium tax at varions rates upon
life insurance companies and upon mutual
and stock fire and casualty insurance companies. The premium tax was lower on stock
than on mutual insurance companies. The
explanation given during that period was that
since the mutual insurance companies were
net subject to income tax, the department
collected a little higher premium tax from
them. But I was pointing out that by this
year's amendments to the Income Tax Act
-not yet before us-the mutual insurance
companies are taxable on a certain basisHon. Mr. EULER: On a double basis.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: -but as a matter of
policy the government sces fit to continue the
premium tax. So you have both income tax
and premium tax applying to stock and
mutual fire and casualty insurance companies.
To that extent there is no discrimination.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Does that apply to British
and American companies?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Every foreign stock
insurance company operating in the fire and,
casualty fields is subject to income tax.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I must take direct issue
wi.th my honourable friend on that.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Except marine insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I named a company.
That company will pay its premium tax.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: My honourable friend
misunderstood me.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You said every foreign
insurance company is subject to the same tax
as a Canadian company.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I said so far as income
tax is concerned British and foreign stock
insurance companies operating in the fire and
casualty fields are subject to Canadian income
tax te the extent of their ope rations in
Canada-

AUGUST 15, 1946
Hon. Mr~. EULER: I disagree with you.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: -with this one provision with respect to their investrnents in
Hon. Mr. EULER: Exactly.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: This was arrived at
-as the result of a convention entered into
many years ago. Followîng the introduction
of the business profits tax during World War I
another convention was arranged in 1932. It
amounted to a compromise. It provided that
those foreign companies would pay incoane
tax on the basis of their grass profits without
making a deduction for losses by reinsurance
ýor for head office expenses. Tbey said, "We
will give up those deductions and pay the
-Canadian income tax on the basis of our
gross profits in Canadla." I ar n ot concerned
whether that arrangement is good,' bad or
indifferen-t. I arn mercly stating the fact.
That is the situation.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Is that. aggravated by the
legislation now before us?
It remaîns
Hon. M.r. HAYDEN: No.
,exactly tbe saine, except that, as the resuit of
the provisions of the incarne tax bill yet to
corne before lis, Canadian mutual insurance
cornpanies will be subject ta incarne tax; and
they will have to pay it upon their entire
incarne, whicb will include their investment
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is cxactly the
point I make.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But wbat we are discussing at the moment is the Special War
Revenue Act, nat the Incarne War Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Must flot the wbole picture be taken togetherHon. Mr. EULER: Surely.
Hon. M.r. VIEN. -if you want to arrive
at a reasonable conclusion on the treatment
metcd out ta Canadian campanies as coinpared with British and foreign?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That mîgbt very wcll
be a matter for discussion whcn we are dcaling
with the Incarne Tax Bill. That bill and the
Special War Revenue Bill should be considered
together in committee. I arn not bere either
opposing or supporting the treatrnent accorded
under the provisions of those bills. I arn
stating wbat is the effect of the present arrangement. I cannot sec how there is any so-called
double taxation. Yau bad an incarne -tax
on every operating company. Now you bave
a premiurn tax on every operating company.
Truc, you have two taxes, but one is a tax
on profits and the other on premniurn incarne.

4

Hon. Mr. EUJLER: If a certain company
which pays a premium tax on, say, 530»0W did
nlot have to do so, would nlot its profts be
that mucb greater?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Or its losses?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Either way. Is Lýtnot
therefore taxed twice? The premiurns which
the company receives help to make up its
profits. If it already pays a tax on its profite,
and again pays a tax on its premiums, Lt has
to pay twice.
Hon. Mr. HAYIDEN: You have double taxation when a company pays tax on profits
and on distributed dividends.
Hon. Mr. EULER: But two wrongs do nlot
make a right.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: As my honourable
friend knows, you have substantially the saine
sitation when, for instance, a manufacturing
concern collece sales tax. To that extent it
pays sales tax.
Hon. Mr. ASELTINE: That is wbat we are
protesting against.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Possibly, if the issue
were raised, I migbt suggest that this would
be a very good time to -take away the preinium
tax . But as a mnatter of history we, know that
stock fire and casualty insurance companies
were subj ect to income tax and the mutual
insurance companies were not. The stock
companies were also subjcct to premiurn tax,
but the government of the day gave themn
relief by perrnitting themn for income tax purposes to deduct the premium tax as an
expense. To some extent the compcnsating
principle that you sliould net impose the full
rigours of both taxes was recognized. There
may be somnething worth considering in the
contention raised; but this bill cornes before
us as a part of governrnent policy, and is
necessary for obtaining revenue. I think the
objection taken is an added reason why the
bilh should go -to cornrnttee.
As long as I have made my points clear as
to the effect of the bill I hold no brief for or
against the views expresed by my honourable
friend. As a matter of facýt, he rnigbt be
surprised at the view I would take should the
question of premium tax corne to a vote.
With that explanation I intend to move that
the bill be referrcd to the Standing Cernmittee
on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. EULER: I knew I arn out of
order, but may I say t-hat I do not tbink my
friend and I are at variance witb respect to
the factsf I arn arguing ýthat we should flot
bave two bases of taxation-. Double taxation
is what I arn protesting against. I think it

4. That a "Canadian Travel Bureau" be
established as a branch of the appropriate
department of the Dominion Government;
such bureau to have a director at its head, and
he be assisted by an advisory council consisting of the Directors of Information of tfie
various provincial governments, representatives
of the federal departments and services interested in tourist travel promotion, and the
members of the Execuîtive Committee of the
Canadian Association of Tourist and Publicity
Bureaus.
5. That a sum of not less than $150,000 be
voted at the present session of parliament to
finance this campaign duriog the current fiscal
year.
6. That a permanent progressive programme
of Canadian tourist travel promotion be
launched, with the closest co-operation between all agencies engaged in this work, the
dominion's share in effort and expenditure to
co-ordinate and supplement the wýork already
undertaken and proposed by all other agencies,
and in no manner to supplant this work or the
organizations engaged therein.
7. That a standing committee of this house
(representatives of all the provinces) be set up
to bring parliament into direct and permanent
contact with this important national matter, to
conduet an annual study of the tourist trade,
and to consider means through which it may
best be fostered and encouraged.
8. That the Canadian system of national
parks be extended, as a truly national policy,
to embrace all the provinces; and that greater
efforts be put forth to attract visitors to these
scenic and recreational scentres.
For the first time since your Senate Committee on Tourist Traffic was created, following the adoption of the 1934 report, hearings
have been held during which it was possible
from the evidence heard to ascertain to what
extent the recommendations of the special
committee of 1934 have been carried out.
Your committee found that they had been
generally fulfilled,
The Canadian Travel Bureau was established and is now a branch of the Department
of Trade and Commerce. It has a Director
at its head and an advisory council constituted
as was proposed by the special committee.
The first appropriation to the bureau made
in 1934 amounted to $100,000.00 For the
present fiscal year the federal appropriation to
assist in promoting tourist business is $650,000.00. During the war years the activities of
the bureau were curtailed. The staff was eut
to a minimum and the appropriation dropped
to as low as $27,000.00.
The bureau has worked in the closest possible co-operation with not only the tourist
agencies in Canada but with an ever-increasing

651

number of tourist organizations in the United
States and in some other parts of the world.
Canadian Trade Commissioners offices and
Embassies in foreign lands have been used to
spread tourist information.
The recommendation of the 1934 special
committee that the Canadian system of
national parks be extended to embrace all the
provinces bas been largely fulfilled. The
national parks system has been extended, particularly in the Maritime Provinces.
Your committee learned from the evidence
that was given to it by the Director that this
year the National Travel Bureau was devoting
most of its publicity to a campaign in the
Canadian newspapers towards developing
friendly and courteous treatment of tourists.
The limited publicity in the United States
had as its major purpose the stressing of the
importance of making reservations well in
advance before starting out on a holiday trip
to Canada.
Canada's attractions as a holiday playground,
summer and winter, are well and widely advertised. This opinion was reached after having
had revealed to the committee the extent
of the campaigns of the transportation interests, the provincial governments, municipalities, the Parks Branch of the Department of
Mines and Resources and the Canadian Travel
Bureau. The committee found that the publicity sponsored by the Canadial Travel
Bureau is aimed to give an over-all picture of
Canada's attractions, while those of the other
interests are concentrated on .particular areas,
such as the mountains, sea-side and other
resorts served by the railways and steamship
companies, while the provinces and municipalities confine their publicity and expenditurcs to their own particular appeal to tourists.
The Canadian Travel Bureau does not confine its publicity to the magazines and newspapers and the issue of pamphlets. It uses
films and other means, such as displays at
exhibitions, to make all of Canada better
known to the travelling public.
Your committee is satisfied that the bureau
is encouraging and bringing about co-operation between the provincial governments and
all agencies interested in the advancement of
the tourist industry. There was no evidence
of needless overlapping.
Your committee was much impressed with
the submissions from the officials of the Parks
Branch of the Department of Mines and
Resources. There is no question that Canada's
national parks are magnets drawing more and
more visitors into the country every year.
Not only is this so with the older parks but
also those of more recent, creation. During
the period of the war the parks appropriation
was barely sufficient to meet the requirements

SENATE
for maintenance. Naturally there will be need
for increased expenditure to bring these resorts
up to standard conditions as well as to provide necessary improvements. It was made
clear to the committee that more accommodation for motor tourists was necessary in most
of the parks, and a continued addition of
cabins to meet the requirements of the
tourists travelling by automobile seems to
your committee to be necessary.
,
It was suggested also that parks might be
established in parts of the dominion where
they do not now exist. A delegation appeared
before the committee to urge the acquirement
of more land to be added to what has come
to be known as the Gatineau Park. close to the
capital of Canada. The committee was
impressed with the case presented, particularly the view that if additional land was to
be acquired it should be done now before
allowing it to pass into the possession of
private parties. It was argued that this park,
in its close proximity to the capital, would do
much to increase the tourist flow from the
United States.
Evidence was tendered to your committee
in support of the view that the Alaska Highway had considerable potential possibilities
for tourist traffic. The fame that it had gained
in the war years, the hitherto largely unknown
country it had opened up, its link with Alaska
and the Yuîkon, led the advocates of the continued maintenance of this highway and the
construction of a shorter road from Edmonton to Dawson Creek to urge that the federal
government should keep the road open for
tourist traffic and assist in the construction
of the proposed eut-off from Edmonton via
White Court to the British Columbia boundary at Dawson Creek. This would reduce the
mileage between Edmonton and Dawson
Creek by 135 miles.
The view was expressed to the committee
that the so-called Haines eut-off running from
the head of the Lynn Canal to the Alaska
Highway near the Yukon boundary should be
brought

up

to

the

standaid

of

the

main

Alaska Highway. The committee was informed
that the Alaska Highway as it exists today
was built entirely at the expense of the
United States and Las been turned over free
of cost to Canada.
Evidence of officers of the federal government established that the highway was to be
kept in operation and that services for the
convenience of travellers were already being
provided et different points along its route.
Almost every witness appearing before your
committee stressed the need of better roads
if tourist traffic was to expand. The prevailing opinion was that Canada had unlimited
tourist attractions. To make them accessible,

all-weather highways were necessary and
federal assistance would be required to assist
in the provision of the main arteries of
approach, particularly from the United States.
Your comýmittee is convinced that a broadly
plannerd tourist traffic policy has almost unlimited possibilities. One witness pointedi out
that United States citizens spend six billion
d'ollars annually in tourist travel and estimated that at least one tenth of this amount
was available to Canada. This sum of six
hundred million dollars was in accord with
other opinion offered te the committee during
its hearing.
If this estimate is correct, or nearly se, then
no other conclusion can be reached than that
wisely appropriated expenditures on the promotion of tourist travel will bring a return
greater than any branch of our export trade.
Your committee recommends:
1. Since the greater part of our tourist
traffic from the United States comes to
Canada by motor car, good Lard-s.uirfaced
ioads, froin United States border points,
strategieally located. are a prime necessity
to its expansion. Your committee recommends te the Dominion Government that
financial assistance, under proper agreements,
should bc offered to the provinces, who have
the personnel in their highway departments to
supervise the construction and maintenance of
*such roads, and that these roads should be
built te a permanent high standard.
2. That facilities in national parks should
he improved, and roads within the parks hard
surfaced to a permanent high standard.
3. That by whatever suitable agencies are
available, Canadians operating service stations,
eating and stopping places, and including
liotels, shops and stores, should be impressed
with the importance of showing .courtesy and
giving good service to visiting tourists at all
times.
4. Suitable descriptive literature and good
road maps for the different provinces should
bc placed in the hands of all immigration and
customs officers at all border crossing points,
to be made available te tourists seeking such
information.
5. That the development and permanent
maintenance of our tourist business should be
planned on a long-range view.
6. That there should be as close co-ordlination as possible of the efforts of the federal
and provincial agencies and the transportation
companies by land, water and air, te prevent
overlapping and get the maximum results
possible for the money expcnded.
7. That inquiry should be made by the
federal governiment into the possibilities of
the Alaska Highway as a tourist attraction,

AUGUST 15, 1946
to ascertain whether expenditure on a more
direct link with it from Edmonton to Dawson
Creek would be justified.
8. That authority be granted for the printing of 600 copies in English and 200 copies in
French of this report and the evidence submitted to the committee on August 8, 1946
with respect to the tourist possibilities of the
Alaska Highway, and that Rule 100 be suspended insofar as it relates to the said
printing.
Due to a lack of shorthand reporters it was
not possible for the Reporting Branch to
furnish a complete report of the proceedings
of the committee.
All which is respectfully submitted.

IMMIGRATION
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of tie Standing Committee on linmigration and Labour.

653

lion. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: Honourable senators, I move adoption of the report
of the Standing Committee on Immigration
and Labour, as published in Hansard a few
days ago. There are a number of comments
I should like to make in connection with this
report. It will be remembered that on the
8th day of May, 1946, this honourable house
authorized and directed the committee to:
Inquire into the Immigration Act, its operation and administration and the circumstances
and conditions relating thereto, including (a)
the desirability of admitting immigrants to
Canada; (b) the type of immigrants which
should be preferred, including origin' training
and other characteristies; (c) the availability
of such immigrants for admission; (d) the
facilities, resources and capacity of Canada to
absorb, employ and maintain such immigrants,
and (e) the appropriate terms and conditions of
admission.
In response to that direction the committee,
under the chairmanship of the honourable
senator from Parkdale (Hon. Mr. Murdock),
held ten meetings for the purpose of hearing
evidence, each of which, as lie stated last
Wednesday, lasted more than two hours.
Thirty-four witnesses appeared before the
committee, and some twenty-four briefs were
received from persons who -did not appear.
As stated in the report, there was remarkable
unanimity among the witnesses who expressed
their views before the committee as to the
desirability of immigration. Not one among
the whole number was of the opinion that
Canada should close lier doors to immigrants.
There was a consensus of opinion, if not a
unanimity, that immigrants seqking entry
should be càrefully selected and their qualifications strictly scrutinized, and that the number
admitted should not be larger than could from
time to time be absorbed into our national
economy without reducing the standard 'of
living or bringing about maladjustment.
It was the consensus of opinion aiso that
Canada cannot expect to hold ber place in
world affairs unless she increases lier population to a degree commensurate with lier great
area and lier vast resources. For this reason
the problem of immigration is urgent. Its
solution cannot be deferred to some other
time; it must be attacked, considered and
solved, at least in part, right now.
All witnesses who dealt with the subject
were agreed that Canada should do lier fair
share with the other nations of the world in
solving the difficult refugee problem. So far
she has done very little indeed. Canada, of
course, should not assume the entire burden,
but she should do lier fair share. I will speak

about this later.
The committee found that immigration falls
into three main divisions: agricultural immi-

SENATE
gration; industrial immigration and domestic
immigration, or the immigration of women
for domestie purposes. This last division, of
course, is of minor importance compared with
the other two.
As to agricultural immigration, your committee found-though we have no exact figures
as to this-that Canada has a vast acreage of
very rich farm lands. There is some evidence
as to the acreage which is occupied and used,
but very little as to the acreage still unused.
Dr. Booth of the Economie Branch of the
Department of Agriculture made the statement
that ther'e are some twenty-seven million acres
of unused and reasonably accessible land suitable for agricultural settlement. We have no
knowledge on what he based his statement,
but presumably one may accept as authoritative an estimate made by a man in his position. That area would provide from 150,000
to 160,000 farms. The Canadian Pacifie Railway Company owns a million odd acres and
the Hudson's Bay Company something less
than a million acres. The census of 1941
showed more than 32,000 abandoned or totally
idle farms, aggregating some 'five million
acres. Speaking for myself, I was net greatly
impressed by the statistics. But we did have
sufficient evidence, I think, together with the
knowledge which we ourselves possess, for
concluding that Canada's unused agriculture
resources are very great, and that their
development would greatly increase her
economie power and ber importance in the
world at large. There is no doubt that complete development of our natural resources
in farm lands alone, if that were possible,
would make this country a powerful economie
unit; and probably, as a secondary result, it
would bring about the building of many large
cities and towns to house a corresponding
inerease in industrial population.
I wild remind honourable members that
our present farming development is net the
creation of a moment; it is the result of
years of skilful cultivation and intensive
labour, sometimes of the most trving kind,
very often entailing great enterprise and no
small courage. Neither is it to be expected
that the resourees which we now possess can
be devolped overnight, or that a large population can be quickly settled on our land. The
same enterprise, labour and industry that built
up our farming population and created our
agricultural devclopment in the past will be
required in the future.
May I remind honourable senators that our
past progress was based upon immigration.
All Canadians, except the descendants of those
who were here when Christopher Columbus
made his famous voyage, are immigrants or
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

the sons of immigrants. Every senator in
this house if net actually an immigrant himself is the son of an immigrant. If we are te
depend upon natural increase to populate our
unused and now waste land, allowing for
wastage by death and emigration, the progress
will be much too slow. In order te make
headway comparable to that of the past, it is
necessary that we supplement our natural
growth by some degree of immigration.
The committee heard reliable and most
convincing evidence that immigration could
be made te greatly improve our industrial
plants. Intelligent seclection of immigrants in
the managerial, technical and artizan classifications would actually have the effect of
increasing our powers of employment, rather
than of filling jobs at the expense of our
present population. We were told the need was
for key personnel-men capable of turning
our unused resources to produetive capacity,
men of technical qualification
and those
experienced in the present day arts or
masters of mnw arts,nmen who car add experience gained elewbcre to our own and
introduce into our economice life new practices
which will promote industrial activity in this
cointr V.
I read frou the report as follows:
Those who dlevote tiemselves to Sie promotion
of new enterprise, to hiigyi
inforined maniagement, and to teclnical and scientifie skills, create
enployment for others, and this is particularly
the case in Canada whbere so miany resources are

unused and so
idle.

iany opportunîities are lying

Our greatest need is for "entrepreneurs"

cwio have the capacity to nake productive indus-

tries of our latent resoures for artisans skilled

in new trades or miasters of old ones. and for
scientific teclnicians of all kinds. Such men
increase our eiployment possibilities.
Of course honourable senators are not without knowledge of immigration matters. Those
who are familiar with the history of England
will recall that the silk trades of Spitalfields
were founded by refugees from religious persecution who crossed the channel and settled
on the banks of the Thames. An English
manufacturer recently told me that bad it net
been for the immigiants antd the refugees who
landed on the shores of England in years gone
by, lie would not have ber iin Canada endeavouring to sell the products of a Huddersfield
woollen mill. It was refugees who brought the
pottery skill to England, and taught the
English how to excel in that trade, as they
have done for so many years. Nature seems
to have amply rewarded the nations which out
of the goodness of their hearts opened their
doors to refugees and the persecuted peoples
of other lands. Perhaps there is a principle
underlying this, too deep for me to discuss
tonight. In any event, opportunities presented

AUGUST 19, 1946
to England in years gone by are now presented to Canada. Men of ability, character
and knowledge are knocking at our doors.
Considerable evidence was heard about the
activities of refugees admitted to this country during the recent war. We were told that
they founded upwards of one hundred industries. Many examples were given, of which I
shall mention only one-the Bata Shoe Company. Imported skills did much to promote the
industrial activities of Canada during the war
years. Many honourable senators have knowledge which will enable them to judge the
accuracy of my statements in this regard.
Among the foreign friends who came to our
,hores were a large number of Polish technicians, and upon the cessation of hostilities
we had the good sense to make their visit
permanent.
Canada has much to offer men of the type
I have described, not only because of ber
unused agricultural lands but her industrial
opportunities. We have vast reservoirs of
cheap power such as few other nations in the
world, if any, possess. Some of this natural
energy is developed; much of it is awaiting
development. I refer to the million horsepower of electrical energy which will result
from the St. Lawrence Waterways scheme,
which I hope will be realized within the next
few years. In ber railways Canada has a
transportation system second to none in the
world; and I should not fail to mention that
marvellous natural phenomenon, the string
of Great Lakes and connecting rivers, which
lead from the ocean to the very centre of the
continent. As the years go by we will have
in greater measure access to the trade routes of
the world. Our proximity to our great neighbour to the south provides us with a convenient market which would be highly valued, by
other nations.
We have much to offer, but it is obvious
that we cannot expect people to come here
and assist us in our development if we keep
,our doors closed to immigration, as we have
done in the recent past. Nor can we
expect to sell our products in world markets
with advantage to ourselves if we sit back like
the lazy frog with mouth open. That is not
the way to do business in this world, in immigration or in anything else. We must select
that which we want, and by our enterprise and
initiative see that we get it, not what somebody else wants us to have. In other words,
a little bit of enterprise and salesmanship .is
necessary if we are to get the best results from
the heritage which has been placed in our
hands.
We are perfectly sure that worth-while men
along the lines that I have descri'bed are to be
63268-43

found. It may seem strange that men of
ability and enterprise should pull up stakes in
the land of their birth and come to a country
of which they have little knowledge; but the
actual fact is that there are such people in
considerable numbers, due to the upset conditions of the world at large and the enterprise
of mankind.
There are senators from western Canada
who will agree with me when I say that the
vigour of the West in years gone by was due,
in some part at least, to the type of men
chosen by a certain natural selection. They
were men who had the enterprise, the itchy
feet, the imagination and the courage to leave
their own homes and trek out ta the West.
Am I not right in that? Absolutely. And so
it was with America in the first place. The
men who came to this continent and hewed
out homes in the forest had the courage and
the muscle and the power of mind to cope
with the difficulties of Nature, and they accomplished great things. There are such men in
other nations today who, if permitted ta do
so, would join the men of similar characteristics in this nation and help to make it great.
But, as I say, what we require is a sustained
and not a spasmodie effort. For that reason,
I submit, our agents should at this moment
be in Europe attending to our business.
Agents of Australia are already there, and
very actively engaged. The Australian people
are advertising that their gates will be open
as soon as shipping becomes available, and
explaining why it is that they cannot sustain
an immigration movement at the moment.
As for us-well, we have some few agents in
London, and that is all. We are doing nothing
towards the selective work which should precede an immigration movement if we are to
secure the kind of people whom we desire. We
should not leave things to chance, and so have
to take what we get.
We were told that a number of homes for
the aged, hospitals and other such public
institutions, are sadly handicapped at present

by the lack of what was described as domestic
help. We were also told that ir ;arious places

in Europe there were many women who would
indeed be glad to come to Canada to work as
domesties in both public and private homes.
Those were the three divisions which I
mentioned.
I think I can say we were pleasantly surprised-perhaps the chairman (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) was net, for he knows labour very
I can say that at least I was
well -but
pleasantly surprised when I found a very
broad-minded attitude on the part of two
distinguished labour representatives who appeared before your committee. They were

the President of -the Canadian Congress of
Labour and tbe President of the Trades and
Labour Congress of Canada. No doubt you
have been told, as I have been, that labour is
opposed to immigration. Well, the ovidonce
given us by these two men did flot support
that statement. They told us that labour in
Canada is flot opposed to immigration, unleas
it is of the kind so manipulatcd and used as
f0 destroy the standards of living whicb these
organizations have struggled to improve. They
are deadly opposed to the use of immigration
for the creation -of a pool of willing and docile
workcrs to be employcd during periods of
activity when money may be madle out of
their labours, and in fimes of lessor activity to
be thrown on the streets to seek sustenance
fromn the municipaliýties. Labour is flot the
only group opposed to such a policy. But
tbese labour represenfatives gave us to understand quite cloarly that labour is not opposed
te immigration of the type I bave described,
whieh would belpi to develop ýCanada's resources and add to its wealth, employmenf
opportunities and importance. Labour, like
ail other groups of Canadians, would like to
see this country develop and become powerful
in the world of nations; but not at the cosf of
impoverisbing our own people.
I was pleased at a statement made by one of
these representatives, that we should do our
part in connection with tbe refugee and displaeed persnns problem, even though it cosf us
something to do if. I fhink tfie reference was
to the possibility of some governmental expenditures, altbougb none were recommended.
Hie said labour was of opinion that Canada, as
a Christian country, should not obj oct if if
became neeessary to spend some money in
order to perform ber obligations.
We were aise pleased imdccc at the cvidence given by representatives of our two great
railways. A restrained and careful optirnism
was observable on the part of these men,
confident in tEe resources of this great country
and very willing te play a part in bringing
together tie labourer and the opportunity, the
demand and the supply.
Canada is wonderfully well served by bier
railways. True, in the railway-builýding era
thiere was at one time a littie to-o much
"shienanrigan" behind the sceneýs; but wbatever may be said, in criticism of that period,
the fact romains tbaf we now have a patrimony
of 42,637 miles of steami railways--a mile for
every 264 persans, man, woman and cbild, of
our population. This vast network faps the
grcqter part -of our usedl and unused resources. Ccrfainly if taps a sufficient area
to make possible a tremendous developmcnt.
During the last four or fiv e years of the war
Hon. Mr. RGEBUCK.

our railways rose magnificen.tly to the many
demands macle upon them, and carrieci freigbt
and passengers in tonnage and nuýmber beyond
anything in. their history. They demonsfrated
how aclmirably and efficienfly fhey could
serve the national interest, for îîndoubfedly
they contributed tremondausly to the success
of our war effort.
Each, of our two groaf railway systems maintains a departmenf of immigration, colonizatien and industrial developmenf.
To their
credif be if sa.id that tbiey bave maintained
those departments fhroughout. geod years and
bad; tbat even in thie slump years of the
hungry t hirfies fhey wcre iooking for opportunifies for mcen wbo wcre prepared: to grasp
tlbem, and were making considerablo expenditures on bringing together the man and
the opporfunity. This was niot donc, so much
for the primary purpose of incrcasing passenger
carnings, but from a realizafion that railways
depend for their prosperity on industrial and
farming aýctivify. We own one of these greaf
raîiway systems, and in the pre-war period if
was our unfortunate obligation to, meet its
deficits.
During the busy war years both
railway syst oms showed tremendous nef
earnings, but I know those in charge are welI
aware of the fact thaf uniless we can maintain the commercial, industrial and farming
activity of those years there wili be a recurronce cf ope.rafing deficits. For thaf reason
our raiiway oxecutives are îirging thaf we
turn our unused resources ýinto business opportunities; that we increase our population to
keep step wifh our industrial, commercial and
farming doveiopment, so fhat railway operatien may be profitable.
In flic past the sfcamship cempanies bave
co-operated very vigorously wifh the railways
in bringing immigrants to our sbores. We had
the advanfage cf lisfening fo a representative
of the Cunard-Wbif e Star Lino. Re expressed

that bis company could nof possibly undertake

vessels are now in regular service between
Scandinavian ports nnd New York. Hie stated

AUGUST 19, 1946
that if Canada desired to bring in immigrants,
arrangements could be made to have these
ships call at Halifax.
The committee were of the opinion that
very little would be gained by a detailed
examination of the Immigration Act, which,
as honourable members know, is for the most
part a statute of exclusion rather than of
immigration. Its various clauses relate generally to keeping out and deporting immigrants
for various reasons, and contain very little
indeed with respect to letting them in. We
came to the conclusion that we require a policy
of selective immigration. I suppose every
member in this chamber has during recent
years received letters from citizens in his home
district seeking to bring relatives to Canada.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not know how
this has affected other senators, but the
applications I have received have aroused my
keenest sympathy. I am able, in imagination,
to sit down in the chair of some Canadian
citizen who, having a wife, brother, father
mother or child in the devastated areas of
Europe, wishes to extend the family hand to
one of these unfortunates, in many cases the
sole survivor of the entire family conection, all
the others being war casualties or victims of
Hitler's concentration camps. During the last
two or three years our Immigration Department has employed a battery of letter
writersHon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: -all of them busy
explaining why nothing can be donc and making the very best of every excuse for inaction
-a most unenviable task. I cannot blame
them. During the war years no other policy
was possible; but I am looking forward to the
time when improved shipping and economic
conditions will make a change of policy possible, and when there will be no bar to our
fellow-citizens bringing in their relatives, for
obviously the immigrant vouched for by relatives or by friends, who are ready to take him
into their home and look after him until he
establishes himself, enjoys an advantage over
any other type of prospective settler. People
of this sort present no absorption problem.
Guided by those who are already here they
will find their way, and I predict that not one
in a thousand will ever become a burden upon
our municipalities.
We have reported, and we were unanimous,
that immigration to Canada is desirable. Very
grave doubts were expressed, and concurred in
by all, as to the wisdom of this country
attempting for an indefinite period to withhold
our vast territories from occupation by the
63268-43j

657

peoples of the overcrowded countries of
Europe. I spoke of that aspect when I moved
for the appointment of this committee,
and I need not labour it now. But you
gentlemen,, with imagination and power to
look into the future, must surely hesitate to
think of Canada attempting to hold the entire
northern half of the American continent for
the use of 12,000,000 people. The principle is
not right, and .in the nature of things it could
not bear happy fruit. There are immigrants
to be brought to Canada, and we must bring
them here.
It is probable that prospective immigrants
from the British Isles would have more friends
in Canada than would candidates from any
other country; but there aie difficulties in the
way of British immigration. Of late years the
manpower of England has been depleted 7-the
war has taken its toll-and I should not think
it was cricket for Canada to attempt to attract
to her shores a large mass of immigration
from the British Isles. The government of
Great Britain would not countenance such a
proceeding on our part. The committee
decided, therefore, that we should extend an
invitation to those who would like to come,
and when they arrive offer them the hand of
fellowship and proffer every possible assistance,
but that we should not be guilty of the
unfriendly act of attempting to bring about
mass emigration from Great Britain to our
shores.
Desirable immigrants are not confined to
any one locality or nationality. Your committee heard evidence of the accomplishments
of European settlers who landed on our shores
in days gone by, and who today might be
described, though not very accurately, as new
Canadians. These people-Poles, Ukrainians
and migrants from other countries who came
to settle with us-have made good in Canada.
They have helped to build our railways, clear
our forests and dig our mines; as well, they
have made for themselves farms out of the
wilderness, and have contributed of their
native culture, language, music, art and literature.
Canadians of Polish descent gave evidence
as to the accomplishments of their people in
this country, and they asked that we do something to bring their compatriots here. Some
200,000 Polish soldiers fought on the allied
side during the recent war. They are young
men in the prime of life, and 60 per cent of
them have had farming experience. Al have
now secured through the army some mechanical training; not a few of them are well educated. Their Polish friends in Canada asked
that we extend to these men the hand of
fellowship and friendship. Since hearing this

SENATE
evidence I have been pieased to learn of the
stop recently taken by the goverement to
permit a group of 4,000 Pouash soidiers to ha
brought to Canada under an agreement that
thev shahl work on farms for a period of at
Ieast two years. My information is that the
Departmcnt of Labour is already working on
this puojeet, and that representatives are going
te Italy to select the particular individuals who
xviii compose the group. It is hoped that some
cf them may ueach Canada this feul, though
I amrn ft

AUGUST 19, 1946
Furthermore, I submit to you that intending immigrants should not be kept in suspense
and doubt until the last moment before
shipping becomes available and all our transportation -problems have been solved. Canadian citizens with friends in Europe should
be assured now that their friends are fit to
be given ingress to Canada and will be
allowed tà come here as soon as shipping is
available.
I want to say something about what other
countries are doing, and I will commence with
just a word about the United States. Since
1820 that country has admitted to its shores
immigrants numbering some thirty-eight millions. I submit to you that had it not been
for the immigration policy carried out so consistently by our friends to the south in years
gone by, the United States would not have the
power, influence and economic ability which
she possesses today.
Canada too has had
quite a number of immigrants. In fact, since
1880 we have brought to our shores about six
million immigrants; but we have lost by emigration about five and one-half million people,
so that to date immigration has not done much
to improve our population total.
The problem we are discussing tonight cannot be solved merely by bringing immigrants
to our shores. The success of our immigration
policy must be judged by the number of
people who settle in this country, become
established and remain as good citizens. That
is a big subject, one that I must not take time
to discuss tonight.
Certainly the United States has done very
well for herself in the matter of immigration.
In 1924 she adopted a quota, which now stands
at 153,000 annually. During the war the quota
was not filled, but was reduced to an annual
average of about 46,000. But on the 22nd of
December last President Truman issued a
statement directing the heads of the appropriate departments of state to co-operate in
bringing in poor displaced people from Europe
-he allocated practically the whole quota to
them, reserving only 10 per cent for people in
another category-and he said there was to be
no discrimination on the ground of race or
religion. On the 20th of May this year the
first steamship to reach the United States in
pursuance of this policy arrived at New York
with 1,000 refugees, many of whom were
friends of American citizens. Not a few were
children, the President having directed that
special attention should be given the children.
As honourable senators know, Australia has
embarked upon a very active immigration
policy. She has announced a quota of 70,000
immigrants per year just as soon as shipping
becomes available and, there is sufficient hous-

659

ing to accommodate them. She has stated that
in the first three years following the war she
will accept as many as 50,000 orphans from
the war-devastated areas. Australia is not
adopting the lazy-frog attitude and waiting
for this matter to clear itself up; she is
reported to be reconverting Liberty ships for
the purpose of carrying immigrants.
Great Britain is a crowded country, with a
population of 500 persons to the square mile
as compared with our 3j persons, yet that
little kingdom has never in the past closed her
door to the refugee, and is not doing so now.
During the war years she admitted to her
ports some 200,000 refugees, and recently there
was an authoritative statement to the effect
that refugees were now pouring into England
at the rate of something like 800 per month.
In the committee's report we have set out
in detail what Canada has donc in this regard.
There is not time for me to go into it now,
but I can make this comment upon it: that
it is hardly a record of which Canadians need
be particularly proud. I hope it wi'll be different in the future.
Now, honourable senators, with your permission I wish to read from the conclusions
set out in the committee's report:
In conclusion, your committee expresses its
opinion that what is required for Canada is
a well-considered and sustained policy of immigration, selective in character and pursued by
Canadian authorities with initiative and enterprise. We should seek out the individual
migrants whom we want who will contribute to
our industrial and agricultural economy and
who will assist in maintaining our high standards of living by increasing proportionately our
productive power, and in additionI call special attention to these words.
-whose mentality and education will fit them
for taking part in Canada's political, economic
and social life. What we require is a steady
flow in reasonable number of good settlers both
urban and rural, rather than any excited or
spasmodie rush, with regard, of course, to the
varying economic conditions and neede of the
country from time to time. Successful immigration can be secured only by careful and intelligent planning, and sustained over a number of
years. Continuity of policy is essential to great
and lasting success.
I will not take time to read a number of
following paragraphs. The last of our conclusions is this:
Canada can be well served at this juncture by
men of action, good judgment and vision.
Then come the recommendations, and as
they are very short I suppose I should read
them:
1. Announcement immediately by the Government of Canada of a policy of selective immigration into Canada of both agricultural and
industrial workers.
2. That such immigration be limited in numbers to what from time to time appears to be

SENATE

660

the absorptive capacity of the country, and by
practical considerations of transport and establishment, and be subject to the shipping priority
of service men and their dependents and other
Canadian citizens.
3. That in anticipation of shipping becoming
available for immigration purposes:
(a) Canada's immigration policy be pu'blished
in appropriate foreign countries with explanations as to the unavoidable delay.
(b) That forthwith Canadian immigation and
inspection officers be dispatched to Europe, and
offices be opened with a view to meeting prospective immigrants and to the selection of those
most desirable.
(c) That surveys be undertaken immediately
in Europe to determine the localities where mimigrants may be found and the conditions and
anticipated problens to be met.
(d) That surveys be undertaken in Canada
in order to determine the agricultural and industrial resources available for use by prospective immigrants and the conditions and anticipated pro.blems to be met.
(e) That the Immigration Ministry at once
make studies and lay plans for an immigration
movement and promptly take steps to impleoent
suc a policy.
4. That everything possible be done to make
shipping available, subject to the above mentioned repatriation, and thereupon priority be
given to the relatives in all degrees and to the
friends of Cacad!iai citizens who assume responsibility for the care and establishment of
the itew-coner, and who are wel able and willig to give gutarantees.
5. 'T'hat the Immigration Act and Regulations
be revised to provide for the finding and selection of immigrants, the admission of those most
Iesirable, and for the supervision and assistance
.f the new-comers until established in Canada.
I submit to you, honourable senators, that
the committee's report is moderate and practical, and if followed out in the spirit in
which it is presented to this house, will contribute to the well-being of Canada, lier growth
and importance in years to corne.
In conclusion, may I he permitted to say
a word of commendation to those who sat
upon this committee with me and who spent
their time in the task-the pleasant task,
I hope it was-of hearing witnesses, gatherand studying this
ing important evidenen
problem? I wish particularly to pay tribute
te the chairman for his warm-hearted ceoperation in all the committee's work.
Hon. F. W. GERSHAW: Honourable mem-

bers, the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is to be congratulated on his exhaustive and instructive
commentary on the report of the Standing
Committee on Immigration and Labour. I
desire to offer a few remarks on the social
aspect of immigration, for the influx of a
number of people from European countries
will materially affect social conditions here.
We all recognize that more immigrants will
be needed in carrying on the development of
Canada, particularly in bringing under cultiHon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

vation the vast areas of farm land that still
await settlement. True, in days gone by our
pioneers established a proud record in opening
up our western wheat lands; but we have to
admit that while many were successful, there
were failures along the way. We must try
to so improve conditions in the future that
these casualties will be reduced to a minimum. We must hold out the hand of welcome
to these new-comers, many of whom will be
almost as ignorant as children. Because they
will not be acquainted with our laws or our
way of life, they will find it difficult to contend with unfamiliar climatic and working
conditions; in short, they will be strangers
in a strange land.
As an interne in a city where there were
a considerable number of foreigners, I was
frequently called upon to dress their wounds
and treat men who had indulged their fondness for liquor at a two or three-day wedding
celebration. Of course, net all our immigrants
are of that type. During the two sessions that
I have served on the Divorce Committee I
have observed much of the seamy side of life
among people who have not been in Canada
for any length of time. Of course, war conditions have been a factor in disrupting family
life, but many of those who appeared before
our committee showed a lamentable disregard
of moral principles and apparently had never
been taught a decent way of living. We are
certain to be faced with the problem of dealing with immigrants of this type, and particularly with their children. Where the parents
have not been able to give their boys and
girls wise counsel and advice a tremendous
obligation will be thrown upon our schools and
churches to make good this omission. More
schools will have to be provided, and these
children will have to be taught not to lie
and steal, but to be industrious and truthful
so that they may become good citizens and
contribute to the development of their adopted
country. We shall also have to educate the
parents to understand our form of government
and to appreciate the privilege of Canadian
citizenship.
It is essential tihat immigrants shall be
ready to conform to our laws and customs. I
need hardly remind honourable minmbers of
the Dukhobor problem. We have become
familiar with the fanaticism of the original
Dukhobor settlers, but it is most disappointing
to find that many of the younger generation,
in Canada, are the ringborn and educe
leaders in the burning of schools, organizing
nude parades, and other lawlessness. During
the war immigrants who lad come from Germany and Central Europe did not say very
much, but it is significant that their children

AUGUST 19, 1946
gloried in the successes of Hitler's army and
navy and seemed to be anxious to overthrow
by force the free institutions of this country.
These people are not easily assimilated, and
a heavy obligation is thrown upon our schools
and churches 'to educate them so they may
become worth-while citizens. In this task none
of us tan escape our share of responsibility.
Another impediment to many of our foreign
immigrants becoming good Canadian citizens
is that they are crowded together in our urban
centres. This brings about conditions which
are physically unhealthy, and morally bad. It
leads to bitter fights and disagreements, and
during brawls the men resort to knives and
pistols, sometimeswith tragic consequences. An
important factor in successful immigration is
the encouragement of family groups. If proper
social conditions are to be maintained, there
should not be any large influx of all men or
all women. In 1942 Mr. F. D. Clarke wrote:
In one province of this dominion there are
10,500 Chinese, including 154 women. Of these
women 70 are in houses of ill-fame.
We must take steps to prevent a repetition
of such conditions, and take appropriate action
to preserve our standards of morality.
I have referred to crowded conditions in
urban centres and the unsatisfactory results
that ensue. By contrast, the isolation of immigrants on remote prairie farms is also unsatisfactory. They are far away from schools and
churches, and there is little opportunity for
community activities. If to this isolation there
is added a low standard of living, despair sets
in, and this leads to personal neglect.
Some time ago a keen woman observer
told me that in her district there were three
classes of people: First, the nice wholesome,
right-thinking people, who educated their
children, took part in community work, upheld
standards of living, and provided a striking
object lesson to everyone else in the district;
second, people who did not know how to
farm, were unfamiliar with Canadian conditions, whose ignorance ended in failure, and
who, of course, could not give their children
any education; and third, people who, as she
put it, "go mad." These would be bachelors
living away out in remote districts in lonely,
unclean shacks. In a spirit of desperation
they would go into town and drink to excess
in an effort to forget their misery. This would
go on year after year until mentally they
were not quite normal. In those remote districts the women suffer even more than the
men. They work too hard and worry too
much, until their health breaks down.
Medical and hospital care must be provided
for these people, and we are very short of
both. We must not neglect those whom we

661

invite to our shores. In Alberta people homesteaded away in the far north, and in the
event of serious accident or sickness they
would telephone for an airplane to take them
to hospital. This happened so often that the
premier of the province decided that no more
homesteads should be granted, for he felt it
was net safe for people to be so isolated.
The home is the foundation of our civilization, and we must do all we can to make it
attractive. To this end we must have not
only certain standards of living, but of education and medical and hospital care for the
people already here and for future immigrants.
The welfare and happiness of our people
depends upon the preservation of a high
standard of nutrition and of housing and community life.
I mention these social aspects of immigration because I believe that we must bear them
in mind if we are to do our whole duty by the
immigrants whom we invite to our shores.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, first of all I should like to congratulate the honourable gentleman from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) on the presentation of the report of his committee. I listened with great interest to what he said, and
with much of it I agree, but I must confess I
am not quite sure that we are ready just yet
to invite any great influx of population. I
have still a very vivid recollection of the
depression. For several years I was chairman
of a public welfare committee at that time, and
I remember trainloads of people who came to
this country and were unable to make a living, and who had to be deported to their home
lands.
If we have to adopt a new immigration
policy, we must insist on a most careful examination of those coming to our shores to make
certain that they are sound not only mentally
and physically, but morally also; and, as the
honourable gentleman who has just sat down
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) has said, they must fit
into our social structure.
We are not likely for some length of time
to get any agricultural immigration from
Great Britain. Farming there today is heavily
subsidized and farmers are getting very high
prices.
The government therefore compels
them to pay very high wages. Farm labourers
who are getting from four te five pounds a
week for an eight-hour day, with a cottage
and milk and other perquisites, are not very
ready to emigrate.
There was some reference made to bringing
out domestic help. Such help is very scarce in
Great Britain today. I think our policy in the
past has not been quite fair in regard to the
women whom we invited to this country. They

662

SENATE

probably wanted to take positions as domestic
help either in institutions or in homes. It is
officials
immigration
that our
doubtfui
acquainted them with the real conditions in
this country. There was too much eagerness
to get immigrants, no matter whether tbey
were suitable to the country or not. About
fifteen years ago I bad lunch with a commissioner of Immigration for Canada in Great
Britain. He informed me with great glee and
in a loud voire that attracted the attention of
everyone in the dining-room for about ten or
fifteen yards around, that when a man came
to him and said he thought of emigrating to
Canada with his three daughters, who were
in service, he told him that in tis country the daughters would all be secretaries or
typists because girls in Canada took up office
work and did not go into service. I thought
it was ridiculous, but he told me that was what
he was doing.
Then again, I had the feeling that our
steamship companies were more keenly interested in bringing immigrants across the ocean
than they were in what happened to them
after they got here. That, of course, is the
esting time. As you all know, we have had
varions schemes for subsidizing immigration.
I remember one scheme under which the immigrant paid $10, the federal government $10,
the steamship company $10 and the imperial
government $10. On arrival here the young
men were expected to take positions on farms.
I well remember the day when six young men
arrived in the city of Kingston. There were
farmers at the government employment agency
to offer them positions. Not one of those
young fellows would go on the farm. To my
great amazement, two days later I found one
of them working in my own newspaper office.
I put him out without neremonv, I assure
you. Those young fellows drifted to Toronto,
Montreal and other cities. They did not play
the game. I discussed the matter with our
immigration authorities in Great Britain, and
they told me they had tried to correct the
situation, but every time they made a move
to do so they were interfered with by elected
representatives who thought such a step would
Consequently
have political repercussions.
Canada wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bringing out farm immigrants who
never went near the land.
Honourable senators, I did not get on my
Fet to find fault, but only to say that we
should go carefully, and also to tell the members of this house that at the present time we
are bringing into Canada the finest type of
immigrants we can possibly find. When I
returned to Canada on the Queen Mary a few
days ago, there were 1,200 British war brides
Hon. Mr. DAVIES.

and 990 children on board. I made it my
business to interview a number of these young
women, and I found that they were all of the
bighest type. I felt that not one bride to
whom J talked was making a mistake in coning to thi. country. I congratulate the Canadian boys who chose thes young women for
their helpmates through life.
The officer commanding the group in charge
of the war brides was Colonel Sutherland, a
son of the honourable senator from Oxford.
The last day I was on board Colonel Sutherland addressed the war brides, and I may say
that he is a worthy son of a worthy father,
for he made an excellent speech and gave
much good advice. This was followed by the
showing of a very appropriate film entitled
"This is Our Canada," produced by the
National Film Board. The showing took an
heur. All the young women and some of the
little children were presont. They appeared
to enjoy the picture and to feel that they were
coming to a country of great promise. These
young women are a very superior type of
immigrant, and I am sure that they and their
children will be a fine addition to the social,
industrial and agrieultural life of this country.
Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, as a member of the Committee on Immigration and Labour, I feel that I should
express the appreciation of this house to the
honourable member who proposed the inquiry,
for the complete report which he has given
tonight.
Thougb I was born and raised within sixty
miles of Ottawa. for the past forty yecar I
have lived in a part of western Canada quite
thickly settled with people from various European countries, ind I believe their morals are
equal to those of Canadians of any other
origin. The honourable senator from Medicine
Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) has mentioned the
Dukhobors. I may say that those who cause
trouble belong to a small group. In my community large numbers have settled on farms
of their own and have shed, so far as I know,
the fanatical tendencies of the sect.
My present concern about the immigration
policy is from the humanitarian point of
view. I have always been of the opinion that
Canada must open its doors to immigrants. I
believe 'that a country of this magnitude, with
its extensive railway mileage and vast areas of
productive soil, will not attain the prosperity
it should until it permits the entry of immigrants. Last February or Mareh the Minister
of Agriculture made a courageous speech in
Regina, in which he stated that if we in
Canada did not allow millions of people to
have access to our wide open spaces, eventually they would be taken away from us. I

AUGUST 19, 1946
believe it is our duty as a Christian nation to
respond to a world problen at this critical
time.
We have heard estimates of the population
that Canada is capable of supporting. In some
European countries the question is whether
there is sufficient land to grow enough produce
to enable the people to survive. In view of
Canada's capacity to produce cattle, hogs,
wheat and other grains in abundance, we
should not talk of limiting the number of
immigrants until we have reached the point
where there is some doubt as to our ability to
produce sufficient food for our population.
The Committee on Tourist Traffic recently
heard evidence about the possibilities of the
Alaska Highway. One witness said that in the
Fort Nelson area 275,000 to 300,000 families
could be maintained. If one travels in any
direction from the city of Ottawa he will
observe how we are wasting our land. I feel
that many people in Europe today are capable
of teaching the farmers of this country how
to utilize the soil.
The Committee on Immigration and Labour
heard a good deal of evidence about new skills
and industries which recently had corne to
Canada. May I refer to the order in council
which permits the entry of certain relatives of
Canadians of foreign descent? I recently had
a letter from a man in Alberta who wanted to
know if under this ,order in council his nephew,
who was a German prisoner of war in Canada,
would be permitted to remain in this country.
In western Canada there are people of many
different racial origins who have made ideal
settlers. It is interesting to look over the
names of those who enlisted from the province
of Saskatchewan and to note the number of
men with foreign names who won distinction
in the recent war. The other night in conmittee I was bold enough to ask about the
millions of displaced persons from parts of
Germany now occupied by Russia and other
powers. I asked the question from the humanitarian point of view. The honourable senator
from Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) spoke of
the number of trainloads of immigrants that
at one time crossed Canada. During the
period to which he refers there was great confusion everywhere, in Canada as well as
throughout the rest of the world. People were
riding the rods, taking advantage of a free trip,
to see the country. Many of them had homes;
some had farms on which they could have
remained; others were immigrants who had
cash in the bank, but who wanted to go back
to Europe to take part in the activities of
same political faction or other.
Today the four new universities in the
western provinces provide higher education
63268-44

663

for our own young people, and the boys of
the Maritimes no longer come west looking
for opportunities. My argument is that we
lack the thousands of workers necessary to
operate the farms and develop the natural
resources in this country. There is great
neglect of reforestation and irrigation projects
because of the lack of manpower. During a
discussion of the remarkable amount of work
accomplished on the farms of the West I
heard it stated that the average age of the
farmers in the province of Saskatchewan was
70 years. Many of these older people have
no young men to carry on their farming
operations when they retire.
Little or no reference has been made to
the advantage of the increased home market
which would result from an extensive immigration policy. The statistician from the
department told us a rather sad story of immigration and emigration decade by decade. In
view of the number of Canadians lost to the
United States, I believe that had we not
attracted so many immigrants at certain
periods of our development our population
would now be much less than it is. I believe
that the larger population of the United States
is one of the reasons why our people go over
there. After all, a large population provides
a home market and makes mass production
possible. I do believe that Canada will not
take its rightful place until it has nearly
twice as many people as it has today. I also
believe that we now have a wonderful opportunity to increase our population, when so
many people in Europe are looking for a
new home, and that we might never again be
able to secure large numbers of immigrants
of as good a class as are at present available.
For that reason I certainly endorse the proposal that we should try now to bring in more
people than we have admitted in the past.
Hon. CAIRINE R. WILSON: Honourable
senators, I had not expected to say anything
tonight, but as a member of the committee
and as Chairman of the Canadian National
Committee on Refugees I should like to make
a few remarks. I have had perhaps as much
experience as anyone with the very few persons admitted to Canada during recent years.
I should like first to express appreciation of
the remarks by the honourable senator from
Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) regarding
the loneliness of new-comers who settle on
farms, and the lack of interest we have taken
in those people. It is important that people
should not be allowed to settle on land where
they cannot make a living. We have seen
enough broken hearts amongst our own nativeborn Canadians to teach us this.
The honourable senator from Kingston
(Hon. Mr. Davies) alludes to the very good

REVISED EDITION

SENATE
class of immigrants in the wives who are coming oct to make homes for our service men.
I should like to add a plea on behalf of Canadian girls who have Iost a chance of getting
a husband. Should we not bring in some
young men for them? We could see to it that
there was careful selection.
I should like to mention the very high
standard of education amongst some newcomers with whom I have had to deal. They
have been particularly well qualified, and I
regret to say we cannot measure up to such a
standard here. One group, with which I had
much to do consisted of refugees who, as boys
of eleven and twelve, left the Germanv dominated by Hitler and were welcomed to the
shores of England. They had reached the age
of sixteen when-during that temporary panie
which, to the credit of the people of England,
lasted only a few days-they were sent out
to Canada. They had been selected without
discrimination, and simpiy because they were
residents of an area which was considered dangerous.
Thus. students at Cambridge were
sent out, whereas those from Oxford were not.
The commissioner who came here later to
make an inspection alluded to one extreme
instance-a surgeon who on Monday had been
officially thanked for services rendered, I
believe under fire, and on Thursday found
himself with prisoners of war en route to
Canada. As honourable senators may remember, our officials here did not understand the
situation when the prisoners of war arrived.
The colonel in charge of the camps said he
heard there was fighting going on between two
grons and he discovered they were Nazis
and anti-Nazis. In one camp a group of young
men. having been told by another group that
if they refused to "Heil Hitler" they could net
have any water, did not think they were doing
anything particularly meritorious in refusing
the command. Thev simply said, "We had
no water."
Mr. Alexander Paterson was sent here by
the Home Office, armed with some documents,
to look into the situation and endeavour to
sort out the friendly people from the others.
He made a selection of about 2,500 who, after
a long time, were segregated in refugee camps.
I must confess that I was much depressed
on each visit to those camps, for although the
red circles had beeen removed from the clothing, and a few other marks had been dispensed
with, the men were still living behind bars and
under what appeared to be prison conditions.
They were for the most part a very fine body
of men, certified by the Hdme Office to be
perfectly friendly; but under our immigration
restrictions they were net allowed to be set
free to take part in the work of the country.
The first group released were able to conform
Hon.

Mrs. WILSON.

te our regulations. There were ten, I think,
who had first-degree relatives in Canada. One
of thece men in particular rose te a very good
rank in one of our services, and his chief said
he only wished he had twenty like him.
Mr. Paterson was not very optimistic about
the prospect of conducting educational courses
for the men in the internment camps, saying
that the atmosphere there was not conducive
to study. However, he said it was worth
while te make the attempt. One of the governors of McGill University told me that the
faculty were net too anxious to publish the
results of the matriculation examinations
because the standard was so very good. And
Dr. Wallace of Queen's said to me that a
small group of these students who had
attended that university had made a great
contribution to its academie record, and that
they were of excellent character. I could cite
case after case in this group, to the number
of between 950 and 1,000 who finally were
individually released in Canada. Some of
them went into our war industries, others
attended universities as students sponsored
by Canadians or by American friends who
made funds available, and a number performed special services in our censorship
department. Some of the group have now
become Canadian citizens. Their pleasure in
this privilege and their desire to serve their
adopted country are very apparent.
I should like to say just a few words about
settlers on the land. No doubt many honourable members have read Louis Bromfield's
book Pleaset Valley. He said he had always
been told that in his own country, the United
States, there were no peasant farmers, but
he wished he could believe that no American
farmers were living below the standard of
European peasants. He went on to say that
the land which a young European farmer
inherits from his father is regarded as a priceless possession to be passed on to his own
children, whereas in the United States-and I
think this is true of our own country too-the
tendency bas been to take everything possible
away from the land and move on to another
section. Recently I read of a tobacco farmer
near London, Ontario, who only a short time
ago bad bought what was considered to be a
worthless piece of land, for which the other
day he refused $22,000. We all know what a
success bas been made by Belgian tobacco
growers in western Ontario counties.
As te immigrant children, I have seen records
which indicate they do well in our schools.
The records were drawn to my attention by
Mr. Duncan Cameron, formerly in charge of
settlement for the Canadian Pacifie Railway,
and later resident in London, where he was

665

AUGUST 19, 1946
sent to study the prospects for immigration to
Canada. He told me that the children of
families who had come to Canada since Hitler's rise to power had made remarkable progress at school. I imagine we all have read
of two or three pupils who won oratorical
contests in English, which was to them a
language acquired after two or three years
of iesidence here.
May I also say a word as to the order in
càuncil admitting certain relatives of Canadians. Within the last month I received a
letter from a woman who is living with her
husband on a farm in Alberta. She asked for
the admission of her sister and niece, who are
now in Denmark, where they have been in a
camp for displaced persons. She says that
not only would she like to have her sister living with her, but that her services and those
of the niece would be very much appreciated
in the house and on the farm. This woman's
two sons, after having served a period in the
Canadian army, are now seeking higher education, so the family has no help whatsoever.
According to our present regulations the
woman's sister is inadmissible because she is
not a single person. The Director of Immigration said that in certain cases a widow with
no children and having a brother or sister in
this country could be admitted the same as a
single person, but in this case, as the widow
bas a child, he was reluctantly obliged to
refuse her application.
I could keep on citing cases from now until
midnight. One woman is particularly anxious
to bring her niece, the last survivor of a family, and now living with people in Belgium.
She says these people have given the child a
home and, so far as she knows, are kind to
her; but naturally they cannot understand
why her aunt in Canada does not open her
home for ber. They cannot imagine that there
are any regulations which would prevent a
child in such circumstances from going to live
with her aunt. At presenit there are no facilities for examining European children who
wish to come to Canada. In Switzerland there
is a group of something like 200 who have
relatives in this country and the United States
who are eager to have them. Miss Hohermuth
was here in December as the representative of
the Swiss committee for children. She gave
us a most interesting account of the work that
had been carried on in that small country for
all the refugees of Europe. I accompanied-fier
when she called, upon the Director of Immigration and told about these children who were
under her care and for whorn relatives in
Canada and United States were asking entry.
Facilities were available for them in the United
States, but none were ready in Canada.
63268-44J

It seems to me that we can delay too long
The other day when I was speaking to the
Minister of Immigration, I thought that
Canada perhaps was doing as the elm tree in
my garden is at the moment-strangling itself
with its own rnots. It is time that we adopted
a broader policy. Not only should we show a
more .Christian spirit towards other people who
were not fortunate enough to escape the horrors of invasion, occupation and the concentration camp, but we should realize that our
country would derive great national benefit
from the admission of such a superior type
of immigrant.
Time does not permit me to tell you further
about the industries established here by
refugees and the contribution which they are
making to our economic and cultural life.
From the camp of which I spoke there has
come a violinist who promises to be outstanding. In fact when in England he was
regarded as a coming Kriseler. Fortunately
the Home Office official ordered. "On no
account let that boy handle an axe." Thanks
to the kindness of a Canadian woman in
Toronto, he bas been able to pursue his
musical education and bas played with at
least five of the most important symphony
orchestras in the United States. I could not
refrain from stating what I know of some
of these people. I think I should be disloyal
to them if I did not tell of their good points;
we are so apt to hear only of their bad.
The motion was agreed to, and the report
was concurred in.
INDIAN ACT
REPORT OF SPECIAL JOINT COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the third report of the Special Joint Committee of the Senate and the House of Commons appointed to examine and consider the
Indian Act.
Hon. J. FRED JOHNSTON: Honourable
senator from
the honourable
members,
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) when
presenting his report on immigration spoke
about the people whom he desired to bring
to Canada to become new Canadians. The
report I am presenting bas to do with old
Canadians-our Indian friends.
Honourable senators will recall that the
joint committee on the Indian Act was set up
in May of this year. The committee had not
been long organized before we found that it
would take from two to three years to complete its work, and we decided that we should
be making good progress if we were able this
session to hear the officials of the department.
We held some twenty-five meetings and took
the evidence of about half of these officials.

666

SENATE

Next session we intend to hear the representatives of the Indian organizations. British
Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan have
such organizations. I think Manitoba is in
process of forming one. The heads of those
organizations will be called to present their
briefs.
Ontario and Quebec are net so
organized, although there are more Indians
in Ontario than in any other province. Owing
to this lack of organization in the central
provinces it is more difficult to get representation from the Indians.
It is proposed that in 1948 there shall be a
revision of the act itself.
The committee hope they may be able to
assist the Indians, not by way of increases in
treaty money or what might be termed "handouts", but rather by putting them in a better
position to help themselves.
I would direct the attention of honourable
senators to section 10 of the report. The
section reads:
That as benefits have accrued to many Indians
as a result of fur conservation and development work undertaken by the Indian Affairs
Br'ani, steps b taken to extend the fur conservation and development programme into
those provinces into which it lias not yet been
introduced.
The programme lias to a small extent been
introduced in Ontario and Quebec, a considerable amount of work bas been done in Manitoba, and a little in Saskatchewan. I propose
to give honourable members a few figures to
show what can be donc to assist the Indians
by conserving fur bearing animals. In the
Le Pas district of Manitoba a fur conservation
and development programme for muskrats was
instituted in 1935. In the area that year there
were only 65 muskrat bouses and 520 muskrats.
In the five-year period to 1939 the houses had
increased to 32,369 and the mruskrats to 258,952.
A beaver project was undertaken in five areas
in Quebec and two in Ontario. The Nottaway
preserve in Quebec may be taken as an example of what was accomplished. In 1938 the
dollar value of the beavers taken there was
$17.850. Eight years later, in 1945, that value
had risen to $447,300. When the witness gave
that statement te the committee he was asked:
"How many Indians have you on the preserve?" He answered: "Approximately 100."
Fron those two examples honourable members
will appreciate the potentialities of the fur
conservation and development work. The
Indian Department intends to extend it te
every province.
Much might be said about the very interesting evidence which was adduced, but I refrain
from wearying the house at this late hour.
I need only add 'that the committee do net
Hon. Mr. JOHNSTON.

expect a final report will be available until
1948. There is a lot of work to be done in
the interval.
I move concurrence in the report.
The motion was agreed to.
TOURIST TRAFFIC
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the second report of the Standing Committee
on Tourist Traffic.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
senators, as I understand it is desired to clear
the Order Paper of the various committee
reports, I shall proceed to discuss the second
report of the Standing Committee on Tourist
Traffic, and to move its adoption. I an afraid,
though, that I shall net be able to cover the
ground as I had intended if more time had
been available. As the discussion took place
on the report of the Standing Committee on
Immigration and Labour, in which I wanted
to participate, I could net help thinking it was
most unfortunate that these reports dealing
with very important matters should be submitted at the last moment when so much business is facing us before prorogation.
It may be of interest to those who were not
members of the Senate in 1934 to know that
thbis standing committee was created as the
result of one of the recommendations of a
special committee then appointed, with the
senior senator froin Halifax (Hon. Mr. Dennis)
as chairman. That special committee recommended the appointment of a standing committee to be known as the Committee on
Tourist Traffic.
May I be permitted to pay a tribute to the
senior senator from Halifax for the active part
he took in bringing this very important question to the attention of the Senate. It is most
unfortunate for us as well as for the committee
itself that his health has in more recent years
prevented him frein taking an active part in
our deliberations.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: The recommendations contained in the final report of the special
committee appointed in 1934 are incorporated
in the present report.
The reference made te our committee was
based on a vote for the Canadian Travel
Bureau, and it might be well to say something
with respect to that bureau, which also was
created as a result of a recommendation of the
special committee. That bureau at the presout
time is under the Department of Trade and
Commerce. For the present fiscal year the
federal appropriation to assist in promoting

AUGUST 19, 1946
tourist business is $650,000. We had before
us the director of the bureau, who explained
that in the war years very little money was
expended on the promotion of tourist traffic
because during that period there was very little
tourist movement.
Honourable senators may ask how the
money is being spent. Your committee found
that expenditures were being made on account
of publicity through advertising in Canadian
and American newspapers and magazines, moving pictures and exhibitions, and sportsman's
activities for the purpose of showing the
attractive features of Canada to hunters and
tourists of that class. The advertising placed
in the Canadian papers this year was for the
most part devoted to building up in the
Canadian people a spirit of courtesy and
attention, in an effort to make the tourists
feel so much at home that they would want
to come back another year. The advertising
throughout the United States was for the
purpose of drawing attention to the return of
available accommodation in Canada now that
the war is over.
The Special Tourist Committee of 1934
emphasized the need of expenditure for the
creation of national parks. Since that time two
new parks, and possibly more, have been
brought into existence. Honourable senators
will recall that the honourable gentleman from
Margaree Forks (Hon. Mr. MacLennan) spoke
during this present session of the Cape Breton
Park. I am told that it is one of the finest
in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I am sure my
honourable friend sitting to my right will agree
that since 1934 a very fine park has been
created on Prince Edward Island, and that it
is a great attraction for tourists.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: Honourable senators, we know that the parks of Canada attract
tourists. I am aware of no other single feature more attractive to visitors than our
national parks in the mountains of the West,
on the prairies, and recently established in
the Maritime Provinces. Honourable senators
who have followed the data on the number of
visitors to the parks this year will have
observed a remarkable increase. That being
so, I think it is the business of the government to maintain the parks already in existence at a high standard, and wherever possible
to locate new parks. I live (in the summer
season) in one of the national parks in
Alberta, and know that to be attractive to
people from the United States the parks
must be maintained at a high standard.

In the development of Canada's national
parks emphasis should be placed on the
improvement of accommodation for motor
tourists.
Cabin accommodation appeals to
the average motorist coming into Canada
during the summer months.
Honourable senators, I should have liked to
discuss all the features of the report at length,
but because of the lateness of the hour I shall
curtail my remarks and emphasize only some
points which I think more important than
others. The chief recommendation of the
committee is that the federal government
should assist in, the construction of what I
call main-artery highways from the American
border to the interior of Canada. They would
be the means of attracting more tourists, and
would result in the consequent expenditure of
considerable sums of money in Canada.
One witness who appeared before the committee, representing the Edmonton Chamber
of Commerce, made the statement that the
yearly expenditure of the people of the United
States on holiday travel was $6,000,000,000. Of
course this amount is not spent in Canada,
but it was estimated that approximately 10
per cent of that sum should come to Canada.
When we realize a revenue of $600,000,000
from an export business-and that is really
what the tourist traffic is-it represents one of
our most important features of trade. If we
are to obtain that $600,000,000 we must furnish
the facilities necessary to attract tourists from
the United States. We cannot expect them to
come unless we have good highways. If we
have only dirt roads, with dust flying in the
warm summer months and uncertain conditions
in bad weather. we certainly will not be able
to attract tourists to Canada. In the past
people have come from the United States into
certain provinces where there were no improved highways, only to turn around and go
to some more favourable spot. We thereby
lost revenue and got some bad publicity, which
they would spread in their own home city.
To show what the committee had in mind
when it recommended that the federal government assist in the construction of these main
arteries, may I give the members of the bouse
an illustration?
The Prince Albert Park,
located in the northern part of the province
of Saskatchewan, is a most attractive, wellwooded area, with plenty of hunting and
fishing. It compares very favourably with
other national parks, but there is no good
highway leading to it. If an all-weather highway
were constructed from the American border to
that park, it would immediately attract tourists in substantial numbers. Across the boundary, in Manitoba, is Riding Mountain National

668

SENATE

Park, also a most attractive place, but with
no good highway leading to it from the United
States border.
We require the assistance of the federal
goveriment in the construction of highways
to bring tourist traffic to our national parks.
The lack of main arteries is a problem which
exists throughout Canada.
Only today I
read an article in the press which indicated
to me that perhaps we were on the right
track. It was to the effect that in Great
Britain there is a proposal to spend immediately $400,000,000 on a programme to improve the roads for no other purpose than
to attract tourists. Recently there appeared
in the Financial Post a statement concerning
the policy adopted in Switzerland. That country bas a programme calling for an expenditure
of a billion dollars on the improvement of its
highwa;ys, and botter accommodation for
tourists. It is realized that the tourist traffic
is the greatest business the country has, and
Switzerland is prepared to spend money to
get it. Canada's natural beauty is unsurpassed from the standpoint of attracting tourists. Hcr mountains in the West, the lake
lands of Ontario and Quebec, the St. Lawrence River, and the popular resorts of the
Maritiinm Provinecs, all are attractions which
should be made available to tourists. It was
estimated by witnesses, as well as by members
of the committee, that Canada's tourist trade
could become a S500.000,000 business.
In my hurried remarks may I refer to
another interesting feature of the tourist trade?
There is a lure for people to travel long
distances into little known places. I read
recently of a group of Americans who had
travelled bv specia train nup to Churchill for
no oihir purpos than to see Hudson Bay.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: It is a beautiful trip.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN: I think the Mackenzie River, Yellowknife and Great Bear
Lake hold the same sort of possibilities. There
are people who will want to visit these places
because they have heard about them. The
committee beard evidence from air line officials as to the possibility of developing trafie
by air into those remote areas, particularly
the Mackenzie River area and Yellowknife.
Of course the lack of accommodation for the
visitor when he arrives in these centres is a
Our report stresses the need for
drawback.
accommodation in addition to other requirements.
The committee devoted one day to the
hearing of representations concerning the possibilities of developing the Alaska Highway
from the standpoint of tourist traffic. As honourable senators know, the Alaska Highway
was constructed by the United States government at a cost exceeding $100,000,000, and
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

that it was turned over to Canada at no cost
whatever. it is now under military supervision, but the evidence indicates that there
is no intention of abandoning it. There was
some difference of opinion as to whether the
highway was attractive to tourists. If a person
wishes to travel to Alaska via the highway he
must be prepared to spend some days in getting there and a similar length of time for his
return trip, in addition to the time he spends
in Alaska or the Yukon. In any event, the
highway is to be kept open, and the report
suggests that the federal government inquire
into the possibilities of developing the highway for tourist traffic in Canada.
'rhe Minister of Publie Works of Alberta
testified before the committee as to the nocessity for shortening the approach to the beginning of the Alaska Highway by a cut-off froma
Edmonton to Dawson Creek. He said that
the province could not afford to build and
was not justified in building that road for the
pu;rpose of opening up the country. On the
other band. if there were tourist traffie possibilities, this particular piece of road should
he opened up in order to shorten the route
to Ihe highwav it-clf.
It was my privilege during the early part of
this year to attend a conference at Great
Falls, Montana, at which the only question
under discussion was the Alaska Highway. J
was surprised to learn of the feeling in the
United States that the highway should be kept
open for tourist traffic. The people at Ilhe
conference thought it had great attractions;
they went so far as to suggest that the United
States government should contribute towards
its maintenance and. if necessir,. expend
money in shortening the route. Of course that
was the opinion of a group of individuals; but
they looked upon it as having real possibilities.
The comimittee however does not commit
itself on the question of the Alaska Highway,
except to recommend that the federal government inquire into its possibilities for development.

Mr. Christiansen, Chairman of the Alaska
Highway Committee of the Edmonton Chamber of Commerce and one of the witnesses
who appeared before our committee, wired
me after he left Ottawa to say that he had
received a message from the Secretary of the
United States Automobile Association. He said
that the 1,600,000 members of that association
had been canvassed with a view to learning
how many were interested in travelling over
the Alaska Highway. The replies showed that
in the neighbourhood of 200,000 members
wanted to take the trip. The only approach to
Alaska, apart from air or water, is over this
highway. The American people could go all

AUGUST 19, 1946
the way to Fairbanks and other pointa in
Alaska, and on the way they would spend a
good deal of money in Canada.
Many other features of the report of the
committee cannot now be stressed because of
the lateness of the hour. But before concluding I may say that we heard evidence concerning the development of the Gatineau Park,
which is located in the immediate vicinity of
the capital of Canada. We not only heard evidence, but saw moving pictures which
impressed every member of the committee
with the beauty of the park and its possibilities from the standpoint of tourist attraction.
One of our members was most insistent that
the capital of Canada was one place that
would attract thousands of touristi. I understand that a good deal of land has been
acquired and that the additional area necessary for the park would not cost very much.
A fine park could be developed there, close
to the capital of our country, and be made a
special attraction for tourists, particularly from
the eastern United States.
The committee heard from eighteen witnesses, representing the Travel Bureau, the
National Parks Bureau, the transportation interests and others. I was a member of the
special committee appointed by the Senate in
1934 to consider the tourist traffic. We heard
a good deal about the whole matter then, but
this year I was much more impressed than
ever before with the possibilities of the
business, and more firmly convinced that the
government would be well advised to increase
its appropriations for facilities that will not
only attract tourists to this country but will
enable them to enjoy their stay, so that when
they return home they will take back a good
word for Canada. There is no use bringing
tourists here if afterwards they are a bad
advertisement for our country, critical of our
facilities and of the kind of service they
received. We emphasize the necessity for
courtesy and excellence of service everywhere.
I might mention incidentally that a friend
of mine in Winnipeg, whom I asked what the
tourist traffic meant to the mercantile business,
sent a reply which made me realize that tourists not only spend money on pleasure but
buy a lot of goods which they take back with
them. He told me that the tourist trade was
a major business in the summer, and in the
sections where the season .is long, as on the
Pacifie coast, it is an all-year business of large
proportions.
In asking that the Senate support the committee's recommendations, and particularly
the one in favour of federal government participation in highway construction, I hope I
have demonstrated to honourable members
that the tourist trade is already big business,

669

worthy of our serious attention, and that
we will get good value from the money and
effort we expend on its continued development.
The report recommends that the evidence
taken at the committee's last meeting be
printed and form part of the report itself. I
might explain that the time of the Senate'
reporters was so taken up by other committees this session that we were able to get
a shorthand report of only the one meeting.
That was the one at which we heard witnesses
on the Alaska highway, and we felt that the
evidence was important enough to be printed.
It contains a good deal of valuable information to which references will undoubtedly be
made in the future, and printed copies would
serve a useful purpose.
May I thank the members of the committee for the interest they took in its proceedings. Sometimes I may have had to close
an eye so as not to be able to see too well
whether a full quorum was present, but in
any event our meetings were interesting and
the members were most helpful in drawing out
important information.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Honourable senators,
I should like to make some contribution to
the discussion of what is unquestionably a
very important matter, but as I could scarcely
finish before eleven o'clock, and I do not
think honourable senators would care to remain beyond that hour, I will, if it meets
with the approval of the house, move the
adjournment of the debate.

On the notice by Hon. Mr. McGeer:
That in the opinion of this house, a special
committee consisting of six senators from Ontario, six senators from Quebec, six senators
from the Maritime Provinces and six senators
from the Western Provinces, to be selected by
the Speaker of the Senate, the Leader of the
Government and the Leader of the Opposition
in the Senate, should be set up to study and
report on the best method by which the British
North America Act may be amended or changed

SENATE

so that while safeguarding the existing rights
of territorial, racial and religious minorities
and the autonomy reserved to the provinces in
the said Act of ý1867, the dominion government
and the provincial governments may be given
adequate powers to deal effectively with the
economic, interprovincial, internal and inter.national problems now demanding urgent, just
and effective settlement;
And that the committee be empowered to
study and report on the best method by which
the British North America Act may be amended
or changed to meet every and all situations now
existing;
And that the said committee shall have power
to sit during the time this bouse is not in session
and to report from time to time and te the
next session of this bouse and to call witnesses,
employ assistants to take evidence and to do
all things which the committee nay deern requisite and necessary in the preparation and
presentation of its report.
And that the address and proposed legislation
now before this lieuse be referred to the said
committee.
Hon. G. G. McGEER: Honourable senators,
I would ask leave te withdraw the last two
paragraphs of this resolution. One of these
paragraphs deals with the legislation proposed
for the purpose of making a change in the
representation of the provinces in the elected
chamber-and that legislation bas now been
enacted by the British Parliament; the other
proposes that the committee suggested in my
resolution be empowered to sit between the
prorogation of the present session and the
convention of the next one.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, that the honourable
gentleman shall have leave to withdraw the
last two paragraphs of his resolution?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Agreed.
The two paragraphs were withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I now move the resolution, as amended.
At the outset may I say that the Constikitien of Canada. consists of the common law
of England as of the time when the first British colonies were established on this continent,
lias been changed by the legislation of the
British parliament applicable to the colonies
in North America and by the law-making
powers of the colonies themselves. The Quebec
Act, the Constitutional Act and all other acts
of the British parliament applying te the colonies are still in force; but the Constitution
has again been changed by the passing of the
British North America Act and its various
amendments, and as well by laws passed by
the Parliament of Canada and by the legislatures of the different provinces. It bas been
changed also by the enactment of the Statute
of Westminster and bas been varied by many
decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada
and of the Judicial Committee of the Privy
lion.

Ir. CRERAR.

Council. It is in, that mass of tradition, precedent, law and practice that our constitution is to be found today.
The question of constitutional security,
change and stability is not a new issue for
Canada, but I should like to refer honourable
senators who are interested in this question to
a book written by Mr. Maurice Ollivier-a
constitutional authority of outstanding ability,
a parliamentary counsel of long experience,
and a writer of brilliance. He lias accomulished the difficult task of dealing with
Canada's constitutional position, past, present
and future, in a way that makes the subject
readable to the layman. His book is written
for popular reading, but at the same time it is
a book for those who wish to go into the technical legal phases of the subject, and for them
it is practically a complete reference to all
of the great issues involved and all the leading
and important decisions made. I commend
the book te honourable members. Further, I
believe this is the kind of text which should be
read and understood by all Canadians of high
school age, about te go out into the future.
May I refer te one or two important obsers ations which the auther makes regarding the
necessity of Canada securing her constitution
as a well-defined piece of governing law?
Chapter XXIV is headied "The Canadian Constitution and the Trojan Horse." It reads as
follows:
One may ask what the Trojan horse bas te
do with this book. Only this, that like the
British North America Act it is a very old
machine; but unlike our constitution, one would
net expect it to serve now, certainly net without
seme changes, in order te find a solution for our
modern problems. Here our comparison ends:
it is useless to open the Iliad, se let us ]eave old
Homer and the Trojan borse te nod in peace.
As Mr. Arthur Beauchesne has stated: "When
the British North America Act was passed, the
population of the four provinces which formsed
the Doninion of Canada aggregated 3,070,061,
or less than the present population of Ontario
aud Quebec. The total revenue of the dominion
in 1868 was $13.687.928 and the total expenditurc $14,071.689. The net debt of the country
was $75,757,135."
Our present debt is in the vicinity of seventeen billion dollars.
"Our railway mileage was 2,278; motor vehicles
were net knon; aviation was a dream. The
West was uninhabited except by Indians. halfbreeds, fur dealers and roaming buffaloes. The
population of British Columbia was very small
since it was put down in 1871 to 45.000 of which
number only about 9,000 were whites.
There was no question of our representation
in foreign countries; we were net even allowed
to negotiate our own treaties; there were
British garrisons in our country: social reforms
was looked upon as the last word of dangerous
radicalism. The people of 1935 are different
frem those of 1867. What -ve want is a new
constitution."

AUGUST 20, 1946

Dr. Ollivier points out prominent Canadians
who have recognized, the need for a new constitution. At page 329 he says:
The Right Honourable R. B. Bennett said in
the house on the subject, April 11, 1934: All
that I can say is that I am firmly convinced of
the necessity which exists to revise our constitution as soon as possible."
On page 333 he refers to the Right Honourable Mackenzie King as follows:
said
The Right Honourable Mackenzie Ki
wish
on the debate on the Address in 1935: i
'North
again to say that I think the Britiai
America Act has been a marvelous achievement;
thus far it has served its purpose remarkably
well, but -I wish to make it clear that I think
the British North America Act requires amendmient in seme particulars, and tha first amendment that should be secured is the recognition
of the right of this country to amend its own
constitution. Canada, as far as I know, is the
only British dominion that has not that right."
At page 329 he again cites the Right Honourable Mr. King in this vein:
Here also is the opinion of the Right Honourabla Mackenzie King: "A change in the British
*Nrth America Act which would ignora the
autonomy of the provinces is one thing; and an
amendment which would serve the interests of
the provinces without causing damage to their
autonomy is altogether another."
I think most people today will agree that
the changes which have taken place have
been not such as would indicate that we should
do away with the principle of federal union,
but rather, such as would justify the adoption
of federal union as against legislative union.
Looking to the future of Canada it would
seem that the need for the continuation of the
principle that the people in the various sections of the dominion shall have jurisdiction
over their own local affairs, as well as the
means to develop and advance them, is more
imperative than it was in 1867. The position
of the Maritime Provinces today in relation
to the rest of Canada is the same as it was in
1867, if not even more pronounced. The province of Quebec is still the home of a FrenchCanadian majority and an English-Canadian
minority. The great province of Ontario has
expanded and. developed from an agricultural
community into a great mining, forestry,
industrial and commercial community. The
interests of these three great sections which
formed the original confederation are still as
distinctly separate as they were in 1867. The
attempt to govern these three great sections of
Canada, with their different races and different
interests, is just as difficult today as it was
in 1867, and, I venture to say, just as
impossible.
In the meantime the Prairie Provinces have
developed. Out in the West today Manitoba
and Saskatchewan are no longer just graingrowing and cattle-raising areas, but are
•

becoming industrialized. They have developed
and are developing their water powers and
vast mining interests. They are a community
just as much separate and apart from Ontario
and Quebec as are the Maritimes.
Farther west there are the great provinces
of Alberta and British Columbia, with their
enormous wealth in oil, coal, timber and
minerals of great variety; with their fisheries,
their vast grain-growing areas and their farms,
on which every ty.pe of live-stock is produced, as well as agricultural products ranging
from berries 'to apples. That great sloping
section facing the Pacifie Ocean-the world's
greatest future theatre of human affairs and of
trade and commerce-is as separate from the
rest of Canada as the Maritimes are from
the eastern provinces.
As all honourable senators are aware, there
have been and still are outstanding men in
our Canadian life who believe in the policy
of centralization; men who, with a view to
reducing the cost of the government, believe
it would be well to concentrate the power in
one central parliament and reduce the provincial governments to the status of municipal couneils. A few weeks ago we had
before us a resolution calling for a fundamental change in the representation of the
provinces in another place. I opposed the
resolution because the provinces were vitally
concerned in the proposed adjustment and
had not been consulted about it. This adjustment was applicable only to the other
place, but if the resolution had been founded
on a spirit of justice, the proposal would
have included an adjustment of the Senate
representation of the four western provinces.
In each of those four provinces there is a
popuqation of roughly one million people,
and that population is rapidly increasing. Yet
the province of British Columbia has only
six senators, whereas Nova Scotia, with but
half as much population, has ten. The adjustments that are obviously necessary must
be made before long, and why they were not
included in the resolution to which I have
referred is beyond me. However, I have had
a good deal of experience in the relations of
the Pacifie Coast with Ottawa, and I long
ago discovered that while it is only about
2500 miles from Vancouver to Ottawa, the
distance from Ottawa to Vancouver is about
25,000 miles. Here they always have seemed
to be iooking through the wrong end of the
telescope. Perhaps that is quite natural, and
is one of the reasons why the Fathers of
Confederation deemed it wise to let the people
in the areas far away from the centre of
government have control over their own
local affairs.

by reason of the fact that under section 7 (1)
of the Statute of Westminster the amendment
or repeal of the British North America At
was excluded that this bill needs to come before

this bouse at all.
was only one amendment proposed to the bill
as introduced, and that was defeated by 108
votes to 42, so that it represents the considered
and overwhelming opinion of the Canadian parliament. As the noble viscount says, these are
not matters for us, and it is for me to ask
your lordships to adopt this procedure as is
required of us at the request of the Canadian
government under the provisions of the Statute
of Westminster.
The bill went fromt the Lords to the House

of Commons.

From the Hansard of that

House I quote the following:
(Major, Sir
The SOLICITOR-GENERAL
Frank SOSKICE):
I beg to move, "That the bill be now read a
second time."
The object of the bill is to give effect to an
address which has been presented to His
Majesty by the Parliament of Canada praying
that certain alterations in representation in
the Canadian House of Commons shall become
effective. To give effect to this request it is
necessary to repeal section 51 of the British
North America Act, 1867, and to substitute the
provisions set out in the bill. That act is
expressly excluded from the provisions of the
Statute of Westminster, 1931. by section 7(1)
of that act. Accordingly. in order to effect the
necessary change in the British North America
Act. it is necessary to pass the present bill
through the United Kingdom Houses of Parliament.
The bill comes to this bouse from another
place. It deals, of course with a matter which
is primarily within the discretion and judgment
The Canadian
of the Canadian legislature.
legislature bas decided upon this change, and is
desirous that legislation in the teras of its
address to His Majesty should be enacted as
speedily as possible by the United Kingdom parliament. I hope that the bouse will agree that
it would be proper to accede to the desire of
the Canadian legislature, and I accordingly ask
that this bill may be accorded a second reading. I would add that, in view of the wish of
the Canadian legislature that the matter should
be dealt with expeditiously, I hope that the
bouse will be able to sec its way to pass the bill
through its rernaining stages this morning.
That was all.
But Mr. Beverley Baxter, Conservative
member for Wood Green, and a former Canadian, intervened in the debate. He said:
While all of us agree that this is a request
by the Canadian government which will automatically be agreed to by this house I want to
point out one or twro things, which, I think,
we might bear in mind. When .the Statute of
Westminster was passed, it was laid down that
after the passing of that statute no act carried
in this house could have effect upon any
dominion. That is the very essence of the
As the SolicitorStatute of Westminster.
General has said, the British North America
Act is exempted from that, but nevertheless I
put it to the house that the very fact that we
in the Imperial parliament are today passing an
alteraetion in that act is an anachronism in

673

itself. Truc, it is only formal and it is automatie what we do today, but it is something
which does affect the constitution of the Dominion of Canada. Therefore I say it is an
anachronism.
Mr. Baxter goes on to say:
Canada is the only dominion where the constitution may be altered by a majority vote in
its parliament; in other words, by a party vote.
We find ourselves here automatically required,
and rightly so, to carry out the wishes of the
Canadian parliament.
Further down on the page Mr. Baxter says:
I should like to make this serious suggestion
to the Solicitor-General. It should be possible
to pass a resolution in both bouses here and
in Canada that in future any alteration or
amendment to the British North America Act
should be done solely by the Canadian parliament, that the Canadian parliament should itself make any alteration in the Canadian constitution, and that this bouse should forego
forever any further passing of any act or
measure affecting any of the dominions.
By the interpretation placed upon the
Statute of Westminster by the parliament of
the Mother Country, England has politely,
firmly and definitely cut Canada adrift.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Britain, not England.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: The parliament of
Great Britain has politely told Canada: "You
are old enough and intelligent enough to run
your own affairs." Again I sec the shade of
Henri Bourassa.
Canada is today a great nation, occupying
a place in the front line of the great nations
of the world. In fact I would classify the
leading nations of this generation as follows:
first, the United States of America; second,
the Soviet Union; third, Great Britain and
her empire, and fourth, the Dominion of
Canada. I ,am aware that Canada is not in
fourth place from the standpoint of population, but she does occupy that position as
respects -ealth, intelligence and capacity to
produce. I believe that she occupies fourth
place among the fighting powers. During the
last six years Canada has builded for herself a
reputation that has made her one of the
mainstays in the struggle for world freedom.
As Mr. Hoover said, after touring the world,
Canada in the post-war crisis of starvation
made the greatest contribution of any country
in the world.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: This nation of ours
is comprised of something more than an
enormous territory with unlimited resources
and its own people. It has assumed a position
in the world in which we live. Canada still
retains all the magnificent prestige of being

a member of the British Commonwealth, a

group of nations tied together by the single

SENATE
thread of allegiance to a common Crown that
is the servant and not the ruler of the British
people. This nation of ours is a full partner
with the United States of America in the
administration of the North American continent.

Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: We have our joint
defence agreement, our Hyde Park Agreement; we are peoples with the same ideals,
confronted with the same problems of common
defence. They in the United States and we
in the Dominion of Canada together have the
responsibility of maintaining the North
American continent as the citadel of freedom
for all the world.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Canada under the
federal union bas grown into that proud place.
Today she looks forward to greater things in
the future than she bas ever enjoyed in the
past. The time has come when we should
have the kind of securities that will preserve
the institutions that have brought us thus far.
But today Canada is adrift. The British parliament bas eut the painter, and we are without
anchor and without rudder-unless we are
prepared to trust our constitutional security
to the vagaries and whims of party politics.
I think it was the Right Honourable Ernest
Lapointe who said that a constitution should
be flexible, but that it should not be so flexible
as to be amended easily. We have gone to
the very limit of making amendment easy.
We do not even have to pass an act of parliament. All that is necessary is a resolution of
the other bouse, endorsed by this chamber,
and it will be rubber-stamped into the constitution bv the British Parliament. That is not
good enough for Canadians. We are without
a constitution which guarantees to our people
and our nation the essential and fundamental
securities of a federal union. I can state the
situation in one sentence: Canada. one of the
great nations of the world, is drifting under
a colonial constitution, without the securities
that go with sueh a constitution when the
Mother Countrv maintains it for a colony.
Anyone who dreamed or thought that because
our constitution was an act of the British parliament. federal union was a guarantee of the
rights of the provinces and of minorities, or of
the integrity of the nation, must realize today
that there is no such guarantee. It bas gone.
Se, if we are going to have those fundamental
secutritios that are essential to stability, we
muîst have a new constitution. and, it must be
written by Canadians and oboeld iii trust for
the Canadian people by the Canadian
parliament..
Hon. Mr. McEER.

There are some things, I believe, that every
honourable member knows are dangerois.
For instance, you cannot have responsible
goveruiment unless the will of the majority
rules. A great many of the representatives in
all our governments today-municipal, provincial
aand federal-were
elected by a
minority of votes. I do not know how that
situation- can be corrected, but I do know
that the constitution should provide that no
person shall sit as a representative of any constituency unles elected by a majority of the
votes of that contituency. Wbether that can
be accomplished by the development of the
primary systei as they have it to the south
of us. or whether it can be done by proportional representation or by the alternate vote,
I do not know; but certainly we cannot go on
as we are now, because our nation is in danger
of being captured by a minority representation
of the electors of this country.
There is another phase of our life that I
think is of the utmost importance. Do bonourable members realize that we have been here
for months and so far have net seen a sign
of the budget of billions of dollars? There
should be a committee of ways and means in
the other bouse and a commuittee of ways and
means in the SenateHon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear bear.
Hon. Mr. MCGEER: -- and surely there
should be a constitutional obligation on the
government to present at the opening of the
session an outline of the budget. The amount
of the national expenditures and the method
of raising the money to meet them should
not be determined by a little group of men
sitting in isolation, screened off from public
responsibility and public gaze, to be presented
later in the form of expenditures of billions
of dollars which no one in eithor chamber of
parlianient understands, or about which no
oneo Las a word to say.
Sone Hon. SENATORS: Hear hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Yeu cannot have responsible government unless those who are
re-ponsible to the people are in control of not
only the taxation policy but the expenditure
policy as well.
Our parliamentary rules also need to be
changed. In the British House of Commons
three davs are allowed for diebates on the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne; representative leaders debate the
tssue, and that is an end of it. Here the debate
goes on and on and on until it becomes nothing
but an endless repetition of addresses delivered
to empty benches. There is a siemilar situation
with regard to the budget.
In the British

AUGUST 20, 1946

House of Commons the government lays down
its policy, which is debated for three days, I
think, and then the items come up for vote.
But they are voted on without debate. They
can of course 'be voted down. In the United
States all this work is done by committees. If
we in Canada want to prevent the loss of
regard and respect for our institutions, we
must see to it that there is a much greater
degree of efficiency in our parliament than
there has been in the past. It is only by some
constitutional change that we eau hope to
do that.
One other matter that I want to lay before
honourable members of this house today is
the dominion-provincial deadlock. I do not
know what attention honourable members
have been paying to this, but I have followed
it from an angle, which is perhaps a little
different from that of most senators. I believe
that the issue is great not only as between our
national and provincial government, but also
as it concerns our cities and local governments.
I have had a good deal of experience in municipal and provincial governments, and it
seems to me that when we look at the present
situation we must remember that prior to the
war our provinces and cities were in a state
of hopeless bankruptcy. Ontario municipalities
were in default to the extent of something more
You who know the cities
than $100,000,000.
of Toronto and Montreal, of Saint John and
Halifax, as others of us know the younger
cities of the West, must be aware that our
cities were deteriorating all during the depression. In other words, throughout the ten or
more years of the depression plus the six
years of war-a total of somewhere between
16 and 20 years-there has been in our cities
an accumulation of deferredi maintenance and
expansion.
I think it would be well for us to refer back
for a few minutes to the wisdom of the
Fathers of Confederation, and note again the
provisions they made for carrying out the
Sir John A.
principle of a federal union.
Macdonald, as he said himself, was in favour
of a legislative union; Cartier and George
Brown were against it. After it had been
decided that 'Canada was to be a federal
union, Sir John A. Macdonald said, as reported
in the Conjederation Debates, 1865, at page
40:
It will be seen that the local legislatures have
the control of all local works; and it is a matter of great importance, and one of the chief
advantages of the federal union and of local
legislatures, that each province will have the
power and means of developing its own
resources and aiding its own progress after its
on fashion and in its own way. Therefore all
the local improvements, all local enterprises or

675

undertakings of any kind, have been left to the
care and management of the local legislature of
each province.
Mr. Alexander Galt, the Minister of Finance
at the time, made this statement, which is to
be found at page 68 of the same volume:
It will be observed that in the plan proposed
there are certain sources of local revenue
reserved to the local governments, arising from
territorial domain, lands, mines etc. In the case
of Canada, a large sum will be received from
these sources, but it may be that some of them,
such as the Municipal Loan Fund, will become
exhausted in course of time. We may, however,
place just confidence in the development of our
resources, and repose in the belief that we shall
find in our territorial domain, our valuable
mines and our fertile lands, additional sources
of revenue far beyond the requirements of the
If, nevertheless, the local
public service.
revenues become inadequate, it will be necessary
for the local governments to have resort to
direct taxation.
And at page 69 he goes on:
In transferring to the general government all
the large sources of revenue, and in placing in
their hand with a single exception, that of direct
taxation. all the means whereby the industry
of the people may be made to contribute to the
wants of the state, it must be evident to everyone that some portion of the resources thus
placed at the disposal of the general government
must in some form or other be available to
supply the hiatus that would otherwise take
place between the sources of local revenue and
the demands of local expenditures.
The provinces were to have direct taxation,
and in addition, as Mr. Galt points out,

there would have to be provincial subsidies.
I have no hesitation in saying that the
Fathers of Confederation intended that direct
taxation should be an exclusive prerogative
of the provincial legislatures.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The honourable gentleman
will no doubt agree, however, that they did
not translate such intention into the language
of the British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I think they did. I
submit that the body which made the error in
interpretation is the Privy Council, and I
will shortly refer to some of its decisions to
show what 1 mean. I believe that if our
provinces had been left with that power of
taxation we would have had a much stronger

dominion today.
In 1917 the dominion government imposed
an income tax, and the then Minister of
Finance offered this observation:
The dominion government under the provision
of the British North Amnerica Act, -1867, is empowered to raise revenue by any mode or form
of taxation. whether direct or indirect. On the
contrary, the provinces, and by consequence the
municipalities which derive their taxation power

AUGUST 20, 1946
in our constitutional position to remain undefined. If Canada is to continue to progress
and prosper as a federal unionSome Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: -that division is too
serious.
Now, what about the law as we have it up
to the present time? A great many people
seem to assume that because under section 91
of the British North America Act the national
parliament has the power to raise money
"by any mode or system of taxation", it can
do everything. That is not true. It is an
exclusive jurisdiction of course, and if the
national parliament bas an exclusive jurisdiction to levy taxes "by any mode or system of
taxation" then the provinces can have no taxation powers whatever. But under section 92
the provinces themselves have powers of taxation. They have an exclusive jurisdiction to
levy taxes within the provinces in order to
raise revenues for provincial purposes. The
totality of the taxation powers of the dominion is lessened by whatever may be the taxation powers of the provinces. That matter
was first reviewed in the old cases of Abbott
v. the city of Saint John, and Parsons v. the
Citizens' Insurance Company. It came under
review before the Privy Council in Bank of
Toronto v. Lambe. There is a fair summary
of it in the judgment of the Privy Council in
Caron v. The King, cited in Cameron's Privy
Council decisions, volume 11, page 353. I ask
my learned colleagues to observe these remarks
of the Privy Council:
Money raised by an income tax act is unquestionably money raised by a mode or system of
taxation.
It is true that by the provisions of section
92 the legislature in each province may exclusively make laws in relation to certain
matters coming within the classes of subjects
which are there enumerated, and that one of
these classes of subjects is "direct taxation
within the province in order to the raising of
a revenue for provincial purposes."
As such particular direct taxation is reserved
to the province, to that extent there is some
deduction to be made from the totality of power
apparently given exclusively to the dominion
parliamenrt to raise money for any purpose by
any mode or system of taxation.
Tihis apparent antinomy has been noticed in
various decisions. It is sufficient to mention
Citizens' Insurance Company v. Parsons and
the Bank of Toronto v. Lambe. In the latter
case, their lordships observed as follows: "It
is impossible to give exclusively to the dominion
the whole subject of raising money by any mode
of taxation, and at the same time to give to the
provincial legislatures, exclusively or at all, the
power of direct taxation for provincial or any
other purposes. This very conflict betwçeen the
two sections was noticed by way of illustration
in the case of Parsons" and after quoting from
the earlier judgment, their lordships proceeded:
"Their lordships adhere -to that view, and
hold that, as regards direct taxation within the

province to raise revenue for provincial purposes, that subject falls ivholly within the jurisdiction of the provincial legislatures."
The only occasion on which it could be necessary to consider which of these two principles
was to guide, would be in the not very probable
event of the Parlianient of Canada desiring to
raise money for provincial purposes by indirect
taxation. It might then become necessary to
consider whether the taxation could be supported, because the power to impose it, given
by head 3 of section 91, had not been taken out
of the general power by the particular provision, or because though not given by head 3,
it was given as a residual power by the other
parts of section 91. But no such question arises
now.
Those decisions lay down the rule that the
levying of direct taxation for provincial purposes is exclusively within the jurisdiction of
the provinces and cannot, under the constitution, be transferred by agreement from the
provinces to the national government.
In the Employment and Social Insurance
case this issue was very fully discussed by the
judges of our Supreme Court. The then Chief
Justice, Sir Lyman Duff, held strongly that
the insurance levy was a tax and was intra
vires of the national parliament, under its
powers to levy taxes by any "mode or system
of taxation." The judgment of the court to
the contrary was written by the present Chief
Justice, and was supported by a majority of
the court. This case will be found in Plaxton's
Constitutional Law at page 305. One of the
arguments advanced was that if the levies
made to carry out the scheme were taxation,
they were levies that the national parliament
could make under section 91, which gives to
that parliament the right to collect taxes "by
any mode or system of taxation."
The Honourable Mr. St. Laurent, now
Minister of Justice who appeared for the
federal government before the Privy Council,
is quoted as saying:
If it is taxation, then parliament bas the
right to use any mode or form of taxation.
In dealing with the matter Lord Atkin, who
read the judgment, said:
That the dominion may impose taxation for
the purpose of creating a fund for special purposes and may apply that fund for making contributions in the publie interest to individuals,
corporations or public authorities could not, as
a general proposition, be denied. . . . But assuming that the dominion bas collected by means of
taxation a fund, it by no means follows that
any legislation which disposes of it is necessarily within dominion competence. ... If on the
true view of the legislation it is found that
in reality in pith and substance the legislation
... encroaches upon the provincial field, the
legislation will be invalid. To hold otherwise
would afford the dominion an easy passage into
the provincial domain.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: What was the finding?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The finding was that
the tax was ultra vires of the national
parliament.
In the well known case of Bank of
Toronto v. Lambe, the argument was made
that the bank having been constituted. created
and operated under authority of the national
laws, the provincial governments had no power
to tax it, because if they were given that
authority tlhey might tax it out of business.
The courts concluded that the powers were not
to be used in that way, but that if the time
should cone when they were to be so used
there would ie au opportunity to deal with
them. In the Alberta bank taxation case thte
courts found that the taxes levied on the banks
were designed to put the banks out of business
and it was held that, having gone that far,
tIe power of taxation twas ultra vires.
I come now to the proposition that by the
very terms of the proposals or agreements
offered to the provincial governments the
federal government admits that it has
encroached upon the revenues of the provinces
>o far, and piopoess Io eneroach so far; that

it intends to levy dominion taxes within the
provinces and then to hand the revenue over
to the provincial governments to carry on.
As I read the law today that procedure is ultra
ite of th' Dominion Parliamient.
I ay that
it cannot by agreement secure from the provinees a jurisdiction that it does net enjoy.
That principle, I think, was decided in the
case of C.P.R. v. Notre Dtmt de Bonsecours
Parish, cited in 1899, Appeal Cases 367. In
that case the following principle was laid
down:
hlie doiinioi cainot give jurisdiction et'
leatve jiti d jeton wiithin the proviie.
Tlie

other enn enlarge the jiirisdiction of the other.
ot suitredter jiirisdiction.
That principle was adopted by the Manitoba

steel producers; but in view of the situation
tiat bas developed in Canada, the attitude of
the government is to me incomprebensible.
I believe that no one who Pas the faintest
conception of economics could defend it. The
attitude of the government may be summed up
in this one sentence: While an increase of
ten cents an heur is justifiable and would, do
nol harm to the price structure, an increase to
fifteen cents per hour would put a pressure on
the price structure which would result in
disastrous inflation.
When the Ioggers striuck on the Pacific
coast. the government appointed the Honourable Mr. Justice Sloan as a mediator te settle
the dispute. After the investigation was conpleted Mr. Justice Sloan recommended, among
other things, an increase of fiftecen cents per
heur. It was recognized that even before the
inecrease the wage level in the lumber industry in British Columbia was higher than
that in eastern Canada. Products of the forest
play just as important a part in the life of
the nation as do the products of the steel
producers; as a matter of fact, it may be said
that in all construction work lumber and steel
go together. Whten an increase of fifteen cents
an heur for the British Columbia loggers was
recoimended
Iv thi
commissioner,
the
Miisiteur of Labour received the finding and,
speaking on beialf of the government, recommendoed its acceptance. The proble
was
uider discussion for weeks. During that period
the provincial government of British Columbia. the federal government at Ottawa and
the comimissioner were pressing for a settlement in order to get the men back te work
on the new rate of pay, and thero was not
one word of criticism on the ground of
t:hretleed inflation. I find it impossible te
understand why fifteen cents an hour should
be considored inflationary in the East when
it

i

not so regarded in

the West.

Let us examine that situation. Wie bave
accepted a fifteen cet wage increase in the

Court of Appeal in th' case of R x v. Brodsky,

West,

1936; by the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
in Rex v. Zaslav sky, 1935; and in the Alberta
Suîpreme Court in Rex v. Thorsb.y Trader, 1936.
Again I say that these are situations which
lrmand clarification. If we in Canada are to
have the enjoyment that we should from our
possessions, we must have stability.
Another important feature is that we must
have uniformity, not only of law, but of
economie and social life throughout the
dominion. We cannot have one standard for
th West and another for the East. I îlo not
propose to discuss the merits of the demands
of the steel work-ers or the contentions of the

adisecd to accept it-that il was wrong and
had an inflationary effect. I have said before,
and I wish to repeat, that it is time we bogan
to dcal with this question as the representatives of the people, and to realize that this
problem is the res-ult of bad advice on the
part of civil sertants. The sooner we recapture the government of this country from
civil servants, the better off we are going to he.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I belive that the revolt in the lou-e of Representatives and the
Stnate of the United States was one of the

AUGUST 20, 1946

greatest things that bas happcocd on this
continent in a long time. It did result in the
development and creation of a price control
board that wcnt out to function, not as an
auth'ority domninating the community, but as
an agency representative of the governTnent,
in an effort to work out a programme in
which production was the paramount objective.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Let us look at this
inflationary nonsense and examine the facts.
Whcn the Family Allowanccs Bill was introduced, we were told that the expenditure of
$250,000,000 on the children of Canada would
help to increase the purchasing power requircd

produce nothing; the money goes into circulation; and there is no criticismn of the ineasure
on the ground that it was inflationary. The
magnificent $ffl,000,000 programme which the
De-partment of Veterans Affairs bias developed
is being carried through without any criticism
that the expenditure will have an inflationary
cifeet on this country. Our huge national debt
requires an annual intcrest payment of
$500,00,000, and it is not condemned as
infiationary. I ask, honourable senators, whvat
could be more inflationary than interest
payments?
The price of wheat at $1.55 a bushel for
export and $1.35 for home consumption bias
been guaranteed for the next four years. 1
know of no four-year period when the farmers
in western Canada have enjoyeà an average
return as great as that.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman to say that I believe
the price is fixed for only two years, and is to
be readjusted at the end of that period?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: It is guaranteed,, but
the assumption is that the price will go up
rather than d.own. In any event I do not
quarrel over the question-leave it at two
years. The price is guaranteed, and this is
going to put into circulation an enormous
amount of moncy. My honourable fricnd who
represents the prairie farmers knows of the
volume of money in circulation at the present
moment. Even without this guarantee-and
I arn speaking only from an inflationary point
of vîew-there is more money today than there
are goods to satisfy the demand. No one bas
condemncd the fixing of wheat prices on the
ground that it will wreck the price structure
and bring about inflation.
The theory is that inflation will result whcn
there is an inease in the volume of purchasing power in circulation without a proportionate inicrease in the volume of consumer
goods available for purchase. On tbe basis

of this theory our policy wjth respect to foreign
boans is bound to have an inflationary effect.
Canada has loaned to England one and a
quarter billion dollars, and to other countries
$750,000,000. While there is no binding agreement that the money so lent will be expended
in Canada, we are told that ail of these monies
are to be spent in the dominion. The result,
therefore, will be that purchasing power in
Canada will he increased bv twvo billion dollars
and the goods produced by that expenditure
wvill be drained off by foreign countries. But
no one lias ever condumned the boaning policy
on the ground that it was inflationary.
The United States government agreed to
an increase of 18ý cents per hour to steel
workers. This raised the price of steel in
Canada by approximately $5 a ton. On the
basis of our Canadiari capacity of three million
tons a year, the steel operators would receive
an increase in value of approximately $15,000,000 annually. That move was neyer condemned as being inflationary. It is estimated
that an increase to the workers of 151 cents
per hour would cost the Steel Company
approximately five and a hall million dollars,
and an increase of 10 cents an hour would
eost $3,600.000. The difference therefore between an increase of 10 cents an hour, whieh
the government says is aIl right, and 15 cents
an hour which is condemned as inflationary,
is $1,800,000 a year.
1 believe, therefore, that if the mien who
now carry on a tremendous part of the operatiens of the government of this country, and
who exercise individual power and authority,
tell us that $1,800,000 a year is goiog to,
destroy our price structure, it is time the
rights of the Canadian people were secured
in a constitution. Quite apart from five cents
an hour being only a portion of the increase
in the price of steel already granted by the
government. and in view of ail the other inflationary policies that have been put into effeet,
the suggestion that such an increase to the
steel workers or to the workers of Canada
generally would be inflationary is obviously
not only ridiculous but utterly absurd.
Now 1 want to say just a word as to the
Senate's responsibilities. 1 think the time for
the exercise of the Senate's full responsibilitics is right now. In the light of what lias
happened at dominion-provincial conferences,
1 do flot sec how the federal and provincial
authorities can get together without the
assistance of an organization such as the
Senate. In my opinion this chamber can
propcrly and rightfully, in the exercise of its
powers and duties, intervene and work with
the national government on the one hand, and
the provincial governments on the other, and
thus bring about a situation that would guaran-

JUDGES BIIL
SECOND

READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 250, an Act respectiog
thte Judgas of Dominion and iProvincial courts.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable members, 1 have sskad tite honourahla sanator from
Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bencit) to handle titis bill.
Hon. J. J. BENCH moved tite second reading of the hill.
Ha said: Honourable senators, te only
new principle involved in titis bill is a proposaI Vo increase judicial salaries hy one-third,
and consaquently Vo increase retiring allowances in te sama proportion. The bill otiterwise may ha descrihed as a revision and consolidation of te Judgas Act and its amendments as titay now appear in our statutes.
There are many details of improvement in
language and of general administration whicit

no doubt will be discussed in comrnittee,
should itonourable memýbers desire the bill to
he so referred.
With the exception of one increasa granted
to the Circuit Court judges of Montreal in
1923, there has been no increase in judicial
incomes since 1920. As a resuit of legisiation
passed in 1920 the scale of judicial salaries
across te country was increa.sed, so that at
the present time the salaries applicable to te
several judicial positions are as f ollows: In
the Supreme Court of Canada, whicit is of
course our senior judicial body, te Chief
Justice now receives a salary of $15,000. Thtis
bill proposes that the amount ha increased to
$20,000. The salaries of the six puisne judges,
each of whom now receives $12,000, are to be
increased to, $16,000. In the Exahequer Court
of Canada the President, as a resuit of the
legislatioo. passaif in 1920, receives a salary of
$10,000, and it is proposed hy this bill to
increase it to $13,333.33. The puisue judges,
who Dow receive salaries of $9,000, are to have
the amount increased by te bill to $12,000.
In the Superior Courts of the provinces the
Chiaf Justices now receive 310,000, which would
be inereased by titis measure to 313,333.33.
Thte puisne judges, who now receive salarius of
$9,000, would advance to $12,000. In the
County and District Courts witere the salaries
are at present, 35,000, the bill provides titat
titey be incraased to $6,666.66.
It might ha interesting to honourable members if 1 were to review te scale of judicial
salaries since confederation. 1 do noV propose Vo review thea in detail, and particularly
I would avoid discussing salaries titat have
obtained from time to time in tite provinces
with witicit I arn not familiar. In 1868 tite
trial judges in tite Supreme Court of Ontario
received salaries of $4,000. The citief judges
of tite courts of law and equity, as titey were
then established, were paid -M,000. In 1873
these salaries were increased hy $1,000 respectively, the citief judges then rcceiving $6,000
and tite trial jud-ges 35,000.
At that time, and indeed down until 1920,
judicial salaries were noV subjeet to income
tax. It seems Vo me titat quite a stroog argument could be made out for te relief of
judges from income tax. 1 needt noV discuss
tite reasoos today, because after ahl that is
not strictly relevant to tite terms of tite bill.
Today a trial judge of the Supreme Court of
Ontario is paid a salary of 39,000, upon witich,
if ha is married and wit-hout dependents. ite
is required to pay an income tax of $2,723.28.

SENATE
I do flot know the family cireumostances cf
ail the judges. but it would appear that for
taxation purpo-es most of themn wotîld Le

The provincial gevernment of Ontario pays
judges cf tLe Supienie Court an additional
$1,000 a ' cear. tlîus increasing the amount, e

$3,160.08, se that those judges would Lave
Ieft today a net of $6.839,92.
I have flot been able te get an entirelv
satisfa ctory cemparison between teday's coaIt
of living and that ef 1873, when the salary of
a trial judge Ivas $5.000. I are infermed,
theugh, that the index ef wholesale priccs publisbed Lv the Dominion Bureau of Statisties
sbhows-taking 1926 at l 0 0--tLat in 1875 the
rost of living stood at 63.5, and in 1945 at
104. Se honeurable senaters will observe that
while the ceet ef living generally bas inereased
by more than twe-thirds, a Supreme Court
trial judge in the province cf Ontario now is
loft with a net salary in the sumn ef $6.839.92
on which te live as cempared te the $5.000
salary ef 1873. l'he judge ef teoday is even
worse off as cempared with the judge cf 1920,
fer at, that time the salary wvas 87,000, entirely
froc ef tax. I venture te suggest that ne ether
empleyab)]e persen in this country teday is

the prices cf individual items makes even
more imnpccssive the inadeqitacy, if I May se

dition that now appears to be more or less
chaotic. In saying that, however, I should not
like it to be assumed that I am in sympathy
with the Gordon report. Frankly, I do not
think very much of it. I do not know where
it was "cooked up"-I have my suspicionsbut anyway I would regard it as being "halfbaked".
With leave of the house I wish to take this
opportunity to point out one feature of that
report which ought to be of special interest to
honourable members. The commission presumes to make a recommendation as to the
salary of the Clerk of this honourable house,
and proposes that there should be a differential
between his salary and that of the Clerk of the
other house. I should like to say now that if
any legislation based upon that repcrt is
introduced to effect a discrimination of that
kind-not so much between the officials of the
two houses, but between the two houses ihemselves-I shall certainly oppose it most
vigorously.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: The report also makes
recommendations regarding increases to other
public servants. It suggests, for instance, a
salary of S17,500 for the Deputy Minister of
Finance. It seems to me that if that official
is to be adequately paid lie ouglit to reccive
more than that for doing the job which is
required of him in looking after the financial
welfare of this country. The report also suggests the munificent increase of $2,000 in the
salary of the Deputy Minister of National
Revenue for Taxation-a man who is charged
with the responsibility of collecting one and a
half billion dollars of our annual revenue.
Honourable members will recall that our
Special Committee on Taxation recommended
that his salary should be materially increased.
To suggest an increase from $10,000 to $12,000
is in my opinion both miserly and ill-advised.
Perhaps I may be permitted to make one
other observation in that connection, since it
more directly concerns this house and the
administration of its affairs. We have as one
of our officials a Law Clerk and Parliamentary
Counsel. I venture to suggest, without fear
of contradiction, that that gentleman is one
of the outstanding lawyers in the public service of this country.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I will not mention the
amount of his salary, but I do suggest that
it is grossly inadequate.
Some Hon. MEMBERS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Not only is he doing
the job of Law Clerk and Parliamentary

683

Counsel, but he is also serving the government
in other capacities. For instance, be is editor
of the wartime orders and regulations that are
published from week to week; he is a member
of the Advisory Committee of the Salaries
Control Board; he is also a member of the
Special Depreciation Board. He may have
other duties, but those are the jobs of which
I have personal knowledge. I would respectfully suggest that our Committee on Internal
Economy and Contingent Accounts, when it
convenes next session, should give some consideration to making an upward adjustment
in this particular official's salary.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: It is drawn to my attention by the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) that our Law Clerk was
not mentioned in the Gordon report. However, I am not sure that the commission had
power to make a recommendation regarding
any of the parliamentary officers. Actually, I
was a little surprised that the Gordon Commission presumed to make any recommendation regarding the clerks of the two houses.
It would seem to me that the salaries payable
to those officers should be left wholly to the
jurisdiction of parliament itself.
Some hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: I will net tire the bouse
with any further observations, beyond saying
that it seems to me we lack courage in the
matter of giving proper remuneration to the
persons who, as civil servants, are serving the
public interest. We in Canada seem to be
afraid of some criticism from the left, and
there was in fact some opposition to this very
bill from the socialist group in the other house.
I believe we should acquire a little more
courage in such matters; we ought to put
salaries up to a level which will attract to the
executive and judicial branches of the government the finest talent available.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I submit to honourable
senators that the salary increase proposed by
this bill is long overdue, and I respectfully
recommend second reading. If the bill receives
second readýing it can be referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. JAMES P. MeINTYRE: Honourable
senators, I agree in principle with the bill,
but I do not think it goes far enough. We
have in Canada ainother class of honourable
gentlemen who are serving the different provinces and whose salaries are inadequate. I
refer to the Lieutenant-Governors. In six of

684

SENATE

the provinces these gentlemen receive salaries
of $9,000; two provinces each pay $10,000;
and one province pays $7,000.
We have in ail the provinces a total of 272
judges, exclusiv e of the Chief Justice of Canada
and the~ District Judges in Admiralty. The
salaries of these 272 .iudgcs at the present rate
total 81,895.000. The expenses incurred by the
judges in tbe provinces arnouet te $156,800.
M'len the salary increase cf one-third is added
te present figures, the federal treasury wviil be
required te pav eut $2,685,000. \Ve hiave oeiy
nine liettna,ýnt-Go\-eino-,, et a total cost te
tise dominion tree.urv of only $81,000. The
eost of inrluding these gentlemen in the salary
iecrease woulîl be S27,000, esaking the total
cost of their s.erx iees a little more than 8100,000.
I suîbmsit that the Lieutenant-Governers cf
the provinces should benefit ýby the one-third
increase ie salaries. They each have te attend
many fîînetiens in various parts of thieir province, and tbey are not ailowed any travelling
expenses. Further-more, ýthey axre frequently
caiied upon to, make donations to, programmes
cf vains kinds throughout the province.
I realize that the Senate cannot amend a
money bill, 'but I would ask the honourable
leader cf the bouse te suggest te tise geverement tise desirability of an increase, cf onethird in the salaries cf the LieutenantGovernors.
Hon. JOHN T. H'AIG: I{enourable senators,
I do net think it wortis while sending- Ibis bill
te comnmittee, unicas seme amendment is contemplated, because it simpiy deals with judges'
salaries.
While listening- te the remarks cf my lisoncurable friend from Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bencîs)
it occurred te me that mcst cf bis address was

bill. I do net propose te follcw bim in that

the opposite aide of tise argument biere. If

Some Hon. SENATOIIS: Huer, bear.
Hon. Mn. HAIG: That is fondamental;
etberwise we xviii bave demands from everybody in the country. 1 de net want te pretend
that I cm a socialist-

AUGUST 21, 1946
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: It would not do you
any good.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: -and I do not intend to
lead a socialist party; but I am disturbedand I say it with all kindness-because we ask
our old people in this country to live on $30
a month. The general old age pension at
present is, I believe, only $25 a month, but
some provinces supplement it with an additional $5. I know that is done in our province.
As to the cost of living, $20 a month was
worth more twenty years ago than $30 is now,
in terms of what money will buy.
Honestly, I am disturbed. It is things of
this kind that are responsible for our having
socialists in this country. Make no mistake
about that. I voted last year for an increase
of $2,000 in the sessional indemnity of members of parliament. I do not think the indemnity is high enough yet, considering that the
men and women who come here to the Senate
and the House of Commons have to spend
practically all their time on parliamentary
work. It is all right to say that our sessions
last only about six months, but during the
other six months we are kept busy at the
same kind of work practically all the time. No
business man can afford to be a member of
parliament unless his business is of such a
kind that it requires fron him only a general
oversight, because practically his whole time
throughout the year is taken up by official
duties of one kind and another.
I am willing to vote for an increase in the
salaries of judges, but I want the government to realize that our taxes must be eut
down or there will be demands for increases
all along the line. I will vote also for an
expenditure to reward old age pensioners. I
know it can be argued, that men and women
should not be on old age pensions, that it is
their own fault if they need them. All that
may be true; yet if we lose respect and love
for our fathers and mothers, or the fathers
and mothers of other people, this country will
have got to a pretty sad state of affairs.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Is that obiter dictum
too?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: No. I am. dealing with
the question of judges' salaries, and the remarks I have just been making arise out of
what my honourable friend from Lincoln
(Hon. Mr. Bench) suggested was said by
socialists in another place. I am not here to
defend socialists, but on the other hand I
am not here to criticize them when they have
got a real ground for complaint. The only way
of protecting the position that I hold in the
economy of Canada is to say what I know
should be done. That is the principle on

685

which I am acting. I arm not saying that I
adopt the socialist policy, but I do say that
when a socialist is right I am going to get
behind him and support him.
I repeat that I am in favour of an increase
in the salaries of judges. I do not have very
much to do with judges now, but it would
not make a bit of difference to my attitude
if I did. In fact, if it was within my power
ta vote the increase, and I did so, our judges
in Manitoba would probably lean over backwards ta give judgment against me the next
time I appeared before them. There is no
doubt that judges are not paid as well as
they were some years ago, and that many
are having quite a struggle to carry on.
Some men say to me, "Why do judges need
more money?" Well, I venture to say that if
we had a vote by secret ballot every lawyer
in this and the other bouse would vote for the
bill, for one reason if for no other. The abler,
the more intelligent, the better the men we
get on the Bench, the better the administration
of law In this country. That is the fundamental reason for giving judges an increase
in salary, and I am for it. I do not want anybody ta think that I am for it just because
I happen to be a lawyer and judges were
formerly lawyers. Not at all. My reasons are
as I have stated. And I say again that we
should admit to the public that unless taxation is eut down salaries and wages will have
to be increased through the whole piece.
I do not think it is necessary to have this
bill sent ta committee. Perhaps it might go to
the committee of the whole, where everybody
would have a chance to discuss it.

this line is estimated to bu $4,125,000, whici
figure is arrived at by calculating at the rate
of S75,000 per mile.
The railway has made a careful study of the
natural resources of the area to be tapped,
the cost of constructing the line, and the
traffic likely to be derived from the projected
line. It has concluded that on all three counts
the construction of the line will be profitable.
From the point of view of the natural
resources in the area to be served by the
railway, aerial survey lias disclosed great possibilities for the development of agriculture
and forest products. Some 275,000 acres of
arable land in the clay belt area liave been
discovered, lying mainly in the valley of the
Bell River. It is estimated that within ten
years this land could support an agricultural
population of 15,000 peuople. In the area served
by the proposed line there are some 940 square
mile., of timber. containing au estimated
6.200,000 cords cf pulpwood.
Seven hundred square miles of tiis timber
bave been granted b' the Quebec government to the Canada Paper Company, in view
of the fact tliat the timber resources of the
Ea-ten Townhip
liave becorme prctically
exiausted. inless the company is able to
obtain timber elsewhere, iere is a strong
possibility of its mills at Windsor Mills and
elsewhere having to close down. Of the 6,200.000 cords of pulpwood within economic reach
of the line, 4,480,000 cords lie within the grant
made to the company.
The traffic possibilities of the area to bu
served by the projected line will be mainly
confined to the transportation of pulpwood
during the carly years of operation, until the
agricultural portions are colonized. In order
to ensure sufficient traffic to meet operating
expenses and the interest on the cost of construction in the first six years, the Canada
Paper Company bas given a guarantee to the
Canadian National Railways, such guarantee
covering an aggregate traffic of 330,000 cords
of pulpwood to be taken out of the area at the
rate of 40,000 cords for the first year and
45,000 cords for succeeding years. In the event
that the pulpwood shipped from the area is
under 330,000 cords in six years, the Canada
Paper Company will pay the Canadian
National Railways $3 per cord on any deficiency between the actual amount transported
and the 330,000 cords. The guarantee extends
only to the 43-7 miles of line from Barraute
to a point at the southeast extremity of the
township of Laas. The estimated cost of this
lon. MIr. ROBERTSON.

43-7 miles is $3,300,000. During the first six
years of operation the gross operating revenue
on this section of the line is estimated to be
$3,007,000. Deducting out of pocket expenses
of $2,316,000 and six years' interest on capital,
namely $594,000, the estimated surplus at the
end of the six-year guarantee period is $97,000.
At the present time the line is projected
only to the southeast corner of Laas township,
a distance of 43-7 miles. The bill also seeks
authority for an additional 11-3 miles in order
to bring it to Kiask Falls, although it is not
-the intention of the railway to construct this
section at present. It is hoped that future
development of the timber resources of the
area will make possible the location of a pulp
mill at Kiask Falls, and it is for this reason
that authority is being sought from parliament
to build the line.
To sum up, this railway is essentially an
industrial spur, the costs of which in the early
years of operation are guaranteed. The line
rins tiirougli an agriculitral, timber, and
mineral irea. It is being built with second-hand
material; no new material or rolling stock
will be required in its construction.
I am also advised that the Minister stated
that about 75,000 people are nlready living in
the broad area served by the lne, and that
there is no possibility of the wood being stripped, as the company plans to cut only two
per cent per year, or a maximum of 100,000
cords.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: I notice your figures
refer to estimated interest on capital. The
railroad is ours, the natural resources are ours,
so why pay interest to the bank or any other
institution? Why not issue the money.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend may devise a system for the purpose, but
up to the presen!t moment nothing of the sort
lias been adopted in this country, and I fancy
there is considerable opposition to any attempt
to put it into effect.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved that the
bill be referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Why not refer it to
the Railway Committee? The Banking and
Commerce Committee is receiving many bills,
but the Railway Committee bas not had any
work to do.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: For the simple
reason, as I have already stated, that it would
facilitate the business of the Senate if at this

The motion wa.s agreed to.
INCOME WAR TAX BILL
SECOND

READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 368, an Act to amend
the Income War Tax Act.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have asked
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. lIayden) to handie this bill.
Hon. SALTER A. HAYDEN moved the
second reading of the bill.
Hie said: Honourable senators, the changes
which were made in this bill during its progress throughi the Commons were few in
nurober. I do not propose to go through the
I
%-arions amending sections in detail.
shahl simply point out some of what I regard
as the more important changes which this bill
seeks to effect.
In the Senate eomm-ittee on taxation there
was considerab1e discussion on the question
of assei;sments and interest, and the committee deait with it in their report. As you
know, sometimes the Income Tax Department bas made an assessment increasing the
tax payable three or four years after the taxpayer filed his return, and when it did this
interes.t was pihed on as a penalty froiti the date
of filing the return. By section 14 of the bill,
section 54 of the act is amended by the addition of a new sub-section providing that no
interest shahl be chargeable for a period beginning twenty months after the day fixed for
filing the return and ending one month from
the day of mailing the notice of assessment.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: This amendment
applies in respect of unpaid taxes for the
taxation year 1945 and subsequent year..
A second item which I tbink is of interest
io senators is the amendment which provide's
that the expenee allowance to mesnbers of
provincial legisiatures shahl, within certain
limnita, be an item of expense, and therefore
deductible from mecome.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Wbhat about the
Senate?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I shahl mention that
in a moment. The proposed amendment peSmits a member of any provincial legisiature to
deduct any expense ahlowance which may be
paid to him by the hegishature, with this limitation-that 'he may deduct that expense allowance up to, one.half of bis remuneration as a
provincial member.
63268-45

687

0f course, you have now the rather anomalous situation, that members of the flouse of
Commons, other than ministers and the leader
of the officiai opposition, have a non-taxable
expense allowance of $2,000; and if this section is accepted, members of ail the provincial
legishatures, other than members of the
Legisiative Council of Quebec, will also, be
entitled to an expense ahiowance. within the
limitation stated; 'but the members of the
Legisiative Counciýl of Quebec and members
of the Senate wihl enjoy "splendid isolation",
they being the only ones serving the public
in the hegislative field, who are permitted to
pay their own expenses and income tax on themn
as welh.
HUon. MT. HO'WARD: Wonderfull
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Another amendment
is of interest to authors of literary, d.ramatic,
musical or artistic works. An author nay have
spent two or ithree years in writing a book or
developing an artistie work, yet the consideration for hia copyright bas been regarded a.s
income for the year in which it wae received.
By suibsection 10 .of section 2 he wihl be aUlowed
to make an election. For instance, if it took
him twenty-four monýths to produce his work
he may ehect to treat haîf of the consideration
as income of the taxation year ini which it waa
received, and to include the other haîf in bis
income for the preceding year. If he spent
three years on bis work he may trea!t onethird oniy of the consideration as income of
the taxation year in which he received it, and,
divide the other two-thirds between each of the
two preceding taxation years.
Although there is no particuhar reference
to it in the report, our committee on taxation
heard representationa with respect to the
fixing of something other than an annuai
basis for determýining the taxable income of
farmera and fishermen. By the amendment in
section 8 an attempt is being made to reach
what might be ealled a cumulative basia for
determining their taxable ineome. By this
amendment it is provided that a farmer or a
fishermen who has ahready filed bis return as
sucb for the two preceding years, may when filing bis return for the current year caicuhate
what his tax would have been on the basis of
bis average income for the three years; then he

may deduct the tax paid in the preceding two
years, and what is lef t represents bis ýtax for
the current year. As honourable members
are aware, the incomne of farmera and fishermen
may fluctuate viohenthy from year to year.

This is an attempt to iron out the his and
valheys and to get a litthe smoother basis for
determination of their taxable income.

Part VIIIA is new and providee machinery
f or appeal from assessments. Section 69A,

BEVISfl IMMTON

688

SENATE

and particularly sections 69B and 690, provide
for the setting up of what is called an Income
Tax Appeal Board.
The Income Tax Appeal Board will be a
sourt of record, with power to hear appeals
fron assessmsent and to determine questions of
law and fact. If a taxpayer is dissatisfied
with his assessment, le shall serve a notice
of objection on the minister within the time
limirt provided. The minister then bas power
to reconsider, vacate or confirm the assessment. If the sminister dors not recognize the
validity of the objection made, the taxpayer
may go to the Income Tax Appeal Board,
foilowing the procedsire outlined in the bill and
in the schedulc. The appeal board msay hear
ces at the instance of tie taxpayer or the
mssay then msake one of tie
depîartmes -It
following decisions: dismiss the appeal, msake a
proper assessiient, or xacate tse assessrnent and
refer the whole matter back to the minister.
There is a prov-ision whereby tie miinister or
the taxpayer may app--ar before the board by
counsel. If both parties consent, the board
may consider written submissions; and if the
taxpayer insists, the hearing must be held in
camera. There is also the important provision
that the decisions of the board shall be
publised. The onlv fee payable by the taxpayer in going to the board is $15. The board
ias no power to award costs to eitier of the
parties.
The board is con-stituted under the provisions
of section 69B, and by virtue of the third
schedule to the bill a set oct at pages 31 to
35. The Governor in Council shall make
appointments to the board, whici shall consist of a chairman and two assistant chairmen.
The qualification for appointment is that
the appointee shall be either a judge of a
superior court of Canada or of a province
of Canada, or a barrister or advocate of at
least ten years' practice in any province. The
board shall consist of not less than six members, and not more than twelve. The age
limit for appointment is sixty-five, and the
members are appointed for ten years. A
member can he removed only for cause upon
address of both houses of parliament. The
calarv the chairman shall be $12,000 a year,
of
and of the two assiStant chairmen 810.000 eaci.
Every member shall he allowed his travelling
expenses.
Hon. 'Mr. DAVIES: Will ie still continue
to be paid as a judge?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If a judge is
appointed, he must resign that office within
a period of three months or forfeit his
appointment to the board.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN.

The quorum is to consist of the chairman,
or an assistant chairian, and half the number
of the other members of the board. For the
purpose of facilitating appeals, there is provision for appointing a hearing officer, who
need not necessarily be a member of the
board. le may iear a case or class of cases,
and will report to the board, which may act

the chairman can designate several members
of the board to conduet a hearing and make

Appeal Board lias all the powers of a court
of record, and provision is made for a registrar
and staff so that it will function as a regular
court. There is a right of appeal from this board
to the Exclequer Court of Canada, either at
the instigation of the minister or a taxpayer.

Prov-ision is made also for the setting up of
hvory Board. This is dealt
as Incone Tax
with at pages 27 and 28 of the bill and in the
fifth sihedusle. The authority of this board is
to review the exercise by the minister of
the varioss discretions in the act. Opposite
page 27 of the bill, in fine prinlt, is an extract
froi the Incomse War Tax Act covering the
various discretions which form tie subject
msatter this board mav dcal witi unider ssetion
69E. I shall not read the list because honourable senators who were nsembers of the
Special Committee on Incosme Tax are famssiliar
with the extent and scope of tliese discretions.
The procedire of the advisory board is as
foiows: Wien the taxpayer is notified of the
inister in the exercise of a
decision of the
discretion lue may, if not satisfied withs the
ruling, express his dissatisfaction, and if tie
sinister does not sec fit to ciange the ruling
lie taxpaiyer eau then requsire tiat the iatter
be referred to the advisory board for hearing,
consideration and advice. The bill does not
say specifically that on the learing of the
application the b-ard shall saxe the power to
do thus and so; it merely provides that the
mnattsr be referred for ecaring, consideration
and advice.
Section 69E (5) reads as follows:
Where an objectioni has been referred to the
board, the minister sialil again reconsider his
decision after receivinsg the report and advice
cf the Incone Tax Advisory Board with reference to the objection.
There is no provision by which the minister is
forced to accept the decision of the advisory
board. The board, as the name implies, is an

AUGUST 21, 1946

advisory board for the purpose of roviewing
the oxercise of discretion by tbe minister and
making a recommendation to him. The minister may then reconsider bis decision, or hoe
sony accept tbe ad'vice of the board and act
upon it.
It bas been stated that the question of
exorcise of discretion by the minister is a
matter of government policy, and that the
ministor should assume the responsibility for
it and ho answerable in parliament for the
propor exercise of thsst discretion.' That is
wby there is no0 delegation of authority to
an independent board to exorcise discre.tion.
The ministor is the persan responsiblo, and hie
sbould dccl witb it. The statemoent by the
government with respect to this particular
board indicates that in dealing with matters
of depreciation, depletion and salary the
exorcise of discretion involves the question of
governmeflt policy.
Wbile I cm giving an explanation of the
bill, and therefore cttempting to givo an impartial exposition of what it, purports to do.
I go no further tban tbat. I must, however,
point eut mv own views withi respect to this
exorcise of discretion. 1 amn committed beyond
recall to do so becauso when the Special Cemmittee on Income Tax was dealing with the
rocommendation that there should be a board
beyond and abovo the control of the minister
to hear appecîs from assessments, even those
involving the exercise of discretion, the remarks 1 mcdo related to this very question. I
supported the rocommendations of the Sonate
committee at the time, and suggestcd that
because of the great number of discretionary
powers, involving depreciction and similar
matters, which eut into public business and
commercial life of the people, the board wou-ld
requiro commercial exporionce as a guide in
detormining whcat should ho nllowed. I arn
committed in my own viows as to the type and
jurisdiction of the board, and 1 bave pointed
out to honourable members the extent to which
the bill provides for reviow of diseretions
exercisod by the minister, however I will add
somothing that bas been said by the minister
himself. If a board sucb as the one suggosted
advises the ministor tbat hoe was wrong in bis
exorcise of discretion in relation to a problema
of depletion or depreciation allowance, hoe
would ho very bold indeed to fly into the face
of such advice and risk publie criticism, even
in the other place, for adopting sucb a course
of action.

The constitution is
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
outlined in the fifth schedule, at page 37 of the
bill. The board is made up of a chairman
plus at least two a'nd flot more than six other
members. The age limit of the members is
sixty-five years. The chairman and the two
assistant chairmen need flot ho judgos, or have
licd a definito period of legal experience. They
rnay bo romoved for cause at any time by tho
Governor in Council. The members of the
appeal board also may be removed for cause,
but only on a joint address of both housos of
parliameut. The salaries of tlic advisory board
are flot set out in the act, but are to ho
detormined by the Governor in Council. 1
migbt also say that the quorum is the chairman or a member designated by himn and flot
less than one half the other members of the

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Thore is no0 sta tement as to the qualifications requirod, oxce.pt
that the mombers must be undor 65 whon appointed, and that their appointment, is for
toni years.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: There is nothing in the
bill to provent the advisory board being ceinposed of mombers chosen from the staff of the
Dcpartmnent of National Revenue?
Hon. Mr. HAYD EN: The bill contains n
provision against ba-ving the board made up
entirely of departmental offleers. The framework of this part of the bull indicates that
it is to bo a departmontal board, 1 have,

690

SENATE

There may be some question as to what
happens to Par-t VIII of the act, which has
to do with appeals and procedure. That is
left there. It provides for an appeal from
an assessnent to the minister, and from the
minister to the Exchequer Court. That procedure will net be fol'lowed in respect of
assessments for -taxation periods after December 31, 1945. Section 69F states that the new
procedure applies only to assessments of income
of the 1946 and subsequent taxation years.
I do not think there is anything else I
can say with regard to the advisory board.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Will the members of the
board le able to carry on any other duties?
If departmental officials are appointed to the
board, will they be able to carry on in their
departmental capacities, or will they have te
give all their time to the board?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The fifth schedule,
which deals with the constitution of the advisory board, contains no prohibition against
employment of the members on other work.
It is net stated that membership on the
board is a full-time job.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: May I ask my honourable friend what are the functions and powers
of the appeal board as distinct from those
of the advisory board.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: As I explained earlier,
the appeal board will hear appeals by taxpayers who are dissatisfied with their assessmients. Therefore, ilie funiction of the appeal
board will be to deal with law and fact in
relation to assessments.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR:

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Its judgment will
be final unless within a certain time an
appeal is made to the Exchequer Court. An
appeal may Le made by either the minister
or the taxpayer.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Could an appeal be made
to the appeal board from an exercise of
ministerial discretion?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No, net according to
the bill as drawn.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: If an appeal te the
appeal board arose out of the exercise of a
discretionary power, would the board not
have any power te hear it?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: No. In that regard
the appeal board would Le in the same position as the Exchequer Court is now, under
Part VIII of the present act. At present,
if a taxpayer is dissatisfied with his assessHon. Mr. IIAYDEN.

ment le may appeal to the minister, who
will affirm or amend the assessment. If the
taxpayer is still dissatisfied Le forwards to
the minister a notice of dissatisfaction, and
then the matter is appealed to the Exchequer
Court. Where the only point involved in the
appeal is an exercise of ministerial discretion,
and the evidence shows that the minister
has exercised a discretionary power given to
him by the act, the Exchequer Court will
refuse to interfere with the minister's decision.
The appeal board, as I say, would Le in the
same position.
Its jurisdiction would be
confined to questions of law and fact.
I will now pass to another section, which
deals with the taxation of mines. The section
refdects the effect of the recent restoration of
our currency te dollar parity with United
States currency. The bill as originally introduced in another place provided that from the
Lst of January, 1947, new gold mines would
during the first three years of their operation
be subject to 50 per cent of the going rate
of income tax. That was the only concession
to gold mines, notwithstanding the recommendations by the special committee of the
Senate on metalliferous mines. After our
currency was brought to parity with that of
flt United States the bill was amended, and
h
honourable senators will sec it now provides
that new gold mines are entitled to income
tax exemption for a period of three years from
the date of their going into production, which
date will be certified to by the minister. In
other words. section 89 of the act, whicli was
made inoperative after the end of 1942, is put
back into effect. In addition, there is an allowance for expenses in connection with prospecting and exploring. That also was in the act
Lefore, but the rate is now different. Under
this bill the taxpayer will Le entitled to deduet
20 per cent of such expenses from the aggregate of his income taxes and excess profits
taxes. if any. In 1946 the allowable dedliction
was twentv-six and two-thirds per cent. I an
not in a position to say why the change was

made.
If honourable members are interested I
will refer to another concession whicb Las
been made to the gold mining industry because
of the restoration of our currency to dollar
parity with the United States currency and the
consequent loss of $3.50 per ounce on all the
gold we sell. The mines are required to ship
ticir gold to the mint at Ottawa for refining,
and the charge made by the mint for this
service has been 35 cents an ounce. That
covered a variety of things and was considerably in

excess

of actual

cost.

One

of

the

recommendations of the Senate committee was
that the mint should bill the mines with only

AUGUST 21, 1946

the actual cost of these services, and the
charge has now been reduced to 20 cents an
ounce.
The Senate committee also recommended
that the depletion allowance for the exhaustion
of a mine should be increased from the present
rate of thirty-three and one-third per cent of
its operating profit to 50 per cent. The government as a matter of policy bas so far refused to
adopt that recommendation, but there is this
change: in future the operators of marginal
properties will be entitled to a depletion allowance of either thirty-three and one-third per
cent of their operating profit or two dollars per
ounce of gold produced during the year, whichever amount is the greater.
The bill also contains some changes with
respect to the taxation of co-operatives and
mutual insurance companies. As honourable
senators know, a mutual insurance company
has no shareholders, but is owned by its

has been exempt from income tax, provided
that savings out of its premiums accrued to
the benefit of the policyholders and were
used to reduce the cost of insurance. As
to stock insurance companies operating in the
life field, the portion of their income set aside
for shareholders has been taxable, but the
portion set aside for policyholders has been
exempt. A couple of years ago a royal commission was appointed, under the chairmanship
of Mr. Justice Errol MeDougall of Montreal,
to inquire into the taxation of co-operatives
and mutual insuirance companies. A report was
made, and this bill implements its main
One of the proposed
recommendations.
amendments will subject mutual insurance
companies, other than life, to income tax
unless their premium income is derived
exclusively from insurance on church propertics, charitable institutions and similar risks.
There is no difficulty in following the provisions so far as the mutual companies are
concerned. :Mutual companies now pay income tax on their net income, less deduction
of dividends paid to policyholders. In order
to avoid discrimination, a similar provision is
now made for stock fire and casualty insurance
companies; if they choose, to return some
portion of their underwriting gain to their
policyholders rather than pay it to their
shareholders, to that extent it may be deducted
from what otherwise would be their taxable
income.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Is it not a fact that the
'mutual life insurance companies which also
do a casualty or health and accident business
are not subject to income tax on their invest-

ment income, whereas mutual fire and casualty
companies are subject to income tax on everything earned, including investment income?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: My friend raises a
question which involves a lot of explanation.
I will try to deal with it very briefly. Heretofore foreign stock fire and casualty insurance
companies operating in Canada paid no income tax upon their investment income. As
I stated in explaining another bill the other
day, that was the result of an arrangement or
an informal convention which, I understand,
goes back to the introduction of the business
profits tax. There were difficulties in arriving
at how much of the investment income of a
foreign company could be related to its operations in Canada. So a "saw-off" was arranged;
the foreign company agreed to pay income
tax on its gross profits; that is, it made no
deduction for any portion of the head office
expenses attributable to its operations in
Canada, nor for loss of profits on the reinsurance outside of Canada of risks taken in
Canada. Apparently the situation was satisfactory until this change took place in the
law. But now Canadian mutual insurance
companies wi'll be hit by the change because,
earning their investment income as well as
their profits from operations in Canada only,
there is no way in which they can get the
benefit of any sueh convention, formal or
informal as it may be. Now you will have
mutual insurance companies in the fire and
casualty field paying income .tax on all their
premium income less deductions for dividends paid back and on their investment income; and, if this convention holds, you will
have foreign stock fire and casualty insurance
companies and foreign mutual companies not
paying income tax on their investment income.
Whether the tax from these sources which Canada might gain under the "saw-off" would be
offset by additional head office expenses and
losses on reinsurance abroad, I am not in a
position to say. There are the facts; the
problem remains.
Hon. Mr. EULER: My honourable friend
spoke of a convention, presumably between
the government and these foreign insurance
companies. Has he absolute knowledge that
there is such a convention in existence, whether
it is a formal document, and when it was
arranged? I am informed that nobody can
find any such document at all.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I called it an informal
convention. I do not know whether there is
anything in writing. I do know that it started

SENATE
at thle iniception of our business profits tax
and was conifirmed again in 1931 or 1932. Apparently there was sone understanding or
arrangementHon. Mr. EULER: I know.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: -as
the result of
which the foreign stock insurance companies
operating in the fire and casualty field paid
income tax on their gross profits in Canada
and no tax upon their investment income

The existence of an agreement and
the difficulty of finding itHon. Mr. EULER: There is none.
Ion. Mr. HAYDEN: Very well. Coming
back to co-operatives, I miglit point out that
the commission which was set up to inquire
into the whole question of co-operatives was
quite impartial. It consisted of one member
named by the Co-operative Union of Canada,
another nominated by the Canadian Chamber
of Commerce, two economists of established
reputation, and the chairman, Mr. Justice
McDougall.
The commission recommended
that the exemptions to mtual insurance companies and to co-operativ es should be removed
on the principle that as a matter of public
policy no class of enterprise should be given
exemption friom incoine ax, and tîat in any,
cvent the sections of the Income War Tax Act
relating to co-operatives were indefinite in
forin and uncertain in their implications.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: Was that a unanimous
report?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes, it was. Something had to be donc about the co-operative
provisions in any event, because for years
the Income Tax Department had proceeded
on the basis that co-operatives were not subject to income tax, and then in 1942 or 1943
the law officers of the Crown gave an opinion
that they were subject to income tax. So
the government bas accepted the recommendations of the commission with respect to cooperatives as well as mutual insurance companies, and this bill provides for their taxation
on the basis of treating the taxable income of a
co-operative in the same way as that of any
other company. This means that, charging
expenses against income, you arrive at a net
figure, fron which you deduct patronage dividends paid to members and even to nonmembers. Then what is left is subject to
income tax. It might be said that if a
co-operative paid out all its profit by way of
patronage dividends it could evxade incone

tax. But the government takes the position
that some portion of the earnings which
goes into the operation of the business must
be treated as capital, so the bill provides that
any co-operative qualifying itself for the payment of patronage dividends may not pay
out the whole of its earnings in this form;
and an amount calculated at three per cent
on the capital employed in the business, as
determined under the provisions of the Excess
Profits Tax Act, is treated as taxable income.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: A co-operative might

would be no profit and therefore no patronage
dividends.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Then there would be
no income tax.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY:

Is the tax

Hon. Mr. IIYDEN: No, its application
starts only in 1946. Wlere you have a new
co-operative coming into being on the lst of
January, 1947-following the procedure for
the incorporation of co-operatives-it is entitled to exemption fron income tax for a
period of tlhree years, on the theory that it
takes that length of time to get going, and
that co-operatives generallv make some contribution to the commercial, and social life
of some sections of the country and, therefore
have a conmtmunity value.
I should add that the rigbt to deduct patronage dividends is not granted exclusively to
co-operatives. Any company may pay patronage dividends if by its letters patent there is
provision for sucb dividends, or if by advertising it holds out a prospect that it will pay
them to its custoners or its shareholders or
meibers within the limitations provided in
the act. :In other words, the company has to
get into a proper uniform to be admitted into
the society of these co-operatives and other
companies whicb are entitled to deduct
patronage dividends from their earnsings for
incomne tax purposes.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Tbere is no restriction
on the amount of salaries paid to employees?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: The general principle
of law would apply. The Minister of National
Revenue can disallow any portion of a salary
or an expense which, in his opinion, is not
proper.
Hon. .Mr. ýMORAUD: Can a company pay
out patronage dividends in addition to the
regular dividends?

693

AUGUST 21, 1946
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If a company, cooperative or otherwise, does not put on that
uniform by holding out the prospect that it
will pay patronage dividends, it does not come
within the section.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: But a joint stock
company could pass a by-law that in future
the regular dividend would become a patronage dividend. Then it would be exempt from
taxation?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Only to this extent,
that the patronage dividend is payable to
customers.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: To shareholders?
Hon. Mr. EULER: To shareholders who are
customers.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes. The McDougall
Commission recommended that patronage
dividends be paid at the sane rate to
customers and members alike. The government did not entirely accept this recommendation. The bill provides that if, for instance,
you have a certain amount of trading profit
resulting from business done with non-members,
and a certain portion of trading profit resulting from business done with members, then
you cannot pay to members any part of the
trading profit resulting from your operations
with non-members without first paying income
tax on it.
iI realize that I have taken considerable time
with my explanation, but there are still one
or two matters I should like to call to the
attention of honourable senators; I shall then
have touched upon what might be regarded as
the high spots in this bill.
At page 18 there appears a section bearing
the marginal note "Deductions from tax". It
provides that a taxpayer other than a corporation may deduct from the tax that would
otherwise be payable, the amount of income
tax paid by him to the government of the
province in which lie lives or earns his income.
This provision anticipates the possible return
of personal income tax in the various provinces, and permits the deduction of the amount
paid to the province, or 5 per cent of the tax
otherwise payable, whichever is the less.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: It does not include the
amount which might be paid to a municipality
or city?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
vinces.

No, only to pro-

Section 7A on page 19 covers a situation that
in my experience has heretofore been covered
by departmental practice. It relates to a person who has been resident in Canada for part
of the year and leaves this country to become a
resident of another country, or a person who
has been a resident of another country and
comes to Canada for part of the year. A
basis has been established whereby the tax
payable bears the same relation to the whole
tax as the period during which he was a
resident bears to the whole year.
Provisions are made with respect to single
payments on retirement, loss of office and so
forth. A further interesting feature is exemption allowed to married persons. During the
war exemptions were allowed to married women who were working. Now a married person is entitled to the exemption of $1,500, but
the other party to the marriage may only
have an income up to $250 before the $1,500
starts to be reduced by whatever amounts, up
to $750, the spouse may receive. In other words,
a married man has an exemption of $1,500,
and if his wife earns $250 or less he retains
that exemption.
Hon. Mr. EULER: More complicated than
ever.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: If the wife has an
income of $350 then the husband's exemption
would be $1,400.
There are some further variations with
respect to exemptions for children and dependents. This requires a little study. There
is an exemption of $100 for each child, who
was or may be qualified under the Family
Allowance Act. The effect of this provision
is to force all parents to register their dependent children under the Family Allowance
Act. There is an exemption of $100 for each
child that may be registered, and $300 for every
other dependent not qualified to register under
the act. It more or less requires everyone to
register his children under the Family
Allowance Act in order to quaýlify for the
exemption.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: What is the age limit
for exemption under the Income Tax Act?
Hon. Mr. HAIG:
Hon. Mr. GOUIN:

Sixteen years.
This is no change in

Hon. Mr. GOUIN: There is no change in
the law.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: May I mention one
or two other features? It is obvious that
an attempt is being made by the government
to change the basis for the exercise of

694

SENATE

ministerial discretion. A number of amendments have been made to the Income Tax Act
whereby the words "in the discretion of the
minister" are deleted wherever they occur and
the discretion is placed with the Governor
in Council. I would refer honourable senators. to the paragraph on page 7 of the bill
dealing with depletion. The same provision
applies to depreciation.
Honourable senators, I have by no means
dealt with all the provisions of this bill, but I
think I have touched on the important items.
I have moved that the bill reccive second
reading, and I intend to ask that it be referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce
for consideration and the hearing of evidence.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators,
allow me to congratulate the gentleman who
has just taken his seat (Hon. Mr. Hayden).
I presume it was necessary for him to take
the time he did, but in doing so he has reduced
the time available to others. The honourable
gentleman has fairly stated the provisions of
the bill, I think, and I do not intend to go
into its details.
In my judgment this is the most important
piece of legislation that has come before us
this session, and this has been a very heavy
year as far as legislation is concerned. Income
tax in all its ramifications is the real problem
in our country today. I referred to this subject
earlier this afternoon and I will repeat my
remarks.
No greater contribution can be
made to our country by this house than to
make an exhaustive examination of this bill
and, if necessary, amend it in accordance with
our wishes.
The first criticism I offer is that the provisions of this bill become effective as of the
lst of January, 1947.
Because the budget
was brought down prior to the lst of July, 1946,
I think the bill should have become effective
on that date.
My second criticism is that the tax exemption of $750 for a single person is too low.
We talk about a higher standard of living.
The standard cannot be very high on an incorne of $750 a year. Reference has been
made to Australia, New Zealand and other
places where it is said that taxes are heavier
than in Canada. I always take those remarks
with a grain of salt for the reason that some
of these countries have only a municipal tax, a
provincial tax or a federal tax. We have all
three. To arrive at an accurate comparison one
would bave to compute all the taxes an individual in this country is required to pay. I
think $1,500 is too low an exemption for
married people, and I certainly object most
strenuously to the reduction of the exemption
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

on a wife's earned income from $650 to $250.
It means that married women are much more
dependent on their husbands for support. If
the wife takes a job, that is her business. It
is not for us to say that she shall not do so.
In my opinion that amendment should never
have been made.
The proposal regarding mining is in my
opinion not sufficient. I have no expert
knowledge of the mining industry, but it
would seem to have prospects of becoming the
greatest industry in Canada in the years to
come. For that reason I believe taxes on
mines should have been further reduced.
My next criticism of the bill concerns farmers
and fishermen. I believe that the three-year
period for the spreading of profits should have
been extended to five years. It must be
remembered that no allowance is made to
farmers to compensate for the work donc by
the wife and the other members of the family
in earning the income.
It is my intention when this bill is in committee to move two amendments to it. The
first deals with the appeal board. The honourable gentleman from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) raised the point-and the Special
Committee on Income Tax passed a unanimous recommendation with regard to it. which
vas accepted by this house-namely that there
should be set up an appeal board similar to the
one constituted by this bill. It was recommended that this board should hear appeals on
not only questions of fact and law but on
questions of discretion. This bill recognizes
that discretion is an important feature. because
it creates a board to deal with it. I cannot
understand why the government should object
to appeal from ministerial discretion. Such a
provision would not interfere with ministerial
responsibility any more than our courts of law
interfere with sonte person's responsibility. It
would simply mean that if a minister exercises
certain discretions under the act there shall be
an appeal board consisting of three, four, or
five members to listen to argument and decide
whether the discretion was improperly exercised. That decision would be no reflection on
the minister, but simply the judgment of three
or four men as to how the discretion ought to
be exercised. This is the amendment I proposeHon. Mr. HAYDEN: Is the honourable
senator giving notice of an amendment?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: I an only giving notice,
honourable members, of an amendment that
I propose to move in committee.
I want

advisory board be stricken out. I cannot
understand why the amendment should not be
acceptable to the government. It is absolutely
no reflection upon the minister to have the
exercise of his discretion made appealable.
Take a lawyer: he is asked for an opinion on
a case and gives one, but later the case goes
before a court, which decides that he was
wrong. His client does not think any the
worse of the lawyer for that; he knows the
lawyer gave his best opinion at the time. I
assume that when the minister exercises his
discretion he acts properly and gives the best
judgment of which he is capable. But he may
be wrong. He is the collector of revenue and,
as we found in our committee, he is influenced
in spite of himself. Human nature 'being
what it is, it would be pretty hard for him to
consider a taxpayer's appeal with absolute
impartiality. During my years in the Manitoba legislature I noticed that whenever we
were considering a matter affecting municipalities, any member of the house who had been a

SENATE

there is no longer any such reason. During the
war years the legislative programme consisted
principally of war measures and there was
not much we could do; but this session, except
for one or two short adjournments, we have
been here as long as the other house. Our
work on the large volume of peacetime legislation has been heavy, and there is every
reason to believe that in future it will continue
to be heavy. With our growing interest in
international affairs and the inevitable increase
in domestic legislation, we are likely to be
required at Ottawa at least five or six months
every year.
The bill exempts the expense allowance to

members of provincial legislatures, and my
amendment asks that the allowance now being
paid to senators, presumably for expenses, be
also exempted from income tax. Having sat
in a legislature for 17 years, I know something about the expenses of members of the
provincial bouses. My own expenses were
practically nil. True, I lived at the provincial
capital, but had, my home been anywhere
else in the province my expenses would still
have been very small. The sessions lasted
seven or eight or nine weeksHon. Mr. HOWARD: The Quebec legislature sat nine weeks last year.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: May I ask the bonourable senator if his amendment would place
the members of both bouses on the same
footing?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
A question may arise in the minds of some
honourable members as to whether it is within
my right to move, or within the right of the
Senete to pass, the second and third amendments, which have to do with the voting of
money. In my opinion there coulid be no
objection on this ground to the first amendment, for it deals simply with a matter of procedure; but in case there may be any question
as to the others, I ask permission to read the
conclusions of the special committee appointed
in lite first session of the 13th Parliament of
Canada, 1918, to consider the Senate's rights
in a matter of this kind. The committee,
which was under the chairmanship of the late
Honourable W. B. Ross, K.C., reported as
follows:
The Special Committee appointed to consider the question of determining what are
the rights of the Senate in matters of financial
legislation, and whether under the provisions
of The British North America Act, 1867, it is

for the Senate to amend a bill embodying
financial clauses (money bill), have the honour

During the
recess the Honourable W. B. Ross, a member
of this committee, prepared a memorandum
dealing with the question, copy hereto attached,
which memorandum has been carefully considered and adopted by this committee.
The
following summing-up thereof is submitted as
the conclusions of your committee on the rights
of the Senate in matters of financial legislation:
1. That the Senate of Canada has and always
had since it was created, the power te amend
bills originating in the Commons appropriating
any part of the revenue or imposing a tax by
reducing the amounts therein, but has net the
right te increase the same without the consent
of the Crown.
2. That this power was given as an essential
part of the confederation contract.
3. That the practice of the Imperial Houses
of Parliament in respect of money bills is no
part of the Constitution of the Dominion of
Canada.
4. That the Senate in the past has repeatedly
amended so-ealled money bills, in some cases
without protest from the Commons, while in
other cases the bills were allowed to pass, the
Commons protesting or claiming that the Senate
coul net amend a money bill.
5. That Rule 78 of the House of Commons of
Canada claiming for that body powers and
privileges in connection with money bills identical with those of the Imiperial House of
Commons is unwarranted under the provisions
of The British North America Act, 1867.
6. That the Senate, as shîown by The British
North America Act as well as by the discussion in the Canadian Legislature on the Quebec

Resolutions, in addition to its general powers
and duties îs specially empowered to safeguard

the rights of the provincial organizations.
7. That besides general legislation, there are
questions such as provincial subsidies, publie
lands in the western provinces and the rights
of the provinces in connection with pending
railway legislation and the adjustment of the
rights of the provinces thereunder likely to
arise at any time. and it is important that the
powers of the Senate relating thereto be
thoroughly understood.
Your committee are indebted to Messieurs
Eugene Lafleur, K.C., Aimé Geoffrion, K.C.. and
John S. Ewart. K.C., prominent constitutional
authorities. of Montreal and Ottawa. who have
been good enough to forward their views on
the question under consideration by your committee.
These opinions are appended hereto
and form part of the committee's report.
Al which is respectfully subnitted.

W. B. ROSS,
Chairman.
I

should

also

like

to put on record the
joint opinion given by Eugene Lafleur and
Aimé Geoffrion referred te in the report. It
is as follows:
Montreal, April 30, 1918.
The Honourable W. B. Ross,
The Senate, Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Sir,-We have been asked if in our
opinion the Senate bas the power te amend
money bills.

AUGUST 21, 1946
,Sections 17 and 91 of the British North
America Act place the Senate on exactly the
same footing as the House of Commons as
respects all legislation.
The only material derogation to this general
rule is contained in section 53 which provides
that bills for appropriating any part of the public revenue or for imposing any tax or impost
shall originate in the House of Commons.
The denial of the right to originate money
bills does not involve the denial of the right to
amend them. Nothing therefore in the text
of the British North America Act takes away
the latter right from the Senate.
The first paragraph of the preamble where it
is stated that the provinces desire to be united
federally with a constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom is relied on.
These words being in the preamble have much
less importance than if they were in the text.
Further it is obvious that similarity in principle does not mean identity in detail; the Canadian constitution differs from the British
constitution in many and important respects; the
similiarity in principle referred to in the preamble is intended to exist only to the extent
stated in the text.
The third paragraph of the preamble states
that it is expedient not only that the constitution of the legislative authority in the dominion
be provided for but also that the nature of the
executive government therein be declared, and
the text of the act contains many sections which
merely restate rules of the British constitution
suci as section 53 already referred to.
If the above-mentioned words of the preamble
meant that the British constitution applies to
Canada except in so far as the text of the act
expressly derogates therefrom the third paragraph of the preamble and all those sections
particularly section 53, would be useless or
meaningless.
The consideration of how the rule limiting the
powers of the House of Lords in the United
Kingdom came to be adopted affords an additional argument in support of the view suggested by the text of the British North America
Act.
In the early days there was a conflict between
the British House of Commons and the House of
Lords on this question of the powers of the
House of Lords in respect of money bills.
In 1678 the Commons resolved:
"That all aids and supplies and aids to His
Majesty in Parliament are the sole gift of the
Commons and that all bills for the granting
of any sucli aids and supplies ought to begin
with the Commons and that it is the undoubted and sole right of the Commons to
direct, limit and appoint in such bills the
ends. purposes, considerations, conditions,
limitations and qualifications of such grants
which ought not to be changed or altered by
the House of Lords."
In 1693 the Lords resolved:
"That the making of amendments and abatements of rates of bills of supply sent up from
the House of Commons is a fundamental, inherent and undoubted right of the House of
Peers from which their Lordships can never
depart."
It is true that the Lords did not act in accordance with this resolution and tacitly submitted
to the claim of the Commons, obviously to avoid
a conflict with the latter House, but this practice was iot the law, and this appears from the
preamble of the House of Commons resolution
63268-46j

li

of 1910 which announced the proposed legislation curtailing the powers of the Lords. (May's
Parliamentary Practice, d2th edition, p. 518.)
It is remarkable that of the two restrictions
on the rights of the Lords which the Commons
by its resolution of 1678 tried to impose, namely:
the denial of the right to originate and the
denial of the right to amend money bills, the
British North America Act while mentioning
the first in section 53 should not mention the
second against which the Lords had specially
protested.
If it had been the intention of the British
Parliament to impose the two restrictions on
the Senate it surely would have mentioned them
both or if content to rely on the preamble as incorporating the whole British constitution, it
would have mentioned neither.
To those reasons might be added this further
consideration that there is very little analogy
between the Lords and the Senate. The Lords
represent themselves, the Senate represents the
provinces. The Lords are not in an independent
position as the House .of Commons can use its
influence over the Crown and induce it to add
as many members as are needed to the House
of Lords to obtain a favourable majority.
It is probably for that reason that section 18
of the British North America Act when dealing
with the privileges, immunities and powers of
the Senate refers as the maximum for such
privileges, immunities and powers to those held,
enjoyed and exercised by the Imperial House of
Commons (and not by the House of Lords) at
the passing of the act.
Under the circumstances, we are of the
opinion that the Senate of Canada may amend
a money bill originating in the House of Commons as fully as the House of Commons can do.
Of course the powers of the Senate are himited
to the same extent as those of the House of
Commons by the fact that money bills must be
recommended by a message of the Governor
General.
Yours truly,
(Sgd.) E. LAFLEUR
AIME GEOFFRION
There is attached. to the report a memorandum of some eleven pages. I intend to
move those two amendments when we are in

shall ask one of my colleagues to move them

to amend money bills.

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: If the

whereby members of this chamber shall be

from initiating a measure involving expenditurc of money?

premium income tax and an additional corporation tax of 30 per cent-, or approximately
$50,000 on a profit of $100,000. That is discrimination against insurance companies as
compared with any commercial or industrial
companies. I said then that it was an entirely

double taxation, although that view was resisted by one senator. I say now it is not
double, it is treble taxation. Take the case
of a joint, stock fire insurance company: it
will pay the premium tax of 2 per cent, another
tax on its profits; perhaps another tax on
excess profits, and then its shareholders will
pay individual taxes on their dividends. I say
that is threefold taxation, and in my opinion
it is a little too much.
My other point is that discrimination is
shown as between taxes paid by foreign and
by Canadian companies. .My honourable
friend and I pretty well .agree that that is
the case.
Another point I wish to raise is the exemption of mutual life insurance companies from
income tax on earnings from casualty business.
I happen to be connected with a company
that will be obliged to pay not only the
premium tax but a tax on all its profits, including its income from investments, while foreign
companies will pay no tax on income from
investments. I do not wish to make it unpleasant for mutual life companies who do casualty
insurance business also, as do some of the
fire insurance companies; but I point out that
they will be exempted from paying taxes on
the profits they make on their casualty insurance business. I say that is unfair discrimination in favour of one Canadian company as
against another engaged in exactly the same
kind of business on a competitive basis.
May I mention another point in which I
am interested as a representative of the Canadian taxpayer? It relates to the fact that
foreign marine insurance companies pay no
taxes of any kind. My honourable friend
referred to the Royal Commission on Cooperatives presided over by Judge .McDougall.
The honourable gentleman stated, and I think
he was putting it fairly as far as he knew the
situation, that the government had followed
out the recommendations of that commission
with regard to the taxation on co-operatives
and mutual insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I said co-operatives;
I did not add insurance companies.
Hon. Mr. EULER: A statement was made
by the Acting Minister of Finance when this
measure was under discussion in the House of
Commons. He may have read the report I
have before me. I propose to read from the

699

report of the commission concerning certain
recommendations that these companies should
be taxed.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: You refer to the
mutual companies.
Hon. Mr. EULER: To the mutual companies. The report reads:
Before giving effect to the foregoing recommendations the incidence of the tax on net
premiums of mutual insurance organizations
under this Special War Revenue Act, the exemption from taxation granted to marine mnsurance companies, and the treatment for income
tax purposes of investment income in Canada
accruing to British and foreign insurance companies, should be reviewed by the government.
There is no indication that the recommendation of the commission in that regard was
followed.
Anything further that I might say, honourable gentlemen, would be better said in committee. I believe that the Special War
Revenue Bill and the measure now under consideration should be considered together.
Hon. THOMAS VIEN: Honourable senators, speaking to the question raised by the
leader opposite, there is no doubt as to the
jurisdiction of the Senate. Section 18 of the
British North America Act gives this house
the same jurisdiction that it gives to the
House of Commons. The only limitations
are contained in sections 53 and 54. Section
53 provides that money bills shall be introduced in the House of Commons; and section 54 states that even in the House of Commons a money bill must be preceded by a
recommendation of the Governor in Council.
That limitation refers not only to money bills
but also to tax bills. When the measure has
been introduced by a minister of the Crown,
with the approval of the Governor in Council,
it is submitted to both houses of parliament,
each of which has exactly the same power.
There is no restriction placed on the powers of
the Senate as compared with the House of
Commons. In the past we have amended
money 'bills and the Commons have accepted
our amendments with certain limitations as
expressed in their debates. I would suggest
that we would do well to assert our jurisdiction when the occasion arises.
When the Income War Tax Act was before
us for second reading last session we discussed the question of exempting the indemnities of members of parliament. The
opinion was expressed by ministers of the
Crown that it had always been a mistake to
tax indemnities. The indemnity is neither a
salary nor an income; it is an amount of
money voted by parliament to indemnify
members of both houses for the time con-

I believe that the railway mileage in the

Hon. G. G. MeGEER: Honourabie senaters,
I rise to support this bill for several reasons.
I certainly agree with the last speaker that in
the province of Quebec there lies probably one
of the most valuable and least developed areas
in Canadia.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I believe that in the
va-t foi est areas of Quebec wc have a supply
of products sufficient to satisfy the demand s
that are crowding upon us-demands for lumber, and pull) and paper; 1 believe that the
demand for forc-.t products te uupply our noxv

Bion. Mr. BORNER.

1 say te my friends in Quehec, as I have
said te the people of British Columbia: You
are partly te blame for the Jack of attention
you reccived from the national parliament.
The authorities iii Ottawxa are tee rnuch given
te coneern about the big thingw, international
affairs, and are content te leaxe local matters
te the provinces. At the samne time they have
encreached upen the revenues cf the provinces
se that they have net the means te carry on
the developrnent te meet their local needs.
This is a very important measure becau-.e it
brings into active eperation a very large area
of the province of Quebec. Tee great a portion
is idie and in a state of wilderness.
I hope
that, when we come te build the Pacifie and
Great Eastern Railway, a prejeet xvhich bas

people of British Columbia for the last txventy

Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hecar.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourabie senators,
1 arn supporting the bill. This proposed railwny line is about fifty-five miles long, and is
te be built largely for the purpose of transporting pulpwood down te, Windsor Milîs. A
shipment of 300,000 cords of wood is guaranteed-40,000 cords the first year and 45,000
each year tbereafter; and if there is a shortage
on that estirnate the sum of $3 is te be paid
for each cord short of the guaranteed quantity.

I think that my honourabie friend from
Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. MeGeer) lest
sight of one important feature. This proposed
line is in the nature of a feedcr, and in my
opinion that type of line is of more use te, the
country than long stretches of railway. The
evidence given before the committee of the
other bouse indicated that the land over whieh
this railway xvould be laid was of second
or third quality and not fit for settlement.
In my province tbe experience of putting
settlers on second or thîrd quality land bas
been very unfavourable. The report in the
ether place showed a cost of $75,000 per mile,
or about three-quarters of a million dollars,

703

AUGUST 22, 1946

for the construction of this railway, and indicated that the total revenue over the first
six years would show a small favourable
balance. I believe that feeders are good for
the railways if there is a future for them at
all. But as the honourable member from Saskatchewan North (Hon. Mr. Horner) has said,
the - problem of the railway today is the
competition by trucking companies. Forty
years ago this Senate turned down a large
number of branch line bills presented by both
the C.P.R. and the then Canadian Northern
Railway. Ever since then this house has been
credited with that saving. As a matter of
fact, the treasury of this country was saved
enough money to pay the salaries of the
senators for the ensuing hundred years. Forty
years have gone by, gentlemen, and we still
have sixty to go, which should satisfy most

of us.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Question!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROL BILL
SUBJECT MATTER-REPORT

Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD presented the
report of the Standing Committee on Banking
and Commerce on the subject-matter of Bill
195, an Act respecting the control of the
acquisition and disposition of foreign currency
and the control of transactions involving
foreign currency or non-residents.
He said: Honourable senators, the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce

beg leave to report as follows:
By order of reference made on Thursday, the
15th August, 1946, the subject matter of Bill

195: "An Act respecting the control of the
acquisition and disposition of foreign currency
and the control of transactions involving foreign
currency or non-residents", was referred to your
committee for consideration and report.
In view of the importance of this matter, all
honourable members of the Senate, whether
members of your committee or not, were invited
to attend our sittings and to participate in our
proceedings, to examine or cross-examine the
witnesses, the right to vote being reserved te
members of your committee. This invitation
was generally accepted and acted upon.
Your committee have held six sittings and
have heard the following witnesses:
The Hon. D. C. Abbott, P.C., M.P., Acting
Minister of Finance.
Mr. Graham F. Towers, C.M.G., Governor
of the Bank of Canada and Chairman of the
Foreign Exchange Control Board.
The hearing of these witnesses and the discussion which ensued have disclosed the necessity of amending the said Bill 195 in several
important respects, and they have also revealed

the necessity of continuing a modified form of
foreign exchange control for a limited period of
time.
Your committee are therefore of the opinion
that, with the information now available, the
Senate proceed to the second reading of the
said Bill 195, with the understanding that the
bill itself will then be referred to your standing committee to be amended in such respects
as your committee may deem advisýable.
SECOND READING
The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
August 14, the adjourned debate on the motion
of Hon. Mr. Hayden for the second reading
of Bill 195, an Act respecting the control of
the acquisition and disposition of foreign currency and the control of transactions involving
foreign currency or non-residents.

Honourable senators, the order for resumption
of this debate stands in the name of the honourable gentleman from Wellington (Hon. Mr.
Howard), the chief Government Whip, who
it will be recalled adjourned the debate at
my suggestion. Before the debate is continued
I think I should say a few words in respect
to a specific question that was asked of me
in committee, namely, whether, if the Senate
should see fit to give the bill second readmg,
I would do all in my power to have it referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
My
Commerce for consideration in detail.
answer is, unequivocally, yes.

Perhaps I should also say a word with respect to another matter. As honourable senators who attended the committee know, the

Acting Minister of Finance was present. While
of course the bill itself was not before the
committee, there was considerable discussion
not only of its general principle but of its
details; and as I recall it, the attitude of the
Acting Minister of Finance was that if the
committee, after having the bill referred to
it and giving it detailed consideration, felt
that any clauses should be amended in a way

which would better serve the public interest
and at the same time not seriously interfere
with the efficiency of the act to accomplish

the purpose intended, the government would
carefully consider any recommendations the
committee might make.
More specifically, and by no means restrieting that general suggestion or evidence of
wilingness te co-operate as far as possible
with the committee, the Acting Ministeir of

Finance made a statement as to the government's attitude towards the setting of a time
limit on the act. As I recall, up to the time
when the Acting Minister last attended the
committee there had been considerable discussion of a proposal to limit the operation of

SENATE
the act to the end of the first session after
the 31st of December, 1948, and the Acting
Minister intimated that if the committee
inserted an amendment to that effect in the bill
the government was prepared to recommend
to the House of Commons that the amendment be accepted.
Another matter discussed was the obligation on the part of individuals to sell United
States currency to authorized dealers. As I
understand it-I
Lave not as good a grasp
of the matter as bave some other honourable
senators-any individual who comes into
possession of even a very small amount of
Americen currency, say 32 or $5, would break
the law if he failed to turn that currency in to
an authorized dealer. The minister said, as I
recall, that sho.uld the Senate see fit te amerd
the bill by putting a reason-able floor under
the amount of currency one might legally
have in his possession-I believe the figure
sugge-tecd was $100, and if I am wrong
honourable senators will correct me-that
amendment would favourably be considered,
subject to the proviso that if an, emergency
arose in the future the floor could be lowered
or entircly eliminated by order in couneil.
There was some discussion also of sections
25 and 26 of the bill, which require permits
for the export or import of property. I regret that I have not a clear recollection of
exactly what the minister said on that point,
but mv feeling is that Le suggested the possibilitv of neeting. in part at least, the views
of the commitee.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: W'as the suggestion
not that the word "property" be changed te
"goods"?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As I say, I am
net clear as to just what was said, but my
feeling is that it indicated a willingness on
the part of the government to give favourable
consideration to the commitee's views.
Another matter that came under discussion
was the clause empowering the board te determine the fair value of any property. That
is section 36 (1) (c) (iii). If I remember
correctly, it was intimated that it might be
possible to consider an amendment with
respect to transactions between parties at
arm's length-I think that was the expression
uîsed-that is, ordinary business relations between residents and non-residents.
The matters that I have m.entioned were
by no means the only ones discussed in conmittee, but te the best of my memory they
were the matters with respect to which
specifie amendments were suggested. I understood the Acting Minister te intimate that
Hon. Nr. ROBERTSON.

he would be most willing to consider any
amendments proposed by the committee-that
is, net only those which had already been
suggested to him, but any others which might
arise out of detailed consideration of the bill.
I believe the honourable senator from
Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard) does net
intend to speak.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That is right.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Thierefore any
other honourable senator who wishes to continue the debate now is entitled to do se.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The question,
honourable senators, is on the motion for the
second reading of the bill.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
Hon. ARTHUR W. ROEBUCK: No, it is
net carried. I have an amendment to offer.
I may say that I was net much convinced by
the evidence given before the committee, as
the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
seems to have been. Honourable members will
recall that when this matter was referred to
committee I said I was opposed to the principle of the bill. I do net believe in fetters
and gags and Lalters on the business activities
of our country. My own view is that business
men carrying on their own affairs, to make
money for themselves, incidentally make
money alo for the country generally; but
clerks sitting behind desks and saying "No"
do not contribute very materially to the final
success of our business enterprises.
In committee I listened to the evidence of
the Governor of the Bank of Canada, and the
more I listened the more firmly convinced I
became that the great success of Canada's war
effort was not the result of petty interference
by himself and his officials, or the vast expenditures for which he was responsible, but rather
of the enterprise and industry, and the power
of thought and the muscle of the Canadian
people. Today, with the war over, I would
rely far more upon our industry and enterprise
than upon the restrictions of officials. The
two are mutually antagonistic; one is the
antithesis of the other. Restrictions do one
thing only-they interfere with industry. I
say, ]et us depend upon the broad principles
of trade and commerce which, if unhampered
and energetically applied by our business
people, will bring about the equilibrium which
the Covernor of the Bank of Canada proposes
to enforce by control.
His evidence before the committee was
largely based on fear. He was a very merchant
of fear, and did his best to bring the committee to the same condition of apprehension

AUGUST 22, 1946

with regard to the future as possessed him, and
upon which he based his arguments. As I
listened to him I could not help recalling the
passage in "Through the Looking Glass."
While walking along a forest path Alice met
a knight armed cap-á-pie. He was strangely
equipped, and around the fore feet of his
charger were steel bands out of which projected heavy spikes. Alice asked him what the
spikes were for. "To guard against the bites of
sharks," he said. So she inquired if he expected
to go to sea. He told her he had not thought
about that, but should ho go swimming these
things would come in handy. Here we have a
gentleman who, figuratively, wishes to place,
not steel bands around our feet, but rather a
chain around our necks, on the off-chance of
-preserving the equilibrium of trade between
ourselves and the United States, which he
forecast may be so disturbed that we shall
lose $600,000,000 in exchange in the next
twenty-four months. That was his prognostication. He himself admitted that it was a mere
statement of opinion, and when asked by
the cross-examiners to furnish substantial
grounds for such an opinion, he had virtually
none to give.
Now, I recall to the minds of honourable
members that Canada's indebtedness te the
United States was no greater at the end of
1945 than it was at the commencement of the
war. Notwithstanding the fact that in the
six years from 1940 to 1945 we purchased from
min
the United States merchandise to a value
excess of six thousand million dollars, at the
end of the period the balance was fair between
us and the honours were even.
We did not accomplish that great result by
having clerks sit behind desks and say "No"
to our business men who were seeking to carry
our their transactions. We did it by enterprise
and industry, and in a number of other ways
that I can mention, and will-not that I want
to thresh over old straw but rather that in the
future, to some extent at least, we may be
guided by what bas taken place in the past.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question to clarify this point?
He bas said that during these last six years
Canada's trade with the United States
amounted to some thousands of millions of
dollars. Is it not a fact that the Foreign
Exchange Control Board was operating during
that time?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: It certainly was
operating, and in some respects it stood in the
way of the result which I have stated. It did
its best to stop any freedom of trade. It
did net do one single thing, even to dotting
an "i", to bring about that result.

705

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Would the honourable
gentleman state how the Foreign Exchange
Control Board injured our trade?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Yes. It stopped the
flow of foreign exchange; at great expenseand I will come to that-it maintained officers
all over this country examining into what the
people were doing, and telling them they
could not do this, that and the other thing, in
that way tying up business and blunting its
transactions. Let me see if I cannot answer
further what my honourable friend has asked,
because this question is my thesis.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: May I interrupt the
honourable gentleman on that same point?
Were not the lease-lend purchases which the
United States made in this country during the
period referred to largely responsible for the
high level of trade?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Of course-not the
efforts of the Foreign Exchange Control
Board at all. That is what I propose to
speak on at the moment.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: How did the board
interfere with that?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Let me go back for
a moment, and I will come to what my friend
is asking me. Up to the end of 1941, as honourable members will recollect, we were buying more from the United States than we were
selling to them, because at that time the
United States was not in the war. By the
end of 1941 Canada's debtor position had
worsened by more than $350,000,000, as can
be seen by reference to page 22 of the last
report of the Foreign Exchange Control Board.
It will be remembered that we were worried
at the time, but there was not very much we
could do about it except to increase the efforts
we were putting forth to maintain our position
in the world. This we did heroically; we
relied upon ourselves. You will remember
that in June of 1940 the budget provided for
an exchange war-tax of ten per cent for the
purpose of discouraging purchases in the
United States. It applied to everybody and
to everything, because it was leviedi upon
dutiahle and free goods, and I have no doubt
that it played its part in bringing about the
final result. We raised the excise on automobiles andi one or two items of that nature,
because we were relying on our business sense
and not on the blocking ability of a dictatorial
board.
In 1941 the United States came into the
war and then things happened. . In April,
1941, there was brought about between the
Prime Minister of this country and the President of the United States, what is known as
the Hyde Park Agreement, under which Can-

706

SENATE

ada sold to and bought from the United States
by way of simple commercial transactions
between the two countries. I point out to
honourable senators that that was not a
restrictive arrangement; rather it was the
reverse. It was the doing of business, not the
stoppage of business.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Will the honourable
gentleman forgive me if I interject? What I
fail to understand is how the operations of the
Foreign Exchange Control Board. interfered
with the functioning of that agreement. That,
indirectly, is what my honourable friend
suggests.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I did' not make that
suggestion-certainly not in those words. I
said that the Foreign Exchange Control
Board's operations were restrictive, and so
doubt interfered with the carrying out of this
agreement, as they have done with all our
commercial transactions. People are sticking
their noses into this and that, and they are in
the way. The board was in the way. It does
not know about the problems, because it takes
no part in commercial or manufacturing transactions. I do not say that it specifically interfered with this particullar Hyde Park Agreement, but it did it no good.
Next followed the building of the Alaska
Highway, a project in Canada, financed by the
United States at very considerable cost. There
was a chain of air fields built in Canada by
United States fun-ds. There was also the
Canol oil project near Alaska. We sold gold
and U.S. dollars, and for goods sent to the
United Kingdom we received back gold and
U.S. dollars to the extent of $485,000,0001. We
sold some of our own securities in the United
States, and sold some current securities. Further, and this is a most important feature, we
had heavy sales of wheat and other grains to
the United States--to the extent of $150,000,000
in 1943, $300,000,000 in 1944, and $100,000,000
in 1946. I suggest to my fellow members of
this house that it was that commercial activity
on our part, not the board's chains around our
hands and feet, which enabled us after we made
our purchases to achieve a balanced trade
position between Canada and the United
States.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: May I ask the
honourable member a question?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I do not know that
it will help any, but go ahead.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Does the honourable gentleman not admit that had there not
been foreign exchange control, requiring payment in United, States dollars for all the
commodities we were sending to that country,
Hon. MIr. ROEBUCK.

the probability is that payment would have
been in Canadian dollars and that we would
not have benefited in our U.S, dollar account?
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I suppose I could
answer that question by a counter question.
How would the people of the United States
get Canadian dollars with which to buy Canadian goods unless they secured them by
giving us American dollars? They are not
printing Canadian dollars in the United
States. So. gentlemen, nearly all the problems
of that kind answer themselves if you only
get out of the way and let business carry on in
a normal fashion. Government interference
with private affairs is always illusive and
mystifying, because the transactions are never
carried through to their conclusion, or they
ire put half way through and the conclusion
is drawn from the wrong promise.
I wish to refer to the dealings with the
United Kingdom because the same line of
experience is drawn from our trade with that
country as is drawn froin our trade with the
United States. By reference to the figures
given by the Foreign Exchange Control Board
I find that in our trade with the sterling
area. Great Britain-which is the sterling
area-receivcd from Canada meorchandise to
the amount of $10,971,000,000, and that the
returns offsetting that amount were only
$5,124.000,000. That is the outline of our trade
with Creat Britain.
The question may be asked as to how that
great deficit is made up. I will give you
chaptcr and verse, if you care to have it
from the records of the board itself. To begin
with, we repatriated Canadian funds to the
amount of one billion and forty-three million.
As I have already stated, we received gold
and U.S. dollars to the value of $504.000,000.
There was Canada's loan to the United States
of $700,000.000, which boiled down in actual
practice to $561,000,000. Thon there was our
billion dollar gift; and what we call mutual aid
-which
the United States refers to as lendlease-to an amount of 82,175,000,000. There
was the interim advance to the United Kingdom of S164,000,000 and the total of all other
capital transactions was $411,000,000, with a
small sterling balance of $11,000,000. With all
those operations the two sides of the book
balanced as between Canada and the sterling
area, so there was no need there for foreign
exchange control interference.
Honourable senators in reply to my proposition may say that the United Kingdom had a
Foreign Exchanige Control Board. My answer
is that it played little part in the results. My
authority for that statement is to be found at

AUGUST 22, 1946
page 31 of the report of our Foreign Exchange
Control Board dated March, 1946, in these
words:
At the outbreak of war it was necessary for
the United Kingdom and other sterling area
countries to introduce exchange control and busband their United States dollar resources. As
the table shows, a relatively small proportion
of the deficiency was covered in this way during
the war.
That is not my opinion, gentlemen, but the
opinion of Graham Towers, Governor of the
The Foreign Exchange
Bank of Canada.
Control Board played 'a negligible part in the
transactions between Canada and the sterling
area.
But that is all behind us; the great difficulties of the war have gone, and natural
forces have balanced the trade between our
countries. I ask you, gentlemen, to rely in
the future, as we have done in the past, upon
the courage, judgment, enterprise and ability
of business to balance trade as between the
United States and Canada, for I am convinced
that if we do this we will meet with less difficulty than we have previously encountered.
The great authority in matters of international finance is the late Lord Keynes. He
was the intellectual father of all economists
and the grandfather of Graham Towers, Rasminsky and the other economists of the Foreign
Exchange Control Board. He was the man
Britain chose to send to the United States to
help negotiate the $3,750,000,000 loan, and has
been probably the most outstanding political
economist in the world. I have in my hand
a copy of a posthumous article by Lord
Keynes, taken from the Economie Journal of
London, England, which has just arrived in
this country. In the editorial footnote the
late Lord Keynes is described in these words:
Britain has lost the architect of the economie
policy which made victory

possible . . . the

brain which more than any other was shaping
her economic future.
Gentlemen, I wish to call your attention to
what Lord Keynes, the father of our orthodox
economy, says about the situation today. But
first may I say that this bill is advocated by
the philosophy of fear and the idea that
American dollars are to be scarce in the coming years. The trembling ones have already
lost confidence, notwithstanding facts that
must be plain to their sight, and are afraid
that our dollars are going to succumb to the
American dollars.
In a statement written just before his death,
and published since he died, Lord Keynee
said.:
-if the two conditions are fulfilled that Britiish
exports of goods and services to the rest of the
world as a whole reach an appropriate level and
that American imports of goods and services
from the rest of the world as a whole reach an

707

appropriate level. If these conditions are satisfied, there will be no necessity for a strictly bilateral balance between the two countries taken
in isolation.
May I re-phrase that statement and apply it
to Canada rather than the United Kingdom?
Given the sale of goods from Canada to the
world at large, and the free purchase of goods
without these objectionable petty interferences
of a board of civil servants, a strict bilateral
balance between Canada and the United States
taken in isolation is not necessary. Honourable gentlemen know, and it was referred to
in evidence before the committee, that Canada has bought more from the United States
in the years gone by than she has sold to
the United States; on the other band, she bas
sold to Great Britain more than she has purchased from Great Britain. Lord Keynes'
statement is that, given a general world balance, a strictly bilateral balance between each
of the countries taken in isolation is not necessary. That theory applies to Canada and her
balances today. Be they with the United
States or Great Britain, all play their part in
that great general balance which has seen us
through in the years gone by, and will not
forsake us in the years to come, even without
the interference which this bill proposes.
Lord Keynes further says this:
Perhaps the most mistaken and most prevalent
delusion relates, however, to the creditor position of the United States today in relation to
the rest of the world. It is commonly believed
that the end of the war bas left the United states
in a strong creditor position, in addition to
her large gold reserves. How many people are
aware that apart from her gold holdings, which
do not, of course, represent an undischarged
claim on the rest of the world, the United States
was a debtor country on balance at the end of
1945?

At the end of 1945 the United States was
not in the strong creditor position that she
was prior to the war; in fact, in the world at
large she was in a net debtor position to the
extent of two billion one hund.red, million
dollars.
Lord Keynes has this to say about the
United States:
After she entered the war, the net short-term
position of the United States deteriorated substantially; so much so that by October, 1945, she
had dissipated by far the greater part of her
large gains from ourselves and others in 1939,
1940 and 194-1 before she entered the war.
The United States dissipated all that she
accumulated in the early stages of the war.
The learned author has this to say:
If the figures are restricted to the more or
less liquid reserves of foreign countries held in
the United States at the end of the war in the
shape of ear-marked gold, bank balances and
market securities, the aggregate is of the order
of $15 billion, and has increased since the end
of 1938 by some $9 billion.

SENATE
This luge movement, most of which represents a gain by foreign countries at the expense
of the United States, has been largely overlooked by commentators in this country.
And it las been totally overlooked by those
who today are attempting to gauge the position
of Canada twenty-four months hence and, as
opposed to the United States, show us down
by $600,000,000-which is a pure guess unfounded in fact.
Let us see what Lord. Keynes' advice is.
I think this is addressed to us as well as to
his fellow-citizens of the United Kingdom:
Putting one thing together with another, and
after pondering all these figures, may not the
reader feel himself justified in concluding that
the chances of the dollar becoming dangerously
scarce in the course of the next five to ten
years are not very high?
He is speaking of the American dollar. The
chances of Canada finding the United States
dollar scarce and hard to get d-uring the next
five years, according ,to Lord Keynes-and
with him I completely agree-are not very
high. Our position in the world today, honourable senators, is as strong as that of the
United States, if not stronger, and we need
none of the artificial protections of these
superior men who draw large salaries for saying "No" in the city of Ottawa.
It is the long run that I am thinking of. It
is the operation of natural forces upon which
I rely. I ask honourable senators to pay particular attention to this sentence by Lord
Keynes:
In the long run more fundamental forces may
be at work if all goes well, tending towards
equilibrium, the significance of whicl may
ultimately transcend ephemeral statistics.
Lord Keynes continues:
I find myself moved, not for the first time,
to remind contemporary economists that the
classical teaching embodied some permanent
trutis of great significance, which we are
liable today to overlook because we associate
them with other doctrines whici we cannot now
accept without much qualification. There are in
these matters deep underdurrents at work. natural forces, one can call them, or even the
invisible band, which are operating towards
equilibriun.
May I pause here to interject one

emark?

In trade matters, as in others, let us not underestimate the force of the invisible hand.
If it were not so, we could not la e got on
even so well as we have for many decades past.
I come now to Lord Keynes' concluding
sentences, which I consider masterly and very
applicable ta the great matters we are now
considering.
Meanwhile for us the best policy is to act
on the optimiistic hypothesis until it lias bcen
proved wrong. We shall do well not tD fear the

future too much.

Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK.

These men who have been giving evidence
to us are pessimists of the worst kind. They
are building their interests on the pessimism
with which they try to infect us, and using the
idea of fear and the mystery of money to
drive us along to actions which we know are
wrong-for it is wrong to put these men in
command. Fancy, honourable senators, fancy
placing in control of the financial life-blood of
this country a man who within the last few
months has made the greatest error in foreign
exchange ever known in the history of this or
perhaps any other nation, and who, out of the
favourable balances which Le had collected
from the people of Canada, made a loss which
on very good authority is placed at $150,000,000
and wLich ie tried to justify before our committee by referring to gains made by a board
that was operating before le and his board
were in existence. Are we to place the flow
of the life-blood of this country in his hands, as
wse Lave in the past?
Lord Keynes continues:
Preserving all due caution in our own activities, the job for us is to get throughi the next
five years in conditions which are favourable and
not unfavourable to the restoration of our full
productive efficiency and strength of purpose,
of our prestibe with others and of our confidence
in ourselves.
I call the attention of ionourable senators to
those words. He would give us in Canada, as
lie tried to give his people in the United Kingloi, a r-easonable and proper self-respect, and
confidence in ourselves.
He ends with these words:
We shall run more risk of jeopardising the
future if we are influeiced by indefinite fears
based on trying to look ahead further than any
one can see.

That is a great argument. I commend it in
all its dotail to my fellow senators before we
take the step that we are asked to take.
What is proposed in the motion before
the bouse? It is that we place this objectionable measure on the statute books of Canada.
Honourable senators, we should never do anythîing of that kind. Furthermore, it is proposed tiat we should do it blindfold, for we
have not today the information which we
should possess before we pass this bill, regardless of what time limitation may be placed
upon it. We have Leard evidence from an
interested party endeavouring to jam through
a bill which he knows is objectionable to our
moral perception. He has donc the best he
could-ie is pretty smooth, I grant you; a
very likeable and very fine fellow-but his
arguments are based on wbat Lord Keynes'
ca
indefinite fears, feirs of tbings of wichi
no knowledge and therefore cannot
we tîve
iefute.

AUGUST 22, 1946
Now,

honourable

sonators, before wo act

on this measure we ought to have evidence
not only froma theso interested civil servants
of ours, but from the business interoats of
Canada. True, the bankers do not want to
come. Certainly flot.
Let me digress for a moment right here.
What has Leen the cost of this Foreign
Exchange Board in tLe past? I cannot perhaps
got at tbis neariy as weil as can tLe honourable senator who conducted the cross-examination in committeo, but as I look through the
board's report for 1946 I flnd that, in addition to its exponses, the board paid year after
year some $4,000,000 in what is euphoniously
called commissions to bankers. For 1943, 1944
and 1945, 1 think it adds up to some
$13,750,000.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: It is $25,000,000.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: 1 agree with the
honourahie senator from Vancouvor-Burrard
(Hon. Mr MeGeer). The total cost of the
commissions from the huard to the Lankers
25,000,000 or M2,000,000 during
was ome
those war years. But that is not ail, Lecause

the charges made Ly the. bankers to tLe individual custorner whon Le changes Lis moýney from
Canadian into United States currency go into
their puekets, and there is nu record of what
those charges amount to in tLe aggregate.
Su to Legin with you have some 825,000,000
of commissions paid to the ha.nkers. 0f course

they wrutýe a letter saying they did nut wish to
give evidence! They were the only unes
invited lu appear'hefore the Communs cornmîttee. If the bankers do not wish tu como,
we s9houid subpoena them. We sbouid have
evidence nut only from thern, Lut frm those
engaged in iumbering, mining and manufacturing. We should also hear from tLe various
societios and, institutions of this country as lu
how they look upon these restrictions which
tie their hands. Il is nul possible for us le,
do this now, and that is another reason why
we shouid at this tirne resist and refuse lu
Le dictateci to hy anybody.
This Lili cornes lu us in tLe dying days of tLe
session, at a lime when it is impossible for us
to give il the thorough investigation which is
nocessary, and which it is our duty ýto subi oct
it lu before it is enacted. Su I say the inquiry
of the iast fow days shuid continue. Il
should be resumed, not in 1940, as somebody
has suggested, after tLe manacies are riveled
on our peuple, Lut at tLe very next session of
parliament. Under the. ordor in council the
huard can carry on the controis and make all
the modifications now suggested by way of a
further order in council, if it is lhuught right
to do su. There is nothing to gtop the huard

709

for a minute. But we are nut responsibie for
that order in council, we, neyer passed it;
Let
others have tak-en that responsibility.
them continue to bear it. Let us understand
what this thing means before we plunge
hastily into it, and let us discharge the duty
which rests upon the Senate of protecting the
liberties of our citizens at ail times. Let us
exercise wisdom as "eider sta-tesmen", a terma
which is perhaps wrongly appiied to us.
For the reasons I have. stated, honourabie
senators, I offer this amendýment, seconded by
ilonourable Senator Hu-shioýn:
That the bill be not now read a second time,
but that it be deferred for consideration to the
niext session of parliament, and that pending
such consideration, parliament extend to the
Governor in Council the authority to continue
the existing powers, control and regulations of
the Foreign Exehange Control Board.
1 commend this amendment to the fax-aurable consideration of my feiiow members. It
is not drastic; it is a motion for deiay; a re-

fusai to be rushed and gagged; a de.mand that
we know where we are going before we start;
an attempt on cur part, vigorous]y to examine
this matter and sec if we can be right and
flot wrong. ýI commend the motion to my follow members with all the force of whicha 1 amn
capable. Let us give Ibis bill that ranch of a
hoist, realizing that the controi board men have
nu real compiaint, Lecause in the meantime
their powers romain in force, and that by
taking this course we reservo to ourseives the
right of judgment, and action after knowledgo
is obtained.
Some lion. SENATORS: Question!
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators. the motion is for the second reading
of Bill 195. an Act respecting the control of
the acquisition -and disposition of foreign
currency aud the control of transactions involving foreign curreney or nun-residents.
An ameadment lias been mox ed by Hhn.
Senator Roebuck, seconded Ly Hon. Senator
Hushion, "that tbis bill Le nul now read, but
that. it be deferred for consideration to the
next session of parliamen.t, and that pending
sueh consideration, parliament extend to the
Governor in Council the authority tu continue t.he existing p'owers, control and regulation.s of the Foreign Exchange Control
Board."
The question is now on the arndment.
Hon. W. RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators. I knew nothing about the -amendment until it was read by the honourabie
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck), but I had intended to vote against
t.he second reading of this bill. I arn voting

against it becau~e I do flot like t.o extend the
controls now being exercised under an order
in ccuncil which bas tbe force of an act of
parliamc nt-con troIs which are enlarged and
atade more stringent in this bill.
I a n fot a member of tbe Banking and
Commerce Committee, but, I bave attended
every meeting and listened very carefully to
ex-crything that bas been said. I bave not been
eonvmeced by the proponents of the bill tbat
iis necessarv to enlarge and continue tbe
pre-ent measures of emergency control. I arn
aliva vs afraid that when a bill is put on the
staisute books tbose administering the act will
find that it gives tbcm fuller powers than, are
possible under an order in council. It seems to
me that an order in council, will be administered iih a great deal more care than an
act of parliament.
The bill provides very severe penalties for
trivial offenceýý.
Sometimes I wonder just
wheie we are heading in the British Commonwealth of Nations. As I said tbe other day, I
bave just returned from Great Britain, wbere
I attcnded an Imperial Press Conference. Tbere
were !sixty representatives in attendance from
ail ov er the Britis.h Commonwealtb of Nations
and tbe British Colonial Empire. We learned
that newsprint was controlled in Australia,
New Zealind. India, South Africa, and in al
the British colonies. We learned also tbat in
some of the colonies a newspaper publisber
would on certain days be told by telephone
that lie eould bave a few extra tons of newsprint, because next day tbe government
wanted him to publish a very important statement. That is wbat we are heading into. I
do not like controls of any kind. We got rid
of newsprint control in Canada, and up
went the price, but I amn quite sure every
n.ewspaper publisber would rather pay $15 a
ton more for bis newsprint and be free.
Tbeze controls in tbe hands of bureaucracy
can be exereised very severely. It migbt surprise honourable senators to know that today
in Great Britain a builder or owner of a bouse
who transgresses the building controls to a
very minor degree, is hiable to be sentenced to
penal servitude for seven years. Does anvone think, that five or six years ago the British
people would bave submitted, to any sucb
regîtlation? Of course they would not. But
the v bave become so accustomed to controls
that, they regard them as innocuous. If you
writp a member of the goverament you do not
get, a reply from him; hi., seeretary writes that
the matter will be brougbt before tbe minister
-but it seldom is.
I shall vote for tbis amendment and against
the motion for second reading of tbe bill. I
think the penalties prescribed for a lot of
Hon. MIr. DAVIES.

trivial offences are altogetber too severe. I arn
flot at ail convineed tbat we need foreign
exehango control at the present time; but
admitting tbat we do, even if the bill is
rejected the Foreign Exchange Control Board
will stili function, but it will not be by virtue
of approval of the Senate of Canada.
Hon. T. A. CRERAR: There is, I take it,
no doubt in tbe mind of any honourable
senator tbat tbis bill confers on tbe Foreign
Exchange Control Board very extraordinary
powers. I have read tbe bill, and I find the
principle of power runs rigbt tbrough it from
the preamble to tbe last section. As I said
when I spoke before, unless tbere is a very
clear and very urgent need for it, we should
flot pass legislation of this kind based on the
principle imphicit in the bill. We are in
,peace time now.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: In wartime wben tbe
country's wbole effort was dedicated to its
very preservation, restrictions and controls
were necessary in certain directions, and
because of the cmergeney our people accepted
tbem, often under mucb irritation. It is time
for tbe Canadian people to ponder and think
very seriouslv upon tbe principles that should
guide democratie government in this country.
During tbe latter part of tbe cigbteentb or tbe
beginning of tbe nineteentb century, there
was in Britain a great political pbilosopher by
the name of Lord Acton, who understood and
analyzed the prineiphes underlying democratie
government. He made the statement, which
bas been accepted by Liberals cverywhere in
the worhd, tbat 'ahI power eorx'upts, but absolute power corrupts absolutely". \Ve bave seen
sorne evidence of tbat trulh in the admninistralion of tbe controls throughout tbe war.
I do not wishi to question for a moment tbe
good intentions or good failh of tbe government or of the men who will form tbe personnel
of tbis board should the legislation go into
effeet. It is neeessarv however to recaîl that
we are conferring enormous powers. If the
legislation passes tbe board will bave to appoint agents in every part of Canada. Wbo are
the agents tbat wilh be appointed? The legislation indicates tbat tbey wilh be tbe managers
of the banks and the postmasters throughout
tbe country. During tbe war it was necessary
for t.be Oil Controller, for instance, to bave
agents stationed everywbere throughout the
country. It was necessarv also. in connection
wilh tbe stabihization pohicies, lu bave tbese
agents. If flic board could ensure that tbe

ment, my objection to this measure would be
lessened very considerably. But nu board can
guarantee that.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: The objections
would not be removed, just lessened.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: May I give one instance with wbic'h I arn familiar in the control
of the sale of gasoline? The Oul Controller,
perhaps for very good reasons, issued a directive that nu farmer operating a truck could
carry passengers. A farmer in the constituency
that 1 represented in the other boýuse was une
day driving bis truck fromn Swan River to
another town and going about bis legitirnate
business. H1e picked up a few young lads be
knew personally, and wbo were going to work
several miles away, aloug the road bie was
travelling. IJnfortunately for bim be was met
by a policeman and stopped. 11e was charged
witb a violation of the act, baled befure a
magistrate and fined $10. This man, tu my
certain knowledge, was subscribing to war
loans; he was a farmer and be was working
from dayligbt to dark to increase the production of food su necessary at that time.
1 arn sure it neyer was in the mmnd of tbe
Oil Controller or tbose at the bead of the
administration that such petty tyranny as tbis
would take place. But it did take place. And
bonourable senators know tbat what I have
just cited is only une of tbousauds of instances
througbout tbîs country. Ouly a few days ago
I received a letter which was a comment on a

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: H-onourable members,

I do flot want such a situation to become a

that he cannot read it without first saying
Who is the author.
Hon.,Mr. EULER: You can always objeet

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable senators. I think the honourable gentleman
add.ressing the bouse is familiar with the rule,
and I have no doubt he will flot transgress it.
The member speaking is required, as has been
statedi, to give the name of the writer.
Hon. Mr. LACASSE: H1e said that he would

Hon. Mr. HAIG3: Not until 1 raised the
question.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: He always intended
to give it. One signs not at the -top of a letter
but at the bottom.
Hon. 'Mr. CRERAR: Mr. Speaker, this is
an unpleasant interruption. May I say to the
bonourable leader opposite that I had intended
to give the name signed to the letter.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: You did not say that you
would until I asked you to do so.
Hon. Mr. ýCRERAR: Was it necessary?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Then why did you
not wait to see whether I was going to give
it or not?
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Under the rule you are
required to give it, as you know.
Hon. Mr. ýCRERAR: I know the rules as
well as my honourable friend.
Hon. MT. HAIG: Well you ought to.
Hon. Mr. EULER: H1e only gives the name

Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes, on demand.
Hon. Mr. LAÇASSE: This objection is

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: The letter is flot
markedi in any way to indicate that it is to be
regarded as personal, and I arn sure the gentleman in question will have nu objection to my
reading it and giving bis name. The name is
F. A. Robinson. The letter reads as follows:

your efforts to save us a few remuants of per-

sonal liberty.

Yours faithfully,

Honourable svnators. the sentiment expressed
in that letter is the sentiment of tens of
thousands of little business men, farmers.
and others throughout this country.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Hundreds of thousands.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: They have no way of
presenting their case to parliament. I make a
plea on their behalf against the imposition of
tnis kind of regimentation, which in my judgment is at this time quite unnecessary.
I listened. as did the other members of the
committee, to the arguments presented by the
Governor of the Bank of Canada, and I give
him full oredit for good faith. J listened lionestly to the arguments he presented as to why
this measure shbould' be passed, and, I am bound
to say that in my judgment they were not
conynecg.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Today we have a
billion and a half dollars in gold and US.
dollars to me t any emîergency that may come.
Where then is the urgency to pass this bill,
when we have not had time to examine if
fully? The goverument bas the power today
to carry on its foreign exchange control and,
according to the statement of the minister
who appearcd before us, will have that ·power
for ut least sixty days after the beginning of
the next session of parliament.
Honourable gentlemen, these are my reasons
for supporting the motion moved by the
honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). It is a motion for delay,
and for a further examination into this
measure. It does not deprive the government
of any power that it requires to carry on its
operations for a considerable period of time;
but it does in effect enable the government,
if it is considered necessary, to bring this
measure baok and give the legislators time to
fuill considor and examine it. J say that no
further power shtould be given at this
session of parliauxent.
This is a miattr upon whichl I have very
strong feelings. I do not want to put hundred's
of thousands of good honest citizens in a
position wlere they mxav be inder the tyranny
of some petty official, simply because there
is a fear that at some indefinite period in the
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

future the government may nced these extraordinary powers. I submit that that is not
proeeding in a sensible way.
We are today living in very disturbed times.
The upset created by the war lias made a
terrifie impact upon the material well-being
of the world. But the war made a greater
impact ipon the qualitirs of mind and
character that are the basis of our civilization.
War is a terribly demuoralizing, disintegrating
and degrading thing. Now if we are to maintain our froe institutions, based -as they are
on the consexnt of the people. it is our resjponsibility, and we cannot escapo it, to sec thut we
do nothing to unnecessarily disturi and irrita,te and confound them.
In my judgment this xmîeasuxre is unnecessary
at the prosent time and will simply serve to
discourage our people throughout every part
of this country. Many will be subjected to all
the petty irritations that officious and even
stupid agents of the board may put upon
them. This is a good reason why we should
be cry
crofu about putting legislation of
this kind on our statute books.
As honourable senators know, I served in
the government during the war, and I will
take a back seat to no one in expressing my
admiration for the manner in which the civil
service of this country assisted in the war
effort. But I fear that as a result of six years
of war and six years of much control, there
is still too much of a control-complex in the
governing circles of this country.
If there is any danger to the external value
of the Canadian dollar, that danger can be
met in other ways than that proposed by the
bill. Let us develop the resources of our country. I am in support of the views expressed
by the honourable senator from VancouverBurrard (Hon. Mr. MeGeer) in that respect.
He cited before the committee yesterday
instances where fifteen million dollars will be
brought into the province of British Columbia
to further assist the industries of that province
to develop their products for shipment te the
United States. That is one way to increase
our supply of U.S. dollars. In my province an
American concern is now planning, and has
taken the initial steps to develop a mining
property that will require an investment of
at least five or six million dollars. That is of
course going on all the time. Take our tourist
traffic. If we want to develop our tourist
traffic with vision and intelligence, it is quite
possible within a few years to make that
businnss worth to us S300.000,000 a vear.
Almost the whole of that S300.000,000 would
be United States dollars which would help
protect our balance of international payments.

perspective, if will be founid that the foresight exercised by the Foreign Exchange
Control Board will rank high among the
reasons for Canada's achievement. in the
economic fild.
It is interesting to rccall what happened.
In the years immediately prior to the war,
favourable, trade conditions had resulted in a
credit balance on current account. On Septemnber 15, 1939, Canada's holdings of gold and
United States dollars from
ail sources
amounted f0 tbe then relatively high sum of
$393.000,000. Thougn cor position then was,
as it is today, relatively strong, fortunately
Canada biad in authority persons wbo exercised
wise foretbougbt. If was apparent f0 thoso
wbo took any tbougbt for tbe morrow that
tbough wvcwere thon in a sfrong position conditions migbit rapidly change. Anyone could
see that there would be an increasing deficit
in our balance of trade witb the United States.
Thaf if migbf assume large proportions was
quite probable. The need for consumer goods
and capital gonds from the United States
might well increase. while our own production
would in ever-increasing degree be needed for
the purpose of our war effort, eithcr at home
or across tbe Atlantic.
But there wvas another factor. Wbat would
ho the attitude of tbe holders of Canadian
investments in the United States, which then
totalled more than four billion dollars, of
wbich more than haîf was in negotiable
seourities? Would they, for any of the various
reasons which influence people in sucb circumstances, become alarmed and trvy to wifhdraw
their capital? There is no necd f0 dw,,ell on
the serious disturbance of our economv which
would bave resulted from a situation'of tbat
kind. With tbis danger in mmnd, the government instituted a control of foreign exebange.
1 should like here to sav a word as to the
qualitative nature of the controls. Certain
foreign c.xclban-e demands; which were of a
more pressing nature than others were freely
granted. I bave a great respect for the knowledge of my bonourable friend from TorontoTrinitv (Hon. Mt. Roebuck) as to these mattors, but I understand that during tbe war the
board sought-a,, it will seek in tbe futureto avoid interference witb the flow of import
and export trade. The function of the board
wvas tben. as it is now. f0 control th(, witbidrawal of capital in such a way as to nui the
least possible risk of iojuring our economv for
the timo being.
The early fears in connection witb our

not at once. For fhreo montbis our balance
of $393.000,000 remainod relatively sfeady,
Hon. âir. ROBERTSON.

but at the end of 1940 if bad dropped to
$332,000,000.
On the favourable side were
our incroasing gold production and, as was
pointed ouf by my honourable friend from
Toronfo-Trinity, the United Stateos dollars
received, direct ly or indirectly, from the United
Kingdom.
The serious pressure doveloped
wben Canadian war production gof info ifs
stride. By the end of 1941 our balance
bad dropped f0 $187,000,000. Purchases from.
the United States increased, as had beon
predicfed; fourist travel fel off; and by 1941
the situation bad become very serious. Despif e the moasures of exebange conservation
then faken, in our transactions wifb the
United States, we woro running a doficif of

more than $300,000,000 a year.

Clearly, new

The United
States introduced tbeir lend-leaso programme
in 1941, but Canada nover would avail herself
of if, and I for one amn proud of the fact.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Iloar, hear.

ion. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Af this time, in
April, 1941, the Prime Minister of Canada
and the President of the United States ontered into the Hyde Park agreement, which
my honourable friend bas referred fo-nof
f0 enable us f0 take advantage of lend-lease,
which was jusf another form of borrowing
from t he American governimenf, but as an
agreement by wbich the American government, as a war measure, would increase ifs
purchases in Canada of such goods as were
reqiiircd for fbeir various types of lend-lease.
As my honourable friend bias pointed ouf,
this arrangement xvas of very groat advantage
to Canada. Trade flowed back the other wvay
as flic resulf of the American government
placing orders for goods f0 be produccd in
Canada and shipped f0 tbe United States or
on Unitecd States account.
This proved to bo the furning point. and
as a resulf of these orders combined witli
flic other factor my honourable friend has
pointed ouf the oxport of $550,000.000 worth
of whLe.,t and coarse grains-we steadily improved our position in forcign exebange balances with the United States, until at flic end
of the past, year fbey had increascd fo
$1,500.000.000.
As bonourable
members bave already
tiointeil ouf. that represen ts a grrat gain.
just as the 1939 figure of $400,000,000 shows a
relativelv strong position. If is nof, however,
as much stronger as flic differenco between
81.500.000.000 and S400,000,000 would sevi f0
indicate. It must be rcuîcmbered that tlhe flow
of Canadian securities purcbased by Amoricans bas been a one-way traffie, for under our

AUGUST 22, 1946
foreign exchange control agreement their
money must stay here, and it bas to an amount
of more than 3480,000,000. There is another
factor too. I do not know just exactly what
the position is in regard to the board, but
in addition to that American capital there are
the accumulated profits of American companies in this country to the very considerable
sum of $263,000,000. That is an offset to this
apparent strength. Nevertheless, thanks I
believe to our foresight, we are in a very
strong liquid position as regards our holdings
of foreign exchange.
Now, honourable senators, with the amendments which are contemplated, we are proposing to extend this machinery for a period
of more than two years. Let us review the
probable position in the future. I appreciate
the argument of the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) that the war
is over. But the effects of the war are not
over by any means. I suggest to honourable
senators that the situation Canada faces at
this moment is almost a deadly parallel in
the economic sense with that which prevailed
on the outbreak of war.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Right.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I hope we shall
have the wisdom to look ahead this time, and
not, as my honourable friend from TorontoTrinity suggests, throw the bill to the winds.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: He never said that
at all.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Inasmuch as the
Foreign Exchange Control Board now has
authority to carry on until sixty days after
the next session of parliament, and in view of
rapidly changing world-conditions not only
in regard to currency but everything else, why
the hurry to pass this bill? Why not defer it
until next session?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I will come to
that.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: May I ask a question?
Does not the honourable leader of the government realize that the amendment of the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity proposes that parliament extend to the Governor
in Council the authority to continue the
existing powers, control and regulations of the
Foreign Exchange Control Board until the end
of next session? In view of that how can he
say that the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity would "throw the bill to the
winds"?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I referred to the
remarks of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity the other day on the motion

un

to have the subject matter referred to the
Banking and Commerce Committee. He saidand he will correct me if I am wrong-that he
had as .much information as he wanted on the
subject and would take action at once. He was
not very much concerned about details, because he was opposed to foreign exchange
control in any way, shape or form. If I have
misrepresented what he said I will certainly
make a withdrawal; but I thought he was
thoroughly consistent, and I admired him for it.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I had better state my
position. I do not rise to object to my honourable friend saying I would "throw this bill to
the winds," but I think he should have mentioned certain qualifications. I am opposed to
control. But control is now in effect. The
proposal I made was that this bill be thrown
to the winds-if you like to use that picturesque language-and the order in council continued for a time. One should always get out
of a position slowly rather than rapidly and
drastically. Accordingly I was prepared to
allow the order in council to remain in force
so that these controls might be removed in a
natural and orderly way. That is the effect of
my present amendment. But my honourable
friend the leader has not misrepresented my
position in general: I am opposed to this kind
of interference with trade.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Well, to the
extent that I may have misrepresented my
honourable friend I am very happy to withdraw anything I said.
I want to point out to honourable senators
that our position today, as at the outbreak of
war, is relatively strong. There is another
parallel between then and now in that today
those in authority again anticipate a large
difference on current account between our
exports to and imports from the United States;
although, mark you, honourable senators, for
the fiscal year just ended we are almost in
balance. The figures which my honourable
friend gave of our total purchases in the
United States were absolutely right. There
was a time when we had an annual deficit of
from $300,000,000 to $400,000,000. That has
gradually decreased until in 1945 there was
only a difference of about $6,000,000-imports
and exports almost in balance. That position
is eneouraging today, just as the relative position was encouraging before the war. And
if we took no thought of the morrow we
might say, "Our current balance position is
good, 1945 is a wonderful showing. Don't let
us do anything about it."
Now, what has happened already? For the
first six months of this year that position is
entirely reversed; there is a deficit of over

716

SENATE

$222,000,000. There is nothing very strange
about that, because current conditions almost
parallel those in the early days of the war.
The great purchasing power of ýthe Canadian
people makes an ever-increasing demand for
goods. The fact that the price level has gone
up raises the quantity of goods to a higher
level. On the other hand, while we have
tremendously increased our production of
goods, that production is partly utilized, as
during ;the war years, for our increased consumption, but more particularly as the result
of trade agreements entered into, by which
we agreed to supply goods to England and
.the continent of Europe to the amount of
$2,000,000,000. There is the channeling of a
tremendous quantity of our production across
the Atlantic, just as there vas during the war
but, thank God, for a much better purpose.
With our dollar on a parity with the
American dollar, the desire of American companies to refund their bond issues in Canada,
despite the fact that we have restrictive controls on capital movement, may well reduce
this $1,500,000,000 to some $600,000,000 or
$750,000,000.
My honouîrable friend says,
"But that is still ample." Yes, assuming that
control remains. What if it does net? That
is a verv grave question. Hadi there been no
control, 1 suppose no one will be able to
determine what might have happened so far as
the wi thdrawal of American capital in the
early stage of war is concerned. We hope
that nothing would have happened. I believe that because during the war we had the
foresight to provide against these situations,
and today are contemplating doing the same
again, American investors will have even
greater confidence in Canada. So it may never
be neces-sary to invoke the restrictions on the
withdrawal of capital.
Ne man can say with any certainty in the
perplexed condition of the world today that
the possibility does not exist. Under those
circumstances, honourable senators, it is
natural and logical for us to exercise the same
prudence and foresight now as we did at the
beginning of the war and, for the same
economic reasons.
The charge was made that the board is
unnecessarily cautions. Honourable senators,
who would say that they are not right in that?
Suppose that more favourable conditions than
we now anticipate do develop, that Britain
will be in a position to buy goods from us
and pay for them with U.S. dollars, or sterling
convertible into U.S. dollars, the result will
be that much the better for us. Suppose that
money unexpectedly flows across the border
into this country in such proportions that our
position will never be as serious as the chairHon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

man of the board suggested, the net result
is all to the good. In the meantime, by this
measure, we will have guarded against possible
effects the other way.
I think that is in keeping with ordinary
good business practice, and should appeal to
every sound business man in this country who
bears in mind the experiences of the war.
For argument's sake may I reverse the proposition? I listened in committec to the discussion of what happened in the past, of the
marvelous conditions that existed before the
war, when there was no forcign exchange
control, and of the conditions which might
arise in the future. As some honourable senalors pointed out, under order in council there
is authority te continue control.
Let us
assume that we operate under that authority
for another six months, and that at the end of
that period we do not have foreign exchange
control. What then? Let us look into the
future and the chances we might take.
lon. Mr. DAVIES: Would the honourable
senator permit a question? Could the foreign
exchange order in council net be continued as
long as the Governor in Council felt necessary,
and could net the control be exercised under
thti authority?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I think the question asked by the honourable senator is an
excs-lent one, and it brings to my mind a
feature I had intended to refer to and had
oerlooked.
Ilonourable senators will recall that during
tie war Great Britain and all the dominions
exercised some form of control over foreign
exchange. They were all alike in one respect,
that the control was effected by order in council under the War Measures Act. In Great
Britain, wlien the war was over, a year ago,
the emergency powers were extended for a
period of five years, and powers given under
order in council were continued. In Australia
the emergency powers have been continutied
under the Bank Act, and as an additional
mieans of controlling foreign exchange, authority bas been given to direct what shall be
exported from and imported into that country.
Reflecting the spirit voiced by the onourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
and the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) the people of
this country, through their members of parliament, have said in no uncertain manner that
they want to see the end of government by
orders in council as quickly as possible. They
said in effect: "We will not extend the War
Measures Act, but we will continue some of
the lesser powers under a new act to be called
the National Emergency Transitional Powers
Act, which will mean that the government

AUGUST 22, 1946
lias got to get to work. You must go througli
your ordeî's in council, make up your mind
wliich ones you are going to raquire and let
the othars lapse." The governrnent then liad
to corne to parliament and put its needs down
ini black and white, su that the people of the
country could raview them.
Hon. Mr. HORNER: May I ask a question? Why was tliis blli not introduced two
months earlier in the session?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The minister in
committee told us tliat the government liad
intended introducing this bill last session, but
that owing to pressure of work it was hald
over. He announced last Mardi that it was
to bie introduced this session. It was given no
priority, lut wvas presented in tlie House of
Commons on June 7tli, over two months ago.
Tliat it did flot corne to this house more
expeditiously is the result of a condition about
wliich we have alwvays complained-that tliese
measures remain in tlie otlier place too long
and corne here too late in tlie session.
The people have demanded that the government corne out from. behind the curtain of
legisiation by orders in council, and put the
laws in the statute books. In effect they said
te, the govarnrnent, "We are giving you a
year to do it." The Ernergency Transitional.
Powers Act providad that these powers should
continue until the end of the year, if parliament met in November or Pacember; otherwisa until fifteen days after thc opeuing of tic
next session. As honourable senators know,
an arndment has been proposed to extend
the perbod to sixty days after the opening of
the naxt session of parliarnent.
The government must decide wiat orders i
council passed under the War Measures Act
are now required, and allow the others to lapse.
The policy lias been to look to future requiremants, and to put the provisions contained
bu orders in council into statutory forrn. The
provisions embodied in the veterans legisiation passed in this house recently ware previously contained in regulations authorizesi
by orders in council. These orders in council
were tabled inl thîs house from. time to tima,
and were available to averyone who wanted
to see them. The publicity this bill has
received and the opposition which it lias met
justify the government in acceding to the
public damand that such measures be brought
before parliament s0 that it rnay decide
whethar the authority will be continued or
not.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Will the honourable
leader permit a question? Is tiare not a diff erance, betwaen placing in the statutes veterans
legisiation, which is of a permanent nature,

717

and a measure such as this, which we hope
wili last oniy a few years? It occurs to mne,
and I know it is in the minds of many others,
that the putting of the provisions of orders
in council into statutory formi gives them a
permanency. That is tlie feature we are trying
to get away fromn in this bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I know of only
two methods of legislating. If parliamnent
had said to the government, "Do flot bring in
any details at ail and we will extend these
powers for five years", this measure would
neyer corne before us. My friand and I would
then have to operate under the presant regulations, and be subject to just as many inconveniences as during the past seven years.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Why bring the
bill in now?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: At this session?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Because the government lias to decicle what measures it wjll
deal witli. Honourable senators must realize
that there will lie a great volume of business
at the nex't session. In the opinion of the
govarnment this is one measure that it will
lie necessary to continue after the end of
March 1947, which is the deadline under existing conditions. Under the circumstances it
lias decided to go ahead with this bill and get
it out of tlie way. If tliere is not sufficient tirne
n0w to, properly consider it, as my honourable
friand suggests, it will presumably corne up
at the next session with ail the other business.
It may be that we will tlien have more time
to consider it; but from the littie I know of
parliamentary procedure I predict there wil
lie less time next session. Tliis billlias already
beau hefore parliament for a period of more
tlian sixty days wlien the Speech from the
Throne was lot heing discussed. I asic my
honourable friand who sits in the seat of the
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne) how
murli tima we are likaiy to have for this measure next session after we have disposed of the
Speech fromn the Throna and deait wîth al
the amergency legîsiation that will resuit fromi
the conversion of orders in counecil te, statutory
lagisiation.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: 1 arn bold
anougli to say that if I were the Prime Minister, sitting in another place, I wouid give this
bull precedence, over ail other bills.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That would all
have to be done hefore the deadhine. However,
this is mere speculation.
Hon.,Mr. MeGEER: Would it ba improper
to suggest that aIl those veterans buis were

718

SENATE

deait with as though they were one bill, and
that they passed the other house in a very
short time, and took only a few minutes in
this chamber?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I was replying to
a pertinent question as to why the government did not ]eave this control measure in
order-in-council form, at least for the present.
I arn sure my honourable friend realizes that
at the end of a certain period t.he measure
would either have to be dropped or converted
into statutory legisiation.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: May I ask whether
this bill, in its urgency, has any relation te, a
sirnilar bill in the Parliament of the United
IÇingclom? The Governor of the Bank of
Canada, Mr. Towers, rather surpriseci me
when he saici he had been informed that a
silnilar bill was about to be pa.ssed in the
United Kingdom parliarnent. Have any communications passed between this parliament
and that of the United Kingdom with reference ýto -the kind of legisiation we are now
considering? Is there anything of that nature
which would create this extraordinary and
unusual urgency?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As far as I know
there is nothing of 'the nature suggestecl by
my honourable friend. I rnay say, however,
that we have been so successful in legislation
of this kind that from -tirne to tirne both the
United I(ingdorn and the United States have
copied what we have done, and I have no
douht they will follow in this instance.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have flot the
slightest doubt that they migbt consider it in
this case as well.
Nom-, wbat would be our position if we had
no contrais at ail? No one will suggest that if
w e abolished aIl controls the world w'ould
corne to an end.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:
the goverrument would.

But probably

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Perhaps so, but
let us corne hack to the question before us.
Wc are told that even with restricted control
on the withdrawai of capital from this country,
the likclihood is that our presont reserve will
be reduced by half, that is, by sornethiing like
$750 ,000,000.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: How much would that
leave?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: $750,000,000. But
the question is, witb no control whatever over
the withdrawal of capital, what miglit happen?
Nobody can prophcesy what actually will hapHon. Mr. McGEER.

pen. We can only play sale by trying to guard
against what mighit bappen.
Remember, as
cornpared with pre-war days, there are additional holdings by American companies of
S500.00-0,000 of negotiable securities in this
country, and thero are $230,000,000 of profits
accumoulated by Arnerican companies in this
country during the war. Now that the Arnerican
dollar is no longer at a prcmium in this
country, suppose thora were a serious witbdrawal of capital. T'hat kind of thing bas
happcned before. As my honourabie friend
from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. MeGeer)
pointed out, the supply of our Arnerican dollars
miglit dwindle to such a, point that there
wouid ho competit ion to get thern. ýOn a free
rnarket the price of the Canadian dollar might
drop five, ton or flfteen par cent beiow the
price of the Amarican dollar. He went on to
say that in time a situation of that kind is
corrected by the law of supply and dernand.
Discount on our currency is virtually an additional tariff which tends to decrease our
imports. The man taking capital out of the
country at a discount of 15 or 20 pcr cent,
whatever it rnay ba, gets tirod of doing that,
and decides to leave boere what ho has. Irnporters buy less and exporters sali more.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Can the bonourable
gentleman state a single reason why within
the noxt two yoars Amorican invostors should
lose confidence in the Dominion of Canada?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: He lias not said that.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Give me one reason.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I can give no
spocifie reason, but I would suggest that foresigbt is as desirable in the conduct of public
affairs as in the conduet of private affairs.
And I suggest that confidence in the country
is inspired by the knowledge that sornebody
is in control of foreign exebange today.
Hon. Mr. MoGEER:

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I did not interrupt my honourabie friand. He has made
ipeeches enough.
s
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: He is going to make
some more.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is bis privilege, but I arn trying to make one now and
ha should allow me to go ahead without
interruption.
Lot us look at the difference between our
presont situation and that of pre-war days.
We have agreed withi other nations to try to
stabilizo exehange in order to encourage international trade.
Hon. Mr. HOW'ARD:

Hear, hear.

AUGUST 22, 1946
International
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
trade, in my humble opinion, is vitally necessary for the peace and prosperity of the world
today. and there is no country for which
it is more necessary than Canada. It is only
natural that we were among the first to collaborate in a world effort to free the channels
of international trade. Traditionally there
have been two obstacles to international
trade: first, violent fluctuations of exchange
rates; and, secondly, quotas and tarifs. The
International Monetary Fund, set up at the
Bretton Woods conference, was designed to
maintain some stability in international exchange; and in due course there is to be a
world conference which will deal with the
other factor, namely, quotas and tariffs.
We are members of the International Monetary Fund. Now let us see what would
happen if we dispensed with all control over
the withdrawal of capital, and the value of
our currency in relation to United States
currency fel1 considerably. In pre-war days,
when we were under no such obligations as
we now are, that would not have been of
much importance, because when the rate fell
low enough certain forces would come into
effect and cause it to swing back again. But
our membership in the International Monetary Fund makes a difference. Article 14,
section 4 (a) of the agreement states:
Each member undertakes to collaborate with
the fund to promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange arrangements with other
members, and to avoid competitive exchange
altérations.
That is what we have agreed to do so long
as we remain a member of the fund-and I
take it honourable senators, that there is not
much difference of opinion as to the desirability of our remaining and contributing to
the worthy objectives of the fund. Now,
suppose we abolished exchange control and the
value of our dollar in relation to the American
dollar fell so low that we found it necessary
to appeal to the fund for assistance. We
might be met with this reply: "You are in a
bad situation, but you did not attempt to do
what you agreed to do."
Hon. Mr. McGEER: When we have one
billion five hundred million dollars in gold
and United States currency?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If we got into
that situation the fund could say to us: "You
did not do what you agreed to do. We
expected you to exercise ordinary foresight,
as you did under war conditions." Indeed,
they could go further and refer us to another
63268-47

section in the agreement-I will give the reference, because lawyers like to have this information-article 6, section 3, which provides:
Members may exercise such controls as are
necessary to regulate international capital movements.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: May I ask one question?
Hon. .Mr. ROBERTSON: Will the honourable gentleman please not interrupt me?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
ahead.

All right; go

Hon. Mr. McGEER: How could it possibly
become necessary for Canada to appeal to the
Bretton Woods institution for assistance within
the next two years, when today we have one
billion five hundred million of gold and
United States dollars, and we are told by the
expert who wants to have this bill passed that
there is no danger of our losing more than
haif of that sum at the most?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is, if this
bill is passed. My honourable friend knows
what was said. Why does he endeavour to
give the house incomplete information? Will
my honourable friend contain himself for a
minute or two? The International Monetary
Fund could reasonably say to us: "We cannot
give you help, for that is not one of our purposes. You yourselves will have to get out of
the position that you got into. We would
like you to stay as a member of this fund,
but you will have to put your house in order
without delay."
What then would we do? When we were in
a situation of that kind before, we borrowed
money in the United States, and we might
again try to borrow from private sources,
such as banking institutions, in that country.
But, mind you, such a serious situation might
have developed that private sources would not
lend to us, and it might finally be necessary
for Canada to do what so many other coun-tries have already done, namely, ask the
Congress of the United States for a loan.
I have the greatest respect for the Congress,
and I feel certain that if we ever got into
financial difficulties it would assist us. But
I hope it may never become necessary for
us to ask it for assistance. I may say, honourable senators, that one of the things of which I
feel most proud-and I believe my pride in this
respect is shared by Canadians generally-is
that we in this country, despite the tremendous
obligations we assumed, have been able þy
foresight to maintain so strong a position that
we alone, of all the United Nations, are the

720

SENATE

one which has not got or does not hope
to get a loan from the United States Congress.
And, what is more, we have given considerable.
assistance to other countries.
This legislation, together with the amendments which we contemplate, and the continuance of 'the administration, which has been the
same for seven years, will constitute a reasonable guarantee that we shall never be placed
in any humilitating position, and should be a
source of satisfaction to everyone in this
country. I am glad to think that those in
control are exercising the same foresight in
these respects as they did during the war, and
for my part I feel that the pa'ssing of this
legislation is a means to accomplish the same
purpose. I should feel very much more confident about the future if this legislation were
passed, and ordinary foresight exercised,
than I would if we were careless about the
matter and trusted ta luck. I believe that
every honourable member on careful consideration will share my opinion.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I wish to ask the
honourable leader a question.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: It is six o'clock.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Go on.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: His very eloquent
speech was of course an argument to justify
the passing of this measure for permanent
control. Is he in favour of limiting the application of the bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I am.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT moved adjournment
of the debate.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators, in
the temiporary absence of the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert),
who adjourned the debate, may I be permitted
to say a few words?
If this measure had been voted upon when
it first carne before us for second reading, I
should most certainly have been among those
opposing it. One of my objections to it was
that it had been brought here at a stage of the
session wben it could not possibly receive the
consideration it deserved. My second objection was that it proposed to incorporate as
part of our permanent statutes a system of
control to which I could net com-pletely subscribe. And finally, I shared the view expressed
by the honouruble senator from Churchill
and the Honourable
(Hon. Mr. Crerar)
senator from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
MeGeer) that it seemed to offend all of the
fundamental principles of freedom and, shall
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

I say, of the Liberalism ta which, as long as I
can remember, I have given my personal
allegiance.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Liberalism spelled
with a small "1"?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: With a capital "L".
In the last-mentioned respect it seemed to
me that the bill was the best possible illustration of the growing and objectionable tendency
in government circles to concentrate tremendous power in the hands of a coterie of senior
civil servants. It appeared to me to be the
kind of thing about which Lord Chief Justice
Hewart protested most vigorously in a work
published some ten years ago, The New
Despotism, in which he dealt with the ruling
of the lives of the people by boardks, commissions and departments.
Along with all honourable senators who sit
on this side of the house-and, I should like to
think with all honourable senators who sit
on the opposite side-I entertain strong objections as a matter of fundamental principle, to
that sort of thing. I subscribe whole-heartedly
to all the complaints which have been so
eloquently voiced against this measure by the
honourable senators from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
McGeer) and Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck).
But the subject-matter was referred to our
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce for consideration, and I had the privilege of attending the sittings of that committee and of hearing what was said in
support of the measure; and while still opposed
to the type of thing which this bill represents
-that is, the delivery to a small specified
group of civil servants, or to any group, of the
control of the every-day economic life of this
country-I must recognize that, as I ventured
to state at the sitting of the committee last
evening, we live under a system of legislation
by persuasion. After listening to the evidence
of the Honourable the Acting Minister of
Finance and of the Governor of the Bank of
Canada, and having heard them very ably
cross-examined, particularly by the honourable
gentleman from Vancouver-Burrard, I found
myself reposing, shall I say, in a substantial
area of doubt as to whether or not at the
present time a measure of foreign exchange
control is necessary.
I think that in consideration of all matters which come before them all honourable
members of this chamber as well as those of
the other bouse, try to bring to bear the best
endeavour of their conscience. I went to the
sittings of this committee violently opposed to
this measure. As I have already said, had the

AUGUST 22, 1946
vote been taken before the subject matter was
referred to the committee I would have voted
against the bill. So I could not be considered
as in any way friendly to the principle of the
bill or readily seducible by the advocacy of
the "merchants of fear", as they have been
described by the honourable gentleman from
Toronto-Trinity.
I must honestly acknowledge that when the
committee's long sittings were completed I
still could not say positively to myself that a
measure-a measure, I repeat-of foreign
exchange control was not necessary at the
present time in the interest of this country.
If honourable senators will concede the
fact that I am trying to reach a conclusion as
honestly as I can, I should like to say to
them that I found myself weighing the practical advantages and disad.vantages of the
rejection of this bill. When I reached that
stage of analysis in my own thinking I was
compelled to recognize that we have today,
entirely independently of this bill, a foreign
exchange control by virtue of order in council.
Then I said to myself, that in view of the
existence of this order in council, even if the
bill is now rejected we still are going to have
foreign exchange control until some time after
the beginning of the next session. If at that
time the government is of the considered view
that foreign exchange control should continue,
along with other measures of emergency controls, it will come to parliament and ask forindeed, shall I say, demand-an extension of
the National Emergency Transitional Powers
Act; and in my humble opinion parliament
will not be able to refuse. If I am right in
that premise, then automatically the existing
foreign exchange control order will be
extended for at least another year.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: By order in council?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Yes. That will take
us into 1948. Now, what will happen after
the first of January, 1948, I cannot predict
with any degree of certainty. Having regard
to the unsettled state of world affairs, which
necessarily is reflected in our own internal
situation, I think it is not unreasonable to
suggest that the government may be justified
-indeed, required to come back to parliament in 1948 and ask for a further extension
of the Emergency Transitional Powers Act.
And if even only one further extension of
that legislation were granted, we would
have foreign exchange control continuing
until probably 1949, entirely beyond the
direct supervision of this parliament.
I do not want to see foreign exchange control continue without limitation as to time.
Therefore it seems to me that from the
63268-47J

721

practical point of view the question is this:
Is it better to pass this measure in statutory form after limiting its life to a definite
period, or to reject the measure and risk
having foreign exchange control extended
indefinitely by order in council?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: May I ask the honourable senator a question? If we pass this
measure, and if the National Emergency
Transitional Powers Act is continued from
year to year as he suggests, then even though
we limit the life of this measure to, say,
some time in 1948, immediately upon its
expiry could not the government re-enact it
under the Emergency Transitional Powers
Act?
Hon. Mr. HARMER: It would have to
come before parliament.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No. The government
would have the power under that act.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Mr. Speaker, we are
unable to hear what is being said.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As I understand it, my
honourable friend from Churchill in the question he has just put to me has wrapped up a
statement of the very principle upon which I
am basing my argument.
Hon. -Mr. HAIG: Pardon me, on this side
we were unable to hear what the question was.
Hon. Mýr. CRERAR: I will state the question again. sMy honourable friend says that
by passing this bill and limiting its life to a
definite period we can determine when foreign exchange control will end, whereas if we
do not pass the bill but from time to time
extend the life of the National Emergency
Transitional Powers Act, the government by
virtue of the authority given to it under that
act will be able to continue foreign control
indefinitely. My point is this. If we did pass
this measure, subject to a time limit of, say,
two years, and if the National Emergency
Transitional Powers Act were extended for,
say, five years, then on the expiry of this measure the government could have recourse to
the National Emergency Transitional Powers
Act for continuing foreign exchange control.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I am grateful for the
interruption which came from the honourable
leader opposite (Hon. Mr. Haig) because,
frankly, I did not understand the question. Not
having the experience in legislative matters
which the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hbn. Mr. Crerar) has enjoyed:, I would not
venture to predict what may be required two
or three years from now. AI that I have been
saying is that should this bill fail to be enacted,
under the terms of the existing order in coun-

cil the government would be able to continue
foreign exchange control, assuming of course
that the National Emergency Transitional
Powers Act will be further extended next
session, which I suggest is a reasonable
assumption.
Let us concede for a moment that the
National Emergency Transitional Powers Act
will net be further extended next session. The
only result of the rejection of this measure in
some form-and, mind you, I do not agree
with its present form-would be that it would
have to be reintroduced next session.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: What harm
w'ould it do if the legislation had to bc enacted
at the next session of parliament? The controls would be in effect until sixty days after
parliament convened.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I acknowledge to the
honourable senator from Alma (Hon. Mr.
that that was my original
Ballantyne)
approach to the bill. I argued to myself that
there was no reason for passing it at this
late stage of the session when the powers
sought by it could be continued by order in
councilHon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: -and that it would be
reasonable to suggest to the government that
it allow the bill to stand over until the beginning of next session and then, if necessary,
introduce it in this chamber se that it might
he dealt with expeditiously. However, the
ievecerse side of the coin is that to continue
foreign currency control by order in council
ma' be te continue it indefinitely, and that
is a feature I do net like. I am opposed to
iis type of control, and I do net want to
see it as a part of our law beyond a definitely
set period.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I am sorry te
interrupt my honourable friend's remarks. At
first he was of the opinion that the bill could
be deferred until next session and sixty days
afterwards, and that the government could, if
necessary, bring down the bill again. Now he
says, "Oi no, that would have te bc done by
o:der in council." But he does not like it
to be done by order in counrcil. I cannot
follow his argument.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Having regard to what
tie ionourable gentleman has said, I recognize that I have net made myself clear. It
has been explained with some measure of
force tiat thre may net bc time for the
government to eiact this measure within sixty
dai
after tlie commîîienement of next session.
If tiere shouihl be failire to enact it in statutory form witiin that sixty day period, the

government would be obliged to have recourse
to the National Emergency Transitional
Powers Act in order to extend the control. My
respectful suggestion is that to drive the
government into such a course would inevitably lead to an undefined extension of this type
of control to which I strongly object. I would
murh sooner see an act of parliament which in
effect says: "Yeu, the Foreign Exchange Control Board, shall have these powers for a
definite period of time, and on and after such
and such a date those powers shall expire,
unless parliament in its good judgment shall
specifically extend them." I submit that that
is the situation which honourasble senators
should consider, particularly those who are
dcesirous of unburdening our people of this
type of control. In my judgment it becomes
a question of the time within which the country can be relieved of this control.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: What is the honourable
gentleman's view on the suggestion made by
the leader of the government, that the operation of the act should be extended to Decamber 3,1, 1947, instead of December 31, 1948?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I was coming to thatHon. Mr. HAIG: All right.
interruption.

Pardon my

Hon. Mr. BENCH: -but I am grateful to
the honourable gentleman for having raised
the specific point. I propose giving my
acquiescence to the second reading of this
bill, but upon certain specific conditions, one
of which relates to the length of time this
control should survive. Personally, as I now
view the matter, I do net think this legislation should extend into 1949. I think it should
hope, a permanentdie a natural-I
death before December 31, 1948. My first
impression was that it would be reasonable to
enact the legislation for a tera of one year.
But after hearing the evidence in the Banking
and Commerce Committee, I came to the
conclusion that periaps a year was not a sufficiently long period within which to test
whether or net the control should be further
continued. I rather anticipate that if we gave
it only a year's test, at the end of that time
these gentlemen from the Bank of Canada
and the Foreign Exchange Control Board would
come to us saying: "We Pave not had suffcient experience under peacetime conditions
upon which to found an opinion as to whether
or not a further extension of this measure is
necessary." So. reluctantly, I had to conclude
that the period should extend to two years.
But I do net think it should go beyond that.
Subject to what may be argued in committee
at a later stage, my own idea is that the life

AUGUST 22, 1946
of this measure should end with the last day
of the session of 1948. That would give it
virtually two years of life, during which time
the government could gain additional experience as regards the need of foreign exchange
control, and upon that experience parliament
could then pass its judgment as to whether the
operation of the act should be still further
extended.
The honourable leader bas stated that the
government would consider-and, I assume,
would favourably consider-a time limitation
being put upon the life of the bill. Presumably the bill, if it gets second reading, will
go back to our Banking and Commerce Committee, where there will be written into it a
section definitely providing a date upon which
the act shall expire. On that point alone, it
seems to me that those of us who have been
violently opposed to this measure-and I am
one of them-have had complete success. In
that concession-if it is a concession-we have
won the substance of our fight, and my respectful submission is that in arguing now for the
hoisting of this measure for six months we are
only arguing over the shadow, the simple fact
of the matter being that, whether we pass
this bill or net, the country for many months
to come is going to have foreign exchange
control by order in council.
There are other details of the bill with
which I am in disagreement. For instance,
there is the provision that the Minister of
National Revenue may hand over to this board
information from the income tax returns of
individual taxpayers. While I believe that that
provision actually appears in the present order
in council, it revolts my concept of what heretofore has been the confidential treatment
accorded to income tax returns. I cite that
merely as one instance of a provision in this
legislation which I would want deleted. Then
of course there is the circumstance, so well
pointed out in committee, that this measure as
now framed bears very heavily upon the individual who may have a dollar, or five dollars,
or ten dollars of United States currency in his
pocket. I have heard some examples given of
the hardship caused to various individuals
through the exercise of this and other powers
by the Foreign Exchange Control Board.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Mostly under war
conditions.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Yes, almost entirely
under war conditions. But notwithstanding
that, I think that in certain respects the
board has been very unreasonable in the enforcement of the provisions of the order. When
the honourable gentleman from Churchill was
citing the instance of the truck operator I

723

was reminded of a taxi-driver in my home
city, St. Catharines, who received a ten-dollar
American bill in payment for a trip, and put
it away in a small compartment in his
wallet.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Not in his shoe?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: No, not in his shoe.
A day or two afterwards he took on a fare to
drive him across the Niagara River to the
state of New York, a matter of only ten miles,
entirely forgetting that he had the American
currency in his wallet-which I suggest in the
circumstances is quite understandable. He
proceeded -across the border at Queenston,
Ontario, intending to enter the United States
at Lewiston, New York. The customs officer
accosted him and asked what exchange he
was carrying. He answered that he was
carrying thus and so, not disclosing that he
had the ten-dollar American bill in his wallet.
The customs officer thereupon required him to
submit to a search, and the taxi-man produced
among other things his wallet. The customs
officer, having gone through it with the long
fingers that customs officers have, found the
ten-dollar bill and charged the taxi-man with
wilfully refusing to disclose the circumstance
that he had the money on his person. The
man protested that he was innocent of any
such wilful non-disclosure; nevertheless, he
was hailed before a police magistrate and
fined. I do not recall the exact amount of
the penalty, but in the circumstances it was
substantial.
Hon. Mr. HARMER: Was the American
money confiscated?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: According to the report made to me, it certainly was confiscated.
The taxi-driver complained bitterly; he was
convinced that he had been the victim of injustice. It is the continuation of that sort of
thing which I hope may be prevented under
this legislation.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Do you believe the
story that he had a ten-dollar bill and forgot
about it?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I most assuredly do.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Well I don't.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: This is not the first
time that I have failed to convince the honourable gentleman from Parkdale.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Let us have a little
less bunk, like the thousand-dollar bill in the
shoe which the fellow forgot about. We need
somebody to maintain a timely supervision
over some of us.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I hope I have not
offended the sensibilities of the honourable
gentleman from Parkdale in my remarks about
the ten-dollar bill. I had no desire to annoy
him.
To return to the merits of the measure, it is
my humble opinion, based on what the honourable leader of the government has indicated,
that the Senate has won a fight for the right
je connection with this measure.
An Hon. SENATOR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: If it is limited as to
time, that is all that really matters. I cannot vote in favour of the motion, which in
effect is the six months hoist, because I believe
that in doing so I would simply be running
around in a circle-we would still have foreign
exchange control.
Now may I speak directly to the amendment proposed by the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity? As I understand it, he is
asking that this measure be deferred for consideration to the next parliament, and that
in the meantime, by some special measure of
this parliament, the Governor in council be
authorized to ratify a continuance of the
powers of the Foreign Exchange Control
Board. I cannot quite follow how that proposal squares with the honourable senator's
declared opposition to any control of this
kind whatsoever. In my opinion it would be
preferable to give this bill second reading and
refer it to committee for the purpose of having
some of the objectionable features deleted.
We should provide a floor below which its
provisions should not apply, and limit its life
to a reasonable period of time.
On the assumption that the treatment I
suggest will be accorded the bill in committee,
I am prepared to vote for the second reading.
If it fails to get that treatment in committee,
I will most certainly vote against third reading. For the reasons given, I must vote
against the amendment.
Hon. JOHN T. HAIG: Honourable senators, I do not intend to take much time at
this stage of the debate. I would only be
voicing a truism if I said that the Canadian
people as a class are violently opposed, to all
con-trols. They resent this control system,
lock, stock and barrel. A great deal of credit
should go to the boards, which during the
war have done so much-and I am not
detracting from that-but, fundamentally our
people do not like controls anywhere.
I say quite candidly that my objection is
not directed to this particular control alone.
There are others that I hate much more. It is
the principle that does not satisfy me. Yet I
recognize the problems the government has to
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

face in these changing times. I suggested in
committee this morning that the government
should fix some limitation as to time. I favour
the end of the session of 1948-and I adhere
strictly to that position. In the committee we
heard a very able cross-examination of Mr.
Towers by the honourable member from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. MeGeer), and I
could not fail to appreciate that Mr. Towers
was putting up a pretty good defence. I do
not propose to go into the details, for if I were
to do so I would spend too much time talking
about where controls have landed us. I attempted a year ago to get this house to realize
what rent control meant to building conditions
in this country. Having won the support of
only one member on the other side of the
house, I failed utterly at that time, and conditions now are just as bad as they were a
year ago.
As to the bill before us, the members on this
side of the house have honestly tried to reach
a conclusion that will be in the best interests
of Canada,,and we have agreed to vote for the
bill provided we have sorne assurance that the
controls will end with the session of 1948. J
listened with keen interest to the remarks of
the honourable senator from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bench). I have always admired his legal
mind, and even though the conclusion he has
reached is different from mine, I am of the
opinion that hie should b Chief Justice in one
of the provinces instead of a senator, because
he does not like the rough and tumble of this
house. But the only one who can give us the
assurance we ask is the honourable gentleman
who sits opposite me (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
I asked him for such an assurance in committee. He bas made an able address today,
but the assurance has not been forthcoming.
I do not like the proposal for the extension of
power to sixty days after the opening of the
next session. I would prefer the six months'
hoist. If the other house were to send another measure to us we vould be confronted
with the same problem. W'e would be consenting to all the controls.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That is right.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: That is one thing I do not
want to see. My party, and I share its view,
is against controls. We recognize the responsibility the government is carrying on, but we
also recognize that after the hast election it had
a majority in the house, and that controls
played a part in that election. We appreciate
that the government has had a relatively short
time to carry out its responsibilities in that
respect. However, we will not accept this bill
unless we are assured that its provisions will
end with the session of 1948. If in that session

AUGUST 22, 1946
the government can satisfy us that the measure
should be extended by statute for another
limited period, well and good.
I entirely agree with the honourable senator
from Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench) when he says
that government by order in council is bad.
Let the government put its measures on paper,
so that he who runs may read, and all may
understand what is being done. I agree with
him entirely in his opposition ta control by
civil servants. This morning in committee one
of these senior civil servants delivered a lecture
which made my blood, boil. That is the kind
of thing that we must not and will not stand
for in this country. The civil servant may be
ten times as clever as any man in this or the
other house, but the responsibility is ours.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: We come here with a very
definite responsibility, and we are accountable
for our actions. I agree with the honourable
senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler) that
we are not elected; but we are appointed by
a responsible government and under the constitution are obliged ta do certain things.
I wish the leader of the government could
give me the assurance I have asked for. If he
cannot, all I can say is, speaking for my associates, that we will vote for the amendment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, since the honourable leader opposite has
raised the question of assurance, I should make
myself clear. I should not like the house ta
feel that I have ignored his request.
In the Banking and Commerce Committee
the question of a time limit was discussed at
considerable length, and it was specified that
the limit should be the end of the first
session of parliament after December, 1948.
The matter was debated back and forth, and
I understood from the members of the committee, including the leâder opposite, that
that date was satisfactory. The Honourable
Mr. Abbott, Acting Minister of Finance, said
that he would consult the government in the
matter. He came back and said that the
government would be agreeable ta the date
suggested. About twenty minutes to three
this afternoon I heard for the first time that
there was a difference of opinion regard-ing
the time limit, and that 'some question had
been raised as ta whether we should go back
ta the government and tell them that the
committee, including the honourable leader
opposite, had changed its mind and asked
for another date.
Now, honourable senators, I have tried ta
be reasonable in this connection, and have
attempted, on behalf of the government, ta
meet any reasonable proposal to amend this

725

bill. If my honourable friend had objected
in committee, or had spoken earlier than a
few minutes before the house opened this
afternoon, I might again have consulted the
government on the point. I do not think
the position taken is very dignified. As far
as giving any guarantee, I can only say that
the government has shown a willingness ta
meet honourable senators.
The question before us is a difficult one,
and there may be other amendments that have
not been discussed. If - any honourable senators are dissatisfied with the bill as amended
in committee, they will have the right ta
vote against it on third reading. Surely if my
honourable friend feels that there is any need
at all for foreign exchange control, he will
agree that the bill should nat be thrown out
because of any question as to the suggested
time liait. No one can deny that for two
days there was no suggestion of any other
date than December, 1948. Nothing other
than that was suggested to me until a few
minutes before I came into the house. I cannot say that I have consulted with the government since. That would not be in accordance
with the fact, for I have been here constantly
ever since.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: May I interrupt on a
question of privilege? I asked the Acting
Minister of Finance what he would think of
limiting the life of the bill to the end of the
first session after the first of January, 1949.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: You asked him what
would be the attitude of the government if
such an amendment were made.
Hon. Mr. HAIG: Yes. I did not say I was
in favour of that date or any other. In asking
that question my idea was to suggest a date
sufficiently far ahead that he could nat say
to me, "That is too short; I could not consider that." I simply asked him the question.
The record will show that I never said- I was
for or against that date. I apologize ta the
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Robertson) if
I misled him in any way, for I had no such
intention. I will state quite candidly that I
voted for the reference ta committee with
some misgivings. When I put the question
ta the minister I wanted ta be sure of mentioning a date which would be far enough
ahead for him ta consider. Today, after consultation with our party, it has been decided
that the first of January, 1948, is the proper
date.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, I have a few observations ta make with
respect ta the amendment proposed by the
honourable member from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck). It seems ta me that

SENATE
substantially all the arguments so far advanced
in this chamber have been against the perpetuation of any form of rigid foreign exchange
control. I entirely agree with that point of
view. It is my hope, and the Chairman of
the Foreign Exchange Control Board said it
was his hope, that the day will come when
we can discontinue foreign exchange control
entirely. But judging by the arguments that
have been expressed here, I feel that very few
if any members of this honourable house would
be willing to vote today for the discontinuance
of foreign exchange control as at the end of
this session of parliament.

If we vote in favour of the amendment, the
foreign exchange control regulations made by
orders in council will continue in force. After
listening to what has been said here, I do not
think that honourable members would like to
have the present strict regulations of the
board continued.
The second way to answer the question is by
passing this bill, first amending it as we sec
fit. Control under the bill would not be as
stringent as it is under the existing orders in
council, and we could, if we deemed it necessary, limit the operation of the bill to a fairly
short period. Even for a short period of time
it is not necessary, in my opinion, to have

make clear that it is to be temporary. I
arn inclined to agree that the time limit
suggested by the honourable leader opposite
(Hon. Mr. Haig) would be sufficient for a
test of the bill in operation, and I ledl sure
that if at the expiration of that time the government of the day considered that the hile
of the measure sbould be extended, this honourable chamber would be agrecable to that.
I should not like to see the amendment
adopted and the bill thrown out. In committee we can amend the bill te ensure that
it embodies ahl the provisions we regard as
necessary and bas none that are objectionable, and in particular we can ensure that the
control will not be continued indefinitely.
I arn not at aIl concerned as to whetber or
not the government bas indicated any willingness to accept the time limit suggested by
the bonourable leader opposite.
We should make wbatever stipulation we
wisb as to 'time limait, and if it or any other
amendment is rejected by the other bouse,
the responsibility for such action will not be
ours. We should not inquire of the go vernment wbether any amendment proposed in
cornmittee is acceptable to it. This measure
sbould be dealt with in the same way as any
other. In committee we ought to be able to
make this a workable piece of legislation, and
so do away witb the necessity for the present
orders in council.
Hon. W. J. HUSHION: Honourable senators, as the seconder of the amendment, I
ehould like to say a word or two. I bave
read the bill carefully, and I bave followed
wbat bas been said about it in the Senate
and in. the Banking and Commerce Committee.
In discussing the bill wben the motion for
second reading was flrst before us, the honourable senator frorn Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) went into a lot of detail, and as be
proceeded be frequently referred to the extraordinary powers the bill would give to tbe
Foreign Exchange Control Board. I was mucb
irnpressed by bis remarks. Then there was a
most excellent speech by the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)-I conS'der it the best speech I bave beard in this
chamber in a long time. I listened witb close
attention also to what wus said by tbe bonoursible senator frorn Vancouver-Burrard (Hon.
Mr. McGeer).
,I arn not a lawyer or a banker, bonourable
senators, but an ordinary business man, and
in the committee I found it a littie bard to
comprebend this legisiation and the large
figures that were mentioned. However, what
caused me to second the amendment was an
answer made by Mr. Towers. He was asked
if it was necessary that this important billand it is important-be passed right now. He
6326"8-

727

said: "No, it is the wish of the minister that
the bill should be put through now." I think
it would be a shame to pass a bill of this
importance at this time, but apparently some
honourable members wish to do it. Personally, I arn very mucli surprised that some of
the lawyer-mernbers of this honourable seflate,
who started off by seeing nothing but danger
in this bill, sec another angle of it to-night.
I cannot quite follow this sudden and surprising change of view. Really, I arn astonished to sec how legal lights can wiggle around
any subj ect. Surely they must think the
ordinary man in tbe street is a fool. I would
like to ask honourable gentlemen on tl4is side
to be mindful that the people are flot quite
so soit as, apparently, they thought tbemn to be.
If this bill means what we think it does,
then it is only right that it should be thrown
back to the govern.ment for reconsideration.
We sbould be given plenty of tirne to study
a measure which confers such unlimited authority on the Foreign Excbange Control Board.
A bill of this magnitude should nlot be presented to us in the last hours of a dying
session. There is no occasion for hurry. The
Foreign Exchange Control Board can stili
operate under the order-in-council, and the
government will have a year and sixty days
within which to prepare a satisfactory bill.
This would give the people of Canada time
to know something about the details of the
proposed legislation. I could tell you about a
lot of fellows whose -business bas been crippled
by these controls. Let me remind the mernbers of this honourable bouse that it is not
tbey alone wbo will bave the worry and
tribulation incident to tbe operation of this
bill; tbe children of our cbildren will carry
the burden of tbese controls. So let us get
this thing rigbt at the start.
I hope tbose honourable senators who had
nlot the opportunity of listening te tbe speech
delivered by the bonourable gentleman froni
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) will read the
report of it in tbe Senate Hansard. Tbe spirit
of Liberalism runs tbrough that speech, and
it is timely that we should be reminded 'of
wbat that word means. 1 congratulate the
honourable gentleman on his very fine contribution to this debate.
I repeat, I sec no reason for rushing this
bill tbrough, adding an amendment here and
an amendmçnt there. Let it go back from
where it came; let the Acting Minister of
Finance prepare a suitable measure and present
it to this house, and I arn sure it will be
treated properly. The honourable leader has
urged that the bill be given second reading,
and that it would not have this or that effect.

SENATE

I stili say the bill should be thrown back, so
that it may be revised and introduced in
proper form.
Honourable members, I have tried to say
a lot in a few minutes. I arn not like some
who talk often and long. I have tried to say
as plainly and as briefly as I can what I mean.
Once more I submit that it does flot behoove
this house to rush through so important a
bill to please anyhody, and it should not be
donc.
I therefore have much pleasure in
seconding the amendment, and I hope it wilI
receive your favourable consideration.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Question!

Hon. NORMAN P. LAMBERT: Honourable senators, within the space of a few
minutes I should like to summarize the position of this bill as I see it, and in doing so I
hope 1 shail not be deemed guilty of repetition if I emphasize some of the points raised
by my honourable friend from Lincoln (Hon.
Mr. Bench). I regret I was not in my seat
when hie rose to speak.
I think the issue before this bouse on the
amendment moved ýby the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) is
not 50 much exehange control as the element
of permanency in the bill. This bouse
embarked upon a certain course of action
when it established a precedent hy referring
the subject-matter to the Committee on Banking and Commerce before giving the bill
second reading. Wbcn the question was discussed and decided upon it was quite competont for the Sonate to hiave taken the action
which my honourable fricend from TorontoTrinity now proposes. The honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) also had
tbe opportunity to insist that the subjectmatter be flot referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee before second reading
of the bill.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I was flot in the house
at the time.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I remember that in
his speech he said he thouglit the bill should
be rcjected.
is position then was the same
as it is tonigbt. After the committee had been
in session tbe bonourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity moved an amendment and
took a strong position on the subject-and he
does stili. I do not quarrel with hlm. I merely
want to direct attention to the logic of the
present situation. This house decided to refer
the subjecet-matter to the Banking and Commerce Committee for consideration before
second reading of the bill. In adopting that
course the Senate acted wisely. As a resuit of
Hon. Mr. IIUSHION.

the discussion before the Banking and Commeýrce Committee this week we are ail a great
deal better informed on the bill today.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: In that connection
I gladly pay my tribute to the honourable
senator from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
MeGeer) for enlightening us on many pointa
of the bill. But having foltowed that course,
and tbe committee now reporting in favour of
the bill being given second reading subi ect
to certain conditions, I tbink logically and
morally we are almost bound to proceed witb
second reading and then refer tbe bill to the
Banking and Commerce Committee for consideration of the amendments proposed.
At this stage. I want again to omphasizo that
s0 far as I amn concorned the issue at stake is
not exebiange control as a goneral proposition;
it is the fixing permancntly upon the people
of this eountr-- of the controls sperified in the
bill. That is the issue. As a resuit of the
discussion in the Banking and Commerce
Committrc on the subleet-mattor thiat issue
bias boon dealt witb vcry adoquiately. I haqve
a v~ery dofinito idea of wbat Sb)ouldC ho the hife
of this bill. M'len the Banking and Commerce
Committoe considers the bill. if flhe turne limit
siiggested is not satisfactorv, 1 amn as.Liming
that whatevor is recommended by way of
compromnise may ho marie the suibjeet of approach to the Acting Mini-.tor of Finanre, in
the hope that it will be acceptable to the
governiment.
I may say to the boeuse now
that w-hile 1 amn prcpared to support second
reading of the bill, if the proposed amnendments whicb bav e been roferred to in a general
way tonight and provisionally acccpted by the
bonourable leader on this side arc not written
mnto tbe bill, I reserve my rigbt to vote against
its being given tbird reading.
As to tbe point raised by the bonourabte
senator from Aima (Hon. Mr. Ballantyne)
about utilizing the prosent order-in-council to
dt.al xvitli this situation instcad of by statute,
1 would remind bim that tbe view expressed
hy friends of the honourabte gentleman has
been very definitely in favour of doing away
with order-in-council government as wchl as
witb controls. The two go together. I agree
with that view.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE:

Hýear, hear.
Hon. Mr. LAMBERT: I submit therefore
tbat the leader of the government in suggesting now that these controls sbouhd be put into
statutory form and thus bave tbe fuîl authority of parliament behind them is at least
beginning to adopt the oft-repýeated recommendations of honourable members opposite

AUGUST 22, 1946
for doing away with order-in-council government. I hope they wiii not overlook that
very impartant point.
As ta the principle of this bill, I say again
that the vital point is the element of permanency. I think the discussions bel are the
Banking and Commerce Committee on the
subject-matter have finally decided that point.
Some Han. SENATORS: Questian.
Hon. JOHN J. KINLEY: Honourabie senators, the honourabie member frorn Victoria
(Hon. Mr. Hushion) said that hie was not a
lawyer and did not as a rule deai in theory.
Like hirn, I arn a plain industriaiist and al
my if e have been trying ta make industry
work for me and my associates. When the
subjeet-matter of this measure was befare the
committee I was very criticai of some sections
of the bill. For that reason I desire the
attention of the bouse while I clarify and
state my present position.
I need hardly say that I do nlot like the bill.
Tt represents legisiation that under ordinary
conditions and in ordinary times is too restrictive, too arbitrary in its contrai and to drastie
in its enforcernent provisions. In the long
run it wouid likely do more harm. than good
ta aur trade and aur people.

It is nat comphi-

mentary ta, aur productive capacity or aur
financial strength.

It

conveys a message ta

aur people and ta, the worid at large that we
need protection, that we fear the threat of
campetitian, ana that we cannot stand the
stimulating breezes ai econornie ireedom.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: We naturaily ask frorn
where and frorn whom cornes the threat.
Surely its source is not in Great Britain, because we have loaned that country billions af

dollars, and we have proven aur strength ta
the world by the fact that we couid send

abroad immense surns of money and at the
saine tirne finance aur own war effort.

Surely

the threat does nat came from Europe, because Germany, anc of cur great campetitars
of ather days, is destroyed; and nat frorn
Asia, because Japan, a great campetitar af al
the North American continent, bas now no
industrial activity for externai trade. There
can be nothing ta fear from. thase sources-the danger, it appears, cames from aur good
friend and neighbour the United States af
America.
In the United States there are 130,000,000
people, and because af their praximity ta us
along aur 3,000 miles af undefended border,
they are ail potentiai customers ai Canada.
In this country we have 12,000,000 people.
Surely if 12,000,000 people are efficient and
industriaus they can sell ta '130,000,000 people
63268--48J

729

more than they need to buy from, them. So
under ordinary conditions we have very littie
to fear in the matter of trade fromn the
130,000,000 people of the United States.
The honaurahie leader of the government
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) told very well the
story of the principie of supply and demand.
In rny opinion we treat that great principle
tao lightly. In trade between two countries
the exchange of good-s and rnoney always
creates a condition which is a balance. If
currency is depreciated, we naturally buy less
abroad. On the other hand we pro-fit more by
exports, thus getting the supply of the currency we neeci. The converse is true when
the currency is high. So in the long run external trade finds its level. The way in which
this operatian works is a good indication of
the strength of a counntry without contrai.
The threat to our financiai position canniot
be very severe at the present tirne, because we
arbitrarily raiscd our currency ten per cent
within the past few weeks. When aur rnoney
was depreciated ten per cent we got a ten per
cent advantage on aIl wc soid to the UJnited
States. No weak country would arbitrarily
raise its currency ten per cent. There rnust
be an) ecanomic reasan for d.oing that. I tried
ta learn from the Gavernar of the Bank af
Canada what the reason was, but hie did flot
give the economic reasan. Naturaiiy we are
glad that we are in this strong position.
The threat cannot he very seriaus, because
we have been told that at the present time
Caniada bas a billion and a hall dollars in
U.S. currency and gold. That is more than
we ever had before in the whole history of
aur country. There is therefore no great
danger or hazard now, and we ail look forward
ta the time when we wiii have cconomic freedam af action.
It seems ta me, honourable senators, ýthat
this measure interferes witb the natural flow
of trade, but it rnay be appropriate under
present circumstanccs. These are the circurnstances: Europe needs food and help, and,
we are .sending ta that continent ail we can
produce, even ta the extent af depriving aurselves of many things. If we shipped ta the
UJnited States ail the commodities that they
have the capacity ta buy, I do nat think there
would be any balanoe of trade ini favour af
the U.S.
Sorne Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: We are in the unusuai
position of sending aur gaods ta Europe when
the naturai channel af trade is ta aur great
customer ta tbe south of us.
Honourable senators, I am not convinced af
the need of this legisiation. I amn a Nova

SENATE

Joseph Howe, who lias been quoted by some
honourable members in this house, asserted
that a high tariff makes smugglers. A control
of this nature will not have a salutary effect
on the trade and actions of the people of the
Maritimes. However we are told that as wartime legislation it worked well. I submit
that anything will work under the proper pressure, and today under conditions of scarcity
of material and abundance of money it should
not be difficult to control balances between
countries. The fact that control worked well
during wartime does not mean that it is practical in peacetime. We do things in wartime
thaft we would hesitate to do under conditions
of peace. We were told that for a time we
must put our liberties on the shelf and that
when the war was over-subject to the one
condition that we must have victory-we would
again enjoy the freedom that we as citizens of
this great country value so highly. Now the
war is over, and we look forward to the fulfilment of that promise and the return to the
freedom of democratie institutions.
1 an not an expert in the matter of finance,
but I find-as was stated by the financial
critic forithe opposition in the other housethe experts do not agree. Therein lies the
safy
iof
the nation, lecause when the experts disagree it becomes the duty of men of
conmnon sense lo bring about the results that
we de-ir. I do not think that my convictions
could prevail without the support of othersi mnay be wrong in tiat-but I look for a practical way to move forward to the things
I want. I imust look around
and find the
truth. As reported in Hansard, the financial
critie of flie other house said yesterday that
there imust be a limit to the measure of
contre] in this country. He wanted te limit it
te one ycar; the C.C.F. party was all out in
favour of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: The measure which is
proposed came to us and we referred its sutbject-matter to flie Banking and Commerce
Committee. There we heard our best expert,
Mr. Graham Towers, Governor of the Bank
of Canada, who told us this control was
needed in the interest of the country. Gentleien, I heard the discussions before that committee and I listened to the speech by my
h onourable friend fron Toronto-Trinity this
afternoon. Even his amendment lias a tail to
if. He moves in this language:
!Tlat the bill be not now read a second time,
but that it be deferred for consideration to the
next session of parliament, and that pending
such consideration, parliament extend to the
(overnior in Council the authority te continue
the existing powers, control and regulations of
thé Foreign Exchange Control Board
lion. Mr. KINLEY.

It seems to me, gentlemen, that the situation
has developed, to the point where it is a matter
of mechanics. What is the best way to get the
results we desire?
My opinion is that we should get clear of
government by order in council. I think that
practice was sensible during wartime, because
the administration had to act quickly, and to
create and destroy. The lawyers tell us that
we should be governed by the rule of lawnet by order in council-and that the rule of
law should be contained in the statutes of the
country. For that reason, if this law is necessary I am prepared to take my responsibility
in helping to put it on the statute books.
The discussion in committee revealed the
fact that the government was willing to
surrender many of flic provisions of the bill
and to do many of the things we advocated if
we gave it second reading. The government is
willing to consent to the removal of the provision whereby a man in this country who
wants to send $100 to another country, or to
have $100 in American funds, must go to his
bank and get a permit in order to do so. While
we might need control of exchange for the
real business of flic country, it soems to me
that these petty interferences with the liberties
of the commen people might very well be
done away with.
On flic question of fair value I pointed out
to Mr. Towers that under this bill one could
net export or import without a permit, and
that a permit could be withheld if flic price
was not considered fair or if you gave credit for
more than six months. I also pointed out that
the fundamentals of any deal were price and the
time of payment; and that in the last analysis
flic two men who made a bargain would have
nothing to do with the deal, because they did
not control the price. The government agreed
to do something about that provision.
The Dominion of Newfoundland, in which
we in Nova Scotia are greatly interested, is
considered a part of Canada for currency
purposes. This, I think, is a good provision,
for it will permit a free flow of money between that dominion and this country.
Then as to the question of a time limit:
if the people responsible for this bill are in
earnest I would say that one year is plenty
to enable them to decide whether or not a
permanent measure is necessary. I will support the bill on condition that we give the
government one year to make up its mind
whether it is going to ask for control, and
whether this legislation will cease after the
first session of the parliament of 1948.
Mr. Towers told us what lie intends to do
by regulations. Well, lie is an official and lie
may not be here next year. But in any event

AUGUST 22, 1946
the question is nQt so much whether we may
trust him to see that the legislation. is nlot
enforced in an improper way. We are nlot
concerned with an officiai, or with regulations,
or with the board. What we are concerned
with is the making of statute law. The real
protection the people will have is 'what we
give themn in the statute. Therefore we must
make sure that nobody is delegated enough
authority to do what we do nlot want to
have done.
To prevent the withdrawal of too mucli
capital we may need a screen. We certainly
should nlot make Canada a financial concentration camp, nor an air-tiglit financial
compartment. This bill looks to me like a
degree of economie nationalism, which. Liberals
should discard.
This is restrictive legisiation. Parliament
tells the people what they cannot do. This
bill on the other hand, would empower the
Foreign Exchange Control Board to tell the
people wbat they can do.
The excuse for continuing foreign exchange
control at ail is that it will allow conditions
to adjust themselves gradually from. a wartime to a peacetime basis. But we should get
rid of the control as quickly as possible.
Money will find its level in every country
wbere there is a free market. It will flow to
wherever it is worth the most. The law of
supply and demnand, together with the industry and productivity of a people, are the
safest ramparts against the things that would
make the people poor. Supporters of this
bill may try te frigliten us by saying, "'Ifyou
do not have this control you will be poor."
Well, honourable senators, some people would
rather be poor but free. There is no price
for freedem.
It seems to me that it is not necessary to
keep our people in a strait-jacket of financial
control. If it continues the day is not far
distant. when they may look to the United
States not only for friendship but for support that would weaken Canada as a nation.
Hon. G. G. MeGEER: Honourable senators, there is one chief reason why I rise to
support the amcndment of the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. 'Mr.
Roebuck). When this bill was first before us
for second reading I complained that it had
not been brouglit down until the l7th of
June, which was months after the opening
of parliament; that some additionah weeks
elapsed before it was referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee of the other
house; and that it did not corne over to the
Senate until the dying days of the session,
when there was no longer sufficient time to
give it proper consideration. That situation

731

has since been intensified rather than relieved.
We have adopted the extraordinary and
unusual procedure of referring the subjeetmatter of the bill te our Banking and, Comnmerce Committee before the bill bas had
second reading. That procedure was criticized-properly, I believe-b y the honourable the Speaker of this house as one that
we should neyer allow ta develop into a
regular practice.
What went on in that comrnittee? We
called the plaintiff as a witness to support
his own case. We called nobody else. We
did not cali any person representative of
Canada's international trade. We did not
eall the iDeputy 'Minister of Finance, who
presumably would be responsible for the
administration of this bill. The strange thing
to me and every other honourable senator
who attended the cominittee was that yoit
could nlot get anybody to acknowledge the
parentage of this extraordinary and unusual
child. You could not find ont who was
responsible for drawing the bill. And no
wonderl You could flot find out who was
responsible for the elimination on July 5 of
the 10 per cent premium on America.n cur.
rency. The only answer we could get was,
"Wel, that lias been explained in a statement that was made at the time." But the
statement that was made at the timne contained just about as much information as
you could get by looking at the moon on a
very dark and cloudy night. It was ne
information at ail.
Certain matters in connection with that
committee should be placed on the record. Wo
were not able to secure even the typewrittetn
copies of the evidence. Nothing came out
of the typewriting machines in time for consideration in the commîttee. Not a single
word of that record bas been printed or i
available.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Terrible.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The honourable tho
whip for the government party in this house
giggles and says "Terrible." Hle may think
this is a matter of no concern to either the
Senate or the people of Canada. Well, 1 do
not agree with that ideýa.
A number of honourable senators have told
us that we are justified in passinýg this bill
because it satisfies nlot only the wishes of
honourable members of another place, but a
universal demand to change from government
by order in council to governmnent .by legislatien. No sucli change would be effected by
this bill. It would result in government by
regulation of a board, which is infinitely worse
than goyernment by order in council.

732

SENATE

To see what government by regulation of
a board means, I ask honourable senators to
look at section 36 of the bill:
36. (1) 'Subject to the provisions of this act
and the regulations and under the control and
direction of the minister, the board may
(a) grant, refuse to grant, revoke or vary
permits under this act;
<b) in particular cases or classes of cases,
from time to time prescribe terms and conditions
for permits additional to those prescribed by
regulation or prescribe special forms of permits
in cases where none is prescribed by regulation;
(c) subject to an appeal as hereinafter provided. determine for the purposes of this act or
any proceedings under this act,
(i) whether any person is a resident or nonresident and the time at which any
person became or becomes a resident or
a non-resident and the country of residence of any non-resident;
(ii) that a person who on or after the fifteenth
day of September, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-nine was or is ordinarily
resident in Canada has ceased to be a
resident; or
(iii) the fair value of any property or of any
debt, obligation or claim, or of any services.
It goes on in similar rein to deal with a
great many subjects.
It was generally objected that Ihe board, if
given power to fix fair values, would be an
unfortunate
duplication of the Customs
Division of the Department of National
Revenue, which over a long term since the
introduction of dumping duties and other trade
practices has built up a staff experienced in
valuing goods from all countries. It was
suggested by the minister that he would
change that general power which the bill seeks
to give the board. I have here a memorandum
which I think was read to the committee by
the Acting Minister of Finance to indicate
in what way the power would be limited.
In paragraph 3 he says:
Determination of fair value. Section 36 (1)
(c) (iii).
It has already been indicated that the necessity for the exercise of the authority of the
board to determine, subject to an appeal to the
Exchequer Court, the fair value of property,
services. etc., is in practice limited to transactions between related companies whose dealings with each other are not arms length, and
that it would be unlikely to prejudice the effective administration of the act if the power of
determining fair value were limited to such
cases.
I would ask the honourable the Chairman
of the Banking and Commerce Committee
(Hon. Mr. Beauregard) if that is not a correct
statement.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: Correct.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I would ask also the
honourable senator who explained the bill on
behalf of the government (Hon. Mr. Hayden)
if that is not a correct statement.
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Yes.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The honourable senator answers in the affirmative. He apparently
does not consider the matter to be important.

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I do not think you
have any right to say that.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I wondered why you
were smiling about it.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I was smiling at being
cross-examined.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: If I had the printed
record before me I would not need to go
through this procedure of checking on what
was said. I do think that we should have a
clear understanding of what amendments are
proposed. My honourable friends across the
way ta whom I have spoken are heartily in
agreement with me on that. I do not agree
that we should by legislation give power to a
board to make regulations. I think it is a
mistake to confer that power on any board.

If regulations must be made for the administration of an act they sbould be made by the
Governor in'Council. Let nie put this straight
proposition to honourable senators who understand the legal meaning of this legislation. If
we give ta that board power ta pass regulations, subject to the approval of the Governor
in Council, once the Governor in Council
approves those regulations they become part
of the act for administrative purposes. Now,
unless there is an express provision defining
such power, I believe that the Governor in
Council would not be able to rescind or amend
those regulations after they had been approved
-unless they come back. They may never
come back.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Is my friend suggesting that if the Governor in Council wished
to make a change in the regulations, and the
board opposed, the change could not be made?
How long do you think the board would last
in that event?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: This board is appointed
for an indefinite period of time.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Indefinite? It can
be removed.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: That would not give
the Governor in Council power to change the
regulations. But why depend upon the exercise of any such power as that? Why not
legislate here that the Governor in Council
shall make the regulations? I think the Governor in Council, making the regulations and
being directly responsible for them, would
probably not be so likely to be a rubber stamp
of approval.

AUGUST 22, 1946
Hon. Mr.
friend.

HAYDEN:

I agree

with

my

Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Then there can be no

question that if the Governor in Council makes
the regulations, he can rescind or change or
extend them. So I say that while you are
legislating the Governor in Council into the
administration of the tremendous field of
activities contained in this bill, you are doing
worse than governing by order in council; you

are giving those powers to a board. But there is
nothing in the bill which reduces government
by order in council that is not contained in the
order in council under which the board is

operating. By the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act we have given the Governor
in Council power to make these very same
regulations, and in these powers the whole
bill is to be found. Turn to Section 35 and
look at the clause contained there:
The board may make regulations
(a) prescribing forms of applications for permits, declarations and permits, including differ-

ent classes of permits;
(b) prescribing terms and conditions to be
inserted in applications and permits;
(c) prescribing the -procedure to be followed
by applicants for permits or in other applications to the board under this act;
(d) prescribing that persons who would other-

wise be residents shall be deemed to be nonresidents or that persons who would otherwise
be non-residents shall be deemed to be residents
for any of the purposes of this act;
The board can tell a man living here that he

does not live here, and that a man not living
here does live here. But listen:
(e) notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained elsewhere in this act, exempting any
person or any class of persons or any transaction
or class of transactions from any provision of
this act;
That is not done by order in council, it is
done by regulation of the board, and once
approved by the Governor in Council it
becomes part of the law of the land, only
changeable if the board recommends a change.
(f) prescribing the manner in which the provisions of this act shall apply in respect of transactions between branches or agencies of any business or undertaking outside of Canada and
branches or agencies of the said business or
undertaking in Canada;
(g) providing for any matter which under this
act may be provided for by regulation; and
(h) generally with respect to any matter
arising in the course of or connected with or
necessarily incidental to the board's operations,
or necessary for the efficient administration or
enforcement of this act and for carrying out its
provisions according to their true intent, mean-

ing and spirit and for the better attainment of
its objects.

mu

2. No regulation shall be effective until approved by the Governor in Council and published
in the Canada Gazette.
I am in favour of that sub-section; but I ask
the leader of the government if he secs any
objection to having those regulations made
by the Governor in Council direct?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My answer at the
moment is that I do not, and I certainly hope
that will be done. But that is another good
argument for giving the bill second reading,
which apparently my honourable friend is
against. When the bill has been referred to
committee it can be amended.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I asked the Acting
Minister of Finance that question before the
committee, and he informed me he was going
to take it up with the Justice Department. I
assumed he might have done so and reported
to his leader in this house, but apparently not.
Most certainly I am glad to hear from the
leader of the opposition that he agrees-Some Hon. SENATORS: Leader of the
government
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I have always been on
the side of the government in politics, and so
for the last thirty-five years I have been referring to the leader of the opposition. I alwaye
wanted to be in opposition.
An Hon. SENATOR: You are.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I made that mistake
because I happen to be in the right party, but
on the wrong side of the house on this particular subject.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I can assure my
honourable friend that as I understand this
bill the board can do nothing without the
authority of the Governor in Council. If such
is not the case, or there is something the board
can do that cannot be undone by the Governor
in Council, I would welcome the honourable
senator's pointing it out when the bill goes to
committee.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I am pointing it out
now, and I hope it will get the attention which
it deserves when the bill goes to committee.
Now, it may surprise some honourable senators to observe that I find something in this
bill with which I most heartily agree.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
An Hon. SENATOR: It must be pretty
good.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: 1 refer to section
71 (2). It reads:
(.2) Notwithstanding anything contained in
section 26 of the Bank of Canada Act, the Bank
of Canada shall not, unless the Governor in

734

SENATE

Council otherwise provides, be required to maintain a minimum or fixed reserve ratio of gold or
foreign exchange to its liabilities.
I am in favour of that section, but I think
it should go further and segregate forever our
gold reserves from our internal currency. In
1937 we passed an act of parliament-probably most honourable senators have forgotten
it-called the Gold Clauses Act. I want to
recall that statute because of this proposed
extension to the law. It is chapter 33 of the
Statutes of Canada, 1937. Let me read a few
of the sections:
2. The expression "gold clause obligation" in
this act means any obligation heretofore or
hereafter incurred (including any such obligation which bas, at the date of the commencement of this act, matured) which purports to
give to the creditor a right to require payment
in gold or in gold coin or in an amount of money
measured thereby, and includes any such obligation of the government of Canada or of any
province.
3. In the case of any gold clause obligation
payable in money of Canada, tender of currency
of Canada, dollar for dollar of the nominal or
face amount of the obligation, shall be a legal
tender and the debtor shall, on making payment
in accordance with such a tender, be entitled to
a discharge of the obligation.
6. Every gold clause obligation is hereby declared to be contrary to public policy and no
such provision shall hereafter be contained in,
or made in respect of, any obligation.
Here is another absurdity in the face of a
declaration that in Canada a gold obligation
is against public policy and it is illegal to carry
a fixed reserve of gold in the Bank of Canada,
because no one can ask the Bank of Canada
for gold in settlement of its promises to pay
on its printed currency. We should do away
with the nonsense of the Bank of Canada's
promise to pay, for example, the holder of a
two dollar bill the sum of $2. The fiction of
the promise to pay ought to be wiped off our
Bank of Canada bills forever. I mention that
because more than passed immediately before
the eye turned up in the committee. We
learned that the people of Canada were
financing this Foreign Exchange Control Board
to the extent of $1,300,000. The board got
the money from Canada, and is paying the
Department of Finance-the Government of
Canada-the same rate of interest that it is
costing Canada to raise that money, one-half
of one per cent. I do not know what thought
came to other members in the committee when
the Governor of the Bank of Canada disclosed
the rate of interest the Foreign Exchange
Control Board was paying, but I asked myself:
Why is it that this repressive and restrictive
board should be able to get its finances at a
rate of one-half of one per cent, while a great
Canadian
corporation like the Canadian
National Railways System, hopelessly in need

of new roadbed, new rails and, new rolling
stock, has to pay two or three times that much
for its money.
Hon. Mr. KINLEY: Call loans.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Call loans,
You can make call loans on the
National Railway itself; they can

can. What about our cities today?

Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Not all bankrupt.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: You say not?
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: I certainly say they
are not. My city is not bankrupt; in fact,
it is in very splendid financial condition.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Do you mean the city
of Peterborough?
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS:
Peterborough.

I mean the city of

Hon. Mr. McGEER: Well some of the
smaller towns may not be bankrupt, but I
know the position of my own city of Vancouver, and that of Montreal and Toronto.
I know the deferred maintenance that these
cities have accumulated.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Maybe the city of
Vancouver was very incompetently managed
under my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: That may be truc.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I should like to
say something in support of the city of
Toronto.
It now bas the lowest debt in
twelve or fifteen years.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I agree, but it has a
very large accumulation of deferred maintenance, and certainly the municipalities around
Toronto are in need of a great many things.
In any event, I know what happened in the
Dominion-Provincial Conference. The provinces' demands were flatly refused by the
national government, whieh creates a serious
crisis in the Dominion of Canada today.
It is very well to say that our cities are in
good shape, but look at the slum areas and
ask any leaders in the larger cities about the
unlimited amount of money that should be
spent for the slum clearance, beautification
and the improvement of general accommodation for the benefit of bealth and education.
The need is the same in all the cities across
the dominion.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: As far as Vancouver is
concerned, there is the rumour around that my
honourable friend intends in the near future
to take some steps to bail it out of its
difficulties.

AUGUST 22, 1946
Hon. Mr. McGEER: There may be a good
many people who want that.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: My friend should
withdraw the statement that the cities are
bankrupt. I contend that the city of Toronto
is not bankrupt. No city in Canada is bankrupt while land values remain untaxed. I
think my friend should delete the word
"bankrupt".
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Probably you are
right.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I rise to a point of order.
Under the rules of the Senate, on second
reading we discuss the principle of a bill;
then we refer it to committee, where it is
taken up section by section. I admit that in
discussing the principle of a bill some indirect
reference to the details of the measure is
almost necessary. I do think, however, that
the discussion for the last few minutes is
clearly out of order, and that the constant
references to sections of the bill are also out
ot order.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: As honourable
senators know, this house is very liberal in
its application of the rules. Senators are men
of experience in the matter of rules of procedure, and guard themselves accordingly
against transgression.
I would ask the honourable senator, who is
well versed in parliamentary practice, to confine his remarks to the principle of the bill
and his reasons for supporting the motion for
delay, and to refrain from discussing the
various sections of the bill, a practice which
makes for continuous debate on subjects
which are not relevant on the motion for
second reading.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I quite agree with my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) that my statement regarding
the cities was probably inappropriate at the
moment.
Hon. Mr. ROEBUCK: I objected to only
one word.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I do say that I know
the need for the things I have spoken of, and
I think they are worthy of our attention.
What we are discussing now is the question
of whether we should have control of foreign
exchange, whether we should give the exercise
of control to a board, and what amendments
would justify us in giving this measure second
reading. As I have said, we are not passing
legislation to get away from orders in council.
There is no justification for voting for the bill
on that ground. We are voting for administration by rule and regulation, and for adminis-

735

tration by a board, with the approval of the
Governor in Council. I suggest that it would
be better to stick with the principle of approval by the Governor in Council, provided
we are to amend the sections accordingly.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: We have agreed to
that, generally speaking.
Hon. .Mr. McGEER: Then I hope it will be
attended to.
A good deal has been said about the Bretton
Woods Agreement. I should like to draw the
attention of honourable senators to section 1
of article IV of this agreemnt, which reads as
follows:
The par value of the currency of each member shall be expressed in terms of gold as a common denominator or in terms o the United
States dollar of the weight and fineness in effect
on July 1, 1944.

Then I would refer honourable senators to
the qualification contained in section 6, which
says:
If a member changes the par value of its currency despite the objection of the fund, in cases
where the fund is entitled to object, the member
shall be ineligible to use the resources of the
fund unless the fund otherwise determines; and
if, after the expiration of a reasonable period,
the difference between the member and the
fund continues, the matter shall be subject to
the provisions of Article XV, Section 2 (b).
Article XV provides the penalty.
What all this really means is that Canada is
now dealing with the United States-also a
member of the fund-with a guarantee of
protection from the fund itself. One must
recognize that we have today in the provisions
of the Bretton Woods Agreement a security
that we never had before. Add to that the
expanding trade possibilities between Canada
and the United States, and further add the
huge reserve of $1,500,000,000. Then let me ask
any honourable senator: Where on the horizon
is there anything to indicate that within the
next two years, or within any reasonable time,
we are going to be short of U.S. dollars, U.S.
investments, or gold reserves?

How could we

be short?
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: The general condition
of the world today would indicate anything,
and that controls that we employed during the
war to the great advantage of this country
may go on again.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Even before the war
there was the most complete co-operation
between the United States, Canada and Great
Britain. I believe that long before Pearl
Harbour we were able to secure co-operation
of the United States and all the financial
powers the government of that country could
extend to us. I believe that after the attack

736

SENATE

on Pearl Harbour in December, 1941, the entire
resources of Canada, the United States and
the United Kingdom were pooled in one
common fund, and that the services of the
Foreign Exchange Control Board, or anybody
else, were not really required.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. ýMeGEER: What nonsense it is
te think that a group of men in Canada had
anything te do with influencing the spirit of
co-operation that existed between government
authorities in London, Ottawa and Washington at a time when we were fighting desperately
to preserve the lives of the people of those
countries. What nonsense it is to talk about
men in the Foreign Exchange Control Board
exercising any power, or being required to
exercise any authority, to help out that international situation. Nothing could be more
absurd; nothing could be more ridiculous. The
interferences that occurred were in many
instances very great; but do you mean to tell
me that President Roosevelt and his financial
department, and Prime Minister Mackenzie
King and his organization for war production
needed any assistance from a foreign exchange
control board to build the Canol pipe-line,
the Alaska Highway, or to carry on the huge
shipping and munitions production programmes
that had beer undertaken?
Why, we were
dovetailed together as one country.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: My honourable friend
usually gets off on a great, broad scale. I
believe, and my opinion is shared by many
honourable members in this house, that the
Foreign Exchange Control Board has done a
wonderful service for the Dominion of Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Honourable senators
are entitled to their opinion. We heard about
the thousand-dollar bill in the shoe and the
ten-dollar taxi-cab fare, but I wonder how
much those items, affected the billions of dollars which were, interchanged in the development of the things that were necessary for
war. Do you think that that kind of administration was necessary?
Let me add an illustration to those already
given. In the province of New Brunswick,
where the people cross the border as easily
as they do in Quebec and at other places
where the boundary is closely settled, there
was a farmer named Kennedy. He was going
across the border to visit a friend, as he had
been doing all his life. He had $95 in his
pocket. He was picked up and $90 was confiscated, and he was left with $5 with which to
proceed. Later he was prosecuted, haled before
a magistrate, and fined $10. He appealed the
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

case to Judge Hayward of the Carleton County
Court; the conviction was quashed, and his
money was returned. The Foreign Exchange
Control Board took an appeal to the Supreme
Court of Canada. The case is known as Rex
vs Kennedy, and I have this memorandum
with regard to it:
Mr. Bishop who defended the appeal on behalf
of Mr. Kennedy, the respondent, took the preliminary objection that the order in couneil
authorizing the appeal was not retroactive, and
that the case was instituted before the change
was made. Mr. W. P. Jones, who appeared for
the crown, asked for time to ineet this objection,
and requested that the niatter be stood over
until the next court. Baxter, C.J. and Grinmer, J., relying upon Doran vs Jewell, refused
to allow further time. 'Richards. J. was in
doubt. Further time was therefore refused and
the case ended there. There was just the one
appeal, and it was not reported.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Will the honourable
gentleman give the date of the alleged offence?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The case is Rex vs.
Kennedy and it was heard in Fredericton by
Judge Hayward in 1943.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: Right in the beat of
the war.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Maybe the farmer was
w rong in not leaving his 895 at home, but, as
was held bv the court, lie did not intend to
commit any offence. That is the kind of thing
that goes on. How much of it do you need
to win a war? How much of it do you need
to save Canada from a shortage of financial
means to carry on the affairs of the nation?
I will give you another instance. A woman
who lives near the town of Woodstock drove
in to town to pay a $300 note at the bank.
She got there before the bank was open and
decided to run across the border to the town
of Houlton. She did not think that she was
committing any offence, but lier $300 was
confiscated.
An appeal was made to the
Minister of Finance, and I understand that
he in turn appealed to the Chairman of the
Foreign Exchange Control Board and the board
paid the note at the bank.
I know of another case. A boy, who had
just earned his first $90 in war work went
acros
the boundary line without knowing
anything about the regulations. The $90 was
confi-cated.
When powers such as those set out in this
bill are placed in the hands of run-of-mine
inspectors and others who are appointed to
carry out such laws, that is the kind of thing
you get; you cannot escape it-and that kind
of thing does not help to win wars or to
preserve economic security.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Will the honourable
gentleman permit an interruption? Assum-

AUGU89T 22, 1946
ing that this bill is given second reading,
does hie not agree that matters of the kind
lie now refers to can be deait with in committee, and that sucli of the board's powers
as permit of these petty annoyances to our
citizens can lie deleted from the bill? As
I sense the opinion of honourable senators,
ail are anxious to have the law sa changed
as to prevent annoyances of the type which
lie lias cited and of which I gave an example
earlier this evening.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I quite agree. In
this big, broad measure to govern our relations witli the United States there are a
number of sections designed to give the
Foreign Exchange Control Board jurisdiction over petty amounts.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: We can amend the
bill to take care of those.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I know we can
amend the bill, but I want to be reasonably
sure that if I make representations to tbe
committee tliey will be heard and accepted.
Hon. Mr. ROBE RTSODN: If my libnourable friend is looking at me, I will tell him
that I do not think anything could be more
ridiculous than that statement. I suppose lie
is asking me, as the government leader in
the Senate, if I will guarantee to him that
any ameniments lie may propose in committe will be concurred in by the goverfimenL, whether the Senate accepts them or not.
I neyer heard anything so ridiculous in my
if e.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I did not say that at
ail.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTS ON: That is what I
understood from my honourable friend's
remarks.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I was not looking at
my honaurable friend, and I did not even
have him in mind. An lionourable senator
said we could amend tlie bill in committee.
I want to lie sure that if the bll goes to
committee my amendments will at Ieast be
considered there, and that if they are not
adopted by the committee they will lie considered liere on the motion for third reading.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: When the bill cornes
back from the committee everything can lie
further considered on the motion for third
reading; and even after the third reading is
given, on the question whetlier tihe bll shahl
pass.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I quite agree. But
I wouhd like to have it made clear that the
board's power ta, confiscate amounts under
$100, witliout approval by any other autliority,

will be stricken from the bill. 1 hope that
the sections which require the postmaster
and the customs officer in every town and
village to take a look into every letter and
parcel to make sure that nothing -is being
sent abroad without a permitHon. Mr. MURDOCK: The honourable
gentleman is telling the Banking and Commerce Committee .what it lias got to do, is
lie?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: No.
Hon. Mr. MtJRDOCK: He is not a mernber of the cornmittee, but lie is serving
notice of what it has got to do.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The suggestion lias
been made here that if we will vote for the
second reading of this bill it wilI be amended
in committee. The usual procedure is that if
you vote for a bill -on second reading you
approve its princiýple, and then in committee
you cannot make any amendment which
would change that principle.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Wliy don't you
admit that if we argued lare titi Cliristmas
you would flot agree with the principle of the
bill?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I arn trying to get
agreement, not wit i my way of thinking or
yours, but as to the best way we can amend
the bill after discussing it. I do not admit
that I cannot be convinced on anything. As
a matter of fact, I arn higlily pIeased that I
made the attack whidli 1 did wlien the motion
for second reading of tlie bill was first before
us, because we have already secured concessions which far more than justify the time
spent on discussion. I believe there are stiil
other concessions to ýbe fouglit for and to he
made in the name of Canadian liberty. What
are we coming taHon. Mr. MURDOCK:
would like to know.

That is what I

Hon. Mr. McGEER: -when even a discussion on a matter of this kind is condemned? That is wliat I would like to
know. Wliy is it condemned?
Hon. Mr. VIEN: I sliould like to point out
that so far as I arn awareý no honourable
senator is criticizing discussion of the principle of the bill. But I think it is the consensus of opinion that under aur rules
detailed discussion of the bill, section by
section is out of order at this stage.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: That is going to be
done in oomrnittee.

738

SENATE

Hon. Mr. McGEER: I would agree with
the honourable gentleman from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) if we were following ordinary
procedure, but surely when we are asked ta
give a bill second reading on the understanding that it will be amended, the question of
what those amendments are to be is important.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: The undierstanding also
is that in voting for second reading we are
not committing ourselves on the principle of
the bill.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Question.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: The bill contains one
other provision that I think is erroneous, and
that is the one giving the board power over
the provinces. Does anyone suggest that in
order ta get our provincial prime ministers
and provincial governments ta co-operate in
the best interest of the nation it is necessary
ta put them under the control of this board?
Suppose the Prime Minister of Quebec, or of
British Columbia or any other province, could
go to the United States and borrow money
on better terms than in Canada, is there any
objection ta his doing that? There never has
been in the past.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Maybe the board
would give him a permit.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: It might or it might
not. But why should the sovereign authorities
of the provinces have to ask a board of
the national government for a permit?
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Why not?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Within their respective jurisdictions the provinces have constitutional sovereignty equal ta that of the federal
government.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Currency is a federal
matter, is it not?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Section 92 of the
British North America Act gives ta each of
the provinces exclusive jurisdiction ta borrow
money on the sole credit of the province.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is for its own
needs. But currency is a federal matter, is it
not?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: But borrowing at home
is under the control of the board.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Does my honourable
friend say that borrowing at home is under the
control of this board?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: The board could
declare a province ta be a non-resident.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: I am aware of my
honourable friends power ta dramatize, but
that is going pretty far.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: I was, of course, dealing with the matter of borrowing abroad.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: There is nothing in
the British North America Act saying that
the provinces have exclusive authority ta
borrow abroad, is there?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: No; but each of them

has an exclusive jurisdiction ta borrow on the
credit of the province. That is an unqualified
jurisdiction, which means that each province
has exclusive jurisdiction ta borrow money
on the credit of the province in any money
market of the world.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:

No.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: There may be a difference of legal opinion on that, but I do not
think there is any question as ta what the
interpretation would be if the question were
suýbmitted ta our own Supreme Court.

There is one statement that I cannot
accept. We were told that without this control
the Government of Canada would, probably
have difficulty in sustaining the financial and
economic security of the nation over the next
two years. Now, in committee I questioned
Mr. Towers on a chart in the board's report, and was able ta demonstrate that
although in the twenty-six years from 1920 ta
1946 we had gone through the worst boom and
the worst depression, and the worst war the
world had ever known, we wound up with
five times as much gold and United States
cash reserves as we had ever had in our
history; and that after every serious boom
and depression Canada had more gold and
United States dollars than she had at the
beginning of the depression; and that there
had never been a time when we had to
withstand a flight of United States dollars or
investments from Canada. What is going ta
happen to us in the next two or three years
to cause that? It has never happened before.
Why should it happen now? I asked* the
Governor of the Bank of Canada ta give me
the reason, and lie could give none. Now, this
was the best bit of evidence I have ever seen
come out in an inquiry or a trial. He said ta
me: I am not able to sustain the d'emand for
this position that we need this thing now
because of there being any danger in sight of
an actual flight of United States dollars or
gold or investments. He could not stand on
that ground in face of the record, so he
switched. To what? To the trade statistics
of the Bank of Canada or the trade statistics
of the Foreign Exchange Control Board? No,
not at al]. He went to the Department of
Trade and Commerce.

AUGUST 22, 1946
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: He would have
been silly if he had given you the answer
you wanted to get from him.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: He might have been.
But I asked him for a true answer, and surely
he would not have been silly if he had told

the Banking and Commerce Committee the
truth. I asked him: "What danger do you
see ahead?" He pointed out the deficiency of
American dollars on these trade statisties as
they appeared in 1946, and built upon that
foundation an assumption that we were going
to have a deficit of trade dollars in 1947.
Now, what were the fapts?, He told me in
the committee that at the end of 1945 there
was $1,500,000,000 of gold in United States
dollars. I asked him if the gold and United
States dollar reserves as of this date were the
same or approximately the same as they were
at the end of December, 1945. His answer
was that they were.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Was there not a
very heavy inflow of American capital during
that period?
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Of course there was.
That is what I say; it was in balance. Why
should there not continue to be the same
inflow? Oh, the reason we all know, but you
cannot blame that on the Americans. But
I am saying to this house that he told me
we had a deficiency in dollars as indicated by
those trade statistics. I am saying the actual
position of American dollars and gold was
just as great in August, 1946, 'as it was in
December; 11945.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: One offset the
other.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: There had been no
drain at all. The only thing that may have
changed that position was the action of the
board itself, because I have not any doubt
that the government acted on the advice
of the Foreign Exchange Control Board when
it took away the premium on Canadian
exchange. Of course, that reduced the price
of Canadian gold to the United States by ten
per cent. It repressed the production of gold
in Canada. It took away from a great many
people who were exporting to Canada a ten
per cent profit, which reduced our holdings of
American cash. It took away a measure of
the incentive to American capitalists to invest
in Canada. But that was done by the boardby the government. Why? We have never
been able to find out, never once. Why was
it done? If we are in danger of losing our
secure position in the possession of reserves
of American dollars and gold, why was not
that flow allowed to continue, and why was
not that position allowed to become more

739

and more secure? We were told that it was
not so easy to convert sterling balances into
gold and into United States dollars as it was
before the war or during the war period.
But the fact is that there is another tremendous security to the Canadian position in relation to its United States dollars, and it is to be
found in the terms of the agreement between
Great Britain and United States on the loan of
$3,750,000,000. Here is a summary of the terms
of that loan:
Never in history has so large a credit been
granted by one nation to another at one time.
In return, the British, in addition to espousing
the liberal trade principles, agree:
1. To abolish at once any exchange controls
affecting United States exports to the Unitea
Kingdom, thus assuring American exporters of
payment in dollars.
2. To abolish within one year the wartime
"dollar pool" of the sterling area, comprising
countries which with Great Britain normally
account for about half of all world trade. Under
the "dollar pool," formed to conserve dollars,
these countries were required to turn the dollars
into London and thus restricted purchasing
power in the United States.
3. To make agreements as expeditiously as
possible with commonwealth and sterling area
countries, to which Britain owes about $14,000,000,000 on account of "blocked sterling,"
settling this indebtedness, and to make convertible into dollars and other currencies any
of such sterling balances thus released. This
means that - these countries will have extra
dollars to spend in the United States.
And also to spend in Canada.
The teris of that agreement provide for
these broad things:
(1) The government of the United Kingdom
agrees that after the effective date of this agreement it will not apply exchange controls in such
a manner as to restrict (A) payments or transfers in respect of products of the United States
permitted to be imported into the United Kingdom or other current transactions between the
two countries, or (B) the use of sterling balances to the credit of residents of the United
States arising out of current transactions.
Nothing in this paragraph (1) shall affect the
provisions of article V1 of the articles of agreement of the International Monetary Fund when
those articles have come into force.
(,11) The governments of the United States
and the United Kingdom agree that not later
than one year after the effective date of thi0
agreement, unless in exceptional cases a later
date is agreed upon after consultation, they will
impose no restrictions on payments and transfers
for current transactions. The obligations of this
paragraph (11) shall not apply:
(a) To balances of third countries and their
nationals accumulated before this paragraph
(,11) becomes effective; or
(b) To restrictions imposed in conformity
with the articles of agreemeint of the International Monetary Fund.
You have in that agreement a huge fund made
available to all the countries of the world.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: I am wondering what
we are gaining by taking up all this time,
when it is our duty now ta give this bill second
reading and refer it to the Banking and Commerce Committee, where it can be discussed
in every detail. We are taking up a lot of
time in the dying hours of this session.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: Nobody has given the
bill any consideration. I venture to say very
few persons in the Senate have read the agreement between the United States and the
United Kingdom on that loan, having in mind
its relation to Canada's monetary position. It
may be that these things are of no concern
to us; that we do not care about them. But
you cannot afford to put too much confidence
in these so-called experts. I have some very
interesting material on that subject. I think
that one of the things we are asked to do here,
is to set up a body of men and say to them,
"You are supposed to know." I do not think
they did know when they lost nearly
$150,000,000 in one move they made. You
may say that this is all right, but do not forget that this Foreign Exchange Control Board
made one move, and the result was that
S150,000,000 of their own assets vanished.

me the Government of Canada, having a Foreign Exchange Control Board, would act
contrary to the advice of the very board that
was doing the work of controlling and regulating foreign exchange?
Hon. Mr. ýMURDOCK:
possible.

That

is quite

Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: The whole authority
was in the government to fix the exchange rate,
not in the Foreign Exchange Control Board.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: On the Foreign
Exchange Control Board are the Governor of
the Bank of Canada and the Deputy Minister
of Finance. The board works under the direct
observation of the Minister of Finance. Surely
the Minister of Finance and the government
would not act without the advice of the
board?
Hon. Mr. McGEER.

Hon. Mr. VIEN: Whether the board acted
or not, the government could always consult
the same officials and receive the same advice.
But the honourable gentleman seems to suggest that senators have not considered the
question from the angle that he is discussing.
All members now in the chamber were in the
committee, where discussion was wide open,
and the very thing he is dealing with now was
threshed out there-and will be again. What
the Senate is anxious ta do now is to refer the
bill back to the committee to have these things
investigated.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Some of us are anxious
that we should not go back into committee,
but should set this bill over until next session,
and so give us enough time to consider and
deal with it fully and fairly. This could be
done without any loss to Canada or the board.
Hon. Mr. VIEN: Let us determine the
question.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: We are discussing
whether or not this bill should be deferred
until the next session of parliament, as proposed in the amendment to the motion for
second rea(ding.
I an giving reason.s why
I think there are many things to investigate
and consider before we adopt the principle of
the bill.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Have you any more
reasons?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: All right, let us have
them.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: One of the reasons is
that you cannot depend on these experts.
The greatest experts in the world probably
are in the Bank of England.
An Hon. SENATOR: Or dead.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Are we to understand that you are the only man we can
depend on?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: No, I do not say that
you should depend on me at all.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: You have taken up
time enough to convince us of that fact.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: That may be truc,
but I do nat think we will lose anything by
taking a little time on this bill, and I am
sure the freedom of Canada will nat be lost
by reason of our doing so.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD: Let us proceed.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: It will soon be
eleven o'clock.

AUGUST 22, 1946
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: It may be that we
should not go into all these things, but I know
that in the Banking and Commerce Committee in the United States such matters as
these are thrashed out for months on end, and
every single phase of the legislation is
thoroughly and exhaustively examined.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: But time is only one
element in the consideration of a problem, is
it not?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: If you are so brilliant
and so magnificently understanding that you
can take these problems and in a few minutes
understandHon. Mr. HAYDEN:
that the rest cannot?

Are you suggesting

-and
pass upon
Hon. Mr. McGEER:
them, then of course argument means nothing.
Like the honourable senator from Victoria
(Hon. Mr. Hushion), I am a little surprised
how easily some people's minds can be
changed.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: You are not suggesting that mine has been changed?
Hon. Mr. McGEER: I am not suggesting
that you have changed, although I think you
are to blame more than anybody else, because
of the warnings that you hung out when you
introduced this "unusual" and "extraordinary"
monstrosity to the bouse. If you were not
hanging out warnings of the danger and
dynamite loaded into this thing you were
explaining, then I do not understand anything of the technique or the tacties of a
counsel pleading a case that he does not like
and does not wish to be responsible for.
Would my friend
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
permit a question? Is he suggesting that other
honourable senators-notwithstanding the fact
that I went so exhaustively into this whole
measure and, as he puts it, hung out all the
danger signs,--were not able to appreciate
then as well as he? Is that the reason for
bis lengthy explanation?
One
Absolutely.
Hon. Mr. MeGEER:
honourable senator came to me and said,,
"When the honourable senator from Toronto
was through explaining that bill, I thought
it was all right; but after I heard what you
said about it, I completely changed my mind,
and have decided to vote against it"--and he
is still voting against it.
Then you do not
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
need to talk any more for him.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS:
change one's mind.

It is not a crime to

Hon. Mr. McGEER:
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS:

Not a bit.
On either side.

Or both ways. I
Hon. Mr. McGEER:
think it was Churchill who said something to
this effect: To change is to improve; to
change often is to become perfect; to change
often enough is to achieve perfection.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK:
change?

Why do you not

Hon. Mr. McGEER: It is not in me to
change. I want to point out that men smarter
than anyone in this bouse can bc fooled by
experts of this particular type. They can
even fool themselves.
Hon. Mr. HORNER:

They often do.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: Back in 1925 England
faced a situation of this kind; she was looking into an unknown future; and I think we
can take cognizance of her experience. Winston Spencer Churchill was then Chancellor
of the British Exchequer, and in a speech to
the British House of Commons he said:
A return to an effective gold standard has
long been the settled and declared policy of this
country. Every expert conference since the war
Genoa-every expert committee in
-Brussels,
this country, bas urged the principle of a return
to the gold standard. No responsible authority
bas advocated any other policy. No British
government-and every party has held officeno political party, no previous holder of the
Office of Chancellor of the Exchequer has challenged, or so far as I am aware is now challenging, the principle of a reversion to the gold
standard in international affairs at the earliest
possible moment. It bas always been taken as
a matter of course that we should return to it,
and the only questions open have been the difficult and the very delicate questions of how and
when.

England, on the advice of the experts, returned to the gold standard and went into one
of the worst disasters it bas ever known. That
is exactly the course proposed to us now. Let
us see what happened. Speaking again in the
House of Commons after that crash Mr.
Churchill said:
When I was moved by many arguments and
forces in 1025 to return to the gold standard I
was assured by the highest experts, and our
experts are men of great ability and of indisputable integrity and sincerity-that we were
anchoring ourselves to reality and stability; and
I accepted their advice. I take for myseli and
my colleagues of other days whatever degree of
blame and burden there may be for having accepted their advice. But what bas happened?
We have had no reality, no stability.
Why do we not call some other witnesses
besides the Governor of the Bank of CanadaHon. Mr. ROEBUCK: Hear, hear.

742

SENATE

Hon. Mr. McGEER: -and the Acting Minister of Finance? Upon what grounds can this
Senate say that it has investigated this measure, when the only witnesses it has heard are
the Acting Minister of Finance and the man
who is to be the chairman of this board to be
set up, and is to enjoy more power over the
people of Canada than any other man in the
whole dominion, not excepting the Prime
Minister himself. How could any senator say
he has given fair judgment on this matter
when he has heard no evidence from the other
side?
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Question!
Hon. Mr. McGEER: You ask me the question; do I think I am the only one who knows
anything about this business. I have never
made that suggestion, but I know that to
learn about these things we should certainly
call more than two witnesses.
Hon. Mr. HOWARD: Question!
Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I think something
better than that should come from the Senate
on a measure of this kind.
Hon. Mr. HUSHION:

Right.

Hon. Mr. McGEER: As I read it, the
Fathers of Confederation had this to say
about the Senate:
The provision in the Constitution that the
Senate shall

consist of a limited

nuiber of

members-that each of the great sections shall
appoint twenty-four menibers and no niore, will
prevent the Upper House from being swamped
from time to tine by the rninistry of the day,
for the purpose of carrying out their own
schemes or pleasing their partisans. The fact
of the government being prevented from exceeding a limited number will preserve the independence of the Upper House, and make it, in
reality, a separate and distinct chamber, having
a legitimate and controlling influence in the
legislation of the country. There would be no
use of an Upper House, if it did not exercise,
when it thought proper, the right of opposing,
or amending, or postponing the legislation of the
Lower House. It would be of no value whatever
were it a mere chamber for registering the decrees of the Lower House. It must be an independent house, having a free action of its own
for it is only valuable as being a regulating body,
calmly considering the legislation initiated by
the popular branch, and preventing any hasty
or ill considered legislation which may come
from that body.
I think the Senate must at all times depend
upon the favour of public opinion for its own
life and security; but it will never lose the
support of the vast majority of the Canadian
people as long as it exercises the power to
guard and protect the property and liberties
of the people and the privileges of every
minority in the land. The Senate is not doing
that by passing this bill.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
amendments be taken into consideration?
Hon. S. A. HAYDEN:
Honourable senators, before the report is considered I would
move, with leave of the house, that the report
be not now received, but that the bill be referred back to committee for consideration of a
point upon which Mr. Tolmie, who appeared
for some of the companies affected, did not
have the opportunity of being heard this
morning. I make this motion so that we may
maintain the reputation enjoyed by Senate
committees of hearing all the representations
that are to be made.
May I explain the point involved? We
were told during the course of the consideration of the bill that all the companies affected
by the subject-matter of the bill paid income
tax, and that the same rate of premium tax
was being applied to all. It appears, however,
that certain companies are being charged a
higher premium tax rate on the basis that they
do not pay income tax, and Mr. Tolmie wants
to submit, for the information of the committee, tiat his company is in fact subject to
income tax. I am asking, therefore, that the
matter go back to committee for consideration
of that one point.

amendments be considered?

TOURIST TRAFFIC
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

CONCURRED IN

The Senate resurned from Monday, August

19, consideration of the second report of
the Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: -and we came to the
conclusion that the Superintendent of Insurance, Mr. Finlayson, was right in his opinion.
If a new point is to be raised, I think it is only
fair that the committee should also hear Mr.
Finlayson.

Hon. THOMAS A. CRERAR: Honourable
senators, a few days ago the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr. Buchanan),
who was chairman of the Committee on
Tourist Traffic, presented a report for our
consideration. It is my intention to speak
only briefly on the subject matter of the
report -and the importance of the tourist
traffic generally to this country.
If seven or eight years ago, whien our
national debt was slightly in excess of three
billion dollars, someone had forecast that by
this date it would have reached the sum of
sixteen or seventeen billion dollars, the prediction would have created very great concern in the minds of the people of this country. We have passed through the experience
of war; we have added tremendously to the
financial burden of the country, and the part

Hon. Mr. HAYDEN:
factory.

of wisdom now is to search out how we may
most effectively meet this burden with the

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Honourable senators,
I agree to the suggestion of the honourable
senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden),
on condition that Mr. Finlayson also be heard.
We gave these gentlemen a very fair hearingHon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is truc.

That is quite satis-

Hon. Mr. LECER: Honourable senators,
I suggest that the procedure would be simpler
if wc were to adopt the report as far as it
goes, and then on third reading the honourable senator from Toronto were to move that
the bill b not now read a third time but be
referred back to committee. We now have
the report of the committee, and there is
nothing wrong with it. I suggest, therefore,
that we accept the report and refer the bill
back to the committee on the motion for third
reading.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: That is satisfactory.
Hon. Mr. BEAUREGARD.

least possible hardship to our people. I need
not refer to the taxation load carried today
by Canadians; unfortunately, in our personal
experience we are all acutely conscious of
that load.
If we look at the matter aright, Canada has
great resources, and I am persuaded that the
most effective means of overcoming our
financial difficulties is an intelligent and wise
development of these resources. I would point
out to the house that in respect of thesa resources we have certain very definite advantages. We are capable of producing gold
in quantities which are worth large amounts

AUGUST 23, 1946
in dollar value. We have important nickel
mines which provide a necessary commercial
metal that is coming into increasing use
throughout the world today. We have resources in other useful commercial metals,
such as lead, zinc and copper, and we have
recent evidence to warrant the assumption
that we shall find large deposits of iron, which
of course is one of the most useful and necessary materials in our modern civilization. A
wise and prudent development of, these resources will create new wealth, give employment to our people and raise the total amount
of the national income, so that the financial
burdens which the federal, provincial and
municipal governments have to carry will bç
more easily met.
But we have in this country 'another resource, a peculiar resource, honourable senators,

which I submit is capable of almost indefinite
expansion. That is the tourist industry, to
which this report relates. We are fortunate
also in respect of this resource. Alongside of
us is a country of 140 million people who live
in a temperate and sub-tropical zone. Our
American friends are great travellers. Among
their other admirable qualities is that of curiosity, the desire to inform themselves, to see
new lands and new scenes, and to experience
new adventures. The population of the United
States is a vast reservoir from which tourists
will come to Canada to get acquainted with
the Canadian people and, incidentally, help us
in our national economy.
What attractions have we to offer? I need
not speak to honourable senators particularly
on this point. We have the great Rocky
Mountain ranges in western Alberta and on
the Pacifie coast. We have the prairies, with
their northern lakes, their forests and their
fishing. We have Ontario, whose northern
parts are in many respects a tourists' paradise.
We have the province of Quebec, which in my
humble judgment may prove the strongest
attraction to our American visitors. The
French-Canadian civilization, if I may so
describe it, varies a little bit from that of
the rest of the country. One can travel in
the province of Quebec and see villages and
ancient churches that remind one of the
France of several hundred years ago. That is
an attraction which is peculiarly tempting to
our American friends. Then we have the
Maritime Provinces. It was my good fortune
a few weeks ago to spend a week with some
friends on the island of Cape Breton. There
we have scenery that appeals in all its attractiveness as effectively as do the highlands
of Scotland.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Hear, hear.

745

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: Its lakes and its
streams, the character of its people, the seaall these things have a powerful attraction
for our American friends. There is an additional reason for this: in the New England
states there are descendants by the tens of
thousands of Canadians from the Maritime
Provinces, who within the last fifty or sixty
years emigrated to the United States. Naturally these people desire to visit the country
of their parents and grandparents.
What at the moment the tourist business is
worth to Canada in dollars and cents may be
somewhat difficult to estimate. I am afraid
our tourist statistics are not as complete as
they might be; but anyone who has travelled
across this country in the last two months must
have been struck by the fact that American
tourists are to be found everywhere. I have
observed their presence particularly in this
city of Ottawa., I am told that my home
city of Winnipeg has had the greatest influx
of American tourists in its history, and that
these tourists are constantly in the jewellery
and general-merchandise stores buying souvenirs of Canada to take home.
The American tourist who comes to Canada
leaves some good American dollars with us,
which, by the way, if effectively marshalled,
would help materially in maintaining our
international balance of payments. I would
estimate that this year's tourist business may
be worth at least $250,000,000, and it must
not be forgotten that we derive that benefit
from tourists without sending out anything in
exchange. When we develop the attractiveness of our mountain scenery, build good
roads and provide accommodation, what we
are doing, in, effect, is exporting our scenery
without in the slightest degree lessening its
future value or attractiveness.
Some Hon. SENATORS: We are increasing it.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I would say a word or
two about the recommendations in the report.
My observation has led me definitely to the
conclusion that the great bulk of our American
tourist traffic comes in by motor car. If we
are to reach the maximum of possibilities of
this traffic we must pay attention to a few
things at least, and the recommendations in
the report direct attention to them. The first
requisite is good hard-surface roads. It was
interesting to hear the remarks of the honourable chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan) in support of his motion for adoption of the report. What he had to say of the
money being spent by Britain and Switzerland

746

SENATE

and France to attract tourist traffic was very
significant and, if we give it due weight, very
important.
Some of our provinces are not financially in
a position to carry out a policy of road expansion as rapidly as they would like to do. I
think it would be the part of wisdom for the
federal government to assist these provincesnot by handing out money here and there, but
by sitting down with the provincial authorities
and getting their co-operation in the development of this great tourist industry, and saying
to them: We will assist you financially in the
building of tourist roads under agreement as
to where they will be located, and how they
will be constructed. A policy intelligently
planned and carried out in that way would
within the next five or six years add hundreds
of miles-yes, probably several thousand miles
-to
our total mileage of good hard-surface
roads. These roads, as the report recommends,
should commence at strategic points along the
international boundary, and link up with roads
into the northern parts of Quebec, Ontario
and, indeed, all the provinces.
If I am not trespassing on the time of the
bouseSome Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: -I will give an illustration which I think pretty clearly indicates
the possibilities of such a policy. Up until
1938 there was no highway connecting the
southern part of Manitoba with the mining
area in the north. One of the things for which
I take some credit is that in 1936, when I was
a member of the government, I was instrumental in bringing about the development of
tourist-road and mining-road programmes.
These programmes were continued until the
outbreak of the war. As the result of the cooperation of the federal government with the
government of Manitoba, a good grave highway was built from Swan river to Le Pas, a
distance of a hundred and fifty miles. This
road was opened for traffic in June or July of
1938. Towards the end of August of that
year I was in Le Pas. I was not there on
political business, but I freely confess that as
a member of the House of Commons I was
also looking after my political fences. As I
walked down the main street of that little
town I counted twenty American cars parked
by the curb, some from points as far distant
as California and Alabama.
Hon. Mr. HAYDEN: Their owners were not
your constituents?
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: No. But believe meand I confess this now that I bave been
Hon. Mr. CRERAR.

summoned from the other place-the building
of that road did not do me any harm
politically.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Ohl Oh!
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: We can also develop
our winter tourist traffic. A great inany of
our American friends love skiing and other
winter sports, and if we go about the matter
intelligently and provide proper accommodation, we can offer inducements that will keep
them satisfied and make them eager to return
for these winter sports. In this connection I
wish to pay a tribute to the province of
Quebec. From what knowledge I have, I
think the authorities in that province are
going about the business of giving comfortable
accommodation and, good meals to tourists in
a better way than any of the other provinces.
There is another suggestion in the reportthat by every means we should endeavour
to get into the minds of our people the possibilities of this tourist business. We should
encourage them to play their part in its successful development by being courteous, providing good accommodation and good food
at reasonable charges, and making our visitors
feel they are welcome guests. That will happen
if the suggestion is ine-lligently conveyed to
our people. I am certain, if we go about it
in the right way, that it is 'quite possible
within seven or eight years to make the
tourist business of Canada worth $500,000,000
a year. For that reason I support the recommendations of this committee.
From my observations, and I have had some
years experience, there is today in the minds
of a great many Canadians a feeling of doubt
and uncertainty about the future; in many
cases it is a sense of frustration. Honourable
senators, that is not a healthy state of mind
for the people of a democratic country. I am
convinced that if we could get some definite
and sensible plan for the development of our
resources, and go out and tell our people about
it and invite their co-operation, we would bring
a new faith and hope to Canadians everywhere
in this country. The psychological effect of
such a project would be felt from one end of
the country to the other.
Canadians are a fine people; they demonstrated that during the war. They still possess
the pioneer spirit that opened up half a continent in the face of great hardship. By a
sensible policy of immigration and sensible
policies in the development of our natural
wealth we can create immense opportunity for
the employment of labour, and thereby increase our national income and lighten the
heavy burden of taxation that now rests upon
our people.

TOURIST TRAFFIC
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. IVA CAMPBELL FALLIS: Honourable senators, before the orders of the day are
called, I should like to draw attention to the
subject-matter of an article which appears in
thissmorning's Globe and Mail under the heading "Lack of Food at Lodges Threat to
Tourist Trade." In view of the splendid
report presented to this house by the honourable senator from Lethbridge (Hon. Mr.
Buchanan), chairman of the committee which
recently carried on investigation into the
tourist traffic, and the very able address of
the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon.
Mr. Crerar), who predicted that enormous
benefits would come to Canada from the tourist traffic during the next few years, I was
very much concerned when I read this article.
According to the article, which applies par-

ticularly to northern Ontario, many touristcamp operators are closing their camps or
offering them for sale at bargain prices. The
camp managers claim that they are being discriminated against. It is said that although
restaurants in the vicinity are able to get all
the food they require, the camps, because of
strict rationing, cannot get the supplies necessary to feed the tourists who come to them,
and as a consequence hundreds of United
States tourists are being turned away and are
going home dissatisfied.
It is all very well for Canada to spend five
or six hundred thousand dollars on publicity
in the United States for the purpose of
attracting tourists to this country, but I maintain that the best publicity agent we can have
is a satisfied tourist. In my opinion the
adverse publicity we get by reason of dissatisfied tourists will be very detrimental to
our tourist trade in the future, and I think
those responsible for our tourist publicity programme should give serious consideration to
the situation I have referred to, and see if
it is not possible to correct it before the next
tourist season rolls around. As one who lives
in a city in the heart of the tourist area at
the entrance to the Kawartha Lakes, I was
so impressed by this article that I was
prompted to bring it to the attention of the
Senate.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, hear.
EMMA WOIKIN
MAGAZINE ARTICLE

Hon. R. B. HORNER: Honourable senators, before the orders of the day are called,
I would direct your attention to an article
appearing in the September lst issue of
Maclean's Magazine under the heading "Backstage at Ottawa". It refers to Emma Woikin,
and is in the following wsords:
Last January, before she knew she was in this
trouble, Emma Woikin went to the Soviet Embassy and applied for Soviet citizenship-she
wanted to go to Russia to live. A month later,
when she was under detention, the Royal Commission tried to find out why she made the
application.
"'Maybe it was just from the kind of life I

had, maybe," she said.

"Just that I look'to

that country for security, and I would like to
live there."
"What do you mean by
Counsel asked:
security?"
"Well, there was a time when I was quite
poor, I guess, and my baby died because we
had no medical care and nobody seemed to care.
My husband was sick, and to such a stage where
nobody seemed to intervene at all."

"There was no public health service where

you were living?"
"No, there was not."
These things do not excuse what any of the
17 people did, nor will they stay punishment.

SENATE
But they may have some bearing on the problem
of how to make sure that nothing of the kind
ever happens again in Canada.
Having lived in the same community as
Emma Woikin for thirty-five years, and having known her father, mother, and brothers,
I feel that it is my duty to bring this article
to the attention of the Senate. For many
years I was reeve of the municipality in
which Emma Woikin lived, and Dr. Batanoff,
the same doctor who attended my five children, was available to her. He was a man
who had to make his escape from Russia
merely because he favoured a minority party.
Dr. Batanoff was one of the finest men I
have ever had the privilege of knowing. He
worked himself to death.
I cannot imagine the family of Emma
Woikin suffering any hardship whatever; they
were well-to-do people and were settled on
the very best of land. If any people in the
community required medical assistance, and
cars were not fast enough, I know that during the years when I was reeve airplanes
were secured to take them to hospital, and
that when
necessary
doctors performed
operations whether the patients had money
or not.
I believe it would be wrong to allow the
impresion given in this article to go
unchallenged.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY TRANSITIONAL POWERS BILL
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 253, an Act to amend the
National Emergency Transitional Powers Act,
1945.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall this
bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I would ask that this bill be placed at the
foot of the order paper, for second reading at
a later stage of this sitting.
Hon. Mr. HORNER.

Hon. Mr. CRERAR: I have not seen the
bill, but I understand there are some amendments. May we have an explanation?
Hon. Mr. LEGER: The only amendment
I can see in the bill is the substitution of the
word "sixtieth" for the word "fifteenth"-that
is, it provides that the act shall expire on the
sixtieth day after parliament meets next year,
instead of the fifteenth day thereafter. It does
not seem to be contentious.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Ordered that the
bill be placed at the foot of the order paper,
to be considered later in the sitting.

BRITISH NORTH AMERICA ACT
PROPOSAL

TO AMEND-MOTION-DEBATE
CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Tuesday, August
20, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. McGeer:
That in the opinion of this house, a special
committee consisting of six senators from Ontario, six senators from Quebec, six senators
from the Maritime Provinces and six senators

AUGUST 27, 1946
from t4e Western Provinces, to be selected by
the Speaker of the Senate, the Leader of the
Government and the Leader of the Opposition
in the Senate, should be set up to study and
report on the best method by which the British
North America Act may be amended or changed
so that while safeguarding the existing rights of
territorial, racial and religions minorities and
the autonomy reserved to the provinces in the
said act of 1867, the Dominion Gavernment and
the provincial governments may be given adequate powers ta deal effectively with the economic, interprovincial, internal and international problems now demanding urgent, just and
effective settlement and that the committee be
empowered ta study and report on the best
method by which the British North America
Act may be amended or changed ta meet every
and all situations now existing.
Hon. A. MARCOTTE: Honourable senators, when this motion was before us a week
ago, the honourable senator from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien), adjourned the debate. He
is unavoidably absent to-day, but instead of
asking that the notion stand over, lie bas
very kindly suggested that I continue the
discussion, on the understanding that later on
lie may have an opportunity of making his
contribution ta the debate.
First of al, may I congratulate the honVancouver-Burrard
from
ourable senator
(Hon. Mr. McGeer) on the able and eloquent manner in which he presented this
resolution- I regret that delay in proceeding with it resulted in the most important
part of the resolution being withdrawn-the
proposal that the special committee should
study the redistribution bill which led ta
the last amendpient of our constitution. I
was under the impression that the resolution
itself would be postponed until next session.
I am satisfied, however, that the matter will
then come before us again, and I do not
intend at this stage of the session ta discuss
the resolution at any great length. The question of how best ta amend the constitution is
of such importance that no one could be
expected, within a few days, ta give it the
study and consideration it deserves.
Honourable senators who were here in
1936, when we studied the report made by
the special committee of the other place in
1935, will remember that I then expressed the
opinion that the time had not come for us ta
change our way of securing amendments ta
the British North America Act. At that time
I was convinced that by leaving the act in
trust with the Imperial Parliament we were
safeguarding our last recourse in case of
disagreement between the federal and provincial authorities, or an encroachment by
the federal government on provincial rights.
But what has recently occurred in the
Imperial Parliament, and the citation of the
declarations of Lord Bennett in the House of

749

Lords and of ·Mr. Beverley Baxter in the
British House of Commons, have convinced
me that I was mistaken. Those gentlemen
stated that once the necessary resolutions
are passed by the House of Commons and
the Senate of Canada, it becomes a mere
formality for the Imperial Parliament to
amend the British North America Act in the
way requested.
On reviewing the past we find that the
provinces cannot and will not be heard by the
Imperial Parliament, because the only channel
through which they can reach that parliament is our federal government. This being
so, the time has come for us ·ta decide the
procedure for amending our own constitution. We could have taken steps ta this end
years ago, and it was only by reason of our
request that the parliament at Westminster
continued ta act. This is clearly demonstrated in the evidence given before the
special committee of 1935.
The amending of our constitution is not a
new subject of discussion and study by our
best authorities on constitutional law. I do
not believe for one moment that the appointment next session of the committee now proposed-and I hope it will be appointed-will
I do think, however,
salve the problem.
that such a committee will be of great value
in bringing this matter before Canadians and
eliciting public opinion, and that as a consequence-if it be true that from discussion
comes light-our federal and provincial governments will be better informed on the problem and better able ta deal with it when they
get together.
Please remember that although in 1935 all
nine provincial governments were invited ta
send representatives ta appear before the
House of Commons committee, not one of
them did so; neither did any of them submit
memoranda, briefs or recommendations. One
has only ta read the, answers ta the invitations
forwarded to each of the provincial governments ta learn that they were definitely
opposed ta coming forward and giving their
views. It is necessary ta read only one answer
ta establish the ground on which the provinces
stood, for it epitomizes the reasons of all. I
cite part of the answer sent by the Government of the Province of Saskatchewan as it
appears in the report of the special committee.
It is as follows:
Referring to your telegram of the twentyseventh day of March wherein you request the
government of the province to make representations, either orally or by written memoranda,
as to the methods of procedure which this province would suggest in connection with amendments ta the Canadian constitution, I would say
that I have been following with intense interest
the proceedings of your committee. The ques-

7bu

SENATE

tion of what if any provision is to be made for
amendment of the Canadian constitution from
time to time is a question which ultimately
must be decided by conferences between the
governments of the provinces and the Government of Canada, with the possibility of a previous preliminary interprovincial conference. In
view of this fact it would appear to be unwise
for the provinces to be giving their views before
a committee of the House of Commons. With
deference might I be permitted to suggest that
the proper procedure is for your committee to
pursue its present enquiry and to make a report
to the House of Commons which I presume will
either be accepted or amended or merely received without binding the government to accept
the proposals of the committee, and with this
report available the provinces could then give
consideration as to what attitude they desired
to take and perhaps discuss the matter amongst
themselves, and thereafter join with the federal
government in a general conference. The report
of your committee would serve as the basis of
discussion around whichs would tale place the
ultimate solution of this problem. We realize
that the question is one of great national importance and should be decided in the welfare
of Canada free of all political considerations,
and we are certainiy prepared to do our share
towards the facilitating of a solution, but we
feel that we must look after the interests of the
province, and think that the procedure I have
outlined would be the proper course for us to
adopt at this time.
T. C. Davis,
Attorney-general.
I call particular attention to these words:
The report of your committee would serve as
the basis of discussion around which would take
place the ultimate solution of the problem.
No doubt the same attitude will be taken by
the provinces before our committee, but in
spite of that the committee will prove its
utility. Great events have taken place since
the enactment of the Statute of Westminster.
Canada has attained in world affairs a promi-

nence almost undreamt of ten years ago. She
is fulfilling the prophecy of that great Canadian, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, when he said the
twentieth century would be Canada's century.
The remarks of the honourable senator from
Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr. McGeer) on the
menace of autocratic bureaucracy and too
much centralization

of power in

the federal

government should open the eyes of our
people. I believe there is a still greater danger
-that too much paternalism by the government of this country will destroy the spirit of
free enterprise and private initiative. Truly,
I believe our committee would do a very
useful work.
The most recent amendment to the constitution is net the first as to which some of us
have thought the consent of the provinces
should have been secured. Honourable senators will recall that wien the Unemployment
Insurance Act was passed our constitution was
amended, and that the consent of the provinces
lon. Mr. MARCOTTE.

was then required. But how was it given?
Honourable senators need only read the Votes
and Proceedings of the House of Commons
of Tuesday, June 25, 1940, a copy of which
was tabled in the Sonate, to be convinced that
there is urgent need for the study of these
problems. What is meant by the consent of
the provinces? Is it just the nod of a friendly
premier or of the government of a province?
Would it net be, rather, consent as expressed
by the provincial legislature?
When the Unemployment Insurance Act
was enacted, only two of the nine provinces
had passed resolutions approving the proposed amendment to the British North
America Act. Honourable senators will remember the discussion which then took place. I
took up the matter before the Sonate, but the
late Senator Dandurand, who was then leader
of the government, claimed that the consent
given was sufficient. I do not know how many
senators would agree to that proposition today,
but I have no hesitation in saying that I do
not share that view today any more than I
did thon. This is a question for discussion
before the proposed committee.

At the outset of my remarks I stated that
I would not deal at length with the subject-

matter of this resolution, but it is imperative
that I make one further citation and comment
on something that was said by the honourable
senator from Vancouver-Burrard (Hon. Mr.
McGeer). The Right Honourable Minister of
Justice, speaking in another place, used these
words:
If this thing goes through, it will be the last
of the contention that the provinces have to be
consulted, and then there is no protection for
the rights of the minorities! If it is to be the
last of the contention that the constitution of
this nation cannot be amnended in respect of
national matters unless the proposal be subjected to the veto of the great powers
who sit in the provincial capitals, then J think
this is a happy day for Canada. This veto business is soething xvhich is proving very difficult
in the Assembly of the United Nations, and if
se this assembly of the representatives

of

the

Canadian people we can down it forever we
shall be performing a service to the Canadian
nation.
I think all honourable menbers wio have participated in the debate have brought forward
all the arguments that could be used for or
agamest such a contention.
I agree with the
lonourable member for Stanstead that there
will be no occasion iereafter to say that the
decision which is toe ) made on this resolution

is an obiter dictusms.
It is a thinsg which will
have been argued and which will have been considered and about which the will and judgment
of the representatives of the whole of the
Canadiani people will have registered their finding. MNlay it be a finding that will endure.
If this statement had hen made prior to
1867, and there had been added to it the statement made by the sa ne minister about the

AUGUST 27, 1946
rigbt of this parliament to abrogate section 133
of the British North America Act, which
authorizes the use of the French language, wbo
will say that the province of Quebec would
have entered into confederation?
Now let us hear wbat the bonourable mover
of the resolution said in bis address:
We have gone to the very limait of making
amendment easy. We do not even have to pass
an act of parliament. Ail that is necessary is
a resolution of the other bouse, endorsed by this
chamber, and it will be rubber-stamped into the
constitution by the British Pýarliament. That
is not good enough for Canadians. We are
witbout a constitution which guarantees to our
people and our nation the essential and fundamental securities of a federal union. I can state
the situation in one sentence: Canada, one of
the great nations of the world, is drifting under
a colonial constitution, without tbe securities
that go with such a constitution when the
Mother Country maintains it for a colony. An>'one who dreamed or thougbt that because our
constitution was an act of the British Parliament, federal union was a guarantee of the
rights of the provinces and of minorities, or of
the integrity of the nation, must realize today
that there is no such guarantee. It has gone.
So if we are going to have those fundamental
securities that are essential to stability, we
must have a new constitution, and it must be
written by Canadians and held in trust for the
Canadian people by the Canadian Parliament.
In speaking about this method of securing
amendments Vo oui' constitution, the honourable senator in bis eloquent way said,' "Shade
of Henri Bourassa!"' If we bave come to the
stage where the guarantees of certain rigbts
given us by tbe Fathers of Confederation are
guarantees no more, can we not say with much
more force: Shade of Sir John A. Macdonald!
Shades of Sir George Cai-tier and the other
Fathers of Confederation.
Tbis is one of the reasons that I support the
resolution for forming a committee of the
Senate to study tbis problem. Tbe bonourable senator bas cited with well-deserved praise
the work of Dr. Ollivier on our constitution
and its problems. Read the report of the 1935
committee of tbe House of Commons and you
will find there other memoranda and briefs o!
great menit. The argument o! Mr. W. E.
Edwards, the then Deputy Minister of Justice,
is a inemorable one. Tbis witness was a flrm
believer in the British North America Act, in
the flexibility o! our constitution and in tbe
present way of securiug needed amendments.
Would he be of the same opinion. today, after
the declarations lately made in the English
House of Commons and the House o! Lords?
I do not tbink so.
Honourable senators, this is an occasion for
the Senate to do a splendid and useful work
for the benefit of our country. I arn couvinced
that you will approve this resolution, and that
63268-49

wbeu the time cornes for the study of this
grave problem, the Senate will give to it the
same earuest attention wbicb bas earned the

'work.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY TRANSITIONAL POWERS BILL
SECOND READING

On the Order:
Second reading of Bill 263, an Act to amend
the National Emergency Transitional Powers
Act, 1945.
Hou. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, I have asked thé, honourable gentleman
from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) to
explain this bill.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN moved the second
reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators will recaîl that
parliament, at the second session of 1945,
passed an act known as the National Emergency Transitional Powers Act, for the purpose of exteuding for a certain period beyond
the termination o! the war various special
powers conferred upofl the government under
the War 'Measures Act. IV is provided ini the
National Emergency Transitional Powers Act
that it "shall expire on tbe 3lst day o! December, 1M4, if parliament meets during November or December, 1946, but if parliament does
not so meet it shall expire on the fifteenth day
a!ter parliament first meets during the yesr
1947." The bill now before us proposes Vo
amend that legishation by extending the period
to wbich I bave referred from fifteen days to
sixty days after parliament first meets ini 1947,
or to the 3lst of Marcb, 1947, whichever date is
the earlier.
I bave ln my baud a statemeut rehating to
the large number of orders in coundil that
have been passed from time Vo time, first of
aIl under the War Measures Act, and subsequently under the National Emergency
Trausitional Powers Act. Honourable senators
will be aware that on the Sth of July tbe
Prime Minister stated ini the other place that
a committee of the Department of Justice and
other departments had ail the orders ini council under close scrutiny, witb a view to redueing Vo a minimum the number of such orders
ini actuai operation.

A short history of what bas happened to
these orders in council may interest the
bouse. Tbe total number of orders passed
under one or other of the emergency powers
was 7,187. 0f Vbis number, 4,27 bave been
revoked or have expired; 26 are ini process o!

REVISU» EDITION

SENATE

being revoked; 616 will be allowed to expire
with the expiry of the National Emergency
Transitional Powers Act, and some 100 can be
re-enacted under the authority of existing
statutes which are not of an emergency character. That totals slightly under 5,000 orders.
Of the remaining orders in council, some
1,500 odd deal with war-duty supplemental
pay for government employees. These are
being examined individually with a view to
terminating the supplements where the special
war duties have corne to an end, reclassifying
the civil servants where the special duties will
continue indefinitely, and having bills ready
for consideration next year in cases where
the government feels it might be proper to
recommend legislation to parliament to take
the place of the orders.
That accounts for about 6,500 out of the
7,187 orders in council. The remaining ones
are those which the Prime Minister indicated
as constituting the real body of the government's existing exnergency powers. They
number 709. Of this number, approximately
225 bave already been placed before parliament at the present session in the form of
draft legislation relating to such subjects as
war crimes, unemployment insurance, control
of atomic energy, veterans affairs, demobilization and rehabilitation of our service men.
There remain 484 orders in council, and it
is these which may continue to be classed as
conferring emergency powers at the close of
this session. They include some which are
merely minor amendrnents of other orders
appearing in the same group. It is not possible
to state for what period of time each of the
powers conferred by this group may be
required while world conditions remain critical,
or what statutory authority may have to be
sought in some cases at the next session. So
far as is known at present, about 268 of the
orders fall within this latter category. They
relate to such subjects as the labour code, the
Wartime Prices and Trade Board, rent control,
and so on.

As I said, the purpose of the bill is to
extend to sixty days after parliament meets
in 1947 the period within which these
orders in council shall continue in force. In
other words, parliament must enact legislation to replace them within sixty days after
the next session of parliament begins. I suggest that under these circumstances this
house can be of very considerable service.
Honourable members are aware of what
normally happens at the opening of parliament: the other house takes several weeks
to debate the Address in Reply to the Speech
from the Throne, and if the new legislation
were to be introduced there in all probability
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

it would not reach finality within the sixtyday period contemplated by this bill. I
venture ,therefore, to suggest to the government that it may be wise to have some of
that legislation introduced in this chamber
at the beginning of next session, so that we
may deal with it in such way as to permit
of its being presented in the House of Commons as soon as that house has concluded
the debate on the Address.
I move the second reading of the bill.
Hon. C. C. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senators, I am sure it will ba very welcome
news, not only to members of parliament but
to Canadians generally, that the National
Emergency Transitional Powers Act will terminate on the 31st of March, 1947. This is
the statute which continues in effect the
emergency powers contained in the War
Measures Act of 1939. During the war no
one could reasonably object to the government taking advantage of this emergency
legislation, but with the end of hostilities considerable regret was expressed that the government still felt it necessary to carry on by
order in council rather than by a return to
peacetime procedure. I certainly have no
objection to the bill as outlined by the honourable gentleman.
He has made an excellent suggestion-that
much of the legislation proposed for next
session to give statutory force to the remain-

ing orders in council might well be introduced in the Senate. It could be dealt with
much more expeditiously here than in the
other house, due to the fact, as he has stated,
that so much time there would be devoted to
debate on the Speech from the Throne.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Honourable
senators, I would ask the honourable senator

This important bill bas been before the comrnittee for many days, and most honourable
membors are familiar with the amendments
that have been made. I sbould tbink it unnecessary to review thein again at this time.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: I think I made it
clear that I was not objecting to any of the
amendinents. It occurred to me that they
could ho read in seven or eight minutes, or
in ten minutes at the most; but if it would
take longer than that I will withdraw my
objection.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I amn in the
hands of the bouse. There is this point to ho
considered: wbile the committee meetings
were largely attended, some senators were not
able to ho present. Porhaps, if the bouse doos

Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN:

mentary on important amendments does nat

Perhaps for a good

many senatars who are more acute of hearing
than I amn that would ho sufficient, but I
must say that reports from important committees are mumbicd in the house, and running

commentaries on amendments are also mumbled. À. numnber of members-I am not the
oniy one-do nat know the first thing about
these arnendmnents.
Hlon. Mr. MURDOCK: Hear, hear.
Han. Mr. MacLENNAN: I reaily abject ta
this idea of a committee of the intelligentsia
being the only ones who knaw about important

amendments that are made.
Han. Mr. DUPUIS: Honourable senatars,
I concur in what lias just been said by the
honourable gentleman from Margaree Forks
(Hon. Mr. MacLennan). We are a body of
responsibie people, the highest court of the

land, the judges of legislation coming from
the House of Commans, and I say that before
we approve or disapprove of anything it is
aur duty ta knýow what it is. As I arn not a
member of the Banking and Commerce Committee 1 was not at its meetings. May I sug-

gest that this bill stand until the amendments
are printed? The printing would probably be
donc by tomorraw, and the bill could be deait
with then just as weil as today. In accordance
with the principle of responsible govcrnment
I humbly suggcst that the bill stand until
tomorraw.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honaurable senators will recali that a few days ago the house
passed a motion proposed by the honourable
the leader, that the rule requiring notice for
the different stages of bis be suspended in
su far as government bis were concerned. The
present motion for concurrence in the committee's amendmcnts ta this bill is therefore

in order..
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: In view of what
has just been said by two honourable members,
I arn perfectly willing that the amendments be
read, or at least thc important ones. There is
no desire an my part nor, I arn sure, on the
part of the leader of the gavernment (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), ta withhald from thc house any
information relating ta these important amendments.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: I second the pro-

posai ta defer concurrence.

755

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I have no desire
whatever ta take refuge behind the motion
passed a few days ago, whereby we decided ta
dispense with the customary notice before proceeding with the different stages of government
bis. It seema ta mne-and I must say this
even though the majority think differentlythat we owe a certain obligation to the senators who for one reason or anather did nat
attend the meetings of the committee, and
I would feel botter about it if one of twa
things were done-or perhaps bath; namely,
that the Clerk read the amendments and that
the Honourable the Acting Chairman of the
Committee (Hon. Mr. Hugessen) explain
them. In my opinion the amendments should
be read. so that ail honourable senators wili
know just what they are; and secondly,
they sbould be explained briefly for the benefit
of thase who were not at the cammittee. I
do flot think that even a majarity of the house
could reasonably and fairly deny ta senators
who were flot at the committee the right to
have the amendments read and explained.

Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Honourable senators, I
am reluctant to allow this opportunity to pass
without making a further remark. No member
of the legal profession who is honestly discharging his responsibilities would pass judgment on or give an opinion with respect to
such an important document as this report
after merely hearing it read, and without
having more time ta study it thoroughly.
As a senator who knows his colleagues well,
I realize that the members of the committee
have studied this measure thoroughly, and as
long-experienced members of a democratic
assembly must have taken the precaution to
protect the liberties of the people and the good
government of this country. If I allow this
legislation to pass without objection, it is not
because I have a thorough knowledge of all
the amendments-some of which are very long
and important-but because I have confidence
in the members of the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce.
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable senators, I think the only useful function I can
perform at the moment is to underline, for the
benefit of the house, the more important
amendments made to the bill by the Banking
and Commerce Committee. Before I do that,
however, I
should say that the committee considered this bill at great length:
sessions were held, morning, afternoon and
evening for three days, during practically the
whole of which time the committee had the
benefit of the assistance of the Acting Minister of Finance and the Governor of the Bank
of Canada. In my slight experience of committee work of the Senate, extending over the
last ten years, I have never known a bill to
receive more careful scrutiny than this one.
The most important amendment suggested
by your committee would impose a time limit
upon the operation of the bill. The bill
contained so many clauses which might interfere with the ordinary liberties of the subject
that it was thought advisable to make it effective for only a comparatively short period of
time, until parliament could again consider it
and decide whether or not it should be reenacted. We therefore proposed to limit the
time of operation of the legislation to a date
sixty days after the first session of parliament
in the year 1949; so under no circumstances
will the measure be in operation for more than
three years from the present time. It will
have to come back to parliament to be reenacted to whatever extent parliament in its
wisdom may then consider necessary.

758

SENATE

The purpose of the second amendment or
series of amendments recommended by the
committee is to make certain that the foreign
exchange con t rol restrictions shall not apply
to tourists coming into or leaving this country.
We thought this was important from a general
point of view, and also having regard to the
great value of our tourist industry, which was
so ably demonstrated in the report of our
Standing Committee on Tourist Traffic. We
thought it important to make it quite clear
in the legislation itself that none of these
foregn exchange control restrictions should
apply to money or securities or property
brought into the country temporarily by
tourists, and removed by them when they
return home, nor to articles purchased by
them in this country for their personal use
and taken home with them.
The third amendment which we made was
to eliminate from the bill as it came before us
a clause permitting the Foreign Exchange
Control Board to have access to the secret
income tax returns filed by individuals and
corporations with the Commissioner of Income
Tax. We considered that clause to be a bad
precedent.
The fourth important amendment which we
made was to permit a resident in Canada to
hold foreign currency, up to the sum of $100,
without a permit or authority from the board.
We felt that in the normal course of business,
particularly the tourist business, residents of
Canada often come quite innocently into possession of American funds-as, for instance,
when paid to them by American tourists. It
would be rather absurd to insist that a
gasoline-station owner, say, who in the normal
course of business received from a tourist an
American $50 bill in payment for gasoline,
should immediately have to report it to the
board or otherwise be subject to the penalties
prescribed in the bill.
The fifth amendment deals more with matters of administration, but is nevertheless very
important. The bill as it came to us empowered the Foreign Exchange Control Board to
make regulations covering a vast number of
subjects. The committee felt it was highly
advisable that the regulations under the act
should be made, not by the board but by the
Governor in Council, and we incorporated the
necessary amendment to that effect.
Another amendment inserted by the committee provides that no prosecution under the
act shall take place after the lapse of three
years from the date of the alleged commission
of the offence.
These are the more important amendments
recommended by the committee. There are,
as honourable senators know, a number of
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN.

other amendments of a more minor character.
I must say that I think the bill as it comes
to the house now is in much more acceptable
form than when it was referred to the committee. Whatever doubts I may have had as
to the wisdom of enacting this legislation in
the form in which it originally came to us
have been largely dissipated, and I am quite
willing to support the measure with the amendments now proposed.
Hon. G. G. MeGEER: Honourable senators,
in opposing this motion and in opposing the
bill generally I want to say that the consideration extended to the bill by the Banking and
Commerce Committee in the time available to
it was most complete and thorough. I also
want to express my sentiments of appreciative
thanks to the members of that committee for
the open-handed and generously co-operative
way they received those who were opposed to
the bill and those who proposed amendments
to it. Certainly the committee is composed of
senators of great experience in public life and
commercial affairs, and in my long experience
in public life, and with courts and other public
bodies, I do not know of anything more
pleasant than the opportunity of appearing
before the tribunal presided over by the honourable senator from Rougemont (Hon. Mr.
Beauregard). He is a most efficient chairman,
and rules most effectively with a smile and
courtesy typical of the people of French
Canada.
Some Hon. SENATORS:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MeGEER: I want to be very
brief in offering my reasons for opposing the
bill. I do not think it came over here in
time for the Senate to give it the consideration
it should have. Except for the minister, the
only persons from whom we heard evidence
were the proposed chairman of the boardthat is, the Governor of the Bank of Canada-and his assistant. We were compelled
to rely upon our own information. To my
way of thinking, we should have called not
only people representative of the tourist
trade. the foreign exchange trade, and the
foreign trade generally, but someone from
the United States who could speak on the
matter from the American point of view with
the same authority as the Governor of the
Bank of Canada spoke on it from the Canadian point of view.
The next serious objection I have to the
legislation is that it imposes the authority of
the federal parliament over the authority of
the provincial governments. We are taking
jurisdiction to say to the provincial governments: Without a permit you cannot borrow
abroad, and you cannot re-finance abroad.

759

AUGUST 29, 194
True, a letter was produced framn the Department of Justice expressing the opinion that
that jurisdiction is intra vires of parliament,
but my examination of the cases on the
British North America Act leads me ta the
conclusion that in nane of themn was the
specific point decided; it is an the barder
line.
Han. Mr. DUPUIS: Similar contrai was
first cxercised under the War Measures Act.
Were any protesta then .received framn the
provinces?
Han. Mr. McGEER: My information is
that there was at least one protest, although
the Governor af the Bank of Canada stated
before the committee that none was received.
Was there any

Hon. Mr. McGEER: I understand there

Columbhia. I have written ta him, but there

bas nat yet been time for me V-o
In any event, the situation between the provinces and the dominion is such that I do not
think this is the time ta press wh'at I believe
Vo be a wbolly unnecessary legislative authority. As I say, I regard this as a border-lime
point.
My next objection ta the bill is that ini
many cases it puts upon the citizen who is
cbarged with an offence, or whose gooda or
property are forfeited, the onus of proving bis
innocence. A number of similar provisions in
the Excise Act and the Customs Act were
cited to us in support of this departure from
the usual procedure, but if I remember correctly, thase provisions were incorporated in
those acts durîng the years 1930 ta 1935, wben
we suifered from a peculiar formi of democratie dictatorsbip. But you ail know wbat
bappened ta the right honourable gentleman
responsible for that kind of legislatian when
the people got an appartunity ta say wbat
they thought about it; and I do not think I
arn going tao far when I suggest that that
rigbt honourable gentleman-now in the House
of Lards-met a similar fate at the hands of the
members of bis own party, for wbhen bie tendered bis resignation as leader it was gladly
accepted.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Oh, no; I would
noV say it was "gladly" aecepted.
An Hon. SENATOR: That was not the only
reason.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: Certainly that was one
reason, and I believe quite an important one.
In any event I do mot think that today the
63268-50

leader of the Liberal party or the party itself
will ever go so far in following that precedent
as to suifer the fate that overtook the previaus
regime.
Now, I believe that in both trade and exchange we reqýuire saine measure of regulation;
but in granting regulative powers we have a
special responsibility Vo see that those who
are to administer them do not have the
authority to make their administration a
nuisance to our people or an unnecessary
invasion of their liberties.
As I say, I f elt vialently opposed ta, the bill
when it was introduced. It contains the sort
of powers which, exercised by civil servants,
would be almast sufficient to cause the kind
of annoyance that would -induce a monk ta
commit the sin of violent anger.
Same Hon. SENATORS:

Oh! Oh!

Hon. Mr. McGEER: However, the amendments have greatly improved the measure, and
I believe that when the time comes for us ta
reconsider the bill the experience we have
gained in the meantime will warrant us in substantially reducing those objectionable pawers.
To me the most important thing in the future
of aur lufe on this continent is that the bond of
friendship and neighbourliness which today
exists between the people of the United States
and the people of Canada may neyer be
broken. And may Canada long remain what

of law evaders is established and confirmed,
and they are prevented from incriminating

original bill wanted, and their purpose has
been fully met.
Hon. J. J. BENCH: Honourable senators,
may I say a brief word on the life of this
measure?
When the bill was before the
Senate for second reading, several of us
expressed the view that it should expire some
time in 1948. However, when that point was
discussed in committee it was intimated that
the legislation would not be likely to come
into force prior to the lst of January, 1947Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN:

Much before that.

Hon. Mr. BENCH: -or, as my honourable
friend says, much prier to that time. The
reason given was that there are certain administrative details to clean up, new regulations to make, and se forth. It was also felt
that two years would be the shortest reasonable time within which to gain the experience
necessary in order to determine whether the
measure should be extended. For those ýreasons it became necessary to extend the time
into 1949. I wanted to state this point, because some of us had very strongly expressed
the view that the legislation should terminate
in 1948.
Hon. JOHN A. McDONALD: Honourable
senators, I think it is only fair to express our
appreciation to the members of the Banking
and Commerce Committee for their splendid
work generally, and especially for the long
and careful consideration they have given to
this particular bill. Two or three other senators
who were not members of the committee have
also rendered notable service.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: Hear, bear.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: I should like to
ask the acting chairman of the committee why,
by the amendment to subsection 4 of section
11, the Governor in Council is substituted for
the minister in the appointment of alternates?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: In answer to my
honourable friend from Ring's, I may say that
the committee considered section 11 very
carefully, and the Acting Minister of Finance
himself suggested that the amendment be
made. Perahps I should explain that as originally drafted the section permitted any of the
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK.

designated members, with the consent of the
minister to appoint their own alternates. But
it was thought that this might be too rigid;
that if, for instance, the minister found one of
the seven designatied members was net performing his duties properly, the minister himself should have the power of designating the
alternate.
The motion was agreed to and the amendments were concurred in.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the bill, as amended.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it your pleasure, honourable senators, to concur in the

An Hon. MEMBER: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill, as
amended, was read the third time, and passed,

INCOME WAR TAX BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN (on behalf of the
Chairman) presented the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on
Bill 368, an Act to amend the Income War Tax
Act.
He said:
Honourable senators, the conmittee have examined this bill, and now beg
leave to report the same with four amendments, which I suggest the Clerk should now
read.
The First Clerk Assistant thereupon read the
amendments as follows:
1. Page 19, after line 24. Add the following
as subolause (3) te new clause 7A:
"(3) Any insurance company, liable under
this, or any other Act, for full tax on its
profits, including interest on investments, may
deduct from such tax the amount of tax on
premium paid, or payable."
2. Page 26, after line 31. Add the following
as subclause (3) te new clause 69B:
"(3) Upon any appeal, the Income Tax
Appeal Board shall have power to determine
all disputes between taxpayers and the
Department of National Revenue with respect
to taxes payable under this Act, and in determining any question before it shall have and
may exercise all the powers and discretions
vested in the Minister by this Act and, notwithstanding any previous exercise or purported exercise thereof by the Minister, shall
exercise such powers and discretions in the
manner in which, in the opinion of the Board,
the Minister should have exercised the same
in the first instance."
3. Pages 27 and 28. Leave out new clause
69E.
4. Pages 37, 38, 39 and 40. Leave out the
Fifth Schedule.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: When shall the
amendments be taken into consideration?

AUGUST 29, 1946
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators,
I understand that we are now due in committee. Would there be any objection to this
measure being printed and dealt with
tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It certainly will
not take very long.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, as there is some question about these
amendments, I intend to move at the appropriate time that they be not now concurred in
but be committeed to the Committee of the
Whole, to be dealt with presently.
Hon. Mr. McGEER: If the bill is to be
dealt with clause by clause in Committee of
the Whole, the amendments should be printed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senators, this same question arose as to the amendments to, the Foreign Exchange Control Bill.
Honourable senators have a right to ask that
the amendments be printed, but I would ask
that they be dealt with now. They are short,
and can be read carefully and discussed at
this time. The amendments, if passed in their
present form, will undoubtedly require some
consideration in the other place. It is desirable, therefore, that we consider them now in
Committee of the Whole.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: All I can say is that
we are dealing with something we have not
got before us. If the Senate of Canada is to
continue doing that kind of thing, my vote
will not change.
AMENDMENTS

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Honourable Mr. Robertson
the Senate went into Committee on the
amendments.
Hon. Mr. Sinclair in the Chair.
On amendment 1-

The CHAIRMAN:

Honourable senators,

this amendment reads as follows:
Page 19, after line 24: Add the following as
subelause (3) to new clause 7A:

"(3) Any insurance company, liable under
this, or any other act, for full tax on its
profits, including interest on investments,
may deduet from such tax the amount of tax

on premium paid, or payable."

MeL. ROBERTSON:
Hon. WISHART
Honourable senators, considerable discussion
has arisen concerning this particular amendment which deals with the 2 per cent tax on
premium income and the income tax payable
by all Canadian insurance companies. The subject will be discussed by the proponents of the
amendment and others more capable than I.
It is ny understanding that at the present
time the premium tax is regarded as an
e3268-504

761

expense of doing business, and that the companies in making up their income tax returns
treat it as such. The proposed amendment
contemplates that the 2 per cent tax will not
be considered as an expense of doing business,

but will be deducted from the amount of
income tax paid.
Apparently under our tax structure there
is no final authority as to fairness or equity
in the very complicated question of taxation.
I have not the slightest doubt that inequities
do occur, but I would point out that the
adoption of this amendment would mean a
very serious reduction in the revenues of this

country as contemplated under the Budget.
It is estimated that the sum involved would
be $700,000.
It is truc, honourable senators, that the
amount involved is unimportant if the principle of the bill is wrong; but I think I am
reflecting the viewpoint of the Acting Minister
of Finance and of the government when I say
that the various phases of discrimination in
taxation will soon be under consideration
again. Even if there were some merit to the
amendment, it throws out the whole of the
government's calculations in relation to the
financial proposals which have been placed
before us. Admittedly, this amendment is
not a solution of the problem of discrimination,
and I think it is exceedingly undesirable at
this time.
Hon. W. D. EULER: Honourable senators,
I hesitate to rise on this subject because I
already have spoken on it twice in this
chamber, and at some considerable length in
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Perhaps I should review the subject for the
benefit of those who are not members of the
Banking and Commerce Committee or who
may not have heard my remarks on the two
previous occasions.
At the outset I must make a slight correction in what the honourable leader said a
moment ago. He stated that it is proposed
now to deduet from income tax the amount
of the premium tax, and that the premium tax
could not be regarded as an expense of
doing business. The premium tax has always
been regarded as an expense of doing business, and continues to be so regarded.
This bill does not affect all insurance companies. It does not touch the life insurance
In
companies in any respect whatsoever.
explaining the purpose of the amendment,, I
may say that while another senator actually
moved the amendment, I was its instigator. The honourable leader has said that
there have been in the past, and are at the
present time, two taxes-the tax on prem-

762

SENATE

iums and the tax on income. That is not
the case. In the past mutual insurance companies, and also the stock, fire and casualty
insurance companies-in fact all insurance
companies, including the life companies-have
paid what I call an arbitrary tax on the premiums received from their policyholders. As I
have said before, I have always felt that
there is no logical reason why the premiums
received by these insurance companies should
be taxed. There should be some relationship,
one would think, between profits and taxes.
These small companies-mostly mutual
companies doing fire, casualty and other
insurance-do not for one moment object to
being taxed on their profits. I would like
honourable senators to bear in mind that
while these companies have been so far subject to a tax on their premiums only and
have paid no income tax at all, they never
thought that was a right procedure. They
have always felt that they should be subject
to income tax on their profits, just as any
other business concern is, but because the tax
on premiums was practically the same in
amount as the income tax would have been,
they raised no particular objection. The government now proposes, in this bill, to subject
these companies to the income tax on their
profits while continuing the tax on their
premiums.
This would mean practically
doubling their taxes. My contention has
always been that the premium tax should
be wiped out altogether, because no such tax
is paid by other concerns, and that these
companies should pay a straight income tax
on profits,. as all other companies do. They
are quite willing to pay that. Why they
should be subjected to income tax on their
profits and also to an arbitrary tax on premiums, and thus have their taxation practically
doubled, I cannot comprehend.
It has of course been brought out that this
additional tax is another way of getting revenue for the country. True, if this bill does
not go through the government's revenue may
be some 5800,000 less than it would be otherwise. But if it is merely revenue that the
government wants, it can get scores of millions
more by subjecting all businesses to an arbitrary tax of 2, 3 or 4 per cent, as it may
choose.
Why should the small insurance
companies be singled out for this one arbitrary
tax?
The reason the amendment proposes that
these companies be entitled ta deduct their
premium tax from their income tax is simply
that we do not desire foreign insurance companies to obtain an advantage over Canadian
insurance companies.
Under this bill the
small mutuals, like other Canadian insurance
Hon. Mr. EULER.

companies, will pay a tax on all their profits,
including interest on investments. These small
companies make very little money out of
underwriting, their chief income being derived
from interest on investments. I might add
that their investments are largely in Victory
bonds, and have been of some assistance to the
country. The foreign companies are taxed on
nothing but their underwriting profits and their
premiums. In other words, they are not taxed
on profits fron investments, and in that respect there is a discrimination in their favour
and against our companies.
Therefore it
seems to me only fair to have the premium
tax levied on the foreign companies as a sort
of recompense, if you like, or balance, to
make up for the fact that our com.panies pay
income tax on all profits, including interest on
investments.
That, briefly, is the story. The objection is
to double taxation. As a matter of fact, in
respect of some of our Canadian stock companies-and an honourable senator who is not
here today knows very well whereof I speakthere is triple taxation. In* the first place,
there is the tax on premiums, then there is the
tax on the company's profits, and then the
individual shareholders are taxed on their
dividends. I say that is unjust.
Of course the country needs money. but I
am sure that no senator would say there
should be any discrimination against small
mutual insurance companies as compared with
any other business concerns, whether in the
mercantile, manufacturing, or any other line.
Charge these insurance companies income tax
on all the profits they make, but why subject
them to this other arbitrary tax as well?
Under the law as it stands these companies
will be compelled to pay the tax on their
prerniums. My suggestion is that the amount
they pay in this way should be deductible
from their income tax. In that way they will
pay their full income tax, just as any other
company does. As a matter of fact, even
under this arrangement some of them might
pay more than their full share of income tax,
because if in any one year a company, after
having paid the premium tax, happened to
make no profit at all, there would be no
income tax from which it could deduct the
premiun tax. And, for some of these small
-ompanies the premium tax might amount to
a substantial sum.
A statement was made that the imposition
of income tax on the profits of co-operatives
and mutual insurance companies is in accordance with the report of the Royal Commission
on Co-operatives. I will not burden the house
with a discussion of that. I will simply say
that while this one recommendation of the

AUGUST 29, 1946
commission's report has been carried out, no
attention whatever has been paid to a number
of other recommendations.
Hon. G. P. CAMPBELL: Honourable senators, having spoken on this question in committee, I perhaps should be consistent and
put my point of view before the members of
this chamber. I think the first thing we
should realize in regard to this proposed
amendment is that its effect would be to
relieve from taxation certain corporations
which under the law as it now stands are
liable for the payment of a substantial tax into
the treasury of this country. Another point
that we should bear in mind is that the bill
is in effect a bill based on budget resolutions,
and whatever amendments are made to relieve
corporations or individuals or business in general from taxation must necessarily have an
effeet upon the budget.
The amendment before us now is a rather
involved one, which 1 feel should not be considered hastily at a time such as this: it is
one that should be given careful study by the
Senate in collaboration with the Department
of Finance and others whose responsibility it
is to find revenues to carry on the affairs of
this country. Perhaps it might help honourable senators to reach a decision on the matter
if I tried to picture the various types of fire
and casualty insurance companies in this country which would be affected by the proposed
amendment. First of all we have a class of
companies known as Canadian joint stock
companies. These companies have shareholders and are engaged in the insurance business for the purpose of making gain or profit.
There are also British and foreign insurance
companies, with head offices abroad, which
are duly licensed to carry on fire and casualty
insurance business in this country. Then there
is another class, mutual insurance companies.
These have no shareholders and are engaged in
the general business of insuring and of making
profit for the benefit of their policyholders.
I agree with everything that has been said
by the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) with regard to the uniformity of taxation, but I submit that we should
keep our minds on what is before us, namely,
the proposed amendment to the Income
War Tax Act, and not allow ourselves to be
thinking of what other taxes may be levied on
insurance corporations. The premium tax to
which the honourable senator refers is a tax
levied, under the provisions of the Special
War Revenue Act, uniformly upon ail these
insurance companies doing business in Canada.
In other words, the mutual companies, the
Canadian joint stock companies and the.
British and foreign companies, all pay that

l0s

premium tax. All the companies regard it as
a cost of doing business. Whether or not the
tax should be levied at ail is something that I
do not propose to argue at this time, but it
can be compared in many ways to other taxes,
such as the sales tax levied under the special
War Revenue Act upon companies in other
lines of business.
Hon. Mr. EULER: And passed on to the
consumer.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: There is no doubt
that the insurance companies absorb this
premium tax as part of their cost of doing
business. It is deductible as a business expense,
just as are other business expenses, such as
office rent, wages, commissions and so on.
The present bill has nothing to do with the
Special War Revenue Act. It is a bill to
amend the Income War Tax Act, and the
change it proposes with respect to mutual
insurance companies is that their underwriting
profits be made subject to income tax. As the
law naw stands, the mutual companies are the
only insurance companies in Canada whose
underwriting profits are exempt from taxation.
So in the past these companies have had an
advantage over the Canadian joint stock
companes.
If the bill is adopted as it passed the other
house, all Canadian insurance companies will
become liable for income tax on the same
basis, and there will be no discrimination.
Hon. Mr. EULER: Surely that is not
correct.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I still maintain
my statement is correct, that so far as Canadian insurance companies, mutual or joint
stock, engaged in the casualty and fire insurance field are concerned, if this bill goes
through without the proposed amendment
there will be an equal tax imposed on al. As
to British and foreign insurance companies,
they have an advantage to some extent by
being relieved of income tax with respect to
income from investments; but, as was explained, head office expenses and certain other
costs of operation are not deductible. There
is a comparable situation in regard to foreign
investment holding companies.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: The local company is liable.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Foreign insurance
companies having investments in Canada,
which they have to set aside with the Superintendent of Insurance, are not liable for
income tax on the income received from those
investments.
Hon. Mr. MacLENNAN: But they do pay
tax on Canadian premiums?

SENATE

7t54

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes; so far as
premium tax is concerned every insurance
company is treated in the same way.

many years. It has nothing whatever to do
with the provisions of the Income War Tax
Act.

Hon. Mr. EULER: Marine insurance companies pay no tax whatsoever.

Hon. Mr. GOUIN: There is double taxation-the insurance companies pay a certain
amount of tax on premiums, and in addition
they pay a certain amount on income.

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Marine insurance
companies are not liable for tax on their
investment income.
Hon. Mr. EULER:

Nor on their premiums.

lon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No.
Hon. Mr. LESAGE: Are the reciprocals
from Boston in particular and from the United
States generally affected by this amendment?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: The honourable senator said that mutual insurance companies
are at an advantage under the act?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:

That is right.

Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Is it now proposed to
place them at a disadvantage?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL:
No.
This bill
brings them directly in line with Canadian
joint stock companies. That is, all Canadian
companies engaged in the fire and casualty
field, whether mutual or joint stock, will be
taxed on exactly the same basis; but, as the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler) says, there is this difference so far as
British and foreign insurance companies are
concerned, that although they are taxed on
underwriting profits, they are net taxed on investments.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: I do net want to
seem obtuse, but will all Canadian companies
be subject to the same taxation, as has been
pointed out?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: This double taxation
does not apply to companies which are not
insurance companies; that is the complaint.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: My honourable
friend is correct. By reason of the Special
War Revenue Act there is a levy on premium
income. By reason of that insurance conpanies pay two sets of taxes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is double taxation.
Hon. Mr. GOUIN: I submit that premiums
are a form of income.
Hon. Mr. EULER: They go to make up
the company's gross income.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: But that is a
burden of the business, and it is something
insurance companies have had to pay for
lon. Mr. MacLENNAN.

Hon. Mr. EULER: No matter what law it
is under, it is double taxation.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I cannot argue
that the tax imposed by the Special War
Revenue Act is not a tax. It is a tax just
the same as the excise tax, the sales tax or
any other tax. The proposed amendment
would permit anyone who pays that special
war revenue tax to have it credited against
his income tax.

Hon. Mr. EULER: My honourable friend

Hon. Mr. BENCH: But it bas not been
shown to me tbat this premium tax is not
passed on to policy holders.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No, those people do
not make any money on their premiums.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The special war
revenue tax has been in force for some time,
and it bas now been reduced from three per
cent to two per cent.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: On premiums?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes. But I do not
see why that tax should be taken into consideration to lessen income tax any more than that
sales tax should be taken off the net profit of
a company in arriving at its income tax.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Is there not an argument in favour of the amendment to this
effect:
that British and foreign companies
doing business here have a competitive advantage in that they do not pay income tax?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Surely.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I submit they have
no competitive advantage. They pay income
tax on their underwriting profits, but they are
not allowed to deduct certain items which
Canadian companies are allowed to deductthat is, head office expenses, ýreinsurance, and
some other costs of that sort.
Hon. Mr. EULER: They deduct those in
their own country.

AUGUST 29, 1946
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: They would also
be taxed in their own country. So if you trace
it through to its source, there is no advantage
whatever. As Mr. Finlayson said this morning,
the matter was most carefully considered, and
it was felt that the disallowance against their
profite was so great that it offset any advantage
they had from income tax exemption on their
investments.
Hon Mr. EULER: That is not what the
royal commission said.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I suppose if they did
have an advantage that could be offset by
increasing the tax on their premiums.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes, under the
Special War Revenue Act. Whether or not
there should be an income tax imposed on
mutual insurance companies.

I am free to

feel that there are many small mutual companies throughout this country that might be
entitled to some consideration in that respect.
Mr. Finlayson said that if the proposed
amendment is adopted the companies doing
business in the casualty and fire field will be
freed of about $700,000 tax. He did not say
how much it would mean if the mutual companies alone were given this advantage. I cannot support the. amendment. Corporations
engaged in the general commercial field of
underwriting for profit, which is passed on to
their stockholders would be relieved of corporation tax to the extent that they would be
entitled to deduct the premium tax, and we are
told that in many cases this would exceed the
income tax.
Hon. Mr. EULER: If the premium tax is
greater than the income tax on the actual
profits, then you cannot deduct something
from nothing.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Frankly I do not
consider the special war revenue tax levied
under another act, and which is charged against
profit, a part of the cost of doing business and
therefore deductible from income tax.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Is not this premium tax
virtually a tax on revenue?
Hon. Mr. EULER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DAVIES: Does any other business
pay a tax on its receipts.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable members, I think the committee should be given
information as to how this matter has developed. The Banking and Commerce Committee is composed of forty-eight members.
Last evening this amendment was passed by
a vote of five to four. It is true that two

tua

honourable gentlemen who are interested in
the insurance business did not vote, although
they made real contributions to the arguments;
and one other distinguished senator did not
vote because-I do not know why. What
happened later? Superintendent Finlayson
told us this morning that, if accepted, this
amendment would encroach upon the revenue
of Canada to the extent of $700,000 a year,
and possibly $2,500,000 a year.
Hon. Mr. EULER: No, no; not under this
amendment.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: He said the loss to
the revenue of Canada might be as much as
$2,500,000.
Hon. Mr. EULER: That is not the fact.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: It applies to British
and foreign companies.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: It applies to the
insurance business. There are a lot of things
about it that I do not know, but I do know
that the great majority of those interested
in the business, promoters and others, are
fairly well off, and making a reasonably fair
income. The Banking and Commerce Committee had before it provisions by which, in
this Canada of ours, a single man or woman
earning $75 a month would pay income tax on
$150, and a married man maintaining a
home would begin to pay tax if by any
chance his income exceeded $125 a month. It
seems to me that some of these cases are
more deserving of the serious concern of the
Senate of Canada than the lightening of what
we are told is an unjust burden.
The burden may be unfair, but what has
that to do with it? Where are we to get the
money for war expenditures and post-war
expenses? A few weeks ago we were told that
American money and Canadian money had
been placed on a par for the present and the
future. That change cost me over $200, but
I was tickled to death to take my loss when
I heard the Vice-President of the Canadian
National Railways say that the change had
benefited that railway to the extent of a
million dollars.
With all due respect to my distinguished
colleague on my right (Hon. Mr. Euler), and
the other honourable members who have so
loyally boosted this amendment, I say to
them: Dig down and help the government
out; there will be no starving or distress
amongst those who are behind the insurance
companies if they continue to pay as the original bill proposes. With the benefit of this
amendment the companies would be relieved

SENATE

of from $700,000 to $2,500,000 a year in
taxes. They are not the ones who are entitled
to relief.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: May I ask the honourable gentleman from Toronto whether the
mutual companies are relieved from income
tax to the extent to which they disperse
dividends to their policyholders?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes, that is
correct.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That applies to mutual
fire insurance companies, and it is proposed
to apply it to other companies?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Yes.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The mutual insurance
companies, as I have said before, do not
profit from underwriting to any extent. Their
profits come from investments, and they apply
them in any way they can to increase their
reserves. I think it has been recognized
throughout that these mutual stock companies
have no capital stock, and that the reserves
are built up for the benefit and protection of
the policyholders. They must be maintained
and increased each year as business expands
and the number of policyholders increases.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: So far as investment
income is concerned, the policyholders really
cannot expect dividends from that source?
Hon. Mr. EULER: No.
The CHAIRMAN: Shall the amendment
carry? Those in favour of the amendment
will please say "content."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Content!
The CHAIRMAN: Those opposed to the
amendment will say "non-content."
Some Hon. SENATORS: Non-content!
The CHAIRMAN: In my opinion the
"non-contents" have it.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I call for a standing
vote.
The amendment was negatived: contents
12; non-contents, 16.
On amendment 2The CHAIRMAN: The second amendment
reads:
Page 26, after line 31: Add the following as
subclause (3) to new clause 69B:"(3) Upon any appeal, the Income Tax
Appeal board shall have power to determine
all disputes between taxpayers and the
Department of National Revenue with respect
to taxes payable under this act, and in determining any question before it shall have and
may exercise all the powers and discretions
vested in the minister by this aet, and, netwithstanding any previous exercise or purHon. Mr. MURDOCK.

ported exercise thereof by the minister, shall
exercise such powers and discretions in the
manner in which, in the opinion of the board,
the minister should have exercised the same

in the first instance."
Shall this amendment carry?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: In opposing this
amendment I would point out that the procedure under this bill is well in advance of past
procedure in so far as it relates to a taxpayer
who feels that he bas not been fairly treated in
the matter of assessment. A taxpayer who has
reason to believe that his assessment is not as
it should be, has the right to appeal to a tax
appeal board on all matters of law and fact.
If he is not satisfied with the decision of the
board, he may go to the Exchequer Court and,
I presume, from there to the Supreme Court of
Canada, if he so desires.

There are matters which are hard to designate specifically, but as to which in countless
cases in the past the minister has undertaken
to exercise a discretion. Up to the present
time no machinery bas been set up providing
for an appeal from this discretion. Section
69E, at page 27 of the bill, sets out provisions
under which the minister is given discretion as
to certain definite matters, and a taxpayer who
objects to a decision of the minister made in
the exercise of a power conferred by one of
these provisions bas a right to appeal to what
is known as the Income Tax Advisory Board.
Upon receiving the report of this board the
minister must reconsider his decision. But
while the minister is required to have the case
referred to the Advisory Board, and must
reconsider his judgment in the light of its
recommendations, in the final analysis the
minister is supreme and must take full responsibility for his actions.
As I understand the effect of this amendment, the Advisory Board is done away with,
and so is the discretion of the minister. The
amendment purports to substitute for the
minister the Tax Appeal Board, which will
be supreme in all matters relating to the
Income Tax Act.
I do not know whether in due course we
may hope to have an Income Tax Act so

carefully framed that there will be absolutely

no necessity for the exercise of discretion by
the minister as to the reasonableness of the

action of the department in any unusual or
exceptional circumstance. This bill contemplates a reduction of the instances in which
the minister may exercise his discretion; and
I believe it is generally thought by those
who are familiar with the subject that a careful review of the Income Tax Act in the
future may eliminate such instances altogether. That would be a very desirable situa-

AUGUST 29, 1946
tian, a.nd one which we, ini varymng degrees,
anticipate will be accomplished. But honourable senators, if the act gives the minister the
right of discretion-and ini cases that are difficuit to provide for by statute someone must
exercise discretion-I feel that to set up a
board which will be superior to the ministerial
discretion is to strike at the very roots of
government, one of the essential features of
whieh is that the minister shall be responsible
to parliament. I feel that the exercise of discretion should flot be left to a board which
is flot responsible to parliament. The minister is subj ect to the Governor in Council
and ta parliament, and I do flot think we
sbould set up above hlm any board of what
recently have been commonly referred ta as
bureaucrate.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: As I understand it, the
bill sets up a board over and above the minister; and, according ta section 69C (1), either
party to a dispute may appeal from that board
ta the Exchequer Court of Canada.
lion. Mr. ROBERTSON: According ta my
understanding-and if I arn wrong I can be
corrected, by honourable senators who are
more familiar with the subject--on ail matters
of law and fact there je an appeal to the
Incarne Tax Appeal Board., and from that
board ta the Exchequer Court. The minister
has nothing at ail to do with such appeals.
But in the past certain matters have been
regarded as proper subi ects for the exercise of
ministerial discretion-perhaps because of the
difflculty of framing the act 50 as to meet
every possible situation-and the exercise of
discretion has neyer been appealable ta the
Exchequer Court. The minister alone has
taken the responsibility for whatever decisions
were made with respect ta such matters. Now
an advance le being made in the setting up of
an advisory board, which will advise the minister whenever a taxpayer appeals from the
exercise of hie discretian. The intention of
the government, as explained to us, le not to
make the members of this board civil servants.
They are ta be a representative group, who
will travel around the country, review the
minister's decisione that have been ahi ected ta,
and advise him upon them. The act provides
that in every sucli case the minieter shall
again recansider hie dçcision. Then he makes
the final exercise af hie diecretian, from which
there is na appeal. It seeme ta me that if
there is ta be any appeal at ail fram the exercise af ministerial discretion, the logical authority ta, wham ta appeal ie the Governor ini
Council. Why give the minister diecretionary
power and then set up a board with power ta
overrule bina?

767

Hon. Mr. MORÂUD: Honaurable senatore,
although I am the mover of the amendment
I am n ot its author, and I hope that same af
the honourable menibers who drafted the
report of the committee on incarne tax and
explained it ta this chamber will also explain
the purpoae of this amendment, which they
can do much better than 1. The cammittee's
report recommending the erection of a board
of tax appeals with power ta revîse any discretion exercised by the minister was unanimously adopted on the 3Oth of May this year.
Ini presenting the report, on May 29, the
chairman of the committee (Hon. Mr. Euler)
said:
I should add here that while aur cammittee
was unanimous that there should be na autharity
exercised by the minigter or hie deputy over
the board itef, Mr. Elliott, the Deputy Minister adniinistering the Act, was not in agreement
wjth us. He felt that while there might well be
an appeal board, its decisions shauld still be
subject ta the approval of the minister. However, the members of the committee remained
unanimous in their support af the recommendation as it stands, and judging from the representations made by the various organizations
that ap.peared before us, I believe aîl our suggestions and recommendations will meet the
approval of the great body of them and of the
people generally.
That recommendation was approved unanimously by the committee and, as I say,
the committee's report wae unanimously approved by this chamber. The only purpose
of the present amendment is to give effect
ta that recommendation. There was a long
debate here on the committee's report and
able speeches were made in support of it by
a number of members, including the honourable senator fram Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Bon. Mr. Hugessen), and the honourable
senator from Lincoln (Hon. Mr. Bench), al
of whom were in favour of doing away with
ministerial discretian.
There seems ta be a misunderstanding about
ministerial discretion. Neither the tax committee nor this chamber recommended that
the appeal board should have anything ta do
with the discretian af the minister in the administration af hie department, as a member
of the government respansible ta parliament.
What the committee and the house unanimously recammendod was in accordance with
a principle of British justice, namely, that
any subjet-in thie case, any tgxpayer-who
considers thgt hie bas niot been fairly dealt
with by a decisian of the minister shail have
recoure ta a court of law. There is such
recourue when a matter of fact or law le in
dispute, and there should be similar recours
when a taxpayer abjecte ta the way the minister bas exercised hie discretion. As the

SENATE
result of an exercise of ministerial discretion
a taxpayer may have his tax increased by
anything from one dollar to a million dollars; but it is the principle, not the amount,
that is important. It is an elementary principle of British justice that the subject must
be able to appeal to some court or tribunal
for redress when he thinks he has not been
treated fairly.
Hon. Mr. BENCH:

Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: If I correctly understand our constitutional procedure, in the administration of his department the minister is
responsible to the cabinet, which in turn is
responsible to the House of Commons or to the
people. That constitutional principle is in no
way affected by the unanimous recommendation of the tax committee and of this
chamber that the minister should not have
power to make any decision which the taxpayer affected cannot appeal. The purpose
of the amendment before us is simply to give
the taxpayer recourse to the Tax Appeal
Board, as recommended in the tax committee's
report.
Again I say that although I am the mover
of this amendment I am not its originator,
and I hope that some members of the committee will explain the reasons for the amendment better than I have been able to do.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I was net a member
of the tax committee and was not present at
any of its deliberations, but I understand
that it presented a unanimous report to this
house and that several members of the committee strongly urged that it be adopted unanimously by the Senate. The Senate did adopt
it unanimously. I should like to know what
bas happened in the meantime te make it
necessary for us to revise our opinion.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The point raised
by the honourable senator is a pertinent one,
which I forgot to mention before. What my
honourable friend says is perfectly true. When
the matter was before us I said-at the moment
I am unable to give honourable senators the
exact reference in Hansard-that as to the
subject-matter of the report I found myself
in a difficult position, because in due course
the government of the day would, in the
exercise of its best judgment and after taking
everything into consideration, bring down
specific legislation. The tax committee's report
having been unanimously agreed to, in that
no one voted against it, we have, theoretically,
to support every word of it. Subsequently
another report was brought down recommending financial relief to the gol mining industry.
That too was adopted, and, theoretically, we
Hon. Mr. MORAUD.

should vote against this bill because that
recommendation is not incorporated in the
budget.
Now I find myself in this position. At
the time the report of the tax committee was
presented and adopted I said I could not express any opinion as to whether I could
approve it in every particular; but, as my
honourable friendi could rightly point out
to me. I did not vote against it. This raises
a question in my mind whether it would not
be preferable that a report should be merely
presented in order to give honourable senators
ample opportunity of studying it thoroughly.
Otherwise, if they are asked to concur in
the report, they can only base their judgment on the confidence they have in the
members of the committe, and by adopting
the report they tic their hands for the future.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The report was printed.
It was nt
adopted the same day it was
presented.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Even so, I think
in the ordinary course of events it would
have been better to merely present the report. However, that is water down the
brook. If by adopting a report we are expected to block any government legislation
which does not implement its every recommendation, we may be placed in a very
embarrassing position.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: In adopting a report we make a distinction between procedure
and principle. We have donc so on many
occasions prior to the presentation
and
adoption of the report referred to.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: At any rate, I
think it is dangerous for the Senate to concur
in a report and thereby tie its hands in
advance. I must say that at the time I had
some doubt whether the government of
which I am a member would adopt the particular recommendiation contained in the
report. On the other hand, I was not able te
argue this or that specifie point and, instead
of voting against the motion for concurrence,
I had simply to content myself by saying that
I was not in a position to subscribe to any
of the recommendations in the report.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: I think the
honourable leader stresses the point too
much.
When
a committee presents a
report and the house concurs in it, this concurrence is not tantamount to accepting the
principle of a bill on second reading. The
report is merely a recommendation from a
committee. I cannot share the honourable
leader's view. I submit that neither he nor

AUGUST 29, 1946
the bouse is at all bound to give effect to the
report.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON- I was simply
answering my honourable friend from Peterborough (Hon. Mrs. Fallis). She suggested
that we were cornmitted to the report because
we had nlot voted against it.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: I contend that if
there was any objection to the report it
should have been voiced at the time. The
comrnittee had Mr. Elliott before them; tbey
formed their opinion on his evidence and
brought in a unanirnous report. I arn wondering wbat in the meantime bas cbanged the
opinion of certain bonourable members. If
there is any real reason wby the Senate sbould
not stand behind tbe report, 1 tbink we sbould
know it.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I suppose that, as
sponsor of tbe special committee wbicb was
set up to consider the Income War Tax Act
and to make recommendations as to its
amendment, I sbould answer tbe question.
As the bonourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Ballantyne) has said, I do not consider
tbat any member of tbis house is formally
bound by ail the details in the report. I
tbink we bave endorsed certain principles,
including the principle of the constitution
of a board of tax appeals. 1 made certain
comments about tbis phase in the committee.
I amn wbolly in accord with tbe principle of
establisbing an appeal board witb full and
complete power to review ministerial discretion, and to review anytbing in connection
with assessments which may resuit in the
levy of taxation upon an individual or corporation. The reason I have some doubts
about the acceptance of the proposed amendment is simply this. When we started to
study the Incorne War Tax Act we carne to
the conclusion that it should be completely
revised. The act was designed to invest tbe
rninister with full discretion in exercising bis
adrninistrative duties. It seerns to me that
until tbis tborough revision lias been undertaken it would be wrong ini principle to go
against the judgment of those charged witb
the administration of the act and say that the
minister sbould have no power to exercise
bis discretion.
Hon. Mrs. FALLIS: Did my honourable
friend arrive at that conclusion when the
cornmittee was holding its mneetings? If so,
why was it not presented to the bouse wben
the report was presented? What was stressed
very largely by tbe comrnittee was this very
necessity of an appeal board to review the
discretion of the minister.

769

Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: The matter was
not discussed in this house, but I raised it in
committee. I was quite prepared to go along
with the other members of the committeeand I am stili-that oui objective is to set
up an appeal board with power to review
ministerial discretion; but I do not consider
that the act is revised sufficiently at the
present time to enable us to vest in the proposed board full and complete autbority for
this purpose. Tbe government lias said that
it is prepared to revise the act, and I understand tbat already a cornmittee is engaged
on this work.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I do not want to hold
rny bonourable friend to bis word, but I would
remind ýhim that be definitely ýcommitted hirnself to this board of tax appeals. At page 388
of the Senate Hansard I find this statement
by bim:
The committee, however, were of opinion that
it was flot desirable to deprive the taxpayer of
the right of going before an independent board.
The commiittee h ave recommended, therefore,
that the Board of Tax Appeals should be empowered to review the exercise of ministerial
discretion.
Notbing lias bappened since to ýchange bis
viewpornt.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is quite correct; the exercise of ministerial discretion
sbould be subi ect to review. There is no
doubt about that at ail.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Subject only to
review?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: No, review as is
contcmplated by the proposed amendment.
But in the act there are so many discretions of
a ministerial character that I question whether
tbe wbole rnacbinery of incorne taxation would
not be bogged down il any individual, no
matter what the minister decided, could
appeal frorn bis decision to a court.
Hon. Mr. EULER: You have altered your
position now.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I have altered my
position to this extent, that until certain sections vesting powers in the minister are taken
out of the act and put on a definite statutory
basis, we sbould rnost carefully -consider tbe
procedure to be followed after an assessment
is made.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I understood tbat you
bad carefully considered tbe procedure, otiberwise you would not bave recornmended it.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Just so. As the act
stands there is no appeal against an assessment
wbich is made as a resuit of the minister

770

SENATE

having exercised his discretion. In principle I
think that is wrong. The alternative suggestion
whieh bas been put forward by the Department of Finance-and it is nothing more tban
a makeshift-is ta constitute an advisory
board. This would not be a judicial board in
any sense of the word. In the case of an
appeal. ta such an advisory board the aninister
would have the final say by exercising bis
discretion. I submit that i.s wrong in principle.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: I bope you do not
approýve of that.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: I do not in any
sense of tbe word. Tbis xnay be splitting
bairsSome Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL. -but I suggest ta
the committee that that advisory board sbould
be appointed from. members of tbe court of
appeal, so you would bave an independent
board, and I hope that witbin a year this
legýisiation will be re-drafted in such a manner
that tbe taxpayer will have an effective right
of appeal on ail matters of income tax
assessment. There are sixty or seventy sections dealing witb ministerial discretions, and
the minister exercises bis diseretion in respect
of almost every assessment. Under these circumstances, and hefore tbe act is revised and
some of the recommendations wbicb. the
special committee made in its second report
are deait witb, I raise the question as to,
whetber we sbould go so far as to say tbat
the Incoýme Tax Appeal Board shah bhave full
and complete authority ta review ail matters
relating ta taxation.
Han. Mr. BALLANTYNE: My bonourable
friend is a very capable lawyer. Wby did not
ail these tbings occur ta bim when bie sat for
montbs in the Income Tax Committee? There
seems ta me ta be a recent conversion on bis
part.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: He said the samne
thing in committee.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: At the time tbe
committee was sitting why di& bie not say that
there was no use making this report to the
Senate because bie was in favour of the minister's decision being final?
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: As far as I am
concerned, I discussed this question at some
Iength in committee in exactly the samne way
as I bave bere. In principle I am in favour of
reviewing the ministerial discretion wbere it
resuits in increased taxation; but I feel tbat
we must take some precaution with respect
ta vesting power ini tbis board.
Bon. Mr. CAMPBELL.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Wbat precaution?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: You are a little
late witb your remarks.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Let us consider a
specifie case in wbich the minister says that hie
disallows depreciation at a certain rate, and
an appeal is taken from that decision. The
board, as proposed, would bave ta cansider
many tbings in order ta, determine whether the
depreciatian was proper and allowable; and
in view of the fact that over a periad of years
the departmnent bas tried ta fix a more or less
uniform rate of depreciation, the board would
get involved in the administrative practice of
the department.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: It would be necessary
ta cboose between the administrative practice
-which
is wrang, and wbicb we bave
denaunced since the beginning of this session
-and tbe rigbt of the taxpayer to, bave bia
case adjudicated by some other body than the
officials of the department.
Han. Mr. CAMPBELL: That is quite
right.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: Hanourable senatars,
1 am not very much impressed witb the
argument that the action, contemplated by
the amendment sbould be delayed until
there bas been an oppartunity ta generally
revise the act. It seems ta me that if we
adopted this amendnient setting up a board
of appeal with jurisicdction ta review the
ministerial discretion, it might basten the
revisian of the act and reduce tbe number of
discretions now vested in the minister.
Further, the provisions as contemplatcd
by the bill are, not ta become effective, except
in respect ta taxes heginning with the year
1946. Sa, tbat in practice it will probably be
late in 1947 or the beginning of 1948 before
à board of appeal wil] be called upon ta deal
a'ith the exercise of ministerial discretion in
ffhe reviewing of assessments.
The special committee set up at the instance of my bonaurable, friend who bas
iust taken bis seat (Hon. Mr. Campbell),
spent considerahie time on, tbis question. The
Deputy Minister of National Revenue for
Taxation was a witneas before tbat cammittee, and this point was cdscussed with hima
at great length. The suggestion was put ta
bim that the appeal board then proposed
should have jurisdiction to, review ministerial
discretion as well as matters of law and fact
flot involving discretion. He was strongly
opposed ta that proposition, and suggested as
an alternative that there should be canstituted the Advisory Board wbich is now provided for in this bill. I have not the report of

AUGUST 29, 1946
the committee before me, but At is my recollection that we said in the plainest language
possible that after careful consideration the
Deputy Ministcr's viewpoint in that conncction had been rejected.
My views have flot changed since that
report was made, and, I most certainly intend
to support this amendment. Unless we adopt
the amendment we are simply leaving a
situation which bas existed for tbirty years
and about which there bas been a great deal
o-f complaint. The recourse from the ruling of
Caesar wilI be an appeal to a greater Caesar.
I amn as rnuch out of sympathy with that
viewpoint now as I was wben the special
committee made its report.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: May I ask a question
about a matter wbich I do not understand?
lJnder section 69A of the bil a taxpayer wbo
is dissatisfied witb bis asscssment rnay send
notice of objection to, the minister witbin
a period of two montbs after the day of
mailing of the asscsment notice. Hle rnay
then appeal to the Appeal Board named i
section 69B. The Appeal Board studies the
assessment, and its decision is sent to both the
minister and the taxpayer. The minister or
tbe taxpayer, if nût satisficd, may appealSome Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: But according to section 69C eithcr the minister or the taxpayer
rnay direct an appeal to, the Exchequcr Court.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: No.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: On law and
fact.
Hon. Mr. EULER: On law and fact-and
with discretion to no one.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Thcy are free to do
that; but in view of sections 69A, 69B and
60C, whicb would appear to, provide the
machinery for appeal fromn ministerial discretion, I sbould like to know the reason for this
arn nd ment.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: My answer is, firstly,
that in this bill there is no right of appeal to
the Appeal Board fromn an assessment based
upon the exercise of mainisterial discretion.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Then where does tbe
ministerial discretion corne in?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: If rny friend wilI look
at the explanatory note to Section 69E of
the bill he will sec in tbe fincst possible print
a list of the discretions. First of ail, there is
no appeal to the board fromn thc exercise of
ministerial discretion. Tbat is the only point
involved in this proposed amendrnent and the
discussion now taking place.

Under the law as it now stands, an
aggrieved taxpayer can go to the Exchequer
Court by way of appeal fromn assessmnent; but
on numerous occasions that court has beld
that it has no jurisdiction to review the
resuit of ministerial. diseretions properly
exercised. The practical resuit is that under
the present law, as my bonourable friend who is
an able lawyer, miust know, there is no
recourse for a taxpayer who is aggrieved by
an assessment based upon ministerial discretion. To overcorne that situation our comnmittee made the suggestion that the Appeal
Board should be divorced fromn the department, and should have the right to review
assessments involving not only matters of
law and fact but also the exercise of ministerjal discretion.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I arn not here to criticize what this important committee has donc,
but I arn asking myseif this question: If the
Exebequer Court has decidcd on many
occasions that it cannot review ministerial
discretion because of some lack of power
under the act, why did not this committee
give the power to, that court instead of creating a new body?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: It had not the
power to do that.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: That proposai. was very
carcfully considered, but the prime objective of
the committee -was to provide an inexpensive
means of appeal to an independent board.
Hon. Mr. CAMPBELL: Instcad of to the
minister.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: Or instead of to the
Excbequcr Court?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: My friend bas asked
wby the cornmittee did not broaden the powers
of the Exehequer Court so that it could
review ministerial discretions and substitute
its own. I believe I arn stating it fairly wben
I say the committee considered the matter
and decided that it was more appropriate to
set up a board of tax appeal, independent of
the departrnent, to wbich a taxpayer would
have recourse in an inexpensive way. If my
friend wants to go to the Exehequer Court
he must first post security for costs in the
amount of $400.
Hon. Mr. DUFFUS: If I remember correctly, the fee for the first appeal was to be $15.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: If it is neccssary to
create an appeal board bcyond tbe Exchequer
Court, is section 69E of the bill a dead letter?
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I sh-ould say it is not
a dead letter.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS:
But the Exchequer
Court has no power to review ministerial
discretion.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I will state the situation
once more for the benefit of my friend. Under
this legislation, apart from the amendment
now proposed, there is an appeal on questions
of law and fact not involving ministerial discretion, and a further appeal to the Exchequer
Court. But I repeat that without this amendment there is no effective appeal and no right
of redress for any taxpayer who may feel himself aggrieved by the exercise of ministerial
discretion. That is the thing we have tried
to get away from. I cannot therefore believe
that the amendment is wrong in principle or
that it will hamper or hinder the administration
of the act. On the contrary, I am convinced
that it will induce a great deal of publie confidence in the administration of our income
tax law.
I intend to support the amendment, and I
am through answering questions.
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS:
Does the amendment
give the details of the powers of the new
board?
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: They are in the law
itself. If you read the bill you will sec all
the powers of appeal.
Hon. Mr. BENCH:
In addition to the
powers which the board would have under the
bill, it is suggested that it have the power te
review ministerial discretion in an effective
way.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The honourable gentleman from La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud)
referred to the first report of the Special
Committe on the Income War Tax Act and
the Excess Profits Tax Act, and quoted some
remarks made by the chairman of the committee, who happens to have been myself,
when the report was presented.
Those
remarks express pretty well what I thought
then and what I think today. I have listened
with considerable interest to my honourable
friend behind me (Hon. Mr. Campbell). He
describes himself as being in faveur of the
principle of this amendment, but for some
obscure reason he is net going to vote for the
amendment.
I may say that earlier this
afternoon I found a certain obscurity in his
remarks on another amendment in which I
was somewhat interested. But whatever the
reason may be, he seems to have made a
right-about turn. However, as one of the old
hymns puts it, "While the lamp holds out
to burn, the vilest sinner may return"-even
at the eleventh heur.
Hon. Mr. BENCH.

To me the crux of the whole question is
simple.
This amendment proposes to give
effect to what was recommended in the report
of the special committee and adopted by the
Senate. As has been pointed out, the committee's recommendations were supported by
a number of senators, including the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Campbell). One of those recommendations
was that the exercise of discretion by the
minister should be appealable to a board, and
that its findings should net be subject to
review by the minister, which in these cases
means the deputy minister. Though that was
contrary to what the deputy minister advised,
it was unanimously approved by the members of the committee.
There might have been reason for some
members changing their minds after the government brought down the budget and
announced what it was going to do. We knew
then that the minister was not accepting our
recommendation; we knew then that he was
in faveur of an advisory board, whose advice
he could either accept or reject. But after
that our committee met again and brought
in another unanimous report, which also was
suipported by the honourable gentleman from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell). In that report
we commented on the proposal of the Minister of Finance, as indicated in his Budget
Speech, for a certain limitation of the discretionary powers of the Minister of National
Revenue, and we went on to say:
Such a limitation of ministerial discretion
becomes all the more necessary, since, much to
the regret of your committee, the Minister of
Finance has not seen fit to adopt the recommendations macle by your committee in Part
One of this report relating to the establishment
of a Board of Tax Appeals with authority to
review administrative discretions.
The point I want to make is that after it
was apparent that the government had disregarded our recommendation for the appointment of a board to which the taxpayer could
appeal from the exercise of ministerial discretien, our committee again considered the
matter and reaffirmed its view that such a
board should be appointed. As I say, that
was a unanimous report of the committee,
and it was unanimously adopted by the
Senate.

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I declare the

Hon. Mr. GRERAR: I do not quite understand, Mr. Chairruan. I thought the number
in favour of the amendment was fifteen, and
the number opposed, fourteen.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: The number
opposed was flfteen, counting the vote of the
Chair.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: With ail due respect,
Mr. Chairman, may I ask if a mai ority is flot
needed to reject an amendment? I1f the vote
was 15 to 15, I do not sce how the amendmnent
can be declared lost.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I understand
the mile to be-I -have not got it at hand just
now-that the Speaker of the Senate or the
Chairman of the Committe of the Whole has
the same right to vote that any other senator
has, and that in the event of a tie he bas the
casting vote.
Hlon. Mr.'MORAUD: There was ne tie; it
was fifteen to fourteen.
Hon. Mr. EULER: It was fifteen to fourteen ýuntîl the Chairman voted, as he had a
right to do, and that made it a tie.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Is it 'possible to have
a second vote?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Let us have the
vote again. I amn net satisfied with the
decision, and I appeal to the Chair to have
the vote taken again.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: If that is the
wish of the committee, I will not raise any
objection.
Ail those in favour of the amendment will

The CLERK: Fifteen.

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Ail those

The CLERK: Seventeen.
Hon. Mr. BENCU: I understood that there
were some pairs. In the light of information
given to me in that regard, I was surprised to
see certain senators vote on this amendment.
Hon. Mr. EULER: The same information
was given to me, Mr. Chairman. A certain
senator who could flot be here said he had
arranged with another member flot to vote.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Furthermore,
may I ask the Chair if votes can be counted
after the doors have been practically closed?
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: So long as a senator
is in when the vote is taken, surely he has the
right to vote.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: He has to hear the
question, at least.
The Hon. the CHAIRMKN: I declare the
amendment Iost.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: On what vote?
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: On the vote
asked for hy the leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne); on the second vote.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If one or two members
come into the house after a vote has been
taken, as this first vote was, and for some
reason or anotýher a second vote is called for,
surely those who came in after the original
vote was taken and announced should flot be
counted.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: This was not a vote
in which the names of the Contents and Noncontents were recorded. SureIy any senator
who cornes into the bouse hefore a vote of
this kind is to be taken-whether it is the first,
second or third-should have a right to vote.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Will the honourable gentleman from Parkdale (Hon. Mr.
Murdock) tell me where the two additional
members came from? They were not here
when the first vote was taken. Where did
they appear from?
Hon. Mr. MURDOC K: One distinguished
senator walked in the door while we were
arguing about the first vote, and another
distinguished senator who did not vote the
first time rose the second time.
Hon. Mr. DIJPUIS: May I say, for the
comfort of those who lost, that on the basis
of the first vote, fifteen to fifteen, the Chairman's decision that the amendment was lost
was a proper decision according to the rules

774

SENATE

of this house. That couid be substa.ntiated by
His Honour the Speaker to-morrow. Then
another vote was taken, after one or more
senators had corne in. There is nothing to
prevent a senator from casting hais vote in
such circumstances. And the second vote did
flot change the restait.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: 15 it the opinion of
my honourable friend that a senator can vote
witbout having heard t.he question put?
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: My honourable
friend (Hon. Mr. Dupuis) was in another
place for many years. Did he ever sce such
an occurrence as this, where a vote was calied
for and the doors were closed, and while the
vote was being taken two members suddenly
appeared and voted?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If rny honourable friend will allow me, I think that bas no
bearing on the question. There was no formai
caliing in of the members, as when the beils
ring and a certain time is aliowed, for members
to reach the -chamber, and the doors are
ciosed after the whips corne in. That is
entireiy different from a vote in cornrittee.
Hon. Mr. BENCH: I would like to think
that I arn not a poor loser, but 1 must say
that I did understand there were certain
pairs. I do not know what the position is.
Thiere probably is no rule which binds anyone
flot to v ote after he bas agreed to pair with
sorneone else. I should like to have an
explanation some time, flot necessarily now, of
just w-bat the position is in that connection.
The CHAIRMAN: I would rernjnd rnerbers of the committee that section 36 of the
British North America Act reads as foliows:
ý36. Questions arising in the Senate shall he
decided by a majority of voices, and the Speaker
shall in ail cases have a vote, and when the
voices are equai the decision shall be deerned
to be in the negative.
The amendment was negatived.

On amendment No. 3The CHAIRMAN: This amendment reads:
Pages 27 and 28: Leave out new clause 69E.

Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Mr. Chairman, since
arnendrnent No. 2 is defeated, I think we
shouid restore the subsequent clauses, because

they were deleted from the bill to give effeet
to the arnendrnent.

ments toi the bill proposed by the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce, and
had rejected the sarne.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON moved the third
reading of the bill.
Hon, C. C. BALLA NTYNE: Honourable
senators, 1 wouid not want the impression to
prevaii that, since little has been said on this
side of the house the party I represent
approves generaliy of the taxes covered. by
this bill and the budget generaihy. The budget
has been unpopular, and bhas been received by
the public, more particularly by tbe taxpayers,
in a discouraging manner. The people of this
country, rightly or wrongly, looked for a
greater reduction in taxation than the budget
provided.
A further disappointment to the
taxpayer is that the small reductions in taxation do not take effeet until tbe flrst of
January 1947. I bave great syrnpathy for the
taxpayers in the iow incorne brackets. A
single man is now taxed on ail incorne above
,3750. I think a single person, maie or female,
.should be exempted on at ieast $1,000, and
a inarried man, on frorn $1,500 to $2,000.
Honourable senators, let me rnake a plea
once more for the white-collar*workers.
I
(annot understand wby, a year and a haif after
the w-ar is over, the izovernment stili maintains
the cciling on tbe wages of sucb people. The
ineonies of these people were frozen during
th, w-ar. Nobody in Canada objected to paying

taxes during the war. But now the war is over;
yet tens of thousands of good, loyal bard-

working people, because of the ceiling, are
(irawinig salaries that are altogetber too iow.
Why the Minister of Finance bas seen fit to
continue the ceiling is beyond my comprehension. I do not suggest for a moment that
controls should be wiped out with one stroke
of the pen. but I do say th-ere ought to be carefuI inv-stigýation into the need of controis, and
wlierce-er possible they shouid be graduaiiy
redtuccd.
Another factor that is retarding production,
in this country is the ceiiing on prices.

AUGUST 29, 1946
Because of strikes and disturbed conditions in
the United States and Canada the price of coal,
for instance, has gone up something like 70
cents a ton. The cost of labour lias increased,
but the price ceiling remains almost the sanie
as it was during the war.
I agree with the government tiiat three
things are required-production, revenue and
full employment. I would add anothermorale. Why flot offer some encouragement
to everybody in Canada, whether they are
employed in the production of goods or otherwise? At the last session of parliament I
referred ta the fact that the morale of the
Canadian people was at a very low ebb. It is
lower now than it was a year ago, ail due
to the restrictive measures 1 have mentioned.
The Excess Profits Tax in a modified form
bas been retained in Canada, while in Great
Britain, the United States and New Zea]and
similar measures have been abolished. Our
brain trust, the sole advisers ta the Minister
of Finance, always want to turn the screw of
taxation one more turil to sce what thýey can
get out of the people. No doubt they have
advised the Minister of Finance to continue
the Excess Profits Tax.
This morning I had the great privileg.e of
meeting Field Marshal Viscount Montgomery,
and-I was much impressed by bis statement
that the human element won the battie of
El Alamein and ail the other batties of his
brilliant campaign. The government, it appears to me, does flot pay very much attention
to the hums.u element. This element symbolizes enthusiasm and courage-qualities inherent in business enterprise. But to-day our
people are discouraged and say: "What le
thec use of trying? We cannot save a dollar."
Thosýe in another category exclaim: "What
is the use of developing our business? When
we die the government will take away most
of the resulis of our enterprise and labour!"
If we live to see another budget brought
down, as I hope we shahl, I trust that it will
present ta us a much brighter picture than
la reflected in the statement for the present
fiscal year.
My honourable friend from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) referred ta, the
happy state of affairs thirty years ago-a
period that I know so well-when government.
and free enterprise walked together in harmony. Then the government did not feel
that its prestige would be lessened by asking
people in all walks of life what changez they
thought sbould be made ini the tariff. As a
matter of fact, the honourable member from
Churchill will recall that in those days we
used to, have a tariff commission going about
the country holding sittings at which the public were invited to present their views on

775

tariff questions. I know that forty yesra ago1 can go back further than my honours.ble
friend--our ministers of finance consulted their
friends and the people from one end of the
count~ry to the other with respect ta fiscal
matters. Under the present bureaucratie system. the Minister cf Finance does not consuit
anybody outaide hie departmnent. He leaves
questions cf finance and taif ta, four specialists--very nice curteous fellows, ail weil
versed academically, but flot a single one with
any business experience.
The motion was agreed ta, and the bil was
read the third time, and passed.
BUSINESS 0F TEE SENATE
lIon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable senstors, before moving the adi ournment of the
house I should likp to rp'fer to onie or two
matters.
The Cominittee on Banking and Commerce
bas one more bill ta consider-the Canadian
Commercial Corporation Bill. A meeting had
beýen planned for 8 o'clock this evening, but in
view of their recent arduous labours, I tbink
the committeea should nlot meet before 10.30
to-morrow morning. It is only fair ta suggest
that they take a holiday this evening.
Hon. Mr. MORAUT>: May I ask the honourable leader of the government if it is indiscreet
ta inquire whether there are any other bills
to come before us?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As far as I am
advised, there are not.
Hon. Mr. LEGER: What about the supply
bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Except the supply
bill.
Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Is the leader in
a position to give us any further indication
as ta the possible date of prorogation?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: As far as I have
been able ta ascertain, there is every hope
and expectation that parliament will conclude
its work this week, and that prorogation will
take place by Saturday night.
I taçe this opportunity of asking as many
honourable senators as possible ta, remain until
Saturday evening. Many honourable members
who come from a distance have been away
fromn their homes for a long time. It is difficult
for me ta urge them to remain, but it is necessary that the business of this country be
carried on as far as we are concerned. I hope,
therefore, that ail bonourable members-particularly those who live in the vicinity of
the capital, and who 'have been able ta get

SENATE

home every week-.end-will seriously consider
the convenience of members who live farther
away, and will be on hand until Saturday
nighit.

Circumstances beyond my contrai make it
necessary for me to be absent from Ottawa
to-morrow and Saturday. I have asked the
honourable senator frani Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) to lead the bouse in my absence.
Ini case parliament should be prorogued before
I return, I take this opportunity of expressing
my appreciatian to, honourable members for
the courtesy they have extended ta me. I
refer flot only to supporters of the government, but ita members of the apposition,
especially their leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) and
the acting leader af to-day .(Hon. Mr. Ballantyne). I realize that I arn surrounded by
men of great and long political experience.
Tbey have been most farbearing with regard
to the sins of omission and commission which,
due ta inexperience, I have undaubtedly
committed.
I hope, bonourable members will have a
vcry happy soi ourn, and will camne back ta the
next session of parliament resolved ta, do
even greater things.
Hon. Mr. FOSTER: And have a nice summer?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON. That is hardly
possible.
Anyone wbo is under the impression that
the Liberal majority ini this house is a rubber
stamp for the government would soon be
undeceived if he occupied my position.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh!

Hon. Mr. BALLANTYNE: Honourable
senatars, I wish to thank flic govcrnment
leader for the very kind reference he bas made
ta the members of this chamber, particularly
to those wbo sit on this side of the bouse.
We have been treated in a very caurteaus and
fair manner by tbe leader on ail occasions,
and I believe that ail througb this long and
arduous session the Senate bas functianed
with a great deal *of cordiality. During the
fifteen years tbat I have been a member of
this bouse I have neyver known the Senate. to
work barder or do mare efficient work than it
bas donc this session. Notwithstanding the
bit of fun that certain newspapers in this
country eboose ta poke at us, I for one amn
very proud of the work this bouse has
aeeomplished.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Hear, bear.

CANADIAN COMMERCIAL
CORPORATION BILL
REPORT 0F COMMITTEE

Hon. J. E. SINCLAIR, Acting Cbairman,
prescnted the report of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce on Bill 251,
an Act ta establisb the Canadian Commercial
Corporation.
He said: Honaurable senators, the cammittee have examined the said bill, and nuw
beg leave to repart the same with the following amnendments:
1. Page 2, line 31. After "Canada" insert
"and".
2. Page 2, line 32. Leave out "and".
3. Page 2, line 33. Leave out " (c) storing
and processing goods or commodities".
4. Page 3, line 36. For "a statement of such
aceounts" substitute "bis report".
5 « Page 4, lines 18 and 19. Leave out "in such

form as the Minister may prescribe".
6. Page 4, line 20. Af ter "March" insert
"containing its financial statements and such information as is required to be furnished ta
shareholders by a companiy incarporated under
the Companies Act, and such other information
as the Minister may prescribe".
7. Page 5, after line 39.

as clause 17:

Insert the following

"17. (1) This Act shall expire sixty days
after the commencement of the first session of
Parliament commencing in the year one thousand nine hundred and forty-nine.
(2) Section nineteen of the Interpretation

Act shaîl apply upon the expiry of this Act

as if this Act had then been repealed."
For tbe benefit of banourable members who

did not bave an appartunity ta be present at
the committee's meeting, I might explain that
these amendments are mostly of a minor char-

acter, only two of themn being of mucb imýportance. One of these refers ta the making of
financial statements by the companry. The
eommittee added a clause requiring the comnpany ta furnish financial statements and sucb
information as is required ta be furnished ta
shareholders by a compan2y incorporated under

the Companries Act, and such other information as the minister may prescribe. Tbe other
amendment limits tbe time tbat the act wihl
remain in force. No limit is specified in the
bill, and tbe committee added clause 17,
whieh pravides that the act shaîl expire 60
days after tbe commencement of the first
session of parliament commeneing in the year
1949.

AUGUST 30, 1946

PROROGATION-BUSINESS OF THE
SENATE
Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN: Since we have
now completed the business on our order
paper, I think that before moving the adjournment I should inform honourable senators as
to the prospects of prorogation. The latest
information I have indicates the possibility,
perhaps rather remote, that the other chamber
will conclude its work late tonight. On the
other hand, it may not be able to do so
until some time tomorrow. The only remaining legislation to come before us is the appropriation bill, which I imagine we shall be able
to deal with fairly quickly.
Under these circumstances I would move
that when the Senate adjourns this afternoon
it do stand adjourned until tomorrow at
10.30 a.m.
The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

PROROGATION OF PARLIAMENT
The Hon. the SPEAKER informed the
Senate that he had received a communication
from the Assistant Secretary to the Governor
General, acquainting him that the Honourable
Thibaudeau Rinfret, Chief Justice of Canada,
acting as Deputy of His Excellency the
Governor General, would proceed to the
Senate Chamber this day at 4 p.m. for the
purpose of proroguing the present session of
parliament.
SPEECHES IN THE SENATE
PROPOSAL FOR TIME LIMIT

That the time has arrived when the Senate
should place a time limit on the length of
speeches in the Senate.

Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Stand t-for the earnest consideration of the Rules Committee at
of the next session of
the commencement
parliament.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh! Oh!
PROROGATION-BUSINESS OF THE
SENATE
A. K. HUGESSEN: Honourable
Hon.
senators, we have now concluded the business
on the order paper. As you are aware, the
other chamber did not finish its work late
last night, but it is fully expected it will do
so within the next few hours. Then we shall
have before us the supply bill. I hope it will
reach us by three o'clock this afternoon, and
in the meantime I would suggest that we
adjourn during pleasure, on the understanding
that the bell will ring at three o'clock. This
will enable us to deal with the supply bill and
be ready for prorogation by four o'clock.
As we have not the supply bill before us
in its final form, may I take this opportunity
to give you the following information? There
will be, first, an appropriation of some
888,000,000 odd to cover the balance of the
main estimates after taking into account the
five interim supply bills passed at various
times during the session; second, an appropriation of $142,000,000 odd, to cover the supplementary estimates, particulars of which were
circulated among you a few weeks ago; and
third, an additional supplementary estimate
of $2,000,000 for a loan to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Of course there may be
other items, but this is very improbable.
Hon. Mr. CRERAR: What was the first
item?
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: To be exact,

$888,954,394.10.

If my suggestion meets with the approval of
the bouse, I would now move that we adjourn
during pleasure, to reconvene at 3 o'clock this
afternoon.
Hon. L. MORAUD: I presume that my
honourable friend, the acting leader of the
government, does not anticipate any debate
on the vote in respect of supply. A very large
sum of money is involved, and at this late
hour of the session it is impossible for the
members on this side of the chamber to take
cognizance of and study this important measure. My hope is that next session bills of
such great consequence as the one yet to come
will reach us in time to enable us to give them
proper consideration.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I fully agree with
the sentiment expressed by my honourable
friend.

778

SENATE

The motion was agreed to.
The Senate adjourned during plepasure.
The sitting was resumed.
APPROPRIATION BILL No. 6
FIRST READING

A message was received from the House of
Commons with Bill 393, an Act for the granting to His Majesty certain sums of money for
the public service of the financial year ending
31st Marcb, 1947.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

Hon. A. K. HUGESSEN moved the second

reading of the bill.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill,
which has just reached us from the other place,
covers the balance of supply for the current
fiscal year. In section 2 it provides for a vote
of $888,954,394.10, to complete the vote required for the ordinary estimates for the year,
after taking into account the amounts already
voted under five interim supply bills which
have been passed by parliament during the
course of the session.
Section 3 calls for a vote of $142,644,296.99
to cover the supplementary estimates, which
have been in the hands of honourable members for some time.
Under section 4 a further vote of $2,000,000
is asked for to cover a loan to the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation.
The remaining clauses of the bill are in the
usual form of measures of this character.

If honourable senators will turn to the summary of the estimates for the current year they
will observe that the total amount to be voted
is approximately $1,566,000,000. The difference
between this sum and the $888,900,000 covered
by this bill is the amount previously voted by
interim bills.
As honourable members are aware, the
expenditure of a considerable amount of money
is authorized by statute and does not require
an annual vote by parliament. The principal
items under this head are an amount of
$580,000,000 for the Department of Finance,
representing, principally, the interest on the

national debt, and approximately $285,000,000
for the Department of National Health and
Welfare, representing the payment of family

allowances and old age pensions.
The total required to be voted for the cur-

rent year, plus the total authorized by statute,
amounts to $2,769,000,000. This sum, together
with the supplementary estimates now before
us, makes the total estimates for the current
year $2,902,000,000.
I have had a short tabulation prepared in
compendious form giving a break-down of
how this amount of $2,902,000,000 is to be
expended. Honourable members will recall
that when the Minister of Finance introduced
his budget in the other place he stated that
by far the largest single item of expenditures
for the current year would relate to demobilization and reconversion resulting from the recent
war. This will be apparent from the tabulation,
which is as follows:

Breakdown of Estimates for 1946-47
(millions of $)

Demobilization and Reconversion:

Main

Estimates
War Service Gratuities and Rehabilitation Credits....
National Defence, including mainly pay of the armed
forces, cost of equipment and supplies, upkeep and
administration of military establishments ..........
Veterans' Affairs, including $75 millions for pensions,
$101 millions for post-discharge rehabilitation
benefits, and $23 millions for hospitalization......
Reconstruction and Supply, including mainly termination of war contracts ($80 millions), housing
development ($42 millione), crown plants ($20
millions), coal production ($12 millions) ..........
Finance, including mainly price control and subsidies
($102 millions), wheat board ($18 millions) ......
Agriculture, mainly food subsidies ($52 millions), and
subsidies on feed grains ($25 millions)............
All other items, mainly vocational training ($18 millions), unemployment insurance ($12 millions), old
age pensions ($9 millions) and civil aviation ($13
millions). Note: These figures represent only that
part of the cost of old age pensions and unemployment insurance provided for under authority of the
War Measures Act.....

Hon. .L. MORAUD: Honourable senators,
thiere is an utteÉr lack of proportion between
the huge total of $2,900,000,000 that we are
now asked. to approve and the time Ieft for
studying the details. We on this side of the
chamber have fromn ye'ar to year protested
against the way in which the final appropriation bill is submitted to us at virtually the
iset minute of the session. In the very short
tume at ùur disposai we cannot adequately
analyse these estimates. Had we the opportuni-ty, we would scrutinize very closely
in pence tume the expenditure of M50,000,000
for the Department of National Defence and
335,000,000 for old age pensions. There are
sa good many other items that should be
analysed, but simply because of this very
unsatisfactory procedure of sending the supply
bill ta us at this late hour, this cannot
be àone. The only thing we can do is ta
repeat our protest against this unbusinesslike
practice, which is unf air not only to the public
but also to the members of this cham-ber, and
ta exprests the hope that t.his will be the hast
occasion on which we shall have to renew
our .protest. We -on thie aide oyf-the bouse
will very reluctàntly vote for the second
reading of the bull.
Hon. VINCENT DUPULS: Honourable
senators, I think it is appropriate, even at
this late hour, to correct sanie false impressi<>ns that might be lefft in the public mind
by the remarks -of the honourable senatoir
who has just taken bis meat (Hon. Mr. Moraud). It ào of course the raie of Hie
Mai esty's Loyal Opposfttn âlways to be
reluctant ta support anything that the governnient may do, but this struggle between
parties is the vetry basis of aur parlisamentary
systeni. May I compliment the honourable
senatoe on the able wày in w.hich he hs
piayed hie role in the short time at hie disposai. Rowever, I tbink it only proper that
the publie shouid know that theae estimates
have been subjecit to thorough investigation

by ahi parties in the Huse of Gommons,
where, as we know, ail expenditures are subjected to close study and keen criticism.
Varieus sections of these estimates have for
months been under discussion by committees
of the other house, and we may rest assuired
that the supply bill is, if I may use the
expression, already cooked and reedy for our
digestion.
If I were on the opposition aide in this
house-s I waa for soie years in the Commons-I would do exactly as the honourable
senator opposite has done, I would. make a
few very strong remarks about the shortnea
of time, and so forth.
Hon. Mr. ST-PÈRE: Would that affect
your stand?
Hon. Mr. DUPUIS: I a democratic country like ours the public is sometimes under
the impression that towards the end of the
session parliament votes in, figuratively, a
few minutes, and without due consideration,
billions of dollars for the public service. I
think it is wehl that we should do our best
ta convince the public that this impression
is erroneous, wnd that ail expenditure le
studie.d very careuhly and discussed at length
before it ie approved.
Hon. W.' RUPERT DAVIES: Honourable
senators, while I do not wish to delay the
passing of this bill, may I ask the leader of
the governinent if he would explain the purpose of the 32,000,000 which we are now
asked ta vote for the Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation?
Hon. Mr. H'UGESSEN: If my honourable
friend will refer ta Schedule C of the bull he
will observe that the $2,000,000 is ta be
voted by way of a boan ta the Canadian
Broad.casting Corporation. Franly, I am nat
aware of the details of the expenditures for
which this boan is required. It is therefore
difficult for me te advise the honourable
member of its purpose. He of course knows

SENATE
that this item was considered in the other
chamber only yesterday afternoon; and as
yet I have not had the opportunity of
reading the reasons advanced by the minister
in charge of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation when he asked for this loan. If I
attempted to give more details I might fall
into error.
May I say to my honourable friend from
La Salle (Hon. Mr. Moraud) that I heartily
agree with the substance of his observations.
We should, however, bear in mind that we
are not now being asked to vote these vast
sums of money without any previous knowledge of what they are being spent for. The

sum of $888,000,000 to which I referred a
moment ago-which is the greater portion of
the total amount-represents monies required
for the various departmental activities specified in considerable detail in the estimates,
which have been before us since the month
of March.
If any honourable member on
either side of the house had objections, it
would have been quite in order for him to
have made his voice heard during the session
when we were passing the 'five interim supply
bills.
Hon. Mr. SINCLAIR: Or in the Finance
Committee.
Hon. Mr. HUGESSEN: I am sure the
honourable gentleman does not wish to leave
the impression that we are now asked to
consider these amounts for the first time.
Hon. Mr. MURDOCK: Honourable senators, a printed record was given to us the
other day explaining the loan to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It reads:
Loans and Investments
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
Vote No. 965. Loans to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation repayable with interest at
a rate to be fixed by the Governor in Council
on such terms and conditions as the Governor
in Council may determine and to be applied in
payment of expenditures on the construction,
extension or improvement of capital works of
the broadcasting facilities of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation in Canada. Such
loans, with interest, shall be a charge on the
revenues of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation next after the charge imposed under the
provisions of Section 17 of the Canad.ian Broadcasting Act, 1936..................
$2,000,000.
Hon. Mr. MORAUD: Honourable senators, I understand that beyond the 82,000,000, we are asked to vote a sum of $3,500,000,
making a total of $5,500,000 to the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
senators, is it your pleasure to concur in the
second reading of this bill?
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

AUGUST 31, 1946
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE

After which the Honourable the Deputy of
the Governor General was pleased to close the
Second Session of the Twentieth Parliament of
the Dominion of Canada with the following
speech:
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the House of Commons:
A year has passed since hostilities ceased
with the surrender of Japan. The world is
but slowly emerging from the turmoil and
ravages of war. The domestic problens of
individual nations have become inseparably
linked with the problems of all nations.
Of international problems, the world shortage of food bas caused the greatest immediate
concern. It is a source of gratification to the
people of Canada to know that our country
has provided over one-fifth of the supply of
food to relieve the greatest famine in human
history. The government bas continued to give
practical expression to the whole-hearted desire
of the Candian people to relieve human suffering and to contribute to international tranquility.
My ministers are continuing their efforts to
restore and expand peacetime markets for the
surplus production of our country. In the
period of transition, exports to our wartime
allies have been flnanced in part by credits
voted by parliament. In accordance with this
policy, you have approved a financial agreement with the United Kingdom and made a
further amendment to the Expert Credit
Insurance Act.
A bountiful crop, which will help in meeting the demand for food, now seems assured.
An agreement has been made with the United
Kingdom for the marketing of our wheat. The
wheat agreement. with agreements for the
marketing of other foodstuffs already in operatien, will greatly assist the government in its
policy of maintaining stable prices for agricultural products.
The demand. both at home and abroad, for
Canadian manufactures bas never been greater.
Production at a high level is required both to
meet this demand and to check inflationary
pressure on prices.
The wartime battle against inflation has

gradual measures of decontrol, and a shift to
a selective price ceiling, the rise of prices has
been held well in check. To this end, a most
important step was the restoration of exchange
parity with the United States dollar.
The conversion of our war industries to
peacetime production has been achieved more
smoothly and speedily and with less dislocation than might have been expected. Opportunities for employment have been maintained
at a high level and the transfer to civilian
occupations of displaced war workers and
demobilized veterans is being accomplished
swiftly and effectively.
In recent weeks essential production has
been slowed down, and the dangers of inflation increased, by stoppages of work in cer63268-51

tain key industries. My ministers endorse the
view of the Standing Committee on Industrial
Relations that continued price control is
only possible with a reasonable measure of
wage control. The government is firmly convinced that the exercise of moderation and
restraint by all parties is essential to the
satisfactory adjustment of labour disputes and
the maintenance of the high level of production, without which there cannot be ample
opportunities for employment.
The repatriation of the armed forces is now
virtually completed. It is anticipated that the
wives and children of veterans will almost all
have been brought to Canada by the close of
the present year. The demobilization of the
wartime army, navy and air force is likewise

been laid for the permanent peacetime defence
forces.
A series of measures relating to war veterans
has been enacted, with the object of making
provision for the veterans, and for the dependents of the fallen, worthy of the service and
sacrifice of Canada's armed forces.
In Canada, as in other countries, the housing shortage has grown more acute since the
end of the war, despite the provision of a
large supply of new housing. In order to
increase the efficiency of governmental action,
the responsibility for housing has been largely
concentrated in one minister of the crown. The
National Housing Act has been amended to
expand facilities for the provision of housing.
The British North America Act has been
amended by the United Kingdom Parliament in
accordance with the request contained in a joint
address adopted by both houses of parliament.
The amendment will have the effect of maintaining more effectively the historic principle of
representation by population, in the representation of the people in the House of Commons.
You have enacted a measure to clarify and
define Canadian citizenship and to make it the
distinctive status of the people of this country.
The Immigration Act has also been amended to
bring it into conformity with the revised definition of Canadian citizenship.
Other bills enacted include measures respecting the armed forces, the development and control of atomic energy, the National Research
Council, the Department of External Affairs,
the operation of crown companies, the Exchequer Court, the remuneration of judges, the
investigation of combines, foreign exchange control, unemployment insurance, war crimes and
the Federal District Commission.
The Dominion-Provincial Conference resumed
its meetings on April 25, and adjourned on
May 3. The conference not having reached
unanimous agreement, proposals in respect to
taxation were subsequently made which could
be accepted by the provinces individually.
These proposals have been accepted in principle
by three provincial governments. Preliminary
discussions are under way with certain other
provinces. It is hoped that ultimately general
agreement embracing all the provinces may be
concluded.
Your approval has been given ta the membership of Canada in the World Health Organizatien and in the United Nations Educational,
Scientifie and Cultural Organization. Canada

has continued to give the utmost support to the
varjous agencies of the United Nations.
Early in the session, the Prime Minister
visited the United Kingdom to join in consultations on matters of common concern with the
Prime Ministers or their representatives of
other nations of the British Commonwealth.
Canada is represented at the conference convoked to consider the treaties of peace with
Italy and the Axis satellites of Southern and
Eastern Europe which opened its proýceedings
in Paris on July 29, by a delegation presided
over, et the outset, by the Prime Minister.

Members of the House of Commons1 thank you for the provision you have made
for ail essentiel services.
The further measure of relief f rom the wartime burden of taxation to be effected at the
beginning of the new year will he cordially
welcomed.
Honourable Members of the Senate:
Members of the House of Commons:
May Divine Providence hless your deliberations and guide the nations in the establishment
of a just and durable peace.
