He said: Honourable gentlemen, I desire,
with the leave of the buse, to present this
formaI motion for the purpose of expediting
our divorce proceedýings. These Bills passed
the Senate and weré sent to the flouse of
Commons. It bas been learned by the officiaIs
of the Senate, after conference with officiais
of the other ýChamber, that hefore the Bis
can be released by the Commons it will be
necessary for the Senate to send a formal
message requesting- that they be returned.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: May I ask, is Parliament open or not?
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: Honourable gentlemen, I do flot think that this procedure is
quite in order. Fromn time immemorial it
has been dustomary to assert and guarantee
our rigbt by introducing a Bill pro forma.
While we may have the privilege of making
motions, no actual legislation is initiated before the King's representative has graciously
delivered the Speech from the Throne. In
my opinion the motion of my bonourable
friend is out of order.

elucidated. I am not at the moment prepared
to discuss it, but I know that a motion of that
kind is not customary in England, nor bas
it been bere for the forty-one years during
which I have been in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
bonourable
gentlemen, I am not prepared to discuss the
point raised by the bonourable gentleman. I
hring in this motion with the approval of
those wbo, I think, are conversant with the
rudles, and I rely upon the judgment of the
flouse.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Do I under-

stand tbe bonourable gentleman raises a point
of order?
bon. Mr. POIRIER: I do raise it. Not
for the sake of opposing my honourable
friend's (Hon. Mr. Willoughby's) motion, but
rather to clarify tbe situation, I would like
to have tbe question settled wbether, before
dealing with tbe Speech from the Throne, we
ought to initiate legisiation other than a Bill
pro f orma, which asserts our right. For
centuries it bas been the practice, through
coui4tesy, to init-iate no legisiation before the
Speech from the Tbrone 'bas been delivered.
Honourable
The Hon. the SPEAKER:
gentleman, I would explain t.hat the proposed
motion of the honourable gentleman from
Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) had not
heen brougbt to my attention, but, speaking
off-hand, without having lad time to study
the whole question, I would say that there is
notbing disoourteous in whjat 'bas been done,
inasmuch as it is simaply a formai matter as
between the two bouses. We find ourselves
in the position of requiring certain information
fromn tbe bouse of Commons, and aIl that is
proposed is to send a message asking that
bouse to, return certain documents. The
motion is not a matter of legisiation. No Bill
has been introduced.
Tbe mot-ion was agreed to.

LATE

HON.

SENATORS

DAVID, McHUGH AND

THIBAUDEAU.

BLAIN

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, we mourn the loss of four of our
members who have left us since we separated
at the end of last session.
Two of them were
from my native province and two from
Ontario.
The first to depart was Senator Thibaudeau,
who was likewise the first to enter the Senate,
having been appointed under the Laurier
Administration in August, 1896. He was distinguished by his leader as one of the merchant
princes of Montreal, representing an old established firm of high repute, founded in Quebec

nent to the Senate it was said an additional
reason why he should be the first selected by
Hon. Wilfrid Laurier was that his father, Honourable Isidore Thibaudeau, had given his
seat in Quebec East to Mr. Laurier after his
defeat in Drummond and Arthabaska, when
he was seeking re-election as a member of the
Mackenzie Administration.
was blessed with
Senator Thibaudeau
qualities and virtues which are the attributes
of perfect citizenship.
In domestic and social
life he was ,surrounded by the affection to
which the sweetest of dispositions entitled him.
He was a Governor of the University of
Montreal and a generous contributor to many
philanthropie institutions. He had studied in
England and in France, and his training had
been of the best. He was modesty itself, and
though of a retiring disposition, his judgment
was good and his advice was sought by many.
The next to depart was Senator David, at
the ripe old age of 86 years. He seemed to
be twenty years younger, for his appearance
and demeanour did not give the impression
of advanced age; yet for more than 60 years
he was in the limelight as journalist, historical
writer and politician. Called to the Bar in
1864, he practised law in Montreal, at the
same time being an active contributor in the
journalistic field.

ranks when that party was for freer trade.

beioved by his province, and, I have reason
to believe, by ail bis colleagues in this
Chamber. They listened te him with attentien and respect on ail matters which he
approached, because of bis ripe judgment and
his earnestness.
With our two Ontario colleagues I was less
intimate. Their demise occurred at about the
same time, just as this Parliamýent was being
called.
Senator MeHugli was a farmer who had but
a primary school education. As he grew up
ho soon became interested in matters of
public concern. H1e was net content te do
the routine work of bis occupation. His mind
travelled beyond bis farmn and township, and
he gave bis leisure heurs to reading books
and papers which came within bis reach. H1e
soon interested himself actively in political
debate and participatcd in many an electorai
fray. 11e was elected te the House of
Commons in 1896 and sat for four years in
Parliament. Defeated in 1900, he was called

.old that amqng bis people he was noted for
bis kindness of heart, bis constant readiness
te belp, bis religieus mind and profound
convictions.
Senator Blain had net completed the span,
generally hoped for, of tbree score years and
ten, yet had a most fruitful career in publie

ife. H1e was a hardware merchant in the
town of Brampton, but bis influence seon
radiated beyond its borders. When quite
young he entered the Town Council, in which
he served for ten years. H1e became Reeve
of Br'ampton, and eoon thereafter Warden of
Peel County. The electors of that county
sbowed their confidence in him by electing
him te the House of Commens in 1900, and
that confidence he retained in the three following ciections, 1904, 1908 and 1911. 11e had
streng party convictions and was one of the
main participants in debate, in the popular
Huse. He was quite aggressive and often
in the thick of the llght. H1e did net fear the
blows, which he returned. gallantiy. Called
te this Chamber in 1917, be seon felt the influence of aur more peaceful atmosphere, and,
like many of our celleagues who have hailed
from the bouse of Commons, meliowed in a
marked degree. He interested himself in the
serieus work of the Senate, which is mestly
done in cemmittees, and gained the esteem
of bis colleagues te the point of being made
Chairman of the Standing Committee on Railways. H1e leaves us inuch tee seen, fer the
experience whicb. he bad gathered would have
continued te be of great benefit te us; but
the designs of Providence are inscrutable.
To the families of our departed colleagues
I desire te extend the warm sympathies of the
Senate.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Henourable gentlemen,
for myseif and for the other members on this
side of the bouse I wish te joîn witb the
honeurable gentleman whe bas just spoken,
in extending our sympathy te the families
of the four Senators wbose loss we meurn.
It is sad te part with men with whom. you
have sat for many years, net oniy in this
bouse, but aise in Cemmittee, and whese
work you have seen and admired fer the care
and thought whicb they gave te it. Neyertheless, when a man attains a good old age,
as did ail four of these gentlemen, and leaves
behind him a record of work well done and a
name that is respected by everyone, we may
weil ask what better fate awaits any of us.
We shaîl be lucky indeed if we can leave
behind us a if e record like that of the late
henourable member for Mille Iles (Hon. Mr.
David), whom 1 knew se well and admired
se much. The others I knew net quite se
well, but stýili well enough te be able te concur in ail that bas been se aptly said about
them by my bonourable friend. They were
worthy of the position they beld in this House.
To the families of those departed Senators
we extend our sympatby.

Will the honourable gentleman tell us why he bas made

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: As a matter

Your Excellancy fer the gracious Speech which
Your Excellency has addraesad Vo, both Houss
of Parliamant.
Ha said: Honourable gentlemen, while I
risa with a full appraciation of the honour
which bas been conferred on me as mover
of this Address, I rise with soe reluctanca
aise, because I f eel that I amn addressing a
body composed largaly of men of much wider
and riper experience in public affaire than I
possess.
The Addrass which bas been brought down
covers many questions, and touches upon
problems affecting aIl parts cf Canada, but
it je my intention te deal merely with soe
of those which te my mind are of outstanding importance, and I hope te do se with
as mauch freedom as possible from partizan
spirit.

I should lika to refer, first of ail, to the
change which has takan place in the represantation of the Crown in this Dominion.
Since we wera last here the represantative
who filled the position cf Governor General
fer four or fiva yaars has gene frem. us. If
there was oe mark which hae left upon the
country more strongly than anothar it was,
I think, his desire te, bacoma acquamnted with
Canada at large. Ha always preached the
doctrine of unity, and thus, in my judgmant,
eet an example net only Vo those cf us who
sit in Parliament, but te, the people generally.
If thera is division in Canada it is largaly due
te the fact that thera je not complete knowledge of our country. Lord Byng miade it
hie business during his terni cf office to visit

'l

almost ail the nooks and corners of Canada.
I doubt very mueh whether any other rapresentative of the King covared so snuch territory, or saw so much of Canada as hie did;
and hie has gone back to Great Britain, may I
say, as an ambassador of Canada, for already
hae ie presenting to the people of the Motherland his impressions of this country, and advancing ite intereets.
To replace him we have a distinguished
public servant, a man who hins filled positions
in p~ublic aifé ini Great Britain and the British
Dominions, a man of wide experience in public
affairs who, juat before coming to Canada,
fdlfilled a delicate and iimportant mission for
the British Governinent in China, if I racollect
precisely. Though hie hien been with us on.ly
a few menths, I think 1 may safely say that
hie has already won a ve-ry wairm place ini the
esteem and affection of the people of Canada.
Another intimation in the Speech from. tjhe
Th.rone appesils to all Canadians, and partieuiariy -to those of the Province of Ailberta, in
which 1 happen, to, live. The announcement
is maide thst the Prince of Wale is to be
with us next yoe&r on the occasion of the
sixtieth anniversary of Conifederation. 1 look
upon the Prince of Wales flot only as a mnember of tihe Royal Family, but aise as a citizen
of Canada, because this is oe part of the
Emnpire that hie bas singled out for hie affections and intere3t. Hie has taken up ini that
Province a property which in not onlY

but in advertising Canada in other parts of
the world. Hie je setting an examle to our

P-robably the mnt important evant of recent
months hias been the Imperiai Conference just
condluded in London. There may be differences of opinion a to the conclusions resched
by that Cod!erence, but I arn bold enough to
say that in my judgment, no matter what
lias been, donea towards extending greatar freadom and responsibiity to the Dominions of
the Empire and krtheing thair autonomy,
nothi-ng bas occurred that wïtl waaken -the tien
that exist betwaen those Dominions and Grea~t
Britain and the anonarchy. I believe that the
greater the freedom concaded Vo the Dominions, the stronger wili be Vhe ties that hold
thern togat.her within the Empire. I tbink
that bas baen the case throughout our
whole history as an Empire. We can recal
the early struggles in this and otiier Dom!inions
for what they consi.dered responsible government and greater freedum, and as concassions

a

SENATE

were made in those respects our affections
for the Empire and for the Throne were
deepened. I am satisfled that such will be the
resulit of this Conference, whate.ver fears some
people may possess as to its endangering the
Empire itself.
Soirne of you may have read the banquet
speech delivered by Mr. Desmond Fitzgerald,
one o;f the representatives of the Irish Free
State, during ihe meeting of the Imperial
Conference in London. You aill irecahl the
part taken by Lord Birkenhead some years
ago in the strife in Ulster, and at that time
he was net recognized in any way as a friend
of Southern Ireland, but rather treated as one
of their outstanding Enemies. He presided at
this banquet in London, at which other distinguished British public men who had not
agreed with the viewpoint of Southern Ireland
were present, amtong them the Earl of Bailfour
and Sir Austen Chamberlain. I recollect that
in that speech Desmond Fitzgerald, who was
an enemy of Great Britain only a few years
before, (paid tribute to the treatment that had
been meted out to Southern Ireland by those
men who had opposed the agitation for Home
Rule. He there confssed that the concession
of responsible government to the Irish Free
State had brought about a deep regard for
the British Empire itselld.
Since the conference concluded we have had similar views
expressed by other leaders of the Irish Free
State, particularly by President-Cosgrave, and
also by General Herczog, the Prime Minister
of the Dominion of South Africa.
I doubt very much whether such views
would have been expressed prior to the meeting of the Imperial Conierence, but their expression following the decisions of the Conference is evidence that the action taken by
the Conferonce has brought about a higher
regard for the Empire itself, and a desire on
the part of two leaders, who in past times
were foes of Great Britain and the British
Empire, to remain within that Empire. That
being the case, we should not be alarmed in
egard to the proceedings of the Conference,
or its developments.
In that connection I might quote a sentence that I read only yesterday in a speech
delivered by IGeneral Hertzog in Cape Town
upon his return from the Conference. He declared that its results were not the work of
one section or another, but that they had
behind them the soul and spirit of the whole
British Empire. He said that we should look
upon those decisions not as the result of the
agitation of a few Dominions, but rather as
the outcome of the labours of representatives
from all the Dominions, particularly those of
the British Government.
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

The Committee dealing with Inter-Empire
Relations had as presiding officer the Earl of
Balfour, and he made this statement the other
day in regard to the decisions which the Conference had taken:
Equality does not mean separation. The Empire
is held together by broad loyalties and common
feelings of interest and devotion to the great
world ideals of peace and freedom more than
anything else. This was the bond of Empire
and if it was not enough, nothing else would be.
Any difticulty that might arise with regard to
the separate entity of each of the self-governing states

of the Empire, wherein

all were

equiial. would be overcomne in practice just as
diffieulties had been overcome at Geneva in
European affairs.
I an prepared to judge of the results of
that Conference from the views expressed by
statesmen of such long experience and great
prominence in our afairs as the Earl of Balfour.
Now, if I devote my remarks to one p.aragraph of the Speech more than to another,
it will be to that relating to the evidences of
prosperity existing in Canada at present. I
approach the subject without any party
spirit or boastfulness, but with a desire to
place hefore this Chamber, composed of men
representative of business and other interests
in this country, from possibly a sectional
viewpoint, at any rate a Western Canada
viewpoint, evidences of prosperity applicable
to one very great section of our country.
We naturally look for such evidences to
our trade returns, and improvement ie the
business we are doing with other nations is
evidence that Canada is prosperous. We find
that within one year there has been an
improvement in our export trade of over
$233,000.000.
I think that in experts alone,
in proportion to population, Canada to-day
stands second only to New Zealand in the
entire world, and in ifs total trade, in proportion to population, Canada stands sixth
among the nations. It is a notable fact that
the increase in our exports since 1913 has
been in the neighbourhood of 100 per cent.
That is a marked development over the prewar years, and is proof that Canada is in an
era of expanding prosperity.
If thi% Charmber desired other evidence of
our prosperity, one of the most notable
achievements has been in connection wiýth the
Canadian National Railways.
Only a few
years ago we were in despair about that
project; we were -continually hearing of deficits; but now we have reports of surpluses.
Four years ago there was reported a surplus
of 83000000. but this year we are led to
believe that the surplus wiMl be $45,000,000.
That condition could be brought about by

DECEMBER 14, 1926
onily two thin-gs-good management, and improvement in -conditions in the country. There
muet be increasing traffic for the railway be£ore a report of that character could be made;
oand that traffie has corne Vo both of the, great
railways -of this country because of cun.t'inued
developinent and improved industriel conditions in Canada.
Mc&îtion was made, and quite righly, of -the
gretlirvet in Canada at :large. On the
western plains -alarming conditions existed in
the early part 'of the harvest, seaisun, and it
was feared that what promised to 'be one of
be
the moist bountiful crops %wuuld eompletely
destroyed or largely damaged on account of
weather conditions. I think I :am warranted
in say.ing that conditions improved unt.il
praceticallyI the crop was aimuast as good as it
would have been haid not had weather interfered. At any raîte, -in the whole of Western
Canada there has been a very large crop,
with good financial -returns.
However, in viewing agricultuTai conditions
in Western Canada it. is a 'mistake to base
ou-r judgment as to the prosperity of that
'section of our Dominion on grain crops aluns.
It is truc that a few years ago grain was the
chief product of ur western f arms, 'but a vast
and very remarkable and welcome ehange 'las
tiaken place, and agricud-tural wealth is being
produoed not .only through crops of grain, but
aliso thrugh mixed farming. I shu.uld 1like
Vo eay soîmething about that particular developinent, 'because I sometimes think that the
country at darge is not a'cquainted with what
is taking 'place; and if I refer to the Province
of Alberta it wiIl 'be ýonly because I possess
the figures in regard, to the develupment of
that province.
A'lberta was created a province in 1905, but
five years 'before thýat, in 1900, the total value
of al the dairy products of the farms of that
province was bare'ly over $500,000. In 1924,
as shown by t'he ilst figures I have availabile,
the value of dairy pro-ductis in Alberta bad
reached a total of $23.000,0W0. That is ýpruof
that the western farmner has been heeding the
sjdviue given in past years by leaders in mndustry and fina.nce 'in. Eastern Canadia. Our
farinera probably did noV like the advice when
it wae given, but conditions warranted a
change frein grain-,growing 'alune to mixed
Mlthough when the province wes
farming.
creaVed Alberta was adbe Vo produce only
8ulicient dairy productas for its own use, there
was exported in a recent year over 4,000,00
pounde of butter to other parts uf the world.
In 1905 -the total value cf agricultural products
ini Alberta was $20,000,000; in 1925, this last
year, the value of agricultural productis in that
province alune reached the great suin of

9

$254,000,000. That is flot due to grain alone.
[t is due to this change in the character of
our farming, and the fact that our people are
engaging more and more in diversified agriculture.
A notable incident has occurred within the
past few weeks 'that I want to bring to your
attention in connection with a view that I
amn going to advance with regard to immigration. You aJl know of the International
Stock Exposition which is held at Chicago.
The awards made at that Exposition are regarded as carrying with theni the world's
championship. That is to say, a man who
goee there and wins a prize for grain is
recognized as the world's champion in that
fieldi. This year the 'chief prises for both
oats andi wheat went to a man whose farin
is situated in the Province of Alberta 450
milesl north of the American boundary. It is
an interesting fact that it is possible to raise
grain of prize-winning quality in sucli a
region. I might also recail that in 1876, fifty
years ago, long before the creation of the
Province of Alberta, the chief prise for wheat
at the Centennial Exhibition in Philadeiphia
was'awarded to a mana at Fort Vermilion, some
700 miles north of the American 'boundary.
That will establish in your mincis the vast
pooeibilities of that country, and w'ill help
you to realize that even in the most northern
sections it is possible to make a success of
agriculture.
But the point I wish to make has to do
with the immigration problem 'that is facing
the country. At nu time in Canada's history
have we needed people more than we do at
the present time. We have a huge debt; we
have a railroad problem; and the chief solution of our difficulties seemos to depend upun
bringing more people and more capital into
our country andi further developing our vaist
natural resources.
There are many angles to our immigration
problein. There are some peuple who say
- that we should bring into Canada only peuple
of British stock; there are others who hold
that it is in the interests of the country to
bring in peuple froin aIl over the world and
settle them on the plains of the West; there
are others who argue that above all we need
men of experience-that it is foolish tu settle
on the land men who have nu knowledge of
agriculture. I am inclined to agree with this last
opinion, but at the same time I do not argue
that men without agricultural experience cannut make, a su-ccesa of agriculture. The gentleman whu won the prize at Chicago this
year neyer saw a farm until a few years agu.
Hie f ought in the war, and after hais return he
went Vo the University of Alberta and grad-

10

SENATE

uated in civil engineering, and it was whi'le
he was engaged at his profession in the Peace
River country a few years ago that he decided to take up farming. This gentleman
is not the only one who, lacking practical
experience, has been able to make a success
of farming. There is in the Province of
Saskatchewan a gentleman named Mitchell,
who came out from 'Great Britain, where I
think he was engaged in an iron foundry,
and who on a number of occasions won prizes
at Chicago. In Alberta we have another distinguished farmer, Major Strange, who, I am
informed, knew nothing about agriculture
until after the war. All this goes to prove
that we cannot draw the line too sharply and
say that we will accept only men with 'experience. What we should desire more than
anything else is to secure men, preferably
Britishers, who are prepared to go upon a
farm and work for a year or two, if necessary,
in order to understand agriculture, before
investing their money in land. It would be
foolish to bring men here and encourage
them to invest their money in farms in the
Maritime Provinces, Quebec, Ontario, or the
West, unless they were prepared to go on
farms for a limited time, in order to gain
experience. As I say, we need population
more than anything else, and I do not think
we should limit our source of supply to the
British Isles. The bulk of the people of the
British Isles who are seeking new homes are
not agriculturists, and there are large numbers of people in certain sections of Europe
who would make desirable settlers and be
able to overcome the hardships that it would
be necessary for them to face in this country.
I think it is a mistake to paint too glowing
a picture of conditions here; I think it is
better to tell the truth, to let the people know
that we have hard winters and that if they
corne here they may have to put ùp with
hardships. It is very undesirable that we
should give them a wrong impression, because
then they become ambassadors of gloom and
send back reports that are anything but
favourable to this country. Let us teil them
the truth, so that they may be aware of the
problems that will confront them here.
Entirely apart from agriculture, western
Canada is making progress. Slowly and
surely other industrial activities are extending
over the western plains. The pulp industry
has been established in the Province of
Manitoba. In Alberta the beet sugar industry has only recently been started, and
although an investment of over $1,000,000 las
already been made by an American company
in plant in that Province, at the present time
the industry is able to meet only a portion
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

of the demand that exists in the Province of
Alberta itself. From this you will see that
there is room for considerable expansion and
for the establishment of other factories, and
all this development will tend to promote
agricultural prosperity.
We hear a great deal of criticism of United
States capital coming into this country.
American capital seerns to be more eager than
Canadian capital to develop our res&irces.
When we wanted to establish a beet sugar
industry we could do so only by means of
American capital; and when we want oanning
factories we apparently have to depend upon
the canning industry of the United States
rather than upon that of Canada. In my
opinion that is a mistake. I think that our
industries should have more confidence in this
country, and should be willing te do everything possible to encourage mixed farming
and manufaocturing.
I desire to mention very briefly a development that is taking place in the Province of
British Columbia, where last year the mineral
wealth was estimated at $68,000,000.
At
Kimberley, B.C., on the border of my own
province, there existe to-day one of the
greatest lead mines in the world. Those of
you who are familiar with the stock markets
have heard of the Sullivan Mine. That
development ias been gradual. Only recently
have the people begun to realize what is
taking place in East Kootenay. It is estimated that in that one small section of
British Columbia there will be a production
of 8,000 tons of lead ore per day, and it is
likely that another smelter will be established
to handle it.
I think it is only right that I should emphasize these facts relating to our prosperity
and development. This is a season of good
cheer, and if I can lay before honourable
Senators and others who may read my remarks a cheerful story, I shall feel that I have
rendered a service to the country.
I could touch upon other developments
taking place in Western Canada, but as they
are still in the initial stages, I am a little
fearsome about mentioning them. Some of
our eastern friends are skeptical about the
petroleum resources of Alberta, but wells have
already been brought in that are producing
great wealth, and vast sums of money are
being spent all over the province in the
search for resources that undoubtedly exist.
Right across the border from Alberta, in the
State of Montana, oil derricks can be seen
for miles and miles. Surely Providence did
not eut off that great natural resource at the
Canadian boundary; surely we have every
right to believe that it will be found on our

,aide of tlie une. If our hopes are borne out,
-vast suras of moiney tliat are now going out

Mention is made in the Speecli from tlie
Tlirone of the report of the Commission on
Sinoe we in tlie West
Maritime Riglits.
'have our prohlems, and since tliere lias been
niuch agitation concerning tliem, I feel warranted in expresing some sympathy with thie
people of tbe Maritimes, and I voice the
1-ope-and I think it is tlie hope of Western
-Canada-tiet, based on tbe report of thie
Commission, some solution of tliose problems will be found. On tlie otlier liend, I
think it is correct to say tliet the solution of
-most of the provincial problems rests witli
tlie provinces thernselves ratlier tlian the
,country et large. Thinking of the movement
,of the products of Western Canada by rail
and by water to tlie Britisli market, one
~naturally wonders why it is not possible for
the egriculturists of the Maritime Provinces
to d-evote themselves to tlie raising of tlie
products most in demand in Great Britain
ýand in Europe-live stock, dairy produets,
-and other commodities--wben ail tliey bave
to do in order to reacli a market is to, put
their produets on a vessel at Halifax or St.
John. It seems to me tliat a solution of et
]east some of tlie problems of tlie Maritime
farmers might be found in concentrating in
that wey.
At any rate, we ask for
,sympathetie consideration of tlie problems of
tlie Maritime Provinces, and we liope it will
flot be long until tliey enter upon the prosperous era tliat we feel we bave reached on
tlie Western plains.
Now I bave dealt witli the subjeets tliat I
particuiarly wanted te mention. In closing
I would urge upon you tlie view tbat tlie
great need of Canada at thie present time is
not only unity on the part of its people, but
also faith and vision. If we have e people
with faitli in tlie country and its resources,
and vision as to its future destiny, we need
flot fear for the welfare of Canada.
Hon. O. TURJGEON (Translation): Honcurable gentlemen, it was not without
misgîving tliat I aocepted tbe task of
seoonding tlie motion for an Address ini reply
to tlie Speech from. the Tlirone, being well
aware that, under tlie circumstances, a member
more capable than I could better deacribe
the financial and economic conditions of the
country and more effectively direct the
attention of the people of Canada to the
present situation.

But bel ore entering upon my subjeet I
desire to pay my respects to His Excellency
the Governor General, who for the first time
has convoked the Canadian Parliament and
laid before us a program for the study of
the most important questions affecting the
country. May I auure Hia Excellency that
his arrivai in. Canada is a source of pleasure
to ail. The great services which. he has
rendered to Great Britain and the Emire in
the various public missions witli which he bas
been entrusted are such as te, command our
admiration, and we are already certain that
bis soi ourn among us will be an increasingly
pleasant one. It gives me pleasure to join
with the mover of the Address, especially in
the name of the people of the castern
provinces of Canada, in extending a cordial
welcome to His Excellency, as well as to bis
noble and grecious consort, who lias likewise
succeeded in winning the sympathy, respect
and admiration of the Canadien people.
I desire to associate myseif with the mover
of the Address in the tribute of admiration
which lie hms just paid to our former Governor
General, Lord Byng. I, too, bave admired
Lord Byng's love for our country and the
interest, that he bas manif ested in ail our
relations. Indeed I may sey that no Canadian appreciates more liigbly than the humble
representative of Gloucester the work wliicli
Lord Byng bas done, not offly througbcut lis
term ini Cânada,. but especielly during tlie
war. With the exception of Marshal Foch
and one or two Britisli generals, lie certeinly
contributed most torwerds bringing the confliet
to a close. His name and achievements will
always be remembered by us and by our
posterity, and will forever occupy an lionoured
place in history.
It affords me mucli pleasure to be able to
say thet Canada lias for sonie time past
been enjoying an era, of prosperity which is
already remarkable and gives promise of

evidences of this in tlie spirit of the masses
of tlie people, wbo, instead of expressing
discontent, and fear for the future, are now
exchanging smiles expressive of liappîness and
proeperity.
Statisties sliow that there is hardly any
unemployment at present, and tliat industries
are daily increasing their output. Tliese
reports are confirmed by statements from
persons and firms who are in tlie best position to know tlie industrial and economic
conditions of the country; and tliey are
corroborated by tbe directors of our principal
Canadien banka, one of wbicli, tlie Royal
Bank of Canada, in its recent amical report,

SENATE

gave incontrovertible evidence of the increase
in trade and the development of our natural
resources to a degree hitherto unknown. We
have also the declaration of the Bank of
Montreal, the greatest financial institution in
Canada, indeed one of the greatest in the
world, which gives us definite reports of the
most encouraging kind with reference to the
future. These institutions declare that all
branches of trade are very active, and that,
notwithstanding keen competition, profits are
growing, and there is an increase of confidence
on the part of capital invested in the development of our natural resources, particularly in
the pulp and paper industry, in mining, and
in the utilization of the country's waterpowers. Such authorities are among the most
reliable.
It is also shown by official figures that since
the first of April of the present year no less
than 42.026 Canadians who had crossed the
boundary in the hope of improving their
fortunes have returned to Canada with the
intention of remaining here.
Immigration during the first six months of
the year 1926 reached a total of 122,848
persons-an increase of 63 per cent as compared with the figures for the corresponding
months of last year.
In the face of all this evidence we cannot
but believe that an era of increasing prosperity lias begun.
Furthermore, if we examine the railway
situation in Canada, we observe with pleasure,
and even surprise, the progress that has been
made in the operation of our National
Railwavs. The latest report of the Deputy
Minister of Railways of Canada sets forth the
improvement that bas taken place since our
railways were taken over by the Canadian
National Board. The impression created by
the report for 1925 is so favourable that we
begin to perceive the possibility that during
1926 the Canadian National System may be
able to pay out of its own revenues the full
amount of interest due to the public; and this
means that for the first time the System can
discharge all its obligations without borrowing,
for the payment of interest, from either the
Government or the people.
In this report of Major Bell it is stated
that ýduring the fiscal year 1921-22 it was
necessary to provide the sum of $183,000,000
on account of the Canadian National Railways, whereas in 1925-26 the amount supplied
by the Government was only $10,000,000. In
1920 the addition to the railway debt reached
$145,000,000, of whicb $14,000,000 came from
the Government and $131,000,000 from other
sources. In 1925 the addition to the railway
debt amounted to about $63,000,000, comHon.

Mr.

TURGEON.

prising $31,000,000 from the Government and
$31,000,000 on account of running expenses.
The report shows that the annual deficit has
been reduced from $80,000,000 to $41,000,000.
That gives us, I think, great encouragement
for the future, and it is to be hoped that
the same wise management will insure the
continuation of this period of prosperity. The
increase throughout Canada in the traffic of
our Canadian railways leads us to believe that
they will not only meet their expenses. but
become a source of revenue for the country.
Coming as I do from the Maritime Provinces, I find in the Speech from the Throne
certain clauses which are very reassuring. I
desire te refer to the report of the Royal
Commission which bas been investigating the
economic situation of the Maritimes. This
Commission was appointed by the Government last session-in the month of March, I
believe-and was authorized to enquire into
the causes of the numerous complaints coming
from the Maritime Provinces in recent years.
The Speech from the Throne announces that
the conclusions contained in the Commission's report are at present under oonsideration
by the Government, and that a Bill will be
introduced for the purpose of carrying out
these recommendations. With due reserve, I
venture to express the hope that the Government and Parliament will give effect to the
recommendations in so far as they are found
practicable and constitutional.
Honourable
members of the Senate are aware that I have
always been sensitive about any attempt to
change our Constitution, which the experience
of years lias taught me more and more te
respect.
One of the recommendations which I appreciate most is that concerning the fuel problem.
We are told that measures will be submitted
for the purpose of providing assistance to
works constructed for the production of
domestic coke from Canadian coal.
Coal mining is the chief industry of Nova
Scotia. The production of coal in that province bas decreased, and the cause is largely
the importation of coal from the United
States, especially into the provinces of
Quebec and Ontario, which have not the
advantage of possessing this great natural
resource. The proposal is often heard that
the duty on American coal should be increased.
Honourable members of this Chamber are
aware that I have never been a great admirer
of high tariffs, particularly on the necessaries
of life. An increase in the tariff would naturally raise the price to the consumers in the
two provinces which I have just mentioned;
whereas the establishment of an industry

DECEMBER 14, 1926
producing coke fromn Canadian ceal would
insure what might be cai'ied a Canadian
market for the output of the Nova Scotia
mines. I hope, therofore, that tho necessary
steps will be taken to give ail possible
encouragement te coking plants and thus
prornote a great expansion in both the
countrys trade and the traffic on our
railroads.
This conversion of Canadian ceai inte a
smokeiess domestie fuel of high quality, equal
to anthracite imported from the United States,
is an industry capable of great deveieprnent,
as yet hardiy perceived by the people.
Besidos coke, we can obtain by this process
a gas which is suitabie for domnestie and other
important- purposes. With scientifle treatment
our coal will also yield oils, and wiii develop
eiectric energy as cheapiy as our water.powers, which cannot be made available te
all corners of this vast Dominion. I congratulate the Government on having recognized
the potential value of this new industry.
The great question studiod by this Commis4sion is the problemn of transportation and
raiiway freight rates. Tranýsportation is a
vital question flot only for the Maritime
Provinces, but for the whole of Canada. The
resources of our country are immense-I
might say inexhaustibie; at ieast our fisherios;
but these resources are distributed over a vast
area extonding for throe or four thoussnd
miles froma the Atlantic coast to the Pacific.
Our home consunmption is entireiy inadequate
for our production. The most productive
regions are situated far from our seaports.
The Prairie Provinces, for instance, are
soparatod by great distances. from both the
Atlantic and the Paciflc coasts. It is the
increase of production in those provinces that
wiii contribute most to the prosperity of the
industrial provinces of Quebec and Ontario,
becauso greater agricultural yiold will mean
greater production of farm iinplements and
,other goods which the western provinces do
not manufacture. Similarly, the prosperity of
the Maritimes will contribute to the prosperity of the central provinces.
The development of our naturai resources
and the distribution of the products thereof
demand, therefore, intelligent and wise consideration on the part of the authorities
managing our raiiways. It is only by an
improvement of traffle that the raiiway situatien may be saved; and in this cennection
it is necessary for us te keep sa much traffie
as possible for our Canadian linos and Canadian seaports, instead of allowing traffie to be
diverted to. United States channels. The
utilizatien of our ports of Saint John and

13

Halifax is, in MY opinion, the best means of
preserving harmony -among our people and
giving a great impetus to their prosperity.
They are asking that the products of the
Weet be shipped by Canadian Atlantic ports.
It must neyer be forgotten that, had it not
been for our winter ports, Confederation
would probably neyer hâve taken place.
These ports still lack the necessary equipment for winter traffic, but I amn giad to
observe in Clause 16 of the Commission's
report a recommendation to the Federal
Government to establish under our laws, for
each of these ports, a harbour commission,
whose duty it should be to improve the
harbour s0 that gradually outiets wouid be
developed which would permit of business
being carried on in winter as weli as in
sumîner. I have always regretted the rejectien or postponement of these measures by
the people of Saint John. I feel sure tbey
will accept the present proposai. The development of our Atlantic ports will also increase
considerably the trade of Prince Edward
Island. It must be admitted that since the
beginning of the present year, 1926, the
President of the Canadian National Railway
Board, Sir Henry Thornton, has contributed
in large measure towards the improvement of
conditions in the Atlantic Division of the
System, and I arn confident that ho will
continue te carry out the program which be
has outlined.
I concur in the declaration of the Royal
Commission that the Atlantic Division should
extend to Levis instead of Rivière du Loup.
In fact, I asked a cou~ple of years ago, in
this Chamber, that that change be made.
I hope that the demand for a preferential
tariff on goods will be received with al
possible syrnpathy by the Raiiway Board, for
I arn certain that the reduction of freight
rates wouid soon be offset by the increase in
traffic.
The report of the Commission recommends
also a study of the question of provincial
subsidies, particularly those of the Maritime
Provinces. This problemn con be soivod only
by an Interprovincial Conference, whose conclusions shouid be unanimousiy 9,pproved by
our legisiatures in the general interest of al
the provinces.
Coming as I do from Now Brunswick, I
arn deepiy interested in the prosperîty of the
Maritime Provinces. Howevor, there are in
this report certain remarks which have particulariy attracted my attention. It is said
that the subsidies are net sufficient and have
not prox1uced the resuit expected of them.
It is true that the Fathers of Confederation,

14

SENATE

when they fixed these subsidies, believed, as
they were justified in believing, that the
population of our provinces would multiply,
and that the subsidies would consequently
increase in the same proportion. Certain facts
are always painful to recognize and announce,
but for the future welfare of our provinces
themselves I must point out that our people.
instead of remaining on our soil, have gone
off to the United States, and that the
population of these provinces may be said to
have remained stationary. Very small is the
proportion of our people who have gone to
settle in the western provinces. Those who
have left have nearly all gone to the United
States.
At page 14 of the report it is stated that
since 1911 the population of the Maritime
Provinces has increased only ten per cent.
The Commission may not have been fully
informed of the situation, as I am; so I may
be permitted to point out that the increase
of population in the Province of New Brunswick is entirely due ta the French Acadian
population. I regret to say, but in the public
interest I must say, that the English-speaking
population of the Province of New Brunswick,
from Confederation until 1921, increased by
only 31 souls. To-day my colleagues from
New Brunswick are crying out for foreign
immigration. It is deploraible that we have
allowed our own children to leave the country.
The vacant lands now offered to the foreign
immigrant in the Province of New Brunswick
should never have been abandoned. The
number of our own children who, in a single
generation, have left that province for the
United States is almost equal to the present
population. I have always sought to have
our people kept at home, and if in the course
of my career I have not succeeded as I
desired, I can at least assert that the County
of Gloucester shows a greater increase than
any other part of the province.
I have had occasion more than once to
meet my colleagues in the House of Commons
and other authorities of our province who
were demanding a change in the Constitution
which would give us the right to retain our
representation in Parliament. I have told
them that we ought first to retain our own
people, and that the natural increase would
then enable us to maintain our representation.
I trust now that the recommendations
submitted by the Royal Commission on the
subject of colonization will receive the most
careful consideration from our authorities,
provincial as well as federal, and that they
will try to keep our people on Canadian soil,
and especially in our own province.
Hon. Mr. TURGEON.

The Speech from the Throne mentions that
remarkable progress has been made in the
construction of the Hudson Bay Railway, and
announces the Government's intention to
submit the study of conditions at the port
to the careful examination of an outstanding
British authority on tidal and estuarial conditions affecting harbours. I am pleased,
indeed, to see this step taken, for I have
always doubted, and I still doubt, the
practicability of navigation to the harbour of
Port Nelson. The natural conditions at Fort
Churchill are recognized as excellent. It
would be a real misfortune to choose a seaport
in which currents and storms might cause
heavy damage to traffic. It is reassuring tolearn of this decision of the Government,
which means, I think, that if it is found
desirable to use the harbour of Fort Churchill,
the necessary change will be made.
The Speech from the Throne announces also
the recent appointment of a Minister Plenipotentiary accredited by His Majesty to
represent the interests of Canada in the
United States. This certainly marks an
important stage in the evolution of Canada's
international relations. The work of our
worthy representative will assureilly tend to
create between the two countries a spirit of
harmony and fraternity which in the futuremay well assist in solving many international
problems of great importance. His work may
also bring about a feeling of commercial and
economic co-operation which will be to the
advantage of Canada as a whole, and particularly the Maritime Provinces.
The witnesses who appeared before the
Royal Commission of Inquiry on Maritime
Rights all urged the free admission of the
products of our forests, lands and fisheries to
the American market-a privilege which we
lost in 1911 by the rejection of reciprocity
with the United States. Let us look forward
with renewed confidence to a better future.
It is my heartfelt wish that Canada's
Minister Plenipotentiary at Washington may
have all possible success in his important
mission. Hon. Vincent Massey is possessed
of all the ability and qualifications required
for the discharge of the high duties which the
Government have entrusted to him. The
office has certainly become a necessity, the
relations between the two countries having
assumed such importance; and only a Canadian, thoroughly familiar with Canadian
sentiment, can speak with the desired
authority for this country. Henceforth we
shall have to negotiate our own treaties and
assume responsibility for them.

DECEM-BER 14, 1926
The Imqierial Conference has deflned
officially the autonomy actually enjoyed by
the Dominions.
Our Prime ýMinister, the Right Hon.
Mackenzie King, has expressod, with deep
gratification, his 'belief that the conclusions of
the Imrperial Conference are a sure presage
of greater harmony among the different
Dominions, and ho ha.s addod that if the
Conference has produced no great changes, it
lias certainly let other countries know more
clearly than ever the real conditions exi.sting
among the various parts of the Empire. Our
autonomny in our own affairs is absolute, and
is recognîzed as suých. This freedorn of action
in our own house does not diminish in the
least our great respect and affection for Great
Britain and the other Dominions.
Our external relations, our freedom of
action in the international field, in no wise
affect our internai Constitution, which is
written indelibly and permanently and cannot
bo changed in the slightest degree except with
the unanimous consent of the legisiatures of
ail the provinces of Canada. We have our
Canadian courts to determine questions of law
in certain controversies which may arise
among the provinces. It is futile to arouse
fears on the subj oct of the rights of Catholie
or other minorities, or on the subWet of
bilingual righta. Ail these riglits are immune
from attack.
Canada's representative, our Right Hon.
Prime Minister, and his adviser and
collaborator, the Hon. Minister of Justice, are
certainly deserving of our higli esteem and
hearty congratulations for their attitude at
the Conference, where they seemed to
doininate the situation and won the respect
and admiration of their associtates from Great
Britain and the other Dominions, as we have
seen hy the gracious tributes appearing in
the entire British press.
Let me add a final word. The Sixtieth
Anniversary of Confederation is to be worthily
celebrateil in 1927, we are assured in the
Speech from the Tbrone. No Canadian is
more highly gratifled than myself to learn of
this decision on the part of the Government.
Hitherto the'formation of this Dominion has
not been commemorated with the splendour
necessary to inspire our youth with great respect for the work of the Fathers of Confederation. Upon the rising generation will devolve
the duty of governing this country, and it will
lie their task to gavera it in accordance w'ith
the traditions of our founders. Let us
encourage our youth along the right path, in
love of our country, which, las already
attractod the admiration of many nations of
the world, and which, with the United States,

has a special mission to accomplish towards
the peoples of the Orient, with whom we
should have the most friendly relations in the
years to corne.
The Government are to ho highly comn
mended upon their action in extending an
invitation to tho Prince of Wales to visit
Canada on the occasion of out Diamond
Jubilee. We look upon him, as not only our
future King, but also a Canadian citizen. I
arn pleased, too, that the Prime Minister of
Great Britain has heen invîted to come to
Canada, I earnestly hope that they will both
ho able to, pay us a visit on this occasion.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemenq, I promise to detain you but a short time
with the rema.rks that I have to miake in
respect of Vhs motion. First of ail, I would
like to congratulate the mover and the
seconder of the Address on what they have
had Vo say. Particularly do I ref er Vo the
remarks of the mover, as it happons that 1
more clearly understood him than 1 did the
seconder. If there was anything wrong in
the remarks of the seconder of the Addresse
I may have to talce hi¶n Vo task aV someother time, when I see lis words restated in
my own language.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My honourable friend may be sure that lie supported
Maritime Rights.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I arn glad Vo hear
that; that will cover a multitude of-oins.
The remarks of the mover of the Address
were par icularly pleaing Vo me, both in
regard Vo their contents and the spirit in
which Vhey were given. It was a perfectlyr
fair speech; it could not have been fairer
if delivered from this side than it was as
delivered frorn bis own. The remarks that
ho had Vo make with regard Vo the harvest
and the condition of things in the West were
certainly pleasing. As I understand from
the newspapers, and from the remarks of
the mover, the wheat, crop of the West is
safe for the year; at least enougli of iV Vo,
make the revenues Vhis year as good as they
were last year; which is very sat.isfactory Voý
know.
We know that there bas been great development in paper and pulp, and at least
a fair year in luniler and flshing, and a.
great development in the mining rogions in
Northern Ontario and Northern Quebre..
Along with that there lias been a pretty large

may ho. I arn glad Vo flnd that that is the

SENATE

fact, and I hope that this prosperity may not
only continue, but increase at a compound
rate.
I think the country as a whole is to be
congratulated as regards the condition of
business. 1 must also compliment the Government thomselves on their modesty, bocause I do not find that they claim credit
for the good harvest as originating solely
with themselves. That bas not always been
truc of Governments on either side.
Right Hon. Sii GEORGE E. FOSTER: A
case of mere forgetfulness.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Governments are inclined to take the credit rather than give it to
Divine Providence.
I agree entirely with the remarks of the
mover of the Address in regard to the

taken the position as set forth in the
statement of Lord Balfour. I do not believe
that the Conference bas changed our position in the slightest degree. I am speaking
now of our relations to the mother country
and the sister Dominions. We are exactly
where we were before the Conference met.
It bas stated our position again, and I do
not know that it bas been made any plainer.
I have read the speeches of Lord Balfour, and
his position, I take it, is this: "You may put
questions to me that I cannot answer except
by saying, 'Wait until the thing happens.'"
We had questions put to us in 1914, on a
difficult situation, and the spirit of Empire
answered them. What Lord Balfour says
now is that we must wait until the difficulty
arises, and the spirit of Empire will answer
again. If it does not, a mere written contract or verbal statement is of no value.
It is true that we have a different status
and a different stature to-day from what we
bad in 1914. I do not want to belittle what
politicians hav-e done. They have done something; and it is something for a politician not
to put any obstruction in the way if be cannot bel1 ) a matter along. Sir Wilfrid Laurier
and Sir Robert Borden and others bave done
well by the Dominion, and I do not want
to detract from themi at all, but I say that
the nane Canadian is an altogether different
Word in the world to-day from what it was
in 1914. While giving due credit to the politicians, we must recognize that, after all, it
was our men who fought and died on the
battlefields who gave the Canadians the status
in the world they have to-day. That is truc
not only of Canadians; it is true also of
Australians and New Zealanders.
I have said that if there had been any
advance or any change in the position of
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

things since this Conference was held, it would
be found to be verbal rather than real. There
are still problems to solve, and they are only
to be solved as indicated by Lord Balfour.
It still holds true that if two men ride a horse
one must ride behind; and if two Governments are going to deal with an important
matter lilke a declaration of war or a declaration of peace, one of then must have the
final say, and one must ride behind.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Which is going to
have the final say?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: My honourable friend
will have to answer that; I do not pretend
to answer. I simply say that things are exactly where they were before, and I am not
at all frightened as to the issue. I have no
criticism, nor anything further to say in regard to the matter. It is a satisfaction to
know that our Ministers while in London
succeeded in reaching an agreement not only
with the Imperial Ministers they met there,
but also with the Ministers of the sister Dominions. They all seem to be satisfied, and I
think that we ought to be satisfied too.
Leaving that question, I am not quite so
sure that I appreciated the remarks of the
mover of the Address with regard to the
Maritime Provinces. I think he gave them
a little lecture upon helping themselves. Perhaps they deserved it, in one way, but I think
he will find them now just a little difficult on
that question. There is something else before
them: the report of the Duncan Commission.
It does not take mueh examination to sec
how serious a document that report is. It
deals with the whole structure of the Confederation agreement, and it would be asking too much of me to say off-hand that I
approve or disapprove of it I want time to
consider it, and to consult business people
with regard to it. I think honourable gentlemen will find that they require assistance in
considering that report, in order to ascertain
its true meaning and what it will involve in
the matter of legislation. In the meantime
the report itself is quite harmless. The important matter will be the legislation, in respect to that report, to be submitted to Parliament by the Government. As I understand
it, the Government are pledged to enact legislation to carry out the report of the Commission, and I suppose the fair thing for us to
do is net to talk too much about it now, or
try to throw anything in the way of the Government, but wait for the Government to
submit their legislation. No doubt we shahl
have that immediately after the adjournment,
and when it is presented, there will be a great
deal of discussion. In the hope that the Government will deal with the matter at an early

DECEMBER 14, 1926
date, I pass on, without expressing any
opinion as to just what lines the Government
should follow.
There are one or two other matters in the
Address to which I would like Vo refer briefly.
From the present situation in regard Vo Western railroads, and particularly the statement
that an expert is ta be sent up to Hudson
Bay to examine and report, I should judge
that the Hudson Bay Railway and the branch
uines in the West are practically being knocked
together, and that we may safely deal with
them ail on the basia of what may be calleà
colonization railways.
In regard to this whole question I have
neyer made any secret af my sympathy witb
the Northwest in the matter of branch railways. I think 1 once stated in this Huse
my theory on this subject. that when a man
settleq, on the land hie must have transportation in some form, either by water or by rail,
because if hie bas not, hie dies or must leave
the land. I further say that I abject to a
man having both water and rail transportation whule part of the country bais neither.
In the samne way I object to any part of the
country having two railways while other parts
have none.
Anyone wha has read the history of the
Canadian West muet see that for the future
we have ta expect an almost annual expenditure, and a pretty substantial. one, for railways there. One of the big railway men-I
think it was Hil-in speaking of the Western
States, said that a man should be able ta get
'bis wheat ta bis elevator without having to
haul it farther than five miles. He added
that in those rich wheat beits raads cauld be
laid within ten miles of each other and run
successfully from a financial point of view.
I have just that feeling about aur Northwest.
We have ta face the problem. The farmers
are entitled Vo have roads. For the present,
I think that if a man gets within flfiteen
miles of bis elevator hie can live, though it
would be better for himi if hie were only ten
miles fram it, and better stilI if only five.
But I think we have been used a littie bit
unfairly by the West. I was speaking ta a
western man the other day, and hie was comnplaining about our abstructing their 'branch
roads. I replied: "It la partly yeur own fault,
and you will have that trouble again unless
you do one thing. You asked us in ten or
flfteen cases for a Bill ta construct a road
fram Paint A ta Paint B, st a cast, in one
instance, of S5,500,000, withaut giviing a single
word of information about what there was at
A or at B, or between A and B." 1 think
that before being called upon ta consider any
of those branch roads we ought ta have full

information laid before us. In the aid country
a petitian states what land there is, and what
people there are, at A and at B, and what
lies between. Such information is available
ta the West, Further than that, we ought
ta have the assistance of the Railway Commission. It is one of the institutions of the
caun.,try, having engineers and a whole staff.
If a road is suggested ta us, we ought ta bave
from the Railway Board either yes or no as
Va whether it is justifiable or not. Mare than
that, we must have same guarantee that ahl
the roada will serve their awn territary. They
should be put under the control of Parliament. If a Gavernment road is eatisfactorily
serving a certain territory, and making markets available ta it, I would nat allaw the

the time will cames wben we shaîl have mare
money and more people ta the mile, and the
problem I am now mentioning, of seeing that
ahl parts of the country are provided with
railway service, will nlot be sa acute as it is
to-day. 1 am quite willing ta allow that clause
in the Speech from the Tbrone ta pass, witb

saying: "We do not ask you to stop the
diversion of the water; we simply want you
t

It
was said that there were 3,000.000 people in
Chicago and that the public health would be
jeopardized if this water supply were cut off.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

The Secretary of War allowed the taking of
only enough water for sewage purposes, but
that order was being disobeyed.
While I am on this subject, let me refer
to another matter. There are commissions
of engineers, one in Canada and one in the
United States. What do the United States
want? They want us to hand over our rights
in the St. Lawrence river, nine-tenths of
which is in the Province of Quebec. The
State of New Yorkt
wants a neutral zone
established, five or ten miles in widlth, on
both sides of the St. Lawrence river. That
zone would take in the cities of Montreal,
Three Rivers, and Quebec. Just fancy the
trea.tment that we would get at tc
hands
of those mighty American engineers!
You
can hear them saying: "Why, don't you know
that the United States of America is paying
for this? We are going to do as we please."
It reminds me of the story of the English
lady giving advice to her boy. "My boy,"
ste said, "if yo play marbles, always play
with a fellow smaller than yourself, so that if
you cheat yo can lick him." That is the
way we would be treated by tie United
States.
Therefore I say this is a matter of urgeney,
and I hope the Government will immediately
issue instructions to our new Ambassador, His
Excellency the Hon. Vincent Massey, to see
at once that we receive some sort of redress.
I suppose that under our new status, whicb
the Leader of the Opposition did not want to
talk about, our Ambassador would have access
to Mis Majesty. and I would suggest that lie
be given instructions to communicate with His
Majesty and tell him that his subjects are
suffering at tie hands of a foreign people to
the extent of millions of dollars a year. I
woulld advise him to ask the Chancellor of
the Exchequer, the Right Hon. Winston
Churchill, to hold back from the money owing
to the United States an amount sufficient to
cover those damages till something is done
to remedy the situation. If there is one thing
the people of the United States like, it is
money-even if they did win the war they
want every cent that is owing to them.
Another matter to which I wish to refer is
the Treaty of Lausanne. I think we should
tell the poor Turks that we are still at war
with them. They do not seem ýto know it.
I know we made war with them. for I Lad
a son very near the Dardanelles, and as
Canada was not a party to the Treaty of
liausianne, we must still be at war with them.
That situation should be ironed out. Perhaps
wv should make a Treaty of our own. In
any event, surely we should not remain in a
state of suspense.

My honourabie friend bas spoken of the

My own conviction is that aIl the powers
that are to be found in the report of tbe

within the four corners of our Constitution.

vantage that we shall find will be in the
word of the provisa concerning the status of
Great Britain and the Dominions. Here is
what the Commnittee said:
'The comxittee are of the opinion that nothing
would be gained by attempting to lay down a
constitution for. tIse British Empire. Its widely scattered parts have very differeut characteristics, very different histories and are
at very different stages of evolution, while considered as a whole it defles classification and
bears no real resemrblauce to, any other political
organization which now exists or bas ever yet

vital matters reached its f ull development-we

affairs, though united by common allegiance to
the crowu and freely associated as members of
the British Commonwealth of nations.
I believe that this statement is very timely,
not because our statua was ouestianed within
the British Empire, but because it was questioned outside tbe Empire. A member of
the Senate of the United States, misapprehending completcly our imperial organization,
stated in a resolution that one of the reamons
why they would not, accept the Treaty of
Versailles was tbat the British Empire was
given six votes and the United States only
one. The samie impression existed elsewhere.

of the Assembly and then Prime Minister of
France, declared that he adhered to the
League of Nations, but was not yet reconciled to the idea that Great Britain sbould
have six votes and France only one.
The situation which is officially described
and recognized in that document bas been
at ail times visualized by our leading statesmen. I have had occasion to state-I amn
not sure that it was nlot in this Chamberthat when the Fathers of Confedieration sent
their delegation to Great Britaîn, beaded by
Sir John A. Macdonald and Sir George
Etienne Cartier, there was only one matter
that bad net been settled, namely, the titie
When Sir
to be given to our country.

SENATE

John A. Macdonald reached London he said:
"I want the nane and title of 'Kingdom of
Oanada'," and he was very near gaining lis
point. Memoirs that have appeared lately
throw upon Lord Derby the responsibility
of refusing that request, because at that time,
in 1866, when the North had just won the
war against the South, the United States were
somewhat sensitive on the matter of European
intervention on-this continent, and somewhat
nervous and impatient at the trend of opinion
in Great Britain and Canada on the war of
secession, and Lord Derby thought that that
appellation, "Kingdom of Canada," would perhaps appear to be odious to our southern
neighbour. Be that as it rnay, I believe that
at that time we got the substance if we did
not get the form. Sir John A. Macdonald
wanted the title, "The Kingdom of Canada,"
with the King of Great Britain as our King,.
in order to establish the fact that we were
no longer a dependency, but were an autonomous country with complete independence
in the administration of our own affairs, under
the sarne flag and the same crown. That was
the end which Sir John had in view. Those
were his principles; and we find them on the
lips of Sir Wilfrid Laurier in 1908. I had
occasion, at his death, to cite that excerpt
from his speech delivered at the Tercentenary
of the founding of Quebec by Champlain.
In the presence of the present King of Great
Britain and the Dominions, at a dinner given
by the then Governor General, Lord Grey,
and attended by representatives of all the
Dominions who were present at that celebration, Sir Wilfrid Laurier thus spoke of our
status:
As I advance in years I appreciate more the
wisdon of that British constitution under which
I was born and brought up, and under which
I have grown old, which has given to the various
portions of the Empire their separate free governînents. It is our proud boast that Canada
is the freest country in the world. It is our
boast that in this country liberty of all kinds,
civil and religious liberty, flourishes to th
highest degree. To those who look only on the
surface of things this may not be apparent. The
fact that we are a colony does not alter the
truth of this statement. The inferiority which
may be implied in the word "colony" no longer
exists. We acknowledge the authority of the
British Crown, but no other authority. We
are reaching the day when our Canadian Parliament will claim co-equal rights with the
British Parliament, and when the only tics
binding us together will he a sane flag and a
same Crown.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:

What date is that?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That was in
August, 1908, at the celebration of the Tercentenary of the founding of Quebec. His
Royal Highness the Prince of Wales came to
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

Canada for that event. Sir Robert Borden
claimed the same- status at Versailles; he
claimed the same status at London, and he
made that very important step forward, the
agreement with London and Washington for
the sending by Canada of an official representative, a M-inister Plenipotentiary. I am
citing these three leaders, all Canadians and
Canadian statesmen, who have been able to
affirm that we we:re autonomous nations,
sister-nations, but bound together by the
sarne Crown and the same fliag; and I find
in the report of the Conference the sanction
and acceptance of those very aspirations and
declarations of the statesmen whom I have
cited.
Of course, Canadians have done their share.
The development of Canada is that of the
whole nation. The right to affirm before the
world that we were a nation to be considered,
and entitled to enter the comity of nations,
was established during those fateful years of
1914 to 1918 on the battlefields of Europe.
But I accept, with my honourable friend, the
statement that this official recognition is but
the crystallization of principles which were
in the British North America Act in 1867;
powers which are to be used as we need theni,
and at the proper hour. The time lias come
when a nation of nine millions can ask to
administer its affairs, and administer them
in the name of one and the sarne King, at
home and abroad.
I made that statement in explaining our
situation when I had the honour of being
made President of the League of Nations,
because I knew that misunderstanding was
rather outside the Empire than inside; and 1
remember that two years ago Mr. André Siegfried wrote a most interesting book entitled,
"L'Angleterre d'Aujourdhui"-"Great Britain
of To-day," which has had the honour of
translation and of very many editions in
English since then, and in which he said,
coming to the study of the relations of the
Dominions with the Mother country, that he
had to acknowledge the great evolution that
had taken place, but wondered if outside
countries would not be somewhat reluctant to
grant us that equality of status while we had
no direct connection with them. It is much
to the credit of Sir Robert Borden to have
established that connection by decreeing that
there should be a Minister Plenipotentiary in
Washington; and I am quite sure that in the
natural evolution of things we shall have
representatives also at other capitals, so that
that contact will be thoroughly established.
So far as my reading of history has enlightened me, there is no precedent for six

21

DECEMBER 14, 1926
or seven nations speaking to the outside
world in the namne of one and the saine King.
1 remember that the Hon. Mr. Pearce, of
Australia, passing through here from Washington, af Ver the Washington Con-ference of
1921., said that there were seven Plenipotentiaries there-two from Great Britain, one
from Ind.ia, one fromn South Africa, one fromn
Canada, one from Australia, and one fromn
New Zealand-ali selected by their respective
Cabinets, and ail having in their hands
credentials fromn one and the saine King.
How illogical 1 "Yes," he added, "so it
appeared, yet it worked." So will our development, as it proceeds regularly, bring
about situations and solutions which *we do
not foresee to-day; but, as my honourable
friend who faces me (Hon. W. B. Ross) bas
said, each problema will be solved in due
course.
In London very many questions were studied
by the varicus ComaxitteeS .relating to trade,
defence, migration, communication, reeaïrch,
forestry, and other economie subjects. These
matters will ail corne up for consideration
when the resodutions are laid before Parliament, and we shahl have occasion te
examine into their work.
The honourable gentleman frein Lethibridge
(Hon. Mr. Buchanan) spoke of immigration,
and said that unfortunatcly we cannot 'have
many i2mÀg'rants of British stock. Some two
inonths ago Colonel Deanis, representative of
the Canadian Pacifie Thailway for Immigration, re-tuýrnmng from a tour of Europe, said
that hle did not hope 'that we could draw to
a very great extent frein Great Britain, because cf the conditions there. Yet I think
that the instruction that de being given
through f arm schoode in Greait Britain will
help te solve its unemployment pro'bhem.
There -are bundreds of thouÉands of mien in
England wvho should becomne good Cana&dien
immigrants and good farmera. If instead of
continu ing the dole, Great Britain applied
itef to giving one or two years' training
in farming to the generation that bas left
achool and grown 'up sinoe the war. we couild
gét a good proportion cof them, and coudd
well take caïre of them. 1 had a conversation
with some of the Ministe-rs of the Crown in
London in Marrch lest, and they f elt that they
should join in giving training and education
la rurail matters to hundreds ef thousande of
their young 'men, that .they shouhd select those
who would agree Vo go permanently on farine,
and these men shou'ld be offered te Canada or
te the other Dominions. I staîted la London
thiat we ehould be uiost happy to receive s
many of thoS boys and young mon as showed
sny inclination f or farmjng. 0f ourse more

than a million men are diepersed in -towns
and cities, 'but sured.y 'the you.nger generation
that le not yet twenty-five or twenity-six years
of age shouild be redeemed frein the slums of
those large chties, made useful by suitable
training, and sent over to Canada.
Allusion hffs been made Vo the preaent
situation of our country. We ail agree that
matters are improving. An incident which toock
place in this Chamber wil11, 1 think, bring
vividly to the rninds of my honourable friends
of the Senate bow fast the wheel is tming.
We ail remnember that in 1!925 we fe!.t that the
situation was moet invelved and we should
do somathing te fmd a solution for our railway deficits. We appointed a Ccanmittee;
we heard men of substance in finance and in
the rai'lway field; and rea'lly there seemed to
be despair in the faces of some of them. It
was difficuit for them to give us a elear
solution; we were still groping in the dark.
That was in Ma.y and June of 'last year. Here
we are in Decemiber, 1926, and *a robuet
optimr sl now piermeat]ng- the country. 1
think we are Sigit. in neyer losing our courage,
or giving way to pessimisin. Canada le a big
country, richla resouroSs, wilh a hard-worki.ng
population, as shown by its production in the
field, 'the mine@, the forest, the fisheries and
in industry. I believe we have the admiration
of the cutoide wcrld, and yet we pass our
'time criti-cising Pach other and askisig ourselves if there wilil be brighter days for
Canada. I woudd point out that we harve
succeedted mueh faster than most counrtries cf
the world in re-establishing confidence i
Canada., aind with the help of Providence,
good crops contirnuing. and the strong wiJl
of *our people to go forward, our future is
assured.

DIVORCE COMMITTEE BUSINESS
DEPUTY

CHAIRMAN

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved concurrence in the 41st Report cf the Standing
{Jommittee on Divorce.

11e said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
new departua'e in the methosi of procedure
of the Divorce Comimittee. At present we
have no provision for any presiding officer
other than a Chairman. From, intimations
,given by the Clerk who bas to do with
divorce proceedings it is ap.parent that the
nurober cf applications this year wili be at
least equal te that cf last year, when we had
185. and it is possible that thÀs year the
-nimber may reach 200.
It is feit desirable to, appoint a Deputy
Chairmnan, and, in dealing with unocntested
cases, to have two Gomnmittees sit concurrently. The election of a Deputy Chairman
-would perhaps relieve- the ciembers cf the
Committee, who give so freely and generously cf the¶ir timne, and perhaps also relieve
the Chairman.
The lion. the SPEAKER: Do I under-stand that the honourable gentleman wants
te have this report ndopted now, or te let it
take the crdinary course?
lion. Mr. WIILLOUGHIBY: Unaess there be

REPORTS OF COMMIT-rEES

H-on. Mr. WILLOUGHiBY moved concurrence in the reports of the Standing Gommittee
on Divorce, n-umbered 2 tic 38.
H1e said: These reports deal simply with
cases heard by the Gommittee hast Session.
A number cf them were passed by Parliamnent
and ready for the assent of the Governor
General. The otheïrs only reached the Committee stage in the other bouse. In ail these
instances it has been necessary to petition

again, under the practice adopted by the
officiags of the House in that connection. In
each of these cases a new petîtion has been
presented, and under the authority given by
the resolution of th-is House4.he other day we
again report the evidence as it was before.
I intend to introduce a Bill in the case of
each of these petitions deait with in the
reports, and later I will ask that the Senate
waive the rule and pass the Bis to-day.
I might add, as Chairman of the Committee, that in my opinion the Committee
ought to meet as early as the date of reassembling of the Gommons, that is, the Sth
of February, so that by the time the Senate
meets again we may have a number of reports
in; otherwise the Order Paper would be
cluttered up with the very large number of
petitions we have already, as well as the
additional ones that will have been presented
by that time.

Hie said: Honourable gentlemen, this is a
measure whieh received very serious consideration in both Houses last year. It stands
in very mueh the saine position as the
Divorce Bills with whieha we have just dealt.
The Bill is regularly on the Order Paper for

ivas passed hast year, but did not become law
beeause, hike many others, it failed te receive the Royal Assent. Although this Bill

bas not been printed, I think that under the
eircumstances it might be given the second
reading.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill w&8

REFERRED TO SPEÇIAL COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I would move
that the Bill be referred to the saine Committee which dealt with it last year, and
whieh wos composed of Hon. Messieurs
Barnard, Beaubien, Beique, Bureau, Dandurand, Girroir, Haydon. McMe'ins, Murphy,
Pardee, Robinson, Ross (Middleton), Tanner,
Willoughby, and myself.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I wos going to
suggest that as the Bill went through the
Committees of the Senate and the Houaie nf
Commons last year, wo might dispense with
the Commnittee stage altogether and pass it
now. When we deait with it before ail the
objectionable features were elirninated.
Hon.
Mr.
DANDURAND:
Con
the
honourable gentleman tell us whether the Bill
is now in the forin in whicha it left the
Sonate bast yeor, or in the amended form in
which it was returned from the flouse of
Commons?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Bill was the
subjeet of considerable discussion in the Coinmittee of the other Huse. It was reported
by that Committee, -and I ani not sure
whether it was reod a third time. At al
events, nuinerous amendments were made in
the other flouse, and my impression is that
they did net corne back to us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
So if we were
te poss the Bill now we should be agreeing
te the amendments made by the flouse of
Commons?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Yes.
Hon. Mr. GORDON: We have nothing to
show what those aînendments are.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
I týhink it is moeh
botter that the Bill should be referred te
the Special Committee. I do net see any
portictîhar urgency for rushing it through so

take the ordinory course and go before the

chief committees of the flouse.
Suddenly to hear, without a word of warnimg, thiat hie had def t us, was a shock, not
only to myself, 'but also, I amn sure, to al
the members of this flouse. I think it is a
modeslt and fair statement to inale that
the Senate has suffered a greait losu, and the
country bas toc, in the death of Senatoe
Pardpe, and I desire to join with the hbonourable gentleman opposite in extending to
bis family and friends the synnpathy of this
flouse.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, it has been the practice in this Chamber to leave to the honourable leader on each side of the flouse the
kindlly office of expressing our appreciation
of those members of the Senate who, from
time to time, have passed away. I would
flot intrude myseif at rthis tinue except for
one consideration, that for a long series of
years, in another place, I was sssoci-ated as a
colleague in Parliament with tühe honourable
member of the Senate who bas left us. I
associate myself with til tihat bas been eaid
of hi-m by the two leaders of this flouse.
Mr. P-ard-ec won the affections of both parties,
and of tall -membrs, I think, on either sida
of the pouular

Chamber.

He was eminentJly

fair and in ail bis dealings inspired confidence. As bas been stated by the honouirable leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Ross), our regret is all the deeper when. a
mnan who seems te have a large part of bis
lifetime yet to give to the service of bis
country is suddenly cailled away. It is a
great 'bas to thousan-ds of indiividuals. Not
orily is bis loss felt in the loeaility in whieh
hcielived and moved, and in which ha was
sueh a beneficent influence, but it is a matter
of deep regret tluat the counybry huas been
suddenly deprived of services wh.ich have
been so valuahîr and useful. Piity it îs tihat
is
uit so. I désired just to add, my personal
agreemeiut with everything that bas been said
with reference to our dleparted friand.. 1
think we ail feel that his loss is a real loss
to us in this Cluamber, not oniy in the matter
of public business, but personalfly and individua;lly.
GRAND TRUNK PAGIFIC SECURITIES
BILL
FIRST READING

Bibl 57, an Act respecting the Grand Trunik
Pacifie Rai:lway Company and respectirig the
Canadiean Nat;iona;l Railways.-Hon. Mr.
Dandurand.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of 'the Bill.
He said: Hlonourable gentlemen, wirt~h the
ieave of the Senate, I move the second reading of thi Bill now. It is a measure to confirm a scheine of arrangement dated the 26t~h
of August, 1926, with the holders of four per
cent dehenture stock of the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Railway, whereby the Canodian
National Railways may create and issue new
stock, in exehange for certificates registered
in the niame of holders of a àike arnoun-t, or
the like aggregate arnotnt, as the case may
require.
The amounit outstanding is £7,176,801 par
value. It is a perpetual debenture stock of
the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, guaran'teed
by tJhe Grand Trunk Reilway Company on
surplus profits of the Grand Trunk after their
fixed charges are met.
This agreement liquidâtes a very invoaved
situation. The Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway
Company is at present under receiversbip,
and, as the principal debtor, it would need
to be sold if the obligation had to ha met.
As the Grand Trunk Railway Comnpany was
and is a gularanitor, a special account of thue
old Grand T.runk has had to be kept separately, inuauch as these debenture holders
The
were entitled to the surplus earnings.
prescrit arrangement cleans up this xvihole
ma.tter.
No interest has been paid uipon those debentures for the ilast six or seven years. The
rnterest is stiill payable, and it is stilN accumulating against the Grand Trunk Pacifie
RailZvay, but not against the Grand Trunk,
the guarantor. The anunt that is at present
due by the Grand Trunk Pacifie Railway on
interest is in the neighbourhood of $9.0O,O00.
By virttue of the arrangement which bas been
arrived at, this interest is wiped ont.
The consideration for flue cancelation of
the interest lies in the faot that the new debentures to be issuced will gfive the holdors
of the present perpetual debenture stock an
interest cf two per cent. The date at wbichn
interest could ha paid by the surplus earnings
of the Grand Trunk system is an unknown
factor. The holders have been without any
interest for the last seven years, and they
agree to take, frosn now on, a small return
in interest, namdly two per cent upon their
holdingsq; but they will have the advantage
of being assured of their capidtal. Two per
cent will be set aside yearly for amuortization
puirposes, and this will wipe out the whole
debt in thirty-two years.
After a period of ten years by drawings,
the stock snay be redeemed -at 100 cents on

28

SENATE

the dollar.
There wili be ocoesional drawrngs ýto dispose of the fund created by the
two per cent resYerve, and the 'holders--the
fortunate peopie-will be paid 100 cents on
tihe dolilar.
Hon. W. B. RO-SS: That is, aft.er ten yea-rs.
lion. Mr. DANDURAND:
will begiýn after ýten years?

The drawings

lion. W. B. ROSS: No; that is the drawing3 at par.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND:

Yes.

lion. 'Mr. ROSS: But diiring the first ten
yeaqrs there ma--y ho drawings at as low as 60
per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND:
Under the
scherne t.here may be drawings even before
the expiration of ten years.
Hon. Mr. ROS; Yes, as low as 60 per
cent, frorn 60 to 100.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But people rnay
flot ag-ree to participate ini sucb a drawing
and- m'ay prefer to wait in ourder to obtain
100 cents on the dollar.
I believo that I have thoroughly outlined
the sebeme whichi it is proposed to substitute
for the situation that bas existed up to this
date. There was a perpetuai 4 per cent debenture.
Now the~ Domnijon puts an end
to that debenture by heing given the right
te withdraw it in 32 years. It is truc that
4 per cent interest is paid on the arnount for
32 years, but that terminates the whole matter.
I helieve this arrangement was sanctioned by
thc late Governent in August last; it bas
rcceived the ratification of the present Govoranient, and it bas unanirnously passed the other
Chamber. For this reason I suggest that we
now take the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourahie gentlemen,
before we take the second reading of this Bill,
I wuid like to say .iust one or two things
about it. I bappen to have a fairly accurate
knowledge of the whole circumstances of the
acquisition of the Grand Trunk hy the Conservative Governrnent; I know wbat the perpetuai debentures of the Grand Trunk Pacifie
nre; and what I arn a little jealous about is
Canada's reputation. Again and again there
have been -insinuations made in the Oid
Country, in London, that Canada was not
doing the fair thing by the hoiders of the
bonds.
1 wisb ahsoluteiy and entirely to
repudiate that insinuation, and, furtber, to put
on record the fact that, su far as I arn concerned, if I bad tbe shigbtest notion that in
agreeing to this contract we were in any
Hon. Mr. DANDURMÇD.

way weakening as to our position having been
perfectiy straightforward and honest, 1 would
not agree to this contract at ail. It must be
understood, so far as I arn concerned, thaýt
wben I agree to this it is sirnply as an entirely
new business contract between this Government and the hoiders of these securities. Tbey
bad no right to complain. At the time the
contract went througb, they were represented
bere not oniy by counsel, mon iearned in the
law, but aiso by engineers and financial advisers, and they knew exactly where they
stood.
These perpetuai debentures were issued by
the Grand Trunk Pacifie and were guaranteed
bv' tbe old Grand Trunk Railway Cornpany,
with the proviso that the interest on these
bonds of the Grand Trunk Pacific was not to
ho a charge on the Grand Trunk proper until
the outstanding securities of the nid Grand
Trunk were provided for. The only payrnent
tbat the old Grand Trunk ever rnade on the
securities was made in 1915; and at that tirne
there was a good deal of talk as to wbetber
or not the Grand Trunk was really justified
in making that payrnent. The oniy year in
wii the Government of Canada were able
to pay that intorest was 1923. Tbere secmed
tc bave been a spurt of business on what were
called the Grand Trunk western uines, in connection witb the business of Ford and other
men engaged in the rnaking of automobiles.
Tben we bcd ail kinds of propaganda going
on in London, and it was stated that Canada
sLouid bave corne forward and paid 4 per cent
on tbc bonds. But Canada nover agreed to
do anytbing of the kind; and the oId Grand
Trunk itself never agreed to do anytbing of
the kind. Thiat being so, the conduct of the
successive governments wbo deait with the
matter-I arn not saying anytbing now about
the wisdomn of taking over the Grand Trunk
at aillbas been perfectly proper, and I prott-.t against any imputations by men in
London as to the good faith of tbose governnients of Canada.
That is ail I bave to say witb regard to that
phase of the question. I tbink it should ho
distinctiy understood, and it sbould be so
expressed, that we are rnaking no concession
at ahl in this; that it is a hrand new bargain,
and that it is an open question, a guess,
wbether we make rnoney or whetber we lose
money. If tbe Grand Trunk proper is very
successfui and bas big earnings, prohahiy
Canada will make a littie money. Even then,
1 do not tbink the people in London wili
lose anything hy this hargain. Tbey stand
te win just as much as the Government of
Canada. Tbey are getting a security that

FEBRUARY 16, 1927
can be turned into cash at the present time,
and they take their chances of losing a littie
cr gaining a great deal.
There is just one other thing I should like
to say. I should like to know, if the honourable gentleman can tell me, whether this
is the final demand on the part of these
people, or whether there is a sort of Oliver
Twist situation-whether they are going to
ask for more. Are we going to have an
organization of the common stock holders
one of these days? I think we ought to
know something about that in making a contract of this kind.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask the
honourable gentleman, not only as a Senator,
but as a lawyer, do we owe this money or
do we not?
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The situation is a very
simple one. There is a perpetual 4 per cent
debenture outstanding on the Grand Trunk
Pacific, which is guaranteed by the Grand
Trunk. We acquired the Grand Trunk, and
we are liable only where the Grand Trunk
would be liable-that is, to psy interest on
these perpetual debentiures providing we earn
it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: After the fixed
charges are paid.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: The operating expenses and the fixed charges. There has
been some controversy in regard to that
It is not a question of good faith or bad
f aith, but one between accountants. We have
no concern beyond that. If we get the
money we are to pay.
Righ-t Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Honourable gentlemen, as this is a matter in
which I have taken somne interest and had
some part, perhaýps I ray be permitted, as
a new member, to say a word.
I agree in large measure with what the
honourable gentleman (Hon. W. B. Ross)
has said. With other members of the Goverment I heard the dlaims of the Grand
Trunk Pacific 4 per cent debenture stockholders on several occasions, and invariably
we took the ground that they could not be
in any worse position than they occupied
before the Government took over the Grand
Trunk, as ini taking it over we assumed the
liabilities.
On one or two occasions they raised this
point-and in referring to it I do not think
I arn giving away any secret-that in the
taking over of the Grand Trunk, certain
securities were made senior to, theirs which
in their humble judgment should have been
junior. 0f course the Government never ad-

2U

mitted that contention. If it were correct,
one could see the reason for the attitude
assumed by the debenture holders, because
the Grand Trunk would have to earn more
money than it otherwise would, before it
received sufficient to pay their interest. In
London, on one or two occasions, this matter
was brought to the attention of the then
Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and
myseif, by representatives of the debenture
stockholders. We took the view very strongly
that there was no legal liability, and I arn
indined to think that the debenture stockholders themselves believed that.
But certain conditions existing in Canada
continued to make it very difficuit for the
Canadian National economically and success-fully to manage this business. On the one
hand there was the Grand Trunk, in which
an accounting had to be made regularly
and accurately with one point in view,
namely, whether, under the earnings of the
Grand Trunk, the debenture holders were
entitled to payment. On the other hand,
a separate accounting had to be kept by the
receiver of the Grand Trunk Pacific to see
whether that company was earning sufficient
to pay any of the interest on the securities.
Last summer I was over in England on
privat.ý business, or pleasure, and with-out
anyofficiai right, and quite unofficially, I consente-d to have a chat with at least one member of the committee that was appointed to
discuss this matter. That committee was
headed by the Right Hon. Reginald McKenna,
who is perhaps one of the leadling bankers
in London. H1e asured me that the committee was not appointed for the purpose of
acting for the debenture holders, but, heing
aware of the relatioiiship that existed between
Canada and the Motherland, hie and his colleagues were anxious to see if, for the benefit
of ail concerned, some arrangement could not
be made by which this debenture stock could
be retired. This would relieve the tension
which existed and remove some of the difficulties, the. least of which was not that of
the management of the Canadian National
in having to do ail this accounting and being
subi ect to audits, and that kind of thing. I
had no authority ta talk with him at ail.
We simply chatted as men. I was impressed
with his sincerity in trying to find a way out
for everybody, if it could possibly be found;
and, while I would not want the House to,
think I took part in the negotiations--far
from ,it-I was impressed very much by the
suggestions put forward on both sides for the
settiement of this difficuit situation.
I think it is true that the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Company did pay a dividend on the

30

SENATE

securities; but that dividend was paid out
of money advanced by the Government. It
ivas intended for operation. and flot for the'
payment of a dividend. To that extont the
debenture holders were led astray, believinig
the Grand Trunk Pacifie was earning intered.
on its securitias. Later, in 1923 or 1924, the
Grand Trunk earninigs wcre sufficient to pay
a certain amount of interest on the securities,
but thcre was a question as to the liabilitv
of the Grand Trunk, and the situation was
quite mixed uip and muddled.
This arrangement is to clear up the whole
situation in justice to every person. As the
honourahie gentleman Who bas spoken (Hon.
W. B. Ross) pointed eut, 2 per cent will go t.n
sinking- fund. In short, it is expected that
th(, amount accumulated will bc sufficiant to
wipe ont the liability in tbirty-two years.
Canadian National securitias, guarantaed by
the Government-and therefore gilt-edgedwill be excbangcd for thle Grand Trunk Pacifie
securities, so there can be ne complaint on
behaîf of the sccurity holders that they have
not been fairly treated. On the other band,
it is fait- ta, our nwn great enterprise tliat it
should be givcn every opportunitY to make
the best possible showing.
After ail, it is
our propcrty. IÇnowing considiiable about its
inception, 1 am strong ly of the view that the
Bouse would be warrinted in approving of
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Howv mnch money
shaîl we have to pay ? Ho1;w much is this

The
honourable gentleman said that legally the
hondliolders bad ne dlaim.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 have told the
honourable gentleman that it is not a question of a deht; it is a question of fact. There
is stock to the amount of over £7,000,000.
lion. Mr. CASGRAIN:

Do we have to

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In othar words, this
seeurity that the debentura iholder had was
notbing but a contingent security?
They
would get their interest so long as the Grand
Trunk Pacifie earned it over and above the
indebtedness on securities as thon issuad by
the Grand Trunk?
Hon. W. B. BOSS:
But if the Grand
Tîunillk R.ailwav' Conupanv did net earo iiî'terest
for oue ycar on those bonds, th:îr could net bc
added ta the interest against it the ncxt year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The cumulative
feature w'as against the Grand Trunk Pacifie
Company alone?
Hon. W. B. ROSS:

Yes, that is right.

Hon. Mr. I3EAUBIEN:
The position in
which we standl to-day, if I understand r;chtly,
is that we cive nothing te tbese people except
in case the revenue is more than sufficient
te pay priority liens against the Grand Trunk
Railway Company and lavas somathing over
for tbem; and that was te be the position
practically for aIl time te comae.
Is that
righit?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Thon the situation
is very ýclear.
We are te pay these people 4
per cent a year on these s,eurities, part of
which interest goes thon te pay the e.ipir.l of
thosL bonds. Inoterer worLs, we have aîsum '1I

Hon. MIr. GRAHANI.

That is exactly

ne less an autbority ýthan the Criminal Code

FEBRUARY 16, 1927
of Canada for yeai-,. Such bonds have been
ban{shed; and 1 arn personally aware that
people have been orrested for selling them in
Canada. One case, I understand, created quite
an impression in the West last year, and is,
I think, stili pending before the Court of
Appeal. Yet the city of Paris did nothing
worse than Canada is going to do now. They
said: "We want to borrow a large amount of
money. We are going to pay 5 per cent on
that amount. Three per cent will be paid
regularly on the bond, and 2 per cent will
be set aside to create a fund, and every year
that fund will ibe exhausted by the drawing
of lots. Any man drawing a good number
gets bis bond redeemed in full-100 cents
on the dollar." Because that feature was
attached to thoso, Paris bonds., they were
frowned down upon, and were prohibited from
entering- Canada. Now, is not this exactly the
saine method as bas been used in France with
Panama and dity of Paris bonds? If there is
a distinction 1 w.ould like to know it, because
then 1 would vote for a metasure like this with
a great deal of contrItion.

in touch with the real situation, after a serious
study of the financial responsibility of this
country, think that this is a fuir contract for
Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Then I would like
to learn where, in the arrangements that have
been made, Canada is made responsible for
the capital of those bonds?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Canada is not
responsible for a cent or a penny till the
Grand Trunk Railway Company has earned
a sufficient surplus, after paying its operating
expenses and its fixed charges, o meet that
obligation. The question is, when will that
hour strike?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But my honourable
friend has not answered my question. I asked
him where is the agreement by which Canada
is obliged to pay one cent of the capital, and
he answers that we may be obliged when the
time comes to pay a certain amount on the
interest. I am not talking of the interest at
all.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is a perpetual
stock.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:' Just a second.
This is just the question that is submitted to
us: are we, or are we not, going to assume the
obligation to pay $35,000,000 in capital?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
But will my
honourable friend not admit that if we start
earning 4 per cent on that stock, and paying
the 4 per cent on that stock out of the surpluses of the Grand Trunk Railway Company,
we are tlien assuming to pay 4 per cent
interest perpetually on that capital, and
acceipting as a live debt of our own the
amount re'presented by the 4 per cent we
pay?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: No, because we
pay nothing but a share of the profits. If
and when the profits attain a certain amount,
then we have to hand over a proportion of
the profits, but we have never been, and we
are not yet, held to be liable for the payment
of one cent of that capital. The Government
is coming to us when we are not liable for one
cent, when there is no engagement, and none
can be shown, and is asking us whuther we
are going to put our seal on this arrangement.
Are we going t sign an obligation to these
bondholders to the tune of $35,000,000? That
is the position, and it is a very serious matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would draw
the attention of my honourable friend to this
situation, that we start with 4 per cent. We

were to pay perpetually 4 per cent, but under
this agreement the obligation will be wipe
out in thirty-two years by the sinking fund
created.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is ail true,
but ail the prior obligations and loans will
carry interest, and we hand over only the
surplus when it existe, and to the extent to
which it exists. That is not a very heavy
obligation. But this Bil asks us to assume a
very heavy obligation for the country. We are
not rich enough for that. We are still
obliged to tax ourselves very heavily, and
the difference in taxation between this country
and the United States is every day becoming
harder to bear; and when there is no obligation to pay-or if there is, I would like to
know it--the Government comes and hands
us this document. Will we sign? It does
not take much time to sign, but once signed
it is there for us and our children and grandchildren. Will we do it when we are net
obliged to? It is a very serious matter, leaving
aside the feature of the 'lottery bond-to
which, for m' 'part, I do not attach much
importance. The question is a very sol'emn
one: will we obligate this country to tfle tune
of $35,000,000?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What will be
the answer of my honourable friend?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I would certainly
be disposed, unýless further explanation were
given, to vote against it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, I move
the adoption of the section.
Hon. Mr. J. D. REID: I would like to say
a few words on this matter. I think there are
two or three points that are being overlooked.
One point is that part of the great Canadian
National Railway System to-day, that is the
Grand Trunk Pacifie. is rmn by a hi-quidator,
and we cannot get away from the liquidator
until this claim has been disposed of. We
must deal with it either by a settlement with
the bondholders, or else selI the road out, and
buy it in, and thus wipe out this caim. That
is the way I understand the matter. I understand that if the old 'Grand Trunk Railway
Company earned sufficient income they must
pay the interest on this debenture stock. From
the reports tihat I read in the newspapers
about the earnings of the Canadian National
Railway system, and particularly that part
which was the Grand Trunk Railway, it does
strike me that within the next thirty years the
earnings will be such that we shalil have to
pay the interest in any case.
There is another point. The impression
given by what has been said is that we are

of the 4 Vhey will establish a sinking fund
which, will pay off the $35,000,000 at the end
of Vhirty and some odd years. So the
laebility that the country assumes and must
pay is really 2 per cent on the U35,000,000.
Now, as I have said, 1 arn firmly af the opinion
that Vhe earnings of the Grand Trunk Railway,
or Vhe Canadian National Railway Systera,
wilq be such that they would be compelled Vo
pay, if noV all, at least a great portion of that
amount anyway. For these reasons we ghould
hesitate about rejecting this Bill.
W.hile the Grand
There is another point.

and built the 'Grand, Trunk Pacifie Railway,
yet every dollar that went into the building
of that road, or practically aIl Vhe money,

me tbhat if we should be obliged Vo foreclose

ia rnuch better Vo make some arrangement
with the bondbholders.
Knowing thee facts,
and believîng this Vo be the situation, I woul

few years ago. Timnes are better now. The
revenues of the railways are increasing, and
if they continue to increase we should have
to pay anyway. And are you ready Vo have
liquidation in order to get a good title to the
Grand Trunk? That la the position.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
friend is much better informed than I amn
on the railWay situation, and especially the
earning power cg the Grand Trunk-its abdlity
te earn sufficienit to meet the interest on ithe
underlying securities, and then on thils security
whioh we are disoussing. Loodeing forward
ten, twenty, thirty, perliaps fifty years, la the
honourable gentleman ready to say that in his
opinion the Grand Trunk is able to make
those payments? 0f course, if we have a
valuable property, which is capable of paying
ail the interest on ail týhese securities and of
giving us, besides, a handsome yearly income,
we are right in doing what is, proposed; but
I do not understand that to be the case at
ail.
Hon. Mr. REID: I may answer the honourable gentleman in this way. 1 have suffioient confidence in the Grand Trunk Railway
portion of the Canadian National Railway
System to believe that that portion will earn
a dividend and pay interest on ail its liabiliies, even on this stock. The honourable
gentleman knows that the old Grand Trunk
system. paid a dividend on ahl its stocks-on ail its perpetual debenture stock, and its
first, second, third and fourth preference. It
paid a dividend until the war came on. Prior
Vo that time it neyer failed Vo pay a dividend.
The railways are doing a well and better
now, and, with the addition of these other
parts of the system, whioh are bringing freight
to the old Grand Trunk-that portion of the
system which. is liable for Vhis interest-I
have faith that it will pay dividends in the
future as it has done in the past. If the
whole Canadian National Railway system
were responsible for this 4 per cent, the case
might be different, but, remember, it la only
the Grand Trunk from Chicago to Montreal
and Portland that is responsible for thi.i
intereat; and I believe the Grand Trunk would
earn sufficient to be compelled to pay it. For
these reasons I think we should pass the Bill.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: As I understand the
question, it cornes Vo this. The Government
bas taken over two, systerna of railway, the
Grand Trunk Pacific and the Grand Trunk.
Those Vwo systems are bound Vo keep a special
account of their earnings. If there is a surplus of earnings sufficient Vo justify the payment of the interest on this debenture stock

out of the Grand Trunk Pacifie, the interest
must be paid. It is very unlikely that there
will be. One means of getting rid of that
obligation would be to liquidate the Grand
Trunk Pacifie. But there is another liability:
a separate account must be kept of the old
Grand Trunk, which bas been merged as part
of the Canadian National Railways, so as to
ascertain if there is a surplus after payment
of the interest on their own bond. If there
is, then it must go to pay the interest on
The Canadian National
those debentures.
Railways have to keep accounts to show what
is the result of the operations of the Grand
Trunk Pacifie, and what is the result of the
operations of the old Grand Trunk. These
are the reasons, I understand, why the Government deemed it advisable to consider
whether there was a means o f getting rid
of these contingent liabilities and avoiding
the neoessity of keeping these complicated
accounts.
In determining whether or not the amount
is fair, which the Canadian National Railways, guaranteed by the Government, are
undertaking to pay, one would have to know
whether the future receipts from the old
Grand Trunk will be sufficient to discharge
the liability; for I think it is taken for
granted that there will be no interest coming from the Grand Trunk Pacifie. For my
part I have no means of solving that question; I must accepit the decision of the Government. I assume that a study has been
made of conditions, and that a conclusion
must have been reached that it is a fair bargain to make.
But the question arises as to what obligation is being assumed. The amount of the
debentures being $35,000,000, the interest to
be paid annually for 32 years is $1,400,000;
therefore, we would have to ascertain what
capital is represented by the payment of
$1,400,000 per anuum for 32 years.
I appreciate the two reasons the Government have for getting rid of this obligation.
What I dislike mainly is the fact that this
Bill comes forward after an agitation on the
part of the debenture holders in England,
which to my mind was very unfair. They
had voluntarily agreed to arbitration, and
after the award was rendered they complained and tried to coerce the Canadian
Government to assume a liability which the
Government had no obligation to accept.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, the question whether or not this is a
good bargain is a problem that no one can
solve now. If the earnings of the Grand
Trunk proper are very large in the future,
then we gain by it; on the other hand, if
Hon. Mr.

lEOUE

they run down to nothing at all, we lose
by it. It is a gamble. I am not disposed
to vote against this Bill, but I want to accentuate again the fact that this is a new
bargain; that it does not grow out of anything wrong in the old bargain-anything in
the way of over-reaching on the one hand,
or being over-reached on the other. A number of business men get together and say:
"Here is the situation, and here is the proposition. It will be an advantage to the
holders of the Grand Trunk perpetual debentures if you can get that security into
such form that it will have a ready money
value in the market." It is important to
bear in mind that we are not conceding that
there was anything wrong on our part at
all. The bargain now being made is based
on the present situation.
There is this further feature.
lhe old
Grand Trunk comiprised I do not know how
many institutions; whether there were twenty
or thirty tle honourable member from
Brockville (Rt. Hon. Mr. Graham) knows
better than I do; and it is important that we
should not give the bondholders connected
with those old institutions any grounds for
coming forward with a claim based upon any
supposed concession to the Grand Trunk
Pacifie. If any of those people turn up with
a demand, they will have to be told that it
must be made on a purely business basisHon.

Mr. DANDURAND:

Absolutely.

Hon. W. B. RDOSS: -and that there is no
liability admitted in this legislation. We are
making a new bargain.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am glad I have
not the responsibility of my honourable friend
(Hon. W. B. Ross). He is leading this side of
the House. The honourable gentleman sitting
opposite (Hon. Mr. Béique) has pleaded for
the Bill with all the skill and knowledge which
everybody knows he possesses. But what is
his argument? "We must simplify the bookkeeping." That is his plea. There is now an
absolute necessity for keeping separately the
earnings of the Grand Trunk and the Grand
Trunk Pacific.
We must get rid of that
obligation. But how much have we to pay to
simplify this bookkeeping? We are going to
pay $1,400,000 a year for 32 years, which,
without interest, amounts to $44,800,000; and,
as everyhody knnws, with interest that sum
will be practically doubled. All of this huge
sum will be paid. That is to simplifv the
bookkeeping of two different roads. Every
railway can tell you at the end of every year
how much it has earned and how much it has
spent on every one of its lines. We know that
the Canadian Pacifie Railway, for instance. is

FEBRUARY 16, 1927
wel1 sware :of the amounat of 'the net earniings
of eanh of its limes. What becomes, then, of
the argument as to simnplifying t>he bookkeeprng? To my mind this difficubty dooe not,
exist.
The real question is whether we aere making
a good bargain or not? I arn going to answer
that in this way. If we are making a bad
bargain we are flot juqtified dn. d-oing se, and
we are not obliged to assume ths obligation.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
Then do flot
assume it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: There is nothing
in Iaw or in equity that constrains us to do
so. Suppose we are about to make a good
bargain. What then? My answer ie that we
have no right to make it. We have been
dealing with these peoiple in good faith. They
have put 33M,000,000 into -the Grand Trunk
Pacifie. Wbat right have we to say tihat we
will eut that in two or perhape in three? If
we are going to do such good business that
we can afford to pay full interest, it is our
duty to pay it.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Honourable gentlemen, I do not intend at this stage of the Bill
to, ask the House to listen to any lengthy
remarks with regard to -it, but I arn going
to suggest to the honourable Leader of the
Government that he allow this matter to
stand until to-rnorrow; also that before this
Bill cornes up for consideration again the
members of the Senate be furnished witb
copies of it. I have not had a copy, and I
arn told that it has not been distributed to tbe
members of the Senate.
I did not realize until to-day the seriaus
character of this legisiation, but frorn the
expianation of it as put before this House
by the honourable Leader of the Government,
I believe it is sirnply an outrage on the people
of this country.
I do flot go so far as to say that we are
flot wise in doing something to make people
think well of us, if we can do it in a decent
way. I do not say we should not pay sornething for peace in England, as might appear
desirable; but what I do say is that to ask
us to assurne the obligations that the Government put before us to-day, in the form in
which they are now, without mernbers of this
Rouse having an opportunity to, study the
Bill and becorne familiar with its details,' is
unfair and unjust to the members of the
Senate and to the people of Canada. The
suggestion has been made that the people of
Canada ought to. be prepared to make sorne
sacrifice, or give sorne expianation as to why
the English bondholders cannot get one
hundred cents on the dollar. Those creditors
32655--3à

3

put their money into the Grand Trunk Pacifie
in the same way that rnany others have put
their money into other unsuccessfuI enterprises
ail over the world, and have lost. There was a
guarantee, not that the people of Canada
wouId pay, but that the Grand Trunk Pacifie
wouId do so; and in case of default, the Grand
Trunk proper, after meeting their other obligations, were to pay as and when their earnings were sufficient, flot with the rnoney of
the people of Canada, but out of the coffers
of the company.
I think it is oniy fair that we should have
tirne to study this question, -and I move that
the Cornrnittee rise and report progress, and
ask Jeave to sit again.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course,
honourabie gentlemen, this matter has been
studied from ail angles by the officiais of the
Canadian National Railways and by the
officers of the Canadian Government. It bas
been before every Administration for the hast
seven or eight years, and the decision arrived
at is now ernbodied ini this Bill.
I really believe that any member of the
Senate can quite easily see the elements that
go to form the decision arxived at in August
hast. The men at the centre of operations
of our railway systern have brought to the
members of the various Cabinets their best
information, and have taken it upon themselves to suggest this agreement; and the
present Administration bas seen the matter
in the same light as its predecessors.
I have no objection whatever to postponing
the examination of this Bill tili to-morrow. I
hope that by that time copies of the Bill
wiil be distributed. But I would a.sk the
honourable gentlemnan who bas just spoken
(Hon. G. G. Foster) and my (honaurable
friend frorn Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) to turn over in their minds the posaibihiities. Perhaps they will realize that there
are other reaeons for this than the question
of bookkeeping, cornplicated tbough it may
be.
There is no question that the administration
of the system. is consideirably hianpered by
the present situation.
The Grand Trunk
Pacifie is still in the hands of a receiver. If
we decided to put an end to that receivership,
such action would necessarily enitail the liquidation of that part of the systern and the
bringing of it under the hammer. But, as the
ex-Minister of Railways (Rt. Hon. Mr.
Graham) lias said, there is the old Grand
Trunk Rai.lway systemn, and we have to decide on the possibilîties of that systern and
what it represents in optimism for the years
to corne.

Now, I think there is considerable advantage to be gained in clearing up that whole
question, and in abolishing this perpetual
debenture and limiting the liability to 32

Hon. Mri. BEIQUE: Before the motion is

to the question put by the honourable Leader
on the other side (Hon. W. B. Ross) as to
whether there remains a class of securities
which may demand practically the same treatment, or require the continuation of the bookkeeping of the Grand Trunk Pacific and the
old Grand Trunk Railway.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I also ask
the honourable Leader of the Goveroment to
enligliten us as to the income off the Grand
Trunk Pacifie within the last ycar, se that wc

which we are iegislating. The matter is presented to us now in such a way that we have
the whole future of this road to consider, and

GRAND TRUNK PACIFIC SECURITIES
BTLL
FURTHER CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE AND
REPORTED

The Senate again went into Committee on
Bill 57. an Act respecting the Grand Trunk
Pacifie Railway Company and respecting the
Canadian National Railways.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
On section 2 (reconsidered)-scheme of arrangement confirmed:
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In view of the unexpected and very decisive information that
has been given with respect to this Bill, for
my part I do not feel that I would be justified
in continuing to oppose it. I only regret that
the information was not given before. It
might have prevented a long and useless discussion.
Section 2 was agreed to.
On section 3-scheme to be operative upon
passing of this Act:
Hon. Mr. HAYDON.

Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Does that wipe out
any of the bondholders?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Ninety per
cent of the bondholders have agreed to come
in under the scheme; and under the Railway
Act, which is similar to the British Act, the
reet will have no option, but will be treated
as coming under the scheme.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: They are brought in
nolens volens.
Section 3 was agreed to.
Sections 4 to 7, inclusive, were agreed ta.
On section S-Certificates for £3,000,000 of
Pacifie Stock held as security to be surrendered and cremated:
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will the honourable gentleman give us some information as
to that? It is rather involved.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: May I read the
explanation printed with the Bill?
This provision is to enable the charge on the
property of the Pacifie Company to be cancelled
as mentioned above in connection with Section
6. The certificate of the £3,000,000 of Pacifie
Stock is merely collateral security to the £2,000,000 advance made to the old Grand Trunk Railway of Canada which is now the Canadian
National Railway Company. The Crown holds
the Grand Trunk Railway Company's notes for
the £2,000,000 and the certificates of Pacifie
Stock are of no greater value than the notes,

and practically of no value. Provision is therefore made for their cancellation without, how-

ever, affecting the indebtedness between the
parties.
That is a question of bookkeeping.
Section 8 was agreed to.
Section 9 was agreed to.
On section 10-receivership of Grand Trunk
Pacifie Railway to terminate:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would ask the honourable gentleman about the discharge of
the receivership of the Grand Trunk Pacifie.
Is the liabilitv on the perpetual debenture
bonds the only liability of the whole Grand
Trunk Pacific? How does it come that the
mere payment of this one debt justifies the
discharge of the liquidator? What becomes
of other liabilities?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There seems to
be no obligation outside of this one-no other
obligation that is not already assumed either
directly by the Government guaranteeing, or
indirectly by the Government having guaranteed Grand Trunk Railway issues.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Then everything has
been paid, in substance?

FEBRUARY 17, 1927
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Or hea been
assumed.
Hon, W. B. R.OSS: That iz the same thing,
as far as windiflg up is concerned.
Hon. Mr. BEAtIBIEN: That means, I
suppose, that pei4'-ng this settlement the
receivership could nlot be terminated, and now
everything is adjusted?
Hon, Mr. GRAHAM: Every impediment is
removed.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Everything has been
aasumed, or will have been assumed.
Section 10 was agreed to.
Section Il was agreed to.
On Schedule "A":
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will the stock that
will be redeemed by the drawing of 'lots in the
first ten years, as mentioned in section 2 of
the schedule, be paid for at 100 cents on the
dollar?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: I wouid asic the
honourable gentleman why there is a minimum
of £60 in the redemption of stock on purchase
by tender onily? If a man tendered to sel
hie stock at £55, why should that price not be
taken?
flan. Mr, DANDURAND: I would asic Mr.
Yates to corne te the floor.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In the purchase of
stock by tender the minimum fixed la £60;
but in regard to the drawing of lots5 the provision rends, "a sufficient amount of the stock
to exhauet at par" the sinking fund moneys.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: That is a gamble.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Perhaps sny honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) can give
us seine enlightenment on clause 2, in which
it la stated that the tenders shaHl be m~ade for
"gnot dess than £60 and not more than £100".
Why limit the amaount of the tender Vo not
less than £60? If a man prefers to have his
capital by tendering at £50, why should we
prevent him from getting it? Many people
mightprefer te have their money in their own
business rather than in this stock at 2 per
cent. Then again, why put a limit at £100
when the Oovemnxent hias the right ta redeem
it at £100? Why say, "Don't send more than
£100"? It seems futile ta put that in.
Hlon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: 0f course that
feature of it does no harmi ta anybody. It la
quite clear.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But the lirait of £60
does harm. Why should we noV have the
right ta repurchase if any of those holders
want ta seli for less than £60?

39

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That figure was
struek after discussion between the two
interests,--4e holders and the intending purchasers. This schemne is a ibilateral ane, and
that form has been agreed upon. It would
be imipossibls for me, unleas 1 consultsd the
attorney who drafted it, and who met the
parties, ta say why those figures were flxed
upan in the arrangement.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: la it not extremely
unusual? In ordinary companies, when issues
of bonds are redeemable, tenders are put in
without any minimum; but this scheme permanently pegs the lowest price of the stock et
£60, instead of leaving it ta the open market.
It means that anyone holding this stock until
the time cames for the first drawing la bound
te geV nlot less than £60. I cannat see any
reason for that feature, or any advantage ini
it ta the Government of Canada.
Hon. M.r. DANRURAND: Very likely it
was arranged by flguring what Vhs bonds
would be worth. When one knows thst a
bond has 32 years ta mnr, and the holder wi'lll
receive only 2 per cent interest. one can
easily ascertain what it will seli for; and probably one of the conditions may have been
that if there is sny caîl for the withdriawal of
bonds the holders shaîl get at least £60. It
will be for the company te decide when and
ta what extent they wiUi pay for bonds before
the expiry of the ten years, and the figure at
which Vhey will agree te purchase them.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: But for Vhe fi-Mt
ten yetra they are bound te apply the sinicing
fund ta the purchase of bonds.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It would depend
on the sinking fund.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Yes; but ordinarily,
where there la a sinking fund, tenders are put
in without any limitation, without pegging the
price at a certain figure, such as £60 in this
case.
Han. Mr. BEAUBIEN: It seems ta me we
are legîslating now ta limit the liberty of
those Who are ta put in tenders.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: No, we are giving
tbem. an advantage.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But we are preventing thase people from sending in any
tender lower than £60. We cannat accept
any tender at less than £60; so if any hclder
sends ia a tender for £50, that la too cheap,
and we have ta wait until hie sends back a
tender for £60 bef are we acept it. Why
should we degielate ta limit the liberty ai
those who offer these bonds?

40

SENATE

Hon,. Mr. DANDURAND: I wou'ld point
out to my hionourable friend that the holders
may expect .by postponing the date of payment, to get a hundred cents on the dollar. It
is for them ta decide what rate they will take
for their holdings during those first ten years,
because after ten years they are entitled to
100 per cent. This arrangement has been a
matter of discussion between the two interested
parties, and I wou'ld be very slow to suggest
that we sh-ould amend it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In other words, that
arrangement must be accepted in toto, or not
at ail? That is the answer?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I should think
190.

Hon. Mr. BEATJBIEN: Then there is no
use in di8cussing it. It i.s like a treaty. But
it is very unusual.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: It is s0 unusual
and improvident that I think that opinion
,ought ta be hedged.

FIRST READING

Bill 65, an Act ta incorporate

a National

Cýomnmittee for the celebration of the Diamond
Jubilee of Confederation.-llon. Mr. Dandu-~
rand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDI RAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
Hie sid: Honourable gentlemen, it will be
remembered that at the la.st session of ParliaHon. Mr. BEAUBTEN,

ment the honourable member from Toronto
(lion. Mr. Lewis) moved a resolution in
favaur of a solemn celebration of t.he sixtieth
anniversary of Confederation. That motion,
which met with the unanimaus approval of
this Chamber, was very well received by the
country at large, and it has been agreed on
a14 hands that there shouýld be a fitting celebratien of Canada's Diam-ond Jubilee.
The Government has thought that this
matter should be eanfided ta a Cammittee
compased of a number of representative
Canadians, who would gather in Ottawa and
appoint an executive and decide an the general
outlines of a program. The persans mnentioned in this Bill as farming the Committee
will have ta meet probably but once, ta appoint
an executive that will have charge of the
whale celebration. The Committee may also
decide ta day down some general rules or
prnci-ples.
Memibers of the Committee named are His
Excellency the GovernÔr General; Her Excellency the Viscountess Willinýgdon; His
Honour William D. Ross, Lieutenant Governor
of Ontario, and aIll the Lieutenant Governors
and Prime Ministers of the variaus provinces;
the Prime Minister of Canada and some of
his oolleagues; the Right Honourable Francis
A. Anglin, Chief Justice of Canada; t!he Right
Honourable Sir George Eulas Foster; the
Right Honourable George P. Graham; the
Right Honourable Sir Robert Laird Borden;
the Honourable Sir George Halsey Perley. 1
wilýl dispense with the reading of the entire
page of na-mes. They are the names of persans holding official positions throughout Canada. This Committee will 'have at its disposal the sumn of $250,000, xvhich, will corne
from the Dominion Exchequer.
The abjects of the Corporation shaîl be ta

make andl carry out tlîe necessary arrangements
in co-operation with tlîe several provinces and
other bodies active ta that end for an effective
celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the
formation of the Domninion of Canada, and ta
adiniiiister aiid (istribilte tie grant herein
ientianeil andl any further grant or grants
hereafter madeo or inone3 s receiv cd by it for the
said purposes.
LTnder this scheme, there miay be contributions from the -prov
inces or the provinces may
decide ta organize their own comimittees and
v ote maneys fromi their own exche-quers.
The affairs of the Corporation shall be admninistered by an Executive Committee consisting of a Chairman and such other officers
and members as the Corporation may fromn
time to time determine. The persans whose
names are mentioned in section 2, part of
which I read, shahl constitute the proviisional
Executive Committee, which shahl hold its
first meeting in Ottawa.

FEBRUARY 18, 1927
The Corporation shall have power to cooperate with any other bodies organized and
established in any place in Canada for purposes
similar to those of the Corporation.
The Corporation shall have power to accept
contributions or receive moneys from any source
and for the purposes of this Act to apply or
expend the same.
The Corporation may out of the moneys
vested in it pay all expenses it thinks necessary
or proper to incur, or which it considers have
been properly incurred by the Corporation or
on its behalf in connection with the carrying
out of the objects of this Act.
The financial operations will be duly audited.
This Bil, in its form, reminds me of the
one we passed for the creation of the Canadian Patriotic Fund, which worked so sati atorily for the people of Canada.
I think that with this explanation the Senate
will not abject to my moving the second
reading of this Bill now.

ROYAL AGRICULTURAL WINTER FAIR
ASSOCIATION BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 64, an Aot for the granting of assistance
to the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair Association of Canada ait Toronto, Ontario.-Hon.
Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, at the
request of the Royal Agricuiltural Winter
Fair Association of Canada and the live stock
associations of Canada, the Government has
deemed it proper to join with the province
of Ontario in enlarging te operations and
the housing of the Winter Fair.
The city of Toronto furnished the land and
bas already spent $1,500,000 for the buildings
in which to hold the exhibition. It was
thought at te time the buildings were erected
that they would be quite sufficient for a number of years, but hardly two or three years
had passed when there was a demand for
twice the accommodation available. The
matter was then discussed as to the advantage
to Canada in developing this live stock
exhibition, which has taken on national, even
international proportions. It wili probably
very soon rival the live stock exhibition of

41

Chicago. Everybody knows that our exhibits
go to Chicago and return quite often with the
blue ribbon.
The Government of Canada thought it
could not refuse the suggestion to join with
the Province of Ontario in extending te
operations of tiis Association, and for that
purpose it suggests to Parliament to vote
twenty annuities of $35,000 each representing
$700,000, which amount is equal to that given
by the Province.
The area covered by the present buildings
is a little over five acres. With the expenditure of the sum of $1,400,000, which is
represented by these annuities and will very
likely be capitalized, the space covered wilil
exceed twelve acres. This Winter Fair will
be one of te biggest things in Canada, and
I real.ly believe that the proposed investm-ent
is justified. The exhibition has already had
considerable success and is bound to develop
very rapidly.
With these explanations I ask leave of the
Senate to «nove the second reading of this
Bill.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER:
gentlemen, I would like a little information,
as I came in perhaps a little late. I understood the honourable leader of the Government to say that this is an international affair.
I understand it is a winter fair. Is that right?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
fair.

Yes, a winter

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: On what ground
is it tq be considered an international affair?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Because of the
exhibits from the south. I do not know that
exhibits bave come from countries other than
the United States. Honourable members who
have had direct contact with that exhibition
could perhaps give further information. I used
the expression "international" because Americans are coming to that fair, as well as exhibitors and visitors from all parts of Canada.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: But I suppose it
is understood by honourable members that
there are winter fairs in other provinces than
Ontario. While I am not objecting to the
amount of this grant, I know that I shall be
asked why we should pay this money for a
winter fair in Toronto, and whether other
provinces of the Dominion will not be in a
position to ask for grants for their winter
fairs.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: But they get them
now. I know the Winter Fair at Amherst, in
Nova Scotia, gets a grant.

42

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: There is one in
Winnipeg.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Can the honourable gentleman give us any information?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, I can; because I have read what the 'Minister of Agriculture said in answer to such an inquiry. He
said that each case would have to be decided
on its own merits. Here we have an, exhibition which, apparently on account of its
geographical situation, bas assumed such proportions as to justify the Government in
joining with the Province of Ontario in helping to develop it. There is nothing in the Bill
which says that the liberality of the Dominion
Government and of Parliament shall stop there,
and conditions may arise which would justify
a similar gift or advance from the Federal
Treasury. I am sure that each case would be
judged on, its merits and decided in a spirit
of justice and fair play to the other provinces.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Can the honourable gentleman inform me whether any provincial winter fairs have received grants from
the Federal Parliament?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course my
honourable friend lays emphasis on the word
"winter''.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Did not the honourable gentleman call it a winter fair?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If I am not mistaken, there bas been a classification of exhibitions throughout the country, and at one
time Winnipeg came under Class A for a gift
from the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That was a
summer exhibition.
Hon. Mr. DANýDURAND: That was a summer exhibition. Winnipeg ceased for a time
to qualify for that subsidy, and the hope was
expressed elsewhere that before long Winnipeg
would resume its former activities and develop
its exhibition.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: But the Province
of Manitoba holds a very important fair.
There is a misunderstanding. The honourable
gentleman does not say that this fair in
Ontario is a September fair, does he? I think
I am right in defining it as a winter fair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This winter
fair is held in November, I am told.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: This is not the
regular summer fair that is held in that
Province. That is what I understood. The
honourable gentleman speaks of Winnipeg.
There bas not been a fair, or exhibition, as
we are accustomed to call it, held in WinHon. Mr. STANFIELD.

nipeg for a number of years; but a really
good fair is held in Brandon in July. We
hold also what is called the Winter Fair, and
I believe it bas become quite a prominent
institution.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is the
winter fair in Winnipeg?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: No; it is in
Brandon. There bas been no fair of any
importance held in Winnipeg for a number of
years. I know that the other provinces have
been receiving grants for their summer fairs,
but. so far as I know, none for winter fairs,
and this is, I understand the first 'instance
in which a grant bas been given to a winter
fair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is my
impression.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: I think the honourable gentleman is wrong-if he will pardon
rue. At Amherst, Nova Scotia, a Winter Fair
bas been held for some years. That being
a central point, stock is shown there from
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island. I am quite sure I am stating
the faot when I say that a grant is given each
year from the Dominion Government towards
the prize list of that fair.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I am in doubt
whether this is an additional grant or whether
it is to be charged to the ordinary grant in
connection with live stock and deducted from
the appropriation for that purpose. Are we
voting an additional sum of $700,000, spread
over twenty years?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is an
absolutely separate grant, under an agreement with the Ontario Government.
Hon. JOHN WEBSTER: This Winter Fair
is held after all the fall fairs have been coneluded. The very best specimens of stock
produced in America, that have been prizewinners at the local fairs, are sent to Toronto,
where they compete with one another. This
is, I -believe, the greatest live stock fair in
the British Empire. I have heard men from
as far south as Texas and from the far west
say that they have never seen anything to

compare with the Royal Winter Fair, and I
agree with them, after having attended most

of the fairs in America.
is in a class by itself.
to be found anywhere

tion bas every right to

The Toronto Fair

The very best stock
on the American confair, and the Associabe proud of it.

Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: I think I can
throw a little light on the question whether
this is an international show. At the Toronto

FEBRUARY 18, 1927
Winter Fair there are horgs in jumping classes,
officers' chargers, steeple-chase horses, and so
on, from France and Belgium. This Fair is
held net only after the exhibitions throughout thç -country have elosed, but a.fter ail the
crops including vegetables and fruits of al
descrliptions, have been gathered in. Therefore it la realdy an international exhibition,
and it is acknewledged by Americans, and by
people from the British Isies and elsewhere,
to 'be the greatest and most succcssful show
of its description in the world.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

Honourable gentlemen, the
Re eaid:
object of this Bill is to authorize -the Governor in Council to lend to the Corporation
of the Harbour Commissioners of Montreal
the sum of $12,000,000 for the construction
of terminal f acilities. Every honourable
gentleman in this Chamber knows of the
consîderable development that is going on in
some of our ports, and tihe congestion which
lias become apparent in the last f ew years
in the port of Montreal.
The elevator capacity of the port of Montreal le 12,162,000 bushels. The total slipment of grain through that port in 1921
was 100000,000; in 1926 it was 166,000,000
bushels. Ail the corporations that have to
do *with ahip#jing have been pressing for
larger facilities for the handling of the incoming and ouit-going ocean freight; at that
port.
The Harbour ComTnissioners asic leave to
proeceed to provide those greater facilities.
The sum of $12,000,000, whidh la asked by
them, la to be spent under the following
heads: harbour dredging, 8800,000; wharves,
piers and basins, $5,400,000; plant, $155,000;
shops and buildings, $322,000; railways and

3300,000; grain elevators, 83,155,000; sundries,

$142,000.

of Deepening off Windmill
Point Basin. $90,000.
MWhile the southern haîf off this Basin was
dredged inany years ago for deep draft vesselio
and equipped with modern deep draft wharf,
the north haîf provided only 25 to 27 f eet
depth, and the wharves consisted off old obsolescent crib-work extonding only from 17 te
22 feet uinder the -vater, in a more or less
ruinons and dangerous condition.
iSubsequent to the Commissioners taking over
Ebevator "B' and extending its facilities it
liecame imperative to proeeed with the reconstruction off the wharf and the deepening off
the north haîf off the Basin, and the Commissioners were accordingly authorized to proceed
with a haîf off this work, and the remaining
baîf on the north side has yet to be done, or
in other words three-quarters off the entire
Basin has now been deepened, suitable for deep
draft vessels, and it is estimated that the sum
off $90.000 is required for the deepening off the
rernaining qoarter, thus completing the whole
Basin.
2. Dredging on Forsyth Shoal, $235,000.
In order to proceed with wharff eonstroction
below the Sutherland Pier it is necessary to
reniove portions off the Forsyth Shoal as the
7ork progresses, while at the same time it is
imperative that dredging be done at the upstream end off the Shoal, as its present contour
renders it a menace to ships approaching and
departing ffrom the Sutherland and Tarte piers
and nneoscomplaints and representations
have been made to the Commissioners botb by
pilots and shipping interests, who have urgently

the sum off $235,000 will cover the necessary
woirk reqoiring to be done during the next
three years.
3. Channel between Racine Wharff and Dry
Dock Channel, $85,000.
The present channel leading to Vulean Whiarf
and Racine Pier ffollows along the North Shore
froni Longue Pointe, terminating at Racine Pier
io a cul cie-sac, which obliges ships bertbing at
1.-Completion

tiiose -wharves to tomn around in a very narrow

FEBRUARY 18, 1927
channel at considerable risk, vessels frequently
going aground and having te be pulled off by
tugs.
The traffic at those two wharves bas increased
so tremendously during the past two years that
there is also congestion under the present conditions and some relief is imperative. It is,
therefore, proposed to dredge, from the end
of the existing channel, a passage connecting
with the channel leading te the Dry Dock, 8o
that ships unloading at the Vulcan Wharf and
Racine Pier may be able te depart through the
proposed channel on light draft, thereby avoiding risks of grounding and preventing congestion te traffic.
It is proposed te carry out this work during
the present season and the estimated cost is
$85,000.
4.-Bickerdike Basin and Approach, $390,000.
This work bas been in progress for many
years, appropriations having been granted froum
time te time; each section authorized has now
been completed and the above sum. of $390,000
is required to complete another section during
the next three years.
The work consists of the dredging of the
valuable area in the central harbour lying between the Bickerdike Pier and the Guard Pier,
where further accommodation is urgently required, net only for additional berthage, but
also for accommodation of inland vessels awaiting their turn te be unloaded at the Commissioners' elevators, and the work now proposed
will permit of the building of the south side
of the Bickerdike Piçr for the one and provide
additional basin area for the other.
The material te be dredged consists entirely
of rock and the work now proposed is therefore
the most efficient, expeditious and economical
method by which the Commissioners can obtain
sufficient rock fill for the various wharves in
course of construction and proposed te be constructed, and for this purpose also authorization
of an appropriation of the above amount is
urgently required.
Total for Harbour Dredging, $800,000.
B-WHABvES, PIEnS AND BASINS
The rapid increase in the business of the

harbour during the past two or three years has
taxed the berthing accomodation te the utmost;
new steamship lines have come te the port, those
already established have brought in additional
ships of greater tonnage and inaugurated new
services, with the result that, while the year
1924 established the record for the greatest
number of ocean steamships coming te the port
over all previous years, the increase in aggregate tonnage of ocean and sea-going vessels in
1925 was twenty-five per cent greater than in
1924. The Harbour Commissioners have been,
consequently, hard put te it te meet the demands
for allotments, and while, with considerable
difficulty, all applicants were in a way accommodated, many had te do with less space than
was asked for and no doubt required for the
more efficient carrying out of their business.
This method of procedure cannot go on
indefinitely and bas now reached its limit, and
if additional berthing accommodation is net soon
available the business of the Port will suffer
serious detriment. - The Commissioners, therefore, earnestly request that provision be made
for carrying out the following program of wharf

4a

construction during the next three years, to
meet a situation which will otherwise become
serions.
1.-Extension of Bickerdike Pier, $930,000.
The only area remaining for development in
the upper harbour is that lying between the
Bickerdike Pier and the Guard Pier, and it bas
always been the intention to proceed with the
construction of the south side of the Bickerdike
Pier as soon as the dredging, which was inaugurated for that purpose and has been going
on for many years, had reached a sufficiently
advanced stage.
The area of the new 'basin now completed
permits of wharf construction being begun and
it is anticipated, with the continuance of dredging operations, that a length of at least 1,000
feet of wharf can be built within the next three
years. This site, being located within the
central harbour, is especially desirable and is
sufficiently prepared for the immediate construction of a berth 500 feet in length, which
it is proposed to carry out this year.
Owing to the importance of the location it is
proposed to use reinforced concrete cribs, for
greater durability and permanence, as was successfully done in the reconstruction of the wharf
in the adjoining basin during the past year.
2.-Continuation of reconstruction of Windmill Point Wharf, $1,715,000.
After the acquisition of Elevator "B" from
the Montreal Warehousing Company, the Commissioners were authorized te add to the storage
capacity and the unloading facilities and erect
modern grain conveyor galleries for the loading
of ocean steamships. They were also authorized
to replace, with a modern deep draft reinforced
concrete quay wall, a length of 1,200 feet of the
original old timber crib wall, which was of
shallow depth and in such condition that
collapse was imminent and in point of fact
occurred as soon as reconstruction was begun.
The portion of the work as authorized is now
practically completed, but the remaining portions of ·the old wharf are in the same condition
as above described.
It is requested, therefore, that provision be
made for continuing the reconstruction of this
wharf in such stages as may be necessary in
the course of the next two or three years, and
the estimated cost of completing the remainder
of the wharf is $1,715,000.
of extension of high level
3. -Continuation
shore wharves, sections numbers 25 te 35,
$1,190,000.
This is the only site that bas been available
in' comparatively close proximity te the central
harbour, for many years, where additional
wharfage could be constructed rapidly. Appropriations have been granted from time te time,
construction and extension bas gone. on almost
continuously, and as soon as each berth has
been completed it bas been immediately occupied.
This section of the harbour in recent years
bas been devoted almost exclusively te the
handling of bulk mineral cargoes, for which
accommodation bas been so limited, and the
berths are of the improved "saw-tooth" type.
The Commissioners merely ask authorization te
proceed with this work as bas been donc in
the past, and the above sum of $1,190,000 is
to provide for the construction of two additional "saw-tooth" berths and complete te high
level the others presently constructed te low
level in accordance with authorization, which

46

SENATE

will practically complete wbarf construction in
this section of the harbour during the next
three years.
4.-New Wharves below Sutherland Pier
(Section 47-48), $810,000.
As the whole of that portion of the harbour
above the Laurier Pier is approaching complete development, no site or space is available in that section for a sufficiently large
scheme of expansion to take care of rapidly
increasing business and anticipated future requirements. The Commissioners were, therefore, obliged four years ago to begin the intensive development -of the Maisonneuve section of the harbour.
Elevator No. 3 has
been built in close proximity to the Tarte
Pier, a grain unloading jetty has been constructed and the adjoining existing berths
equipped with grain handling facilities. Any
wharf construction carried ont immnediately
above this location would merely be a replacement of existing wharves which, although they
are only of the old low level timber crib work
type and will eventually have to be replaced
by walls of modern construction, canot be
dispensed with until additional berthage is
available elsewhere to take care of the business
which they now accommodate. The additional
accommodation so urgently required eau, therefore, only be obtained by proceeding downstream from the Sutherland Pier, where ample
width of wharf is obtainable.
It is estimated that the above sum of
$810,000 will permit of the completion of
1,000 lineal feet of additional wharf at this
location within the next tlree years.
5.-Reconstruction of Jacques Cartier Pier,
$330.000.
The tbree main piers in the central harbour,
completed about twenty-five years ago. were
constrciited entirely from foundation cope in
timber, and as the life of timber crib work
above water level is not usually expeted to
exceed from twelve to fifteen years, the Commissioners have had under contemplation their
reconstruction for the last fifteen years.
Reconstruction. of course, necessitates outting
the portion of wharf to be dealt with out of
commission. partly or wholly during the season of navigation. and wbile the Commissioners'
programme fifteen years ago was to do one
brth each season. accommodation was so
limitcd on accoinmt of increasing business that
it has been practically impossible to take possession of a single berth for this purpose. The
only part of this work that bas so far been
accomplished was done in 1115 and 1910 when,
by neans of the elosost co-operation of the
Manchester Lino officials. who did all in their
power to facilitate lhe work, while at the
same time maintaining their iwn services, the
reconstruction of the dowin-stream half of the
Jacques Cartier Pier was accomplished.
Fortunately the materials and worknanship
of the original piers have been of a very high
quality, and, so far, by careful and sometimes
somewhat heavy maintenance, it has been possible to keep the old wharves in commission,
but reconstruction is very urgently required
and it is hoped to proceed with the work as
soon as additional berthing accommodation is
available, while there is always the contingencv
of soei portion giving ont at any tinie and
necessitating immediate action.
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

The Commissioners, therefore, request that
the above sum of $330,000, which is the
estimated cost of reconstructing the up-stream
face of the Jacques Cartier Pier, be provided,
in order that that or any other more urgent
portion may be proceeded with as may be
necessary.

6.--Industrial Wharves, $425,000.
The Commissioners have had before them
for some time applications from the present
lessees of the Vulcan Wharf and the Canada
Cement Wharf, Montreal East, for extensions
to these wharves, which increasing musiness
has rendered imperative. The estimated cost
of the required extension to the Vulcan Wharf
amounts to $267.000, the extension to the Canada Cement Wharf $158,000, making a total
of $425,000, and the industries guarantee the
necessary revenue to warrant the work being
undertaken.
It is requested. therefore, that the necessary
provision bc made in order that these items
may be carried out during the present «year.
Total for Wharves, Piers and Basins,
$5,400,000.
C-PLANT
I Locomotive Cranes, $45,000.
The Commissioners' force of locomotive cranes,
formerly used mainly on construction, have
had to be utilized almost exclusively during the
past two or three years for wharf service in
unloading cargoes from ocean steamships. The
demiands for this service became so great during
the past year that the present force of cranes,
even by working twenty-four hours a day. could
not meet requirenients, and two additional locomotive cranes are immediately necessary to
overtake tie business in prospect for the
present season.
The estimated cost of two new locomotive
cranes is $45,000.
2 Flat Scows, $110,000.
The extended nature of operations consequent
upon harbour improvements in general has
rendered the present fleet of scows totally inadequate for the efficient service of the dredges
and derricks engaged in reclamation work, and
six additional flat scows are necessary to meet
these requirements, as well as supply such
lightering services as are required by shipping.
The above sum of $110,000 is the estimated
cost of constructing six new flat scows.
Total for Plant, $155,000.
D-s5rOPS AND BUILDINGS
Extension of Harbour Yard, $322,000.
The enlargement of the grain elevator system
lias increased proportionately the amount of
machinery repairs and maintenance donc by
the Mechanical Department, and four years
ago the Comnissioners were obliged to erect
up-to-date mechanical shops at the Yard at
Hochelaga, at which are alse situated the
locomotive shops.
The change from steam to electric traction
necessitates garage accommodation for the electrie locomotives and the establishment of a
power sub-station, and these, for the greatest
efficiency and economy, should bc provided at
this location. In order to provide for these
facilities it is necessary to generally re-model
the arrangements at the Yard; divert and
bridge over the Aylwin Street ramp and generally extend the Yard eastward.

The above sum of $322,000 is estimated ta
:over all necessary expenditures in connection
with the extension.
Total for Shops and Buildings, $322,000.
E-RAILWAYS AND

ELECTRIFICATION

Railways.-The steady increase in railway
traffic during the past five years has necessitated a constant yearly enlargement of the
railway system, and in order ta avoid congestion relief is necessary at the after-mentioned
locations:
1.-Two additional tracks on site of existing
roadway between McGill Street and Section
No. 19, including a connection ta track outside
flood wall, opposite the Harbour Building, with
necessary turn-outs. Estimated cost, $75,000.
2.-Tracks between Parthenais and Poupart
streets, in the vicinity of the C.P.R. Junction,
ta serve the new "saw-tooth" wharves recently
constructed at Sections numbers 30 ta 32.
Estimated cost, $52,000.
3.-Two additional tracks from upper end
of Dominion Coal Wharf ta Desery Street,
iainly for service ta Elevator No. 3, as well
as general traffic, including widening of embankment and the erection of six girder
bridges. Estimated cost, $145,000.
Total for Railways, $272,000.
Electrification.-The electrification of railway
terminals had been contemplated by the Harbour Commissioners as early as 1915, but it
was decided not ta begin operations until after
the War, and work was accordingly begun in
1919, with the result that when the present
Commission took office seventy-five per cent of
the then existing tracks had been electrified.
The present Commissioners have completed
the electrification of the remaining portion of
the railway system, including such additional
tracks as have from time ta time been laid
down, and it has been necessary for them as
the system expanded ta add ta the generating
equipment and provide traction equipment, and
the items as enumerated below are required
for the electrification of track extensions proposed ta be carried out during the present year,
enlargement of the generating equipment and
additional traction equipment that is immediately necessary for operation of the system as
presently developed and ta meet the probable
requirements of the next two or three years:
I.-Electrification of track extensions above
enumerated, including railway transmission
hnes, estimated cost, $69,000.
2
.- Power sub-station at Harbour Yard, including two motor generators and equipments,
estimated cost, $280,000.
3.-Miscellaneous additional equipment in
existing stations, emergency construction car,
and installation of telephones throughout the
system, estimated cost, $56,000.
4.-Five new Electrie Locomotives, $600,000.
5.-Erection of garage at Harbour Yard for
locomotives, $65,000.
Total for electrification, $1,070,000.
Grand total, $1,342,000.
F.-PERMANENT

SHEDS

Permanent sheds, $300,000.
The Commissioners have had the same difficulties with regard ta demands for transit sheds
as they have had for allotments, and during

the past two years have not been able ta meet
all the applications. While the Commissioners
have, in a manner, allocated such accommodation as was available among all applicants,
nevertheless there were always several applicants who had ta do with a shed less than
asked for, and the difficulty hitherto in providing for this deficiency bas been the lack of
wharf space, but it is hoped that with the completion of wharf extensions under construction,
and some of those now proposed, sites for additional sheds will be available at an early
date.
Additional sheds must be provided as soon as
possible and the above amount of $300,000 is
the estimated cost for the erection of two semidetached single storey reinforced concrete sheds
with overhead craneway, similar ta existing
sheds numbers 26 and 27, for which provision
should be made so that erection can be begun
as soon as a site is available.

G--GRAIN

ELEVATORS

I.-Additional storage at Elevator No. 3,
$2,700.000.
A Grain Elevator Committee appointed by
the Ministers of Marine and Fisheries and of
Railways and Canals on March 29, 1922, after
an intensive study of the congestion which
took place in the years 1921 and 1922, recommended that additional storage ta the extent
of three million bushels should be immediately
added ta the facilities of the Port of Montreal,
in the expectation of the volume of grain
handled in 1922 being maintained, and stated,
further, that a further extension of two and
a half million bushels would be justified in
the event of business increasing.
Following
upon this recommendation the Commissioners
were authorized ta enlarge the storage facilities
at Elevator "B" by approximately one and a
quarter million bushels, and ta construct a
new elevator at Maisonneuve with an initial
storage capacity of two million bushels.
These works were begun in 1923 and were
pressed as rapidly as possible ta completion.
but the additional storage of three and a
quarter million bushels so provided was nat
really fully available until the season of 1925,
with the result that the amount of grain received for shipment being over 165.000,000
bushels. as compared with 155,000,000 bushels
in 1922, about 10,000,000 bushels more grain
had ta he handled with practically the same
storage facilities.
This situation was greatly aggravated in the
fall by the lack of demand for export. and on
'September 3 no less than 63 lake boats were
waiting ta be unloaded at the harbour elevators, causing considerable hardship ta the in]and water carriers, while in the month of
October the railway companies suffered in like
manner from similar causes.
Last season,
these additional facilities being in full operation, the quantity of grain received for shipment being approximately the same, and supply
and demand being less at variance, the situation was decidedly improved; nevertheless,
even under those conditions, in the month of
May there were actually forty-two lake vessels
waiting ta be unloaded.
These conditions prove that the findings of
the Grain Elevator Committee were correct,
and show that an addition ta the storage of
the Port of not less than three million bushels

SENATE

48

is immediately necessary, even if the present
volume of business is maintained, and still
greater additions must be made if the volume
of business increases. Elevator No. 3 at its
inception was planned as the first unit of a
future expansion just to provide for such contingencies.
The present storage capacity is two million
bushels, but the working arrangements, intake
and delivery were designed to serve a very
much larger bouse, the ultimate capacity contemplated being between twelve and fourteen
million bushels, the plan being to add additional units of about three million bushels
capacity fron time to time as the increase in
business demanded.
The Commissioners therefore earnestly ask
for authorization to proceed with a second
storage unit of three million bushels at Elevator No. 3, the estimated cost of which is
$2.700,000, which sum includes cost of pile
foundations, connecting conveyor galleries and
all other necessary equipment.
2.-Extension of Conveyor Galleries in Central Harbour. $65.000.
The Alexandra, King Edward and Jacques
Cartier Piers baving been lengthened about
250 feet to accommodate the largest ships now
coming to the port, it is necessary to extend
the existing conveyor galleries, on both sides
of these piers, sufficiently to serve the enlarged
berths, and the estimated cost of the necessary
extensions amounts to $65.000.
3.-Improvement and extension of Conveyor
Galleries at Flevator "B", $100,000.
Plans, specifications and estimates for this
work were submitted and approved last year,
but while the total estimated cost amounted
ta $400,000, only a sufficient amount, namely,
$300,000, was asked for, and granted, for the
sections of the work carried ont last year.
The work has been carried out according to
prograi and authorization and the above
sum of $100,000 is necessary to carry ont the
work proposed to be done this year, accordieg
to program already approved.
4.-Installation of protective devices in
Elevators numbers 1, 2 and "B", $160,000.
The explosion which took place in Elevator
"B" on December 1, 1924, not only occasioned
a very thorough investigation of the origin by
several independent authorities, at the request
of the Commissioners, but during the past year
a very seriots study vas made of the possibilities of eliminating contributory conditions,
with a veiw to making the harbour elevators
as nearly as possible immune front this danger,
not only for the protection of harbour property
and the lives of the operators, but also for the
safety of properties in the vicinity of the elevators and the public in general.
After consultation with expert authorities and
their own offheors, the Commissioners decided to
install at the earliest possible date a systen
of protective devices, consisting of automatic
windows and shutters, together with vents in
the legs, bins. hoppers, etc., and the installation
of dust collecting systems in the older elevators,
numbers 1, 2 and "B"; the new elevator No. 3,
having been already equipped with all such
devices during erection.
The total cost of these protective measures
in the thrce elevators amounts to $160,000.
5.-New power station at Elevator No. 1,
$130,000.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

The installation of six car unloaders in
Elevators numbers 1 and 2, together with the
extensions of the conveyor galleries on the
central piers, greatly increases the power requirements at these elevators, and as power can
no longer be supplied froin the main railway
power station on account of greater power
requirements for the operation of the railways,
it is necessary to establish a new sub-station in
the vicinity of Elevator No. 1, for 12,000-volt
service to take care not only of the additional
requirements above described, but also to provide for increased power and lighting service in
general in this section of the harbour.
The estimated cost of erecting and equipping
the station amounts to $130,000.
Total for grain elevators, $3,155,000.

The question generally asked of the members recently -appointed to this Chamber has
borne upon their vievm concerning tihe question of Senate reform.
As members of the Liberal party and
adherents to its policy, Vhey have not hesitated
to declare that they were favourable to a
reform of the Senate whieh. would bring this
Chamber nearer the modern and democratie
conception of a second Chamber, with the
clear understanding thýat said changes would

CANADA'S

RAILWAY PROBLEIMS

INQUIRY AND DISCUSSION

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON rose in accordance with the following notice:
That hie will caîl the attention of the Government to certain matters affecting Canada's
transportation activities and problems, and will
inquire of the Governuient whether or not it
bas any definite policy in relation thereto, and
if so, will ask that it be publicly declared.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this notice
was placed upon the Order Paper for the purpose of bringing to the attention of the House
and to others, I hope, who inight be initerested
in the subjeot, .some
points of importance
touching transportation problems and activities that I think ought to 'be considered. at
this turne, when oui. friends of the Board of
Railway Co.mmissioners aTe engaged in the
very diffleuit and delicate task imposed upon
them. by Order in Couneil last year.
Perhaps a word or two reminiscent of Canadian raidway activities might be of assistance
in forming a conclusion. I would first caîl attention to the outatanding fact 'that probably

railway mileage in proportion .to its increaise
in population to such an extent as Canada lias.
If we look back to 1870 we find that there
were then 2,270 miles of rai'Way in this country, and that tibere was a population of something over 3,000,000. Coming to 1925, we find
that we had 42,600 odd utiles uf railroad, with
a population of 9,000,000. In other words,
whiýle our population increased three times,
our railway mileage increased twenty-one
times. That is one of tihe fundamental difficulties that have broughit in thýeir wake many
other problems which are now confronting the
Canaýdian people and Canadian railways.
As time went on, efforts were made to bind
together the varinus provinces of Canada that
had entered into a bond or agreement known
as the Pact of Confederation. In order to
fulfil the destiny intended by the Fathers of
Cenfederation, it was necessary to bind
together ail parts of this Dominion by railroads. The State undertook the building of a
transcontinental railway, but f ailed, and subsequently private interests, private initiative
and vision succeeded.
Later on, when that great venture was emerging froým the experimental stage and developimg into a suecess, other far-sighýted, energetic
.men thouight there was roora for more railroads, and I think it is truc that it began to
be wihi'spered about among the people, espeeially in Western Canada, where great development wvas oecurrinmr. that competition was
the ife of trade and that competition in railroads xvas absolutely essential to the wellbeing of the people. It was not very long
until the people w'ho were fed and taught thait
propaganda came to the conclusion that there
must be competition, and the building of other
railways begaih, with the result that there was
an epidemie of railway construction, which
went on until 1912 or 1913, when it slowed. uýp.
Some criticism has been levelled at the
original raiiroad in Canada, because of the
assistance that was given to it in the way
of lands and othier concessions. I may point
out to alI intereted that th-is is not at ail
unusual; that it has occurred on the North
American continent wherever it became necessary to penetrate unsettled sections of the
country by railroads for the purpose of
colonizations.
I toôk occasion when in
Washington not long ago to ascertain what
h:ad happened in that country with regard to
its ra'ilways extending from the Missouri
Valley to the Pacifie Coast. I found that
between 1860 and 1897 no leas )han 195,000,000 acres of land, an area five times as large
as the State of Pennsylvania, had been handed
over to railroads as subsidies for building in
ion. Mr. ROBERTSON.

a country comparable to that through whioh
the railways of this country built, and in
addition to that there was record of $67,000,000
of cash subsidies, and there may have been
more.
So we flnd that our transportation systeris
have been built up, in the first place, by
grants of large tracts of land which were at
the time valueless, but which, by the time
other systems came along to provide that
competition, so necessary to the welfare of the
people, had acquired a substantial value. The
other railroads thus found themselves in posstssion of lands far more valuable than those
granted to the pioneer railroad of this country.
Coming te a later date, we find that about
1902 or 1903 the Parliament of Canada, realizing that there should be a;ome governmental
control over the activities of our transportation companies, of which there were several
at, this time, and which w--e developing iýnto
large concerne, passed the Railway Act and
established the Board of Plaiway .Commissioners to exercise some supervision over
railway affaire, the rates eharged for public
service, the equipment used, and the safety cd
the public and of employees. For some
seventeen years, down to 1921, the operations
were automatic. Every complaint that the
public had was taken to the Board of Railway
Commissioners if it was otherwise impossible
to adjust it satisfa.ctorily, and the judgments
and decîsions of that honour&ble body possessi n, judicial powers, came to be respected,
and public confidence in it grew frora yeax
to year. Public confidence had become se,
implicit that the people would a.ccept without
question almost any statement that might
emanate from -the Chairman of the Board of
Railway Commissioners.
But in 1921 a
tragedy occurred, affecting a, large number of
people in this country. I wa.nt to refer to it
specially because in my opinion it is the basis
of the difficulties and the serious problems
that now ýconfront Canadian raÀilroads, and
indeed the Canadian Government.
I have said, and I think truly, that during
that seventeen year period the confidence of
the people in the Railway Commission grew
in strength. 'It se happened that after the
war broke out the cost of everything entering
ioto ralilway operation increased. It was the
experience -of all citizens t4hat their ýcost of
living increased. Whethcr a man, wos operating a factory or a railroad, he had the samne
experienýce, .and on to 1920 there were substantial increases in the cost of operating all
railroids-increases in the wage, bill and in
the cost of material, equipment, ties, coal,
everything- that railroads used. During that

MARCH 10, 1927
period they were of necessity compelled te
eall upon the powers that be for authority to
incresse the tolls which they might charge for
their services. Increases were granted, which
1 shall deal with a little later on.
But in April, 1021, flot very long after a
new Chairman had been appointed to the
Board of Railway Commissioners, that gentleman stepped aside from his officiai duties
and stood upon a public piatforxn, and after
prefacing his remarks by saying that he
pi'obably was out of order in saying that he
was going to say, hc stated that railway rates
were high, but that they could fot be reduced. 1 quote his words as Vhey appeared
in the public press under date of April 7th,
1921.

be stated at the time that lie was probably
out of order. I hope tbat my honourable friend
will concede to me an equal riglit, because of
wba.t bas oocurred.
Now, I believe that the honourable gentleman made that statement in 1921 in the firm
conviction that the railway wage rates of
which he then complained were equal to the
wage rates paid on United States railiroads.
But therein bie was inistaken, -and therein lies
most of thbe trouble tbat now confronta our
railway situation. It is truce thit ini 1918, after
an exhaustive inquiry made hy a Commission
appointed by tbe President of the United
States, a general increase in wage rates was
made on ahl railroads in t-hat country.
It is
also true tbat in the samne year, by reason of
the fact tbat living costs had rapidly increased
since thbe outbreak of the war, tbe railway employees in Canada mnade a general -request for
a revision of tbeir wage agreement witb the
railways. Like eveoey other class of citizen,
tbey bad boped from day ta day and month
to montb that the unfortunate war would
quickly end, and that their domestie affaira
,could thon be taken ýcare of better than they
bad boon for four years, from. the outbreak of
the war. Tbe burden bad become so great,
the purcbas9ing power of tbeir earnings bad
been sa depreciated since 1914, by reason of
the increased cost of living, tbat in 1918 those
employees were ail in unison, because ail were
uýnder necessity, in requesting tbe Canadian
railways to improve wage rates.
In July, 1918, tbe Canadian railways did
something that at the time was tbougbt by
saine ýto be gonerous 'ais well as just; but in
the light of experience since then it develops
that tbey were very far-sigbted, and by doing
wbat they did they not oniy settled tbe
difficulty at ýthat time, but paved the way for
a very great saving in operating expenses in
years to ýcorne. We fmnd that in April, 1921,
wben Mr. Carveil made bis statement, the
average annual wage earned by United States
railway employees of aIl sorts, from presidents
to messenger boys inclusive, as sbown in the
annual reports of the ýInterstate Commerce
Commission, was $1,820.12, while in Canada,
in that samne year, tbe average compensation
received by all railway employees, from the
presidents of the two great railways down ta
messenger boys, ahl included, was $1,568.82a difference of M21.30. This represented tbe
comparative situation for the year 1920, of
wbich the hionourable gentleman ta whom I
have referred was t-hen speaking. If lie bad
known that that was the situation, I do flot
tbink he would have made the representations
libat bie did ta tbe Canadian public. It is true
lion. Mr. RtOBERTSON.

tbat in 1918, and again in 1920, Canadian rmilways did concede ta their employees the same
advance in wages as was granted in the United
States; but it was not true, bias neyer been
true, and is not now true, that Canadian railway employees are ýpaid on the aie average
standard of wages as are aill those of the United
States.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would my honourable friend allow me ta ask him a question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Certainly.

Hon. Mr. ýBELCOURT: Do I understand
my honourtable friend ta say that the matter
of wbicb bie is speaking is now heing investigated by tbe Board of Railway Comnmissioners? I think he made that statement;
I xvant ta be sure.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, I make the
statement tbat railway wage rates bave an
effect upon railway operating costs, and tberefore are a factor in the consideration and
determination of what fair railway rates should
be. The question of railway rates now being
before the Board of Railway Commissioners,
it is proper tbat tbis phase of tbe subject
should receive somne attention. ln view of
the fact that the Cbairman of tbe Board of
Railway Commissioners in years past did step
out and-not intentionally, perhaps-did mislead Parliament, tbe press and the public of
this country, I consider the present an opportune timie ta set that matter rigbt.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Migbt I follow
that up by another question?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my bonourable friend not tbink tbat bie is violating tbe
rule that bas always prevailed, that Parliament, or- public opinion, shaîl nat be influenced, or sought ta ho influenced,, by discussions in Parliament or in the press in
regard ta matters whicb are being investigated
by any judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal in

se; and if I did, I sbould be entitled ta the

Chairman of the Board of Railway Commissioners took in discussing this saine subject
before tbe public.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURI: That is another
matter altogether. We are not concerned
about bis duty, but we are concerned about

hie not to-morrow take up any case that is

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
I ask my honourable iriend' a question? Does
hie ho'ld that although Parliament itself
stepped in and interfered in this matter in
1922, and brought into existence the situation
of which I arn now complaining, a member
of Parliament has not the right ta raise hie
voice in Parliament ta discuss the question?
I arn certainly amazedHon. Mr. BELCOURT: The answer ia
very plain. Parliatuent has delegated ta the
Board ai Railway Commissioners the duty
ai investigating these matters and deciding
upon them, and whilst they are performing
that duty it is not the business ai Parliarnent
ta discuse the mat ter.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would observe
that Parliament did not delegate this duty
ta the Board ai Railway Commissianers; it
was delegated by the (iovernor in Coundil
under Order P. C. 886 on June 5, 1926, aiter
Parliarnent haed stepped in in 1922 and averriddea the decision ai the Board of Railway
Commissianers with reference ta reductions
in freight rates. I amn discussing a matter
that directly affects Parliament, that is the
resuit of an action ai Parliament and ai the
Goverament, and it surely neyer occurred ta
me that I was not in arder in discussing sO
important a public question.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What bothers
me is this situation that is being created by the
statement ai my honourabIe iriend. He will
state a case and draw conclusions.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON - Yes.
Saime other
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
member may controvert lis statement, either
in fact or in law, but Parliament can make
no decision. The body ta which we have
delegated the power ta sEttle this matter
would have ta make its own decision. Would
it accept or be influenced by a discussion that
has taken place in this Chamber, or in the
other, as containing arguments that it must
weigh? I doubt it. Then is our discussion
not sornewhat vain?
.Han. Mr. ROBERTSON: But Parliameat

oî that authority of which rny honourable
friend now speaks, and after Parliament found
itself in a muddle as a resuit of that interfErence, the Governrnent passed an Order in
Council and said: "We unload ail this back
on the Board of Railway Commissioners."
I want ta eall the attention of Parliament ta
the resuit of that action of Parliainent, and
the Government in this -important matter,
because it affects the welfar ofa three-quarters
ot a million people of this country; and I
surely think that a free discussion of a question so important ought not ta be strangled
in~the Parliament of Canada.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
would like to ask a question with reference
t-, the point raised by my honourable friend
and colleague (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). Will he
quote the rule?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Hepa, hear.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Will hie quate the rule which forbids the
discussion in this Chamber, or in the other
branch oi aur Parliament, af a matter affecting the public welf are, simply because the
Board of Railway Commissioners has under
its tonsideration, at or about this time, the
question of fixing railway rates? Where is
the rule? Before we get into a heated state
about this, if there is a rule under which we
are bound, let us have a reference to it; then
we can corne to sorne conclusion. If there is
no su-eh rule, we are free ta diiscuss this
mnatter. I arn ai the opinion that there is
-no such rule, and that we are not so bound.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Well, I cannot
quote any rule. This matter stands on very
miuch the saine ioooting as do many other
tnings in the British Constitution for which
there is no text; but I would appeal ta xny
r;ght bonourable iriend and ask him if hie is
not very well aware of the rule that-not in
so rnany words, but for reasons ai good government, reasons of propriety and deSecy,
and in order ta preserve the impartiality
ai aur courts-prevents tlie discussion, for
instance, ai matters which are being investigated by a ludicial tribunal like the Railway
Commission. I do not think I nieed cite -any
text ta my right honouraible iriend to convince
him that such is the principle under Britisih
institutions. To me this is exactly as if we
were discussing an appeal now pending before
the Supreme Court o~f Canada.

The cost of living rose much more rapidly
than wages. We llnd that in 19)14 the railway
wage level was 101.7, and the cost of living
103; that in 1916 the railway wage level was
101 and the ýcost of living 124. During the
war Canadian railway cmplýoyees enlisted
early, or worked at home, and thcy asked
nothing from anybody, hoping that when the
struggle was over they could. settie their
domestie affairs. In 1918, when at last they
unanimously asked for some relief from the
serious situation which confronted them, the
wage level was 133 as against a cost of living
of 162. So, taking -the period fromn 1914 ta
1926, the situation is this: the cost of living
advanced in excess of wages by 9.2 per cent
on the average over the entire period. Nine
per cent of $1,411 the average annual wage of
railway empînyces in 'Canada in 1924--,which,
by -the way, is the lowest .post war year, and
therefore the faîrest to take for illustrationis $156.87 per year per man less than hie
would be ýentitded to by the increase in the
cost of living. In ot-her words, the total paid
was $26,667,000 a, year less than was required
to equaýlize the employees' purchasing power.
If it is ýcon-ccdcd that railway employees'
wages were fair in 1914, and that they should
have received a wage adjustment equal to the
cost of living increase, then there was due as
of Deceimber 1, 1926, the rather large sum
of $346,600,000, or $2,039,31 per ernployee. Yet
the people of this country 'have been Ïhonestly
in large part, I believe, of the opinion that the
incomes of railway employees were exorbitant
and excessive and so on, ais I have quoted.
Passing that bY, I may say that it is a
little difficuit to maintain a parity between
the waýge rates and the fluctuation in the cost
of living, and therefore, perhaps, the coinparison is flot entirely accurate. But surcly
there is one comparison which it will be
admitted is fair. Surely every person in
lion.

Mr.

ROBERTSON.

Canada wiIl agree that the wages of Canadian
railway cmployees ought to risc in keeping
with and »in sympathy with the rise in wages
of industrial workers of ail classes, living in
the saine country alongside of them. Let us
sec what a comparison on that basis would
show.
The Department of Labour has since 1901
kept an accurate record, by industries, of the
fluctuation upwards or downwards of the general wage situation. The industries of the
country are divided into fine classes. Over
the period of years from 1914 to 1926 we flnd
an accurate picture of the situation, affccting
1.013,490 employees, as reported by cmployers. From 1913 to 1926 the average rise
of wages of aIl these classes, covering, as I
have said, over 1,000,000 men, was from 100
to 178. or an increase of 78 points. Steam.
railway employees alone fall short of the
average, their increase during that pcriod
being from 100 to 158. The index number
of the metal trades, comprising 110,000 men,
rose to 209; that of clectric railway employces
to 194; the fig-ure for common factory labour,
in large part uaorgani7ed, rose fromn 100 to
215; for miscellaneous factory labour the
figure rose to 216; for logging and siw mill
men it rose to 202; and for coal miners to,
197.
So steam railway empînyces alone,
according to the Govcrament's own record,
were the only class that feli short of the
average among over a million workers who
go to make up the nin-e different classes, and
the steamn railway cmployecs arc 17 points
below the average, or 9.2 per cent.

Now, applying that statement to the situation, what do we flnd? We flnd that the
average earnings of the eight principal classes

of industrial workers named rose from 100
in 1913 to 182 in 1926; t.hat the average
earnings of railway employccs rose fromn 100
in 1913 te 158.'9 in 1926, or 23 points below

the average of aIl other employees.
Again, to use the iow year of 1924 as a
hasis of comparison, proves that railway
ernployecs' increases in wages from 1913 ta

1926 average $335 per man per year less than
the average increases rcceived by aIl thc other
classes of workers named. This totals $57,000,000, which is the amount that railway
cmplovees might prope.rly dlaim for the past
fourteen years, but have not received. That
is a startling statement, but I know it is a

truc statement. I think it is right that the
people should know the facts, and I believe
that Parliament will, pardon me for having

the tcmerity to bring this matter ta its attention at this time.

aur rail'ways the tidy sum of $741,000,000,
or 34,358 per emlyee. That indicates ta you
the situation of these men ini coinparlson with
other classes af labour in Canada.
Now, fhonaurable gentlemen, that bringa us
down ta 1924. What has happened since then?
In the United States iii 1924, aster the -railways were turned back ta, private ownership,
there had ta be- a new dcafl, amud -certain basic
principles were 'laid down by the Interstate
Commerce Commission in that country, a bady
similar ta aur Board of Raiiway -Commissioners, but having greater powers. What
propositiun did the Interetiate Commerce Coinmission lay down to goveru the general
operation of railways? Firet and foremost
they said the American railwsys muust pay an
adequate wage rate ta iemployees. Thet was
the first -charge a.gaînst thle properties; that
was the first cha~rge ta be met. Next thcy
said that the rail'waya muet be kept lu a good
state of repair, that the physical condition
muet j>e maixitained at a standard that would
ensure saiety in the handuling of traffie. Then
th-ey said the equipumeu't must be kept up to
a certain standard which they laid down, and
after that they said, that investors in United
States railroad securltlae were entiuled ta something, and, should receive 54 per cent upan
the capital actually nve«We in the praperty
-- nt upon the capitalizatian-and thet whexi
that wae &ipaid it was tine enough for them
ta cousider whct.her there éhould be any adjustment of freight rates either uipwardà or downwawdsi.
Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND -Did they decide
Nvhat au adequate wage rate was?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They did not
assume ta do that, but the Congress of the
United Staîteýs, on the recoxumendation of the
President, who acted upon the joint recommendation of ali the raibroaids lu the United
States exîcept twe'nty, auli every organisation.
of raillway employees, decided that, a law ohouid
be paesed. in order that theoe things might be
proper]y determined, and I will1 gladly give
my honourable frleud a little idea, of just what
was doue ln thet conection.
The United States Railroad Laibour Law,
whach. became effective in May 1926, provides,
firet, thae there ehail be set up by mutual
agreemient, either on individul raifroads or
on groups of ralroads, as the eknpyloyees and
the management xnay agree, boards of adjustment ta whiioh shail 'be referred disputeswNhicb

59

the law requires thet no change sEhali take
place in conditions until the United States
Board of Mediatian bas been notified of the
situation and haîs sent mediators on the
graund. An investigation las made, and if the
parties cannot be brought ta a mutual agreemeut, it is the duty of the mediators ta urge
them to agree ta Adust their differenices by
arbitration, t.he flnifing of which is binding
upon them bath under the law.
The Interstate Commerce Commission say:
"Wage disputes are outside aur jurlsdiction.
There is a law laid down. for the governing
of such matters. Ail we say is that the wage
should be adequate and fair." Yau will note,
however, that wages are the first charge against
the railroad earning-9.
Now, I have pointed out, I hope with some
ýdegree of clearness, the fact thet Canadian
railway employees lu 1924 were recelving on
an average $201 a year below what similar
workers were receiving iu the United States.
They were not satisfied with thet. And why?
Let me tell you one of the reasons why. In
.1921, after the eut was made ln the 'United
States, Canadian railways demauded a similar decrease in wages here, aud the employees
objected for the reason that the average rate
in the United States, even after the mien had
accepted their decreaee, was e4l SM5 a year
above the rate here. But great pressure was
brought ta bear. uipon the men by the railways. Freight rates were being reduced upan
.the railways; it was argued that conditions
were such that the men should bear part of
the burden, and they did, aud in 1921 the railway employees of Canada accepted an average reduction of seveu ceuts per hour,
amountiug raughly ta 328,000,000 a year.
They handed back ta the railroad 328,000,000
a year as a taken 'of their good faith sud
willingness ta co-operate aud help ta meet
the situation that faced Canada at thet time.
We ail kuow that the volume of traffic f ell
off, and that revenue was f alling off in proportion.
Now, what happened thet S28X,0000
handed back at that time, and the same
amaunt which was hauded back every year
since theu, but which might have been retained had the men arbitrarily insisted upan
retaining what in equity and justice they had
a perfect right ta retain? Durlng the followimg session of Parlisment the Goverument

drastic reduction in freight rates and railway
revenues. Probably unable to resist the pressure, the Government was stampeded, I believe, and on July 1 of that year, owing to
force of circumstances, the Government and
Parliament--and I ar n ot blaming the Governrnent particularly, because the rnattcr was
discussed here by everybody-automatically
]et the Crow's Nest Pass agreernent corne
into force again; the $28,000,000 a year which
the railway employces had turned over te
help the situation was handed back te. the
farmers of the prairie provinces; and since
that tirne 175,000 railway ernployees have
every year been paying approxirnately $150
each into the pockets of the 220,000 farmers
of the prairie provinces.
That is the way the railway ernployees
view the situation. They feel that the action
of Parliarnent has brought about this crucial
condition. They carried on until 1924, when
certain of the train service ernployees in
Canada feit they had suffercd under this
handicap long eiiough. United States irainmen
and condiietors in the castcrn territory, that
is, ail the area north o~f the Ohio and east of
Chicago, in which a very large number od
ernployees reside, received a very c5ubstantial
increase in pay. The Canadian emp]oyees in
similar classes asked the sarne 'consideration
and were denied it. The railway companies
argueýd that freight rates had been reduced

had corne dmwn only 10 per cent, and that
it was impossible for the railways in Canada
to meet the rnen's demands.
That followed a rcquest of the C.P.R.
Telegraphers, and the garne argument was
made before a 'board of conciliation.
The situation continued through 1924 and
1925, because conditions were 'bad and the
revenues of our Canadian railways had fallen
$31,000,000. It was net until Septeinber 125
that the tide turned and sinice that tirne there
has been a constant and satisfactory iniprovement. Realizinýg the seriousness of the
situation, as they were good, loyal citizens
of this country, trying to do their part, they
rernained quiescent during 1925. In 1926 they
came forward, large numbers of thern, running
into rnany scores of thousands, and ail were
turned down. Ail1 were told îthàt wages could
net be increased because of this rate situation.
I do flot mind queting the words of the
railway companies thernselves, se t-hat the

large roads and sorne srnaller ones, this representation was addressed. in writiing:
The railways' returns per unit of service
ronclered to the public have shown marked deeroase in recent years under the various redictioii5 in their passenger and freight rates,
particularly the latter, made effective- under
orders of the Board of Railway Commissioners
andl hy legislation.
Under conditions as they exist in Canada todlay, this is pre-erninently the tirne when the
eniployees of Canadian railways should be prepaired te consider the question of their rates of
pay on the basis of conditions as they exist in
Canada.
I ask, is it net true, bas it net been made
abundantly clear here, that the Governrnents
ever since 1921 had been creating tbat very
-ituation. The employees were fast corning te
the point where they feit that while they had
every sympathy for the situation in which
the railways found thernselves--and thousands
upon thousands of the railway ernployees in
Canada do net blarne the railýway rnanagernent
for the situation with which they are now confronted&-they dýid 'blarne Parliarnent for the
situation thus created.
I cannot blarne the
Governnent, because the difficulty in which it
found itself re-sulted frorn the parliarnenýtary
situation that existed, when a little tip either
way would keep it in or throw it out; but
Parliarnent itself subrnitted te that situation,
and brought about those conditions which have
ever since preyed upon these men, and have
cost thern several hundred millions of dollars
since 1920. They are now rapidly approaching the stage where, as they say, patience
ceases te be a virtue.
The tirne has corne
when sorne rernedy mnust be found, and they
point te the fact that under this law in. the
Ujnited States, though the railways are objecting te it, mediation proceedings are being
undertaken and in a large numnber of cases are
succeeding, and where these fail arbitration is
being induýlged in.
In November last year we very nearly had
a tie..up of transportation on our two big
railways, by trainrnen and conduetors. Why?
Because at that tirne they were receiving six
per cent less wage than was paid on aIl railways on comparable territory in the United
States, and that had continued since 1924.
American Railways running right into the
cities of Montreal and Hamilton were paying
six per cent higher wages than comparable
ernployees on out railways received, and they
said: "cThat is not rigbt."' Finally, under
substantial pressure, they obtained an adjustment which netted them about five per cent
increase; and within 24 hours of the time that
agreement was made, in what is known as the
eastere territory, covering ail the area from

MARCH 10, 1927
the Ohio River and east of Chicago, more
than 33,000 conductors and trainmen received,
by arbitration, 7J per cent increase over what
they had before; so that the comparable situation now is worse than it was before this
development af last November.
Since that time, only the other day, an
arbitration on the Boston and Maine Railway,
which touches Canadian territory, granted
over 1,000 railroad clerks an increase of 5

connettion with this very passage front which
I was reading a while ago_ 4,0(X0 odd dlerks an
the Canadian, Pacific Railway were unoible ta
get an adjustmnent, because of the reason given
by the company in the statemnent on rates
which 1 have just read, and to-day they are
sitting in conference with the Viceýpresiden.t
of the C.P.R., the campany having refused to
put into force the mal ority findings of a Board
of Conciliation which investigated that trouble.
And what do the company say- is the trouble?
They say the reson is that their revenues
wiil flot allow them. ta grant the increase because they are al'lowed ta collect 12ý per cent
less than is paid for the saine service on
American roas.
Theref are the question cornes right home
ta thàs Parliament and the Government of
Canada-na matter what Government it may
be-to take recognition of this situation, and
ta sec that something is done to remedy it.
Otherwise unfortunate and unforeseen difficulties may arise. I feit that it was proper,
under such circuinstances, and in view of
these facts, ta bring these matters ta the attention of Parliament, because, after ail, the
Government has seen fit in the paet ta override the decisions and views of the Board of
Railway Commissioners. Rumour has it that
thîs has been donc on several occasions. I
arn not prepared to say what may be donc,
and I do not intend ta prophesy, but I do
assert that if the Governrnent cares ta intervene in any way, or ta let its views be known,
it às praper that the Government should be
in possession of the facts.
Furthermore, I respectfully suggest this-and it is the meat of my inquiry-that the
Government of Canada, I do nat care what
Government it may be, ought ta have some
definite policy on so important a matter as
aur steam railway transportation.
For 17
years, from 1904 down ta 1921, there surely
was a well-defined and well carried out policy;
namely, a tribunal known as the Board of
Railway Caminissianers was established and
given certain powers, and was neyer interfered with. By the wise and careful exercise
of thase powers, by giving everybody a

caurteaus hearing and dealing with all matters
subinitted ta it on their merits, that Board
grew in the confidence of the public. Until
1921 it waé reg'arded as beifig an ideal body.
Then, hby reason of -the action of Govermrnent
and Parliament in 1922 in interfering wîth
freight rates and overriding the decision of
the Board, what happened?
Immediately
there were a dozen different interesta that
came ta the Governinent, and not ta the Railway Commission, and said: "We also want
reductions in rates." Provincial Gavernments,
and large interests of varions sorts in different parts of the country, made appeals, until
the Goverament found these influences pressing dawn upon it with such farce that it was
absolutdly obviaus ta everyane that no Government could attempt ta deal intellîigently
with such questions. There is na more intricate and delicate task ini any country, especially a country the size of this, with ail
its varied interests and differing locations,
than that of establielying a structure of freight
rates that is fair and equitable ta every
interest and every !Iocality. It is utterly impossible ta say: "We are gaing to equalize
these." If you put an equal rate on the
same product in every part of the country,
any railway tariff expert would very quickly
disabuse your mind of such a plan having any
virtue. Sa it wàs necessary that this matter
shauld he referred again ta the Board of
Railway Commissioners, as was donc by
P.C. 886, in June, 1926, and the Government
practically said: "The wind is tao strang for
us: now we wilI turn all this matter back ta
the Board of Railway Commissioners, after
we have made a lovely mess of it."
The Railway Commission were then
bombarded. They received over a hundred
eubmissions by interested parties wanting ta
equalize freiglit rates, and in every st case
of that hundred a downward revision is asked.
for. The Board of Railway Commissianers
to-day have their backs against the door and
are I hope endeavouring ta do justice ta, ail
intereste in Canada in working out a revised
freight rate Ëtruoture.
In view of ail that has occuirred it seefns
ta me ta, be an absolute, neeoity now ta
escertain, whether or not the Gavernment has
any definite policy that it intends ta fallow
in connedtion wiith this mat.ter for -the future;
and I think the people of Canadýa are waiting
ta hear something along this lune. Io the
Government prepared ta adoipt something
definite, based on sound principlei sueh -as
those wvhioh I have mentioned as having been
adopted in the United State, and whieh are
working with such ssitisfaotion? -le it prepared ta say ta the people of Canadu that

SENATE

it is going to keep is hands off and not interfere with the Board of Railway Commissioners, but give them fuil poweV and make
them responsibli for their own actions? If
so, let us have an annourcement to that
effect; let the Government make it clear to
the people that there is net going to be any
more of this tampering that has brought about
such distress, such instability, such chaos as
we have had during the past four or five years.
It has become almost a national sport to
appear before the Railway Commission and
demand some kind of decrease in one rate or
another. I read, a few days ago, of a case
where a certain solioitor got $700 a day in
fees for coming down and putting up a tirade
against the Board of Commissioners in the
matter of freight rates.
Somebody, and it ought to be the Government, should meet this situation, and stand
out prominently before the people and say
that there is no country in the world that is
so dependent upon its steam railway facilities
for the proper conduct cf its business, and for
public welfare, as is Canada. No other civilized country in the world has so large a
mileage in proportion to its population.
Therefore it is an absolute economic necessity
that rates should be fixed that will meet these
necessary charges: first, a reasonable, indeed
an adequate, wage for the men who render
the service; second, what is required to maintain the physical condition of the railroads,
and also their equipment, 'at a proper
standard; and likewise a reasonable return,
say 6 per cent, to the people in this country
who 50 years ago had faith in Canada and
invested their capital, in many cases their all,
in railway securities. Having accomplished
these things, let the Government tell the
Railway Commission to regulate freight rates
in accordance with requirements after those
already mentioned have been met.
I submit to the Govermnent that that
would be a sensible ýpolicy to announce. I
hope that my honourable friend who leads the
Government in this House wil attempt to
give us some definite reply, and on behalf of
the Government that he represents here, outline a definite policy that will set at rest this
confusion that has existed in the railway world
for the past five years.
Hon. J. P. B. CASGRAIN: Honourable
gentlemen, I took notes as the honourable
gentleman was going on. He started away
back in 1870, when, as he said, we'had 2,000
miles of railway and a population of 3,000,000,
and he showed how the mileage had increased.
That is quite right, but what he said has
happened in every country. In 1870, 57 years
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

ago, railways were commencing to be built in
every country, so that is nothing very wonderful. That we built too many railways is
another matter. The honourable gentleman
told us that we had a much greater mileage
in proportion to population than any country
in the world; which was quite right. He might
have told us, also, that in Canada we have a
mile of railway for a little over 200 people,
while in the United States they have a mile
for over 400 people--twice the number-and
naturally those employees are expected to do
a great deal more work and get much greater
returns on the railways.
All through the honourable gentleman's
speech-which lasted, by the dock, an hour
and a quarter-there was a constant turning
to Washington or 'to the United States, to
refer to the conditions that prevail there.
In regard to the question asked by the right
honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster), may I say,
as a layman, that in my humble opinion we
have a perfect right to discuss this question
in Parliament. Parliament means parlement,
that is te parler te talk and I think that anything of public interest can be discussed perfectly well here, whether it relates to a matter
before the Supreme Court, or the Privy Council in Engiland, or the Board of Railway Commissioners.
Hion. Mr. DANDURA'ND:
friend speaks as a layman.

My honourable

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Of course, I am
net speaking as a lawyer, thank God. But the
situation here is very different from that in
the United States, and nobody knows it better than my honourable friend. It is with
seme diffidence that I attempt to answer the
honourable gentleman, without 'preparation,
for he has studied railway questions for years
and years. I think bis occupation in life has
been railroading, one way or another, and
naturally he must be very well versed on all
those questions. I cannot claim so much experience, although for ten years I ran a railway. It was only a hundred miles in length,
but in those ten years I not only never got
into a law suit, but I did not get even a
lawyer's letter, and that railway was handled
more cheaply than any other, for I spent only
one dollar when the cheapest other railway
spent three. Of course I did not pay the high
wages my honourable friend wants. The wages
were very moderate, but we never left a ton
of freight behind, or never injured a passenger; so that is not such a bad record.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: What did it operate
on?

MARCH 10, 1927
Hon. Mir. CASGRAIN: We ran 62,000 miles
at a cost of $34,020-a;bout .53 cents a mileand I defy anybody to do as weil.
The honourable gentleman went back to
the very inception. of railroade. Re spoke
of the Canadian Pacifie Railway. I might be
pardoned for- mentioning to this House an
incident whidh occurred in 1910, when I
happened to be in Vancouver with Sir W-ilfrid
Laurier, who was so busy at the time that hie
asked me to sec an old gentleman named
Beaven, who called, and who had been Prime
Minister of British Columbria before Confederation. This gentleman wa.s over eighty
years of age, and hie gave me an interesting
account of British Columbia conditions before
Conifedoration; and I wish -to relate this
incident, whieh is to the everlasting glory of
Sir John Macdonald, because if British
Columbia was in Confederation at ail it was
due to the foresight of Sir John. There were
three parties in British Columbia i those
early days, when that province was a Crown
colony. There was the .party that waz then
in office and wished to remain there. Another
party, which was very strong, wanted annexation to the United States, there being no
means of communication witih Canada, the
only route 'being down through San Francisco
and California. There was at that tirne
hardly anybody in favour of Confederation,
andi those who favoured amiexation, in order
to find an excuse, appointed a deputation to
corne to, Ottawa, and this old gentleman came
with it. They were instructed to ask Sir John
Macdonald if he would build. them a roadnot a raifroad, but a waggon road between
Canada and *British Columbia, over the
mountains. When they came to Ottawa they
expected a refusal, wihich would give them an
excuse to be annexed to the United States;
but when they interviewed Sir John Macdonald
hie said: "What? Build you a wagg.on rond?
W'hy, I'll build you a railroad to Bri'tish
Columbia". That deputation went back with
that answer, and the railroad was built as
promised, and finished in 1886, and Cana>da
was saved an outlet on the Pacifie.
The honourable gentleman has spoken also
c'f the advantages the C.P R. had in building
that road. They had a great rnany advantages,
I know. First andi foremost, they were given
25,000,000 acres of land, which enhaneed in
price, as hie has said. Besides that, they were
given the right to charge any rate they
pieased for passenger service or for freight,
with absolutely no control, and that kept on
for over twenty odd years. They were also
allowed to import free of duty anything
they wanted for their own road. Notwith-

&

standing ail this, as we are ail aware, in 1893
the C.P.R. stock wus selling in Montreial at
WOand Mr. Shaughnessy (afterwards Sir
Thomas, and later Lord Shaughnessy), who
was at that time purchasing agent, had difficulties in buying from merchants in Montreal,
because the C.P.R. were even without credit.
So it was not too, much to give the railroad
aI those ac}vantages. 1 do not intend going
back to, discuss the conditions of the time,
but the right honourable the junior member
for Ottawa (Riglit Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
knows perfectly well what happened when the
railroad was nearly failing: Sir John came
to the rescue with a loan of $22,000,000, and
s0 on. That is, however, beside the question.
For a while I thought the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Robertson) wanted the Parliament of Canada to override the Railway
Board. I understood him to say that the
Government must make a decision-must do
something. 1 claim that one of the best
things that were done by the Laurier Government was the creation of that Board.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Agreed.
My honourable
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
friend says the Railway Board went on very
well from the time of its establishment until
1921 , and everybody was in favour of the
Board. Of course hie would say that. Wages
were increasîng and every application was
considered favourably. But when conditions
began. to become stabilized and the trend was
the other way, then the Railway Board was
not all right, end there waa chaos, as he
said. There will be plenty of chaos yet
before we have finished, because, after alI,
wages must become normal at some tirne or
other.
The honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) brings in the name of Hon. Frank
Carveil. I remem-ber perfectly well what
Mr. Carveli said, and it was absolutely true,
that you cannot keep on increasing wages and
reduce freight rates. I omit passenger rates,
because, on the National Railways, out of
$5 of revenue they receive $1 for passenger
service and $4 fromn freight; on the C.P.R.,
for eve.ry $4 that they take in, .they get $1
from passenger service and $3 fromn freight;
and even on that $1 from. passengers the
railways lose money. Any honourable member who has had anything to, do with the
matter will agree, and I arn sure rny honourable friend will not contradict me, that the
railways lose money on the passenger business
and their profit is made on freight.
The honourable gentleman said he was going to prove that Mr. Carveil was wrong. I

64

'SENATE

listened most intently for that proof. The
honourable gentleman has flot given it, and
that is why I arn on my feet now. If you
raise wages you must raise freight rates. In
the United States they did raise the wages,
but they increased the freight rates too, and
it is a fact that nobody will deny, that the
freight rates in the United States are to-day
from one-quarter to one-third higlior than
those prevailing in Canada. Honourable gentlemen from the West are constantly clamering for lower freight rates. Fancy how it
would be if they were in the United States.
Here in Canada they can ship 3 bushels of
wheat for about what it costs the Ujnited
States farmer to ship 2 bushefs. That is a
fact in plain English, and it cannot be denied.
We have lowor freight rates in Canada. Yet
my honourable friend says, "Look at thc
United States." As I have said just now,
they have twico our population per mile of
road and they do twice as mueh business.
They can probably afford to pay more, and,
after ail, more cannot ho expected than people
can afford to pay. With our scant population,
our great mileage, our small earnings per
mile, we cannot afford to pay as much as the
Umnited States. What are the railwayaien going to do?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. ROBE'RTSON: That is .iust what
I would like to ascertain: what are the railwaymen going to do if in the future there
is a contînuod doýwward trend of freight
rates? Does my honourabie friend say that
the railway ernployeos in Canada should accept any wage necessary on the basis of the
freiglit rates as they may be fixed, without
regard to any right they may have?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: If my honourable
friend wants to have the rates raised, I have
no objection.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No, but will the
honourable gentleman answer my question?
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: But what if we
cannot pay them unless, forsooth, the railwaymen follow the advice given them by the
honourable member and ail trek to the United
States? That is what ho tells them to do.
Hlon. Mr. ROBERiTSON: No.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They would be so
much botter off there. The honourable gentleman spoke to, that effoct for an heur and
a quarter. I listeoed carefully. Ho saîd that
the United States was the panacea, that it
was an Eldorado, it was everything that was
good. The farmer in the United States does
Hon.

Mr. CASGRAJIN.

not say that when, as I mentioned a moment
ago, ho is obliged to pay as much for the
shipment of 2 bushels of wheat eastward as
the farmer in Canada pays for 3 bushels.
Thereforo it seems to me that the proposition is a very easy one. It is this--and 1 have
stated it in this House frequently in the past
twenty-five yoars and more: yoiî cannot keep
on reducing rates whilo you increase wages.
The cbasm is becoming wider and wider aIl
the while, and there will corne a time when
the people concerned will have te, got together
and decide one way or the othor.
Hon. Mr. RIOBERTSON: Now is the time.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
Either the rates
will have te, be increased or the railway
people will have to take smaller wages. The
honourable gentleman quoted the Interstate
Commerce Commission as desiring that their
railroads get 54 per cent. Very well. What
are the C. P. R. getting te-day, according to
Mr. Beatty, who, I suppose, would not make
a false statement te the people of this couintry? They are gettiog 2î per cent on their
total investment.
What does that mean?
Either that they are paying too much in
wages or they are net getting enough for
freight. There can be ne douht about that.
As f ar as our National Railways are concerned, we know tbey are not ketting even
2*' per cent, notwýithstanding aIl the golden
reports wo seo. Se there is the proposition.
What is my honeurable friend driving at when
ho says that he wants more wages paid? I
understand, ef course, that ho is desirous of
helping the railread employees, ho being one
of their leaders, and ho is playing bis part.
As Shakespeare said: "Ail the world's a stage,
and aIl the mon and wonein merely players."
The honeurable gentleman is playing a part,
and I think he is playing it very well, teo.
Nevertheless ho cannet well escape the fact
that in wvhat ho is new preaching he is attempting te square the circle. Lt cannot ho
dene.
If the henourable gentleman wants
the wages te be higher, ho must cerne eut
beldly and declare that the rates must be
raised accerdingly.
Hen. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I answer
my hionourable friend?
Hon. Mr. CAS GRAIN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Without desiring
te interrupt the honourable gentleman, may
I say that the reasen why I could net enter
into any discussion of that phase was that my
honourable friend the leader ef the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) intirnated Vhat
a discussion of freight rates was out of order
at this time.

MAROH 10, 1927
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Ail right, -but I
think the honourable gentlemuan could have
gone into that also, for this is a free Parliament and we can discuss what we please.
As to the passenger traffic, anyone who bas
looked at the figures ie well s.ware that there
has been a considerable reduction on account
of the increased use of automobiles. The decrease ini passenger traffie, due to the lamge
number of automobiles, is 20 per cent. I
believe that the traffie will continue to
diminish. There are numeroue inotor buses
carrying passengers from one place to aniother
and depriving the railways of s0 xnuch traffic.
So the passenger service of the railways is
becoming less profitable.
In conrlusion, I do not see that there can be
an increase in wages with every fluctuation in
the cost of living. We aUl f elt the burden of
the cost of living during the war, and we had to
accommodate ourselves to it.
The bonourable gentleman bas pointed out the fact that
rallway eniployees are getting proportionately
less than people in other trades; but railway
employees have permanent employment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN: Men employed i
other trades may <work one or two or three
days a week, and 'be out of employment the
reet of the tinie; but railroad men have permanent emiployment aIl the year round. I
amn told that a locomotive engineer can maire
as much as 36,000 a yer.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That is utterly
untrue, my friend.
Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN: What is the moot
he can make?
Hon. Mr. B0BERTISON: During the war
periodHon. Mr. CAGGRAIN: To-day-the moat,
flot the least.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1[ cun give sny

'but a still! higher one, 'whMo wua established

Hon. Mr. CASGRA±TN: Wlmt in that in a

Hon. Mr. RiOBERTSON: Qne hundred miles
je a d!ay.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They do not mun
only 100 miles, because that would meau

65

only about three or four bourg work. They
run more than that in a day. Let the honourable gentleman be perfectly fair.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: ýMy statement
stands.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAINS: Wby flot be honest?
We are ail in the famiiy here. Tell us the
bighest yearly earning that you know of?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I do not know
any train, service employee wbo earns 84,000
a year.
Hon. Mr. CAeGRAIN: A locomotive engineer?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: No.
Hoa. Mr. CASGRAIN: Well, I stand corrected. 1 bave seen the figure 36,000, but I
take the honourabie genotlemanas word.
Now, bonoumable gentlemen, I have to,
apologize for speakin-g witbout preparation..
The bonoursble gentleman said be was going
to prove that the Hon. Frank, Carvell
was wrong.
Well, he was not wrong when
be said that you cannot increase wages umtil
you increase freigbt rates. That is wbat ho
said.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: May I aelc tbe
honourable gentleman a question? 'It seems
to me that the gist of the speech of tbe honourable gentleman froni Weland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) is this: that in allowing the Crow's
Nest Para agreement to corne int force again
the Government brought about the present
condition, which le a very serious one. My
honourable friend cipposite Ime not touched
upon that point. He has been running a railway for ten yearsHon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Not lately.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: -with much better
suoceas than most railway managements. We
would be glad to obtain hie opinion on that
score.
Hon. Mr. CABSGRAIN: I cannot very well
anawer that; that -pertains to the honourslle
gentleman wbo, brought up thls question. But
i my humble opinion when tbe Governinent
undertook to interfère with the Railway
Board, they made a tremendous mistaire. That
Board was created for a purpose, and nobody
found fauit; but now that the shoe pincea
,people are ceming te the Government. Thon
there is an appeal to the &qmrme Court on
questions of law.

people of the West, and gave in for political
reasons, probably in a moment of weakness.
Many things are done in moments of weakness.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, may I point out the fact that while
Parliament passed legislation in the interest
of the people of the West, that legisiation is
a dead letter.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: The railroads have
deliberately refused to carry out the intention of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: H1ear, hear.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Both the louse of
Commons and this House passed legislation
providing that certain rates should come into
force, and the Board of Railway Commissioners advised the railways that this legislation liad been passed, but both the Canadian
National Railways and the Canadian Pacifie
Railway deliberately defied Parliament and
the Government, and refused absolutely to
carry out their wishes and instruction. For
this reason I am very glad that my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Robertson), who
brought up this subject, asks the honourable
gentleman who is leading this side of the

House what the policy of the Government is.
Are they going to enforce their instructions,

or are they going to allow the railways to set
Parliament and the Government at naught?

I hear it argued to-day that freight rates

are too low, and that conditions would be

worse if the Crow's Nest rates were put into

effect. I would remind honourable gentlemen
that during the past two months the Board
of Railway Commissioners has been sitting
almost constantly in Ottawa, and that it has
been acknowledged by witnesses of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and, also I think, by
witnesses of the Canadian National Railways,
that wheat, whether under the rates which
are in force now or under the rates that

would be in affect if the Crow's Nest Pass
agreement were in operation, as the Government said they should be, is the most profitable source of revenue that the railroads
have. That is true, and it has been proven
time and again. But the Government, for
some reason or other of which I am net

aware, have permitted the Canadian Pacifie
Railway and the Canadian National Railways
to flout them and dictate to them and say,
"It does not matter what you have said, we
are not going to put those rates into force."
The legislation that I speak of was passed
in 1925, and two crops have been shipped
from the West since then. Men who are adept
at figuring say some $1,500,000 to $2,000,000
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN.

a year, has been taken out of the pockets of
the farmers during the past two years and
put into the pockets of the Canadian Pacifie
Railway and the Canadian National Railways.
The farmers have suffered that loss, and they
naturally ask what is going to be done. I
want to point out te my honourable friends
opposite what may happen if something is
not done. During the past few years the
matter has been thoroughly discussed throughont the West, and my honourable friends opposite know what happened. They have not
got much support from the three Prairie
Provinces; thcy have one member in fact. I
also want to warn my honourable friend the
genial Leader of the Government in this
House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) that he should
not be too much carried away because the
Government have a large following froin the
Prairie Provinces. I weuld like to ask him
what he thinks would have happened in the

last two elections if the people of those Provinces had thought for one moment that the
word of the Government, the promises that
had been made, and the legislation that was
passed were not worth the paper they were
written on. Dots my honouraible friend think
that the people

would have supported the

Government to the extent that they did? Out
in the West party polities sit pretty lightly
on our shoulders, and if the Government's
future action is not very different from what
it has been during the last year or two there
will be a change.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: They have a perfect right to change.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, and everybody
will know it when the time comes. It often
happens. You may get members to support the Government by making them
promises, but let me itell you that you cannot carry the farmers of the West with the
members if those promises are not made
good.
The promises that were made are fair, and
it has been acknowledged in the witness box
that the proposed rates were fair. If those
rates are put into force the railways will con-

tinue to make money in the carrying of
wheat. There is no other traffic as profitable
as the traffie in wheat from the Prairies to
the ocean, and unless the rates on wheat are
put right, as was promised, the farmers cannot do well and the country cannot do well.
I am glad my honourable friend has asked
this question, and I shall be very much interested in hearing the reply of the Government.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: May I ask just
one question? The honourable gentleman

MAROH 10, 1927
always says the railways are making money
carrying wheat, whereas everybody knows that
it is the cheapest commodity tliey carry. Is
it nlot -true that, the western lines bring ini a
revenue of only $8,000 a mile, whereas the
eastern lines bring in 811,000 a mile?
Hon. Mr. TtYRRIFF:
My lionourable
friend has asked that question and made tliét
statement ini this House every Session since I
have been a member of the House, and I
suppose he will continue 'te do it. I answer
him that if the eastern division of the C.P.R.,
from Poit Arthur te Halifax, muade, say,
$500,000 net profits during June, and the same
amount during July, that the western portion
of the road, from Fort William to Vancouver,
made about the same amount. That is, the
earnings were very evenly divided in the
months when no wheat was carried. But in
August the earnings of the western portion
of the road would be almost double what
they previously had been, and in September,
Oetober, November and December, .they would
stili be increasing, while those on the easterzi
.section would remain practically stationary.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN:
Why leave out
the other montbs? Take the whole twelve
months.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Wait a moment. My
honourab:le friend asks me about the other
months. In the other .months the earnings
eaut and west were just about equal, roughly
speaking; s0 we are compelled to acknowledge,
as the witnesses that have been giving evidence
before the Railway Board within the last
two months have been eompelled to do, that
w'heat is the best paying commodity carried
by the railroads. You need nlot worry about
the railroads if the rates are enforced that
Parliament said should be enforced; the railroads will still continue to make plenty of
money.

,On motion of Hon. Mr. Beau4bien, the
debate was adjourned.

168

SENATE

IPerbaps I should here state, for the benefit
of those 1honourable members who cannot be
supposed to know the geography and political
divisions of Prince Edward Island as well as
we Who live there, that the Island Province,
like Gaul, is divided into three parts, or
three counties, namely, King's, Queen's and
Prince. King's County is represented in the
House of Commons by one member, Queen's
County by two members, and Prince County
by one member.
The potato industry is to Prince Edwarci
Island what the fishing industry and coal
mining are to Nova Scotia, what farming and
lumbering are to New Brunswick, what farming, manufacturing and mining are to Quehec
and Ontario, what grain growing is to the
Prairie Provinces, and what lumbering and
fishing are to British Columbia.
In other
words, while not by any means our sole industry, it is the most important industry we
have and is sure to increase rapidly if we
can obtain adequaýte transportation facilities.
Our soit and climate are admirably adapted
for the growing of the best potatoas that can
be produ.ced in North Aimerica.
Some years ago we grew potatoes in the
rnost haphazard manner, without giving any
attention to variety, cultivation, or methods
of transportation, and, in consequence, our
sales in the other provinces and in the United
States were small and the price was exceedingly low. Ail this has been changed.
When the Fordney-McCumber tariff went
into operation we were practically excluded
from the United States market on low priced
stock, because of the high specific duty of
haîf a cent pýer pound on potatoes. Just
about týhat time some of our farmers discovered there was a good demand in the
United States, at paying prices, for a highclass article for seed purpoees, and the duty,
being specific and not ad valorem, would not
be sueh an obstacle to, the trade. Some of
them joined together in an organization
known as the Potato Growers' Association and
began growing and shipping in a smali way
to the UJnited States, with good results. Our
potatoes soon obtained an enviable reputation
in the American market, because varieties that
suited that market were grown and transported
under proper, or, at aIl events, improved
conditions.
The trade and the Association
grew rapidly. Most of the stock grown by
the Association was handled by the Southgate Import and Export ComipM.y, a large
pûtato, house in Norfolk, Virginia.
If ýmy
meinoiy serves me well, tibis house atone purchased in Prince Edward Island, last fail, over
six humdred tliousand hushels of &eed stock,
ail of which went out by water, and they
Hon.

Mr.

HUGHES.

were distrîbuýted from Long Island, New York,
in the North to Georgia in the South. And
such excellent crops are grown from this seed
that the demand is increasing aIl the time.
In the warmn States of the South the farmers
nt plant new Northern seed every year in
order to get a gond crop.
AIl the farmers on Prince Edward Island
do not belong to the Potato Growers' Association. Many of the large growers ship on
their ow-n account, and many others scîl to,
the merchants, who ship for them. Last year
we grew over three million bushels for export
and probably over two million bushels for
borne consumption. AIl our shipping4~acilities
were taxed to their utmost to handle these
t.hree mnillions. This year we shahl have at
least four million bus9hels to export, because
our acreage will be increased by at least 30)
to 40 per cent; and unless the Port of Georgetown is equipped this coming summer, from
a haîf to, three-quarters of a million bushels
will be left in the hands of the farmers,
because they cannot be shipped from the
province.
Honourable gentlemen. allow me to submit
proof for this staternent. Last year a littie
less than six hundred t.housand bushels were
shipped from Charlottetown and that porthad
ail the business it could handle. Summerside
is to ha equipped this year, but that port
closes as early, if not a little earlier, than
Charlottetown. Therefore, five or six hundred thouýsanid bushels will ha aIl that can can
be shipped from Summerside. The Car Ferry
can take care of about two million and a
quarter hushels in a season. Add these three
quantities together and we have three millions
and three or four hundred thousand bushels,
which will leave six or seven hundred thousand bushels on the hands of the farmers to
rot in their fields or in, their cellars, because,
as already stated, we shail produce at least
four million bushels this year, and in 1928 an
additional million, and so on and there wil
he no means by whioh that quantity can be
shipped from the province.
But this is not aIl. I have already told
you that our seed potatoas have been sold as
far south as Georgia, and there is a demand
for them, in Florida and Texas, and we belýieve
a market can ba found for them. in Alabama,
Mississippi and Louisiana. But the farmers
in these States will not buy our potatoes unless
they can get them when they are ready to,
plant them, and their planting season is from,
say, the middle of January tilt about the l5th
or 20 of February.
There are sevaral reasons -for their refusal
to buy before the planting season begins, and

MARCH 11, 1927
one ia that they do nlot want ta pay for them
and store thema six weeks or a month beifore
they are ready ta use them; but the greatest
reason is that potatoes sprout and deteriorate
very rapidiy in that warna country and the
crop is flot nearly as good unless they are
pianted shortiy after they arrive. Therefore,
ta get the best prices, and, indeed, to hold the
Southern markcet at ail, we muet ship from
Prince Edwar~d Island during the month of
December; but in that month Charlotteown
and Summerside harbours are ciosed. Only
the harbours of Georgetown and Souris reinain
open tii! January, hence the vital necessity of
equipping one of these harbours immediately.
The other one wili have ta be equ-ipped within
a very few years. No matter what shipping
facilities may bc provided at Charlottetown
and Summerside, the situation wiil nlot be
met, because these harbours close eariy in
December.
When I was in the Southern States recentiy
the Southgate Import and Expert Company
of Norfolk told me that if we wished ta
extend aur trade ta the Gulf States, or even
ta bold the markcet we have in South Carolina
and Georgia, we would have ta ship by water
from Prince Edward Island in Deceniber;
because the farmers in these States simply
refused ta buy eariier than the 1Oth or l5th
of January. I got simiiar information from
other people.
You may, perhaps, asic why we cannot ship
by rail from Prince Edward Island ta the
Southern Sta tes during the month of December,
and I wiil tell you. The freight by rail from
Prince Edward Island ta the Southern States,
even if we could get the rail accommodation,
which is not always avaiiable is practically
prohibitive. The freight by rail from Prince
Edward Island ta points as far south as
Norfolk is about equal ta the water freight
and duty combined, and the farther south
you go the greater becomes the differential.
Hence the vital importance of water transportation if this industry la ta grow, or even
remain where it is now.
There in another reason 'why the harbour
of Georgetown shauld be equipped. There are
many settiemesits i Ringsa County that e.annlot ahip potatoea by rail, because they are
far fromn a railway station, and potatoes are
a bulky article. In norne caum Uiese sottiements are nlot far £romn the railway, as the
crow fies, but inaemucb as the country has
many rivers, bays and inlets, t4e distance the
people -would have te traire! te ship by rail
is se great that they could flot undertake it.
These settUementa are: Dundas, Annandale,
Little Pond, Launching, St. Georgesý De Grae
Marsh, Sturgeon, Gasperaux, Murray Harbour

S0

NorthI, Panmure Island and Boughton Ialand.
These settlements couid ail conveniently send
their potatoes in large boats and small vessela
ta Georgetown, if a suitable warehouse were
there in which ta assemblve cargos, anid until
such a warehouse be provided they will be
.practically excluded frein the growîng of
potatoeu.
Now, dionourabie gentlemen, you may perhaps wonder why I should have te ex'piain
this matter et such iength in this Chamber,
and you may think I shauld have expiained
it in the other Ohamber when i was there, or
even yet ta the Minister of the proper Department. Well, I -think I have done my duty
in aI! these respects, and I will expiain further.
In 1924 -and 1925, both verbally and by letter,
I explained the matter fully te the then
Miniater of Public Works, HonourabIe Dr.
King, and I feit, sure that I had convinced
him that it was a work that should lie undertaken wit.hout delay. I explained to the
Prime Minister briefiy, but naturaliy did not
bother him with details. I also expiained it
ta the Honaurable Mr. Sinclair, one of the
members fromn ithe Island, and then a member
of the Gavernment. I thought Mr. Sinclair
understood the si.tuation as well as I did and
had as muoh interest in the proposal as I had,
because the proposed warehouse was not a
caunty matter at ail; it was, and is, a
provincial matter.
For resoens which I fiave fully explained,
the man at Tignish in the western end of the
Island, would benefit almoset as much from the
construction of a suitable front-proof patato
warehause at Georgetown as the man living
two miles froma Georgetown would benefit.
Mr. Sinclair lavoured the idea and told me he
would support it in Council and would
endeavour te get an amount for the construction of the building i the estimates that
year. Later I iearned that Mr. Sinclair had
opposed it in Counciil and lied preventedl the
Government fromn putting an amount in the
estimates for the construction of the building.
Some monüha later Mr. Sinclair publicly stated
in Prince Edward Ieland that lie did nlot
oppose it in Council.
I did not then, and 1 do not now, blame
the Government for not proceeding with the
work; they cauld not be expeeted te go on
wîth it, when it was opposed by the member
of the Cabinet from the Province.
Hon. Mr. DÀNDURAND: My honourable
friend has juat inforîned n that the gentleman
Ïhad denied -having oppoaed the proposition.
How does rny honourable friend reconcile hie
statement with that denial?

SENATE

70

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: R thi.nk the denial is
incorrect.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend is flot j ustifled in making that statement.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I amn justiîfied; and I
will give xny honourable friend the information
and he will then admit that I amn justified.
I understood that one of Mr. Sinclair's
objections to the proposai was that inasmuch
as the Railway in King's County was narrow
gauge and the railway in Queen's and Prince
Counties was standard gauge, the farmers and
shippers in Queen's anjd Prince Counties couki
flot use the warehouse in Georgetown titi the
railway in King's would be standardized. Well,
that was correct, but ail the people in Rings
who were obliged to use the narrow gauge
railway could ship through Georgetown as
well as, and 'better than, through any other
port. And the people living in the settleanents
which I have mentioned, and who hiad practically no railway facilities, could have muade
splendid use of a warehouse at Georgetown.
Ap'parently Mr. Sinclair did not think, or care,
about these people, though he wu. the menmber of the Government fromn the Island, and
the Island is not a large place.
At ail events, the railway in King's County
was stndardized last summ'er, aind, when that
was done, 1 thought the last objection was
removed, but I arn not so sure now; there
appear to be still somne impediments in the
way.
Last January a dýelegation fromn Prince
Edward Island waited tzpon the Minister of
Public Works i connection with this matter.
The delegation had letters from the Boards
of Trade, the Potato Growers' Association.
several shippers and business muen, and a
letter from Mr. Johnston, the Liberal candidate for King's in the last election; ail
favoring the immediate construction of the
proqposed warehouse. I was with the delegàtion, and they ex'plained -to the Minister and
his deputy aIl the merits of the case, a.nd
asked that an amount for the construction of
the warehouse bie placed in the main estimates,
so ýthat the building could be rcacly for
business in the faîl of 1927. They and I felt
that the Minister had been favourably im'pressed, that ail impediments had been removed, and that there would be an amount in
the main estimates for this rauch needed work.
The Georgetown ýwarehouse is not mentioned
in the main estimatesl. The Public Works
Department asks Parliament for $201,600 for
Prince Edward Island and $1,000 of this
amount is for King's County, though many
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

of the Public Works in that County, notably
the breakwater at Souris, are in a dangerous
condition.
Perhaps I should mention here that the
Duncan Report on Maritime Claims c~ecom'mends the construction of a ftost-proof
potato warehouse at Georgetown, and last
summer when the Prime Minister spoke in
that town he showed great sym'pathy with the
prcýposa1 and emphasized its importance.
Eveýrybody went away f romn that meeting
feeling satisfied that if the Liherals came back
to power the construction of the rnuch discussed and long dclayed warehouse would lie
immediately proceeded with. But something
hais happened to cali another halt. Apparently
there are *more impediments in the way. Is
it possible that Mr. Sinclair is .pursuing the
same course in 1927 that he folowed in 1925;
and is it possible that Mr. Johnston, the
defeated Liýberal candidate, is co-operating
with him? If eit'her or both these gentlemen
are privately opposing the construction of this
warehouse whilc publicly favouring it, suých
conduct would he very inmproper and the mcn
who would do that should have no influence
with this or aay other Govcrnment i Canada.
ks it possible that the Governmeat haîts in
its duty because the County voted Conservative in the lest election. I cannot believe
such a thing, because such an attitude would
be unworthy of the Liberal Party. And I will
give you *my reason for the faith that i.s in
me.
For many years the construction of a piece
of railway in Prince Edward Island known as
the Elmira brandi had been under conAfter I became a member of
sideration.
Parliament I strongly advocated it. In 1907
the (}overnment survcycd tic line, and in the
session of 1908 voted a suru of money to
begin the work and asked for tenders.
An election was held in 1908 before
the tenders had been .reeeived, if I
remember correctly. I was defeated in
that election, and, fearing that some
delay migit take place in the building of
that piece of road, I came to, Ottawa at my
owri expense to push it. W-hen I reached
the Capital I found that the Railway Department had fully decided to drop the project,
and they thought 1 would resent my defeat
and agrce to their views. I could not change
the Department's decision, and had therefore
to interview tic Prime Minister, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, on the subject. After stating my
case to him and answering a few questions
which he asked, lie told me that he thougit
the County which I 'iad represented had make
a mistake in not re-electing me, but that in

MARCH 11, 1927

the <iovernment any injustice: that everY

That is a good

il

certain policy and 'who privately advise it te
pursue a contrary policy, because tbey want
to avenge some real or fancied personal
grievance, are on the very face of thinge
acting improperly, and snch men ehoijld have
no influence with any Government or any body
of public men.
It is generally supposed that tbis Session
will terminate next month. Therefore, if an
amount for this work were put in the supplementary estimates the work oould be puEhed
during the summner, and it could probaibly be
flnished i lime for the fall trade. I therefore appeal te this honourable Hocuae for
support ini this matter.
The Senate of Canada is nlot without influence i the Council of the nation. It was
constituted te protect amall provinces and
minorities, and I know that an appeal te it,
to see that justice be done, will not be, made
in vain. I particularly appeal 10 the honourable the leader of the Government in this
House, whose sense of justice is proverbial,
te put Ibis malter before his colleagues as I
have tried to present it te him. There, are
doubtless some points which I have overlooked, and there may be others which 1 have
not made sufficiently clear, and if such be the
case, and if the hionourable leader will give
me an opportunity te explain themn further,
either now or at eome other time, I shall be
deeply grateful.
0f course, if our honourable leader could
give me assurances similar te those Sir Wilfrid
Laurier gave me in a somewhat similar case
some nineteen years ago ail would be well, but
that might be 100 much te expeet at the
moment, under al the circumstances. I will
therefore close my case, confident of its
merits, and relying upon the justice and
honour of the Government and Parliament of
Canada. I thank you.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: --and that I miglit

in question would be built. Il was built. 1
hope and trust that the Liberal Party bas
not lost the virtues and the principles it professed and practised some eighteen or twenty
years ago. I hope and trust that the farmers

foresight and prudence have found markets
for these crops, wiil not bave their hopes

report is at present before the mcmbers of
Council,
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: May I say anotber
word? I thank the honourable leader for saying that be will bring the matter to tbe attention of bis colleagues in Council. I inay say,
bowevcr, tbat the Duncan report on tbat
question is very brief; only a fine or two;
whereas, in the remarks that I have made, I
have given some details wbioh are, I tbink, of
importance.
I regret exccedingly-if I may be allowed
to say so-having been obliged to mention
the name of any member of the other Chamber, but in my view of the matter I did not
sc bow I could .hring the case clearly to the
attention of tbis flouse without mcntioning
aIl the facts known to me.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend from King's (Hon. Mr.
Hughes) if there is a Government potato
warebouse at Cbarlottetown?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Yes, there is a Government potato warehouse there, and there is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

in the estimatee an amount of $75,000 for
improving that warehouse. There is also in
the estimates an item of $63,000 to provide a
warebouse at Summersîde.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My bonourable
friend's point seems to be, then, that the Governinent bave provided, or are providing,
warehouses at two points wbere they are
accessible to sbips for only a portion of the
year, and he desires that tberc should be at
Georgetown a potato warehouse wbich would
be accessible to ocean vessels during the winter montbs. I think I understand that.
Hon. Mr. COPP: Tbat is open not ail]
winter, but just part of the winter, tili
January.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That is the main point
that I bave in view.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I simply wanted
to understand it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Tfli port of Georgetown is open about twice as long ns thic ports
of Charlottetown and Summerside. and the.
shipping season at Georgctown is about twice
as long a? at those other ports. Georgetown
is open at that scason of the year when potatocs can be shipped so as to arrive in the
Southern States when they are wanted.
PAN-AMERICAN UNION AND INSTITUTE 0F PACIPIC RELATIONS
MOTION FOR RETURN

Right Hon, Sir GE-ORGE E. FOSTER rose

in accordance with the following notice:
That lie -will ask for copies of ail correspondencc had with any member or officer of the
G.overnmnent of Canada, respecting the accept-

ance by Canada of membership in the PaniAmierican Union or affiliation with that organization or representation at its meetings, and

an.) similar

correspondence

with respect to,

affiliation with or representation upon the
Pacifie Couneil of the Institute of Pacifie Relations.
Hie said: Honourable gentlemen, I do not
intend to mak-e any very extended remarks on
tdiis motion. My purpose is mainly to obtain
information, but in a subsidiary way the mno-

tion is meant as a caution or warning

witb

regard to probabilities in connection with the
information for which I am asking.
It was a matter of some surprise to me to
bear, a few wceks ago, wben the report of a
conference was bcing discussedi in Parliament
and in the country, that on several occasions

previously representationýs bad been made to
the Govern.ment of Canada, or to Minigters of
the Government., with reference fo Canada's as-

MARCH 11, 1927
suming a seat which, it was said, fiad been prepared and was waiting for ber in the PanAmerican Union. The statement was 'made
and broadeast that now that some change had
been made in Canada's relations and an arnbassadorial representative of tii country
would find bis place ini Washington, that seat
would be offered to, Canada, and it was hoped
it would be accepted. What communications
have been made I do not. know, and it is the
purpose of this motion to ohtain that information for niyself and the other members of
the Senate.
The second point in my motion is that it
rnight be taken aomewhat in the nature of a
caution as to our attitude in dealing with such
an invitation if it were realy given and were
being considered by the Government.
The Pan-Arnerican Union fias a rather long
hi"try, but into that I arn not going at
present. There la, no truth whi-ch cornes to one
wit-h greater pertinence than the fact that
considerable importance may be ettached to
a remark or promise, perhapa thoughtless or
unfo-unded, and that it may be called up
years and years afterwards for fulfilment. The
influence that a single man, or a statement by
an individual, sornetimes hbas in international
relations is really a revelation Vo ane who -h
lot previously given hie attention ta that
phase. Take for instance the March meeting
of the Aaeinbly of the League of Nations at
Geneva. It becarne apparent there, in the
discussion of tihe subject -which was before
that Aaeembly, 4that much of the difficufty,
peirhaps ail of it, Jay in the fact that in the
earlY organisation yeas of the League the
repreeentatives of certain natEons, perha
chiefly France and Great Britain, made to
Spaih a promise that in. the future, at a convenient, opportunity, these nations or their
representatives would support a dlaim made
by Spain for a permanent place upon the
Council. That promàse, given. by men who
had flot the power to performn it, even t'houg'h
it was provisionally made, played a large Part
in the dissMtlsfection of Spain when she urged
that after ail these years the opportunity had
Oure]Y come -for these nations' to back ber
dlaim. So it la that even in the ¶IIIBoIy <>i ouw
Own countrY there are i.nstanoe of our having
found ourselves impelled along a certain line
that had been ln earlier years initiaked by a
statement, promise or conclusion as to poa"ble
polioy by a single meniber, or a few membera,
ofa government, or by prorninent men in the
country.
Now, with referenc o t he subjeet-matter of
MY motion may 1 say that wit~h the stronget
sentiments of good-will towsrde the people of

73

the United States, with full recognition of the
happy relations that have hitherto existed, the
present condition of those -relations, and the
advisability and, 1 believe, the certainty of
maintaining those relations, we must not
forget, nor do I tihink tsat we do forget, that
we have liere ini Canada our own history,
traditions and snteoeidents, with a rising and
growing national feeling, and that it is our
bounden duýty to guard those traditions, that
national consciousness, that growth of national
feeling, to the utmost extent. Before we or
our Governrnent lend any support or assistance
to the proposai that we should take a seat in
the Pan-Arnerican Union, it de in my opinion
our duty to investigate very carefully these
questions. W'hat is the Pan-American Union?
On what basis is it constituted? What are its
aims? What are its dominating influences at
the present time? If we set ourselves to study
these questions we shail find, I think, a very
interesting field of inquiry and researich, and
it will be best for us to cover that field 'n its
entirety before any step is taken towards
giving a favourable reply to any invitation
that rnay corne to Canada to becorne a mernber of the Pan-American Union. Not only
shail we flnd that it contemplates the growth
and improvement of good relations, arnity
and international felilowship arnong the
different powers on the South Arnerican and
North Arnerican continents, and tjaat it does
in large rneasure busy itself witb -the encouragernent of communications, personal,
commercial and econornie, among the different
countries; but we shall flnd that it goas
furtber and thm* in it there wae factors,
cultural, racial and politioel, whioh it would
be weIl for us Vo explore before committhing
ourselves Vo beooming a rnember of what i&
called an association or union of the republica
of thbe two Arneric&n continents.
I amn asking for 4hie information and bringing ýthe matter to -the attention of honourable gentlemen En the 'hope that we may ail
become interested in this subjeet and Vba*
we may not develop tendencies toc, hastily, or
u
acolsinbtth

what is involved.

74

SENATE

The Hon. the SPEAKER: It a.sks for
copies of ail correspondence had with anY
momber or officer of the Governmont of
Canada.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But the right
honourable gentleman does not anove for a
-rpturn. I would like to ask the right, honourable gentleman if his allusion 'bore u-pon any
statement made by any member of Parliament on this matter. He referred to some
staternent. Could he tell us a littie more
pi ecisely the source of that staternent?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: As
I remember it now, the statement was mnade
by a former very important official of the
Pan-American Union; I think Mr. Barrett is
his name. If I remeraber rightly, hie said that
hie himself had comnmunicated with reference
ta the matter on several occasions, and hie
gave expression to the belief that Canada
would now find herseif in a position ta accept
such an invitation and become a member of
the Pan-American Union.
As to the point raised by my honourable
friLLid, rny requ*ast may be too muoh in the
f ormn of a question and too little in the f orrn
of a motion, but my purpose was to move
that the!Government lay iupon the table of the
House copies of a.1l correspondence on this
matter. If my motion does not carry out
that purpose, perhaps the Senate will allow
me ta amend it in accordance with my intention.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will certainly
inquire frorn' the Governmnent as ta any
correspondence that may have been exchanged
between some outside party and any member
of the Goverament. I miay say that the
matter has not corne officially before Council.
The question raised by rny riglit honourable
frîend is a very intereting one. Like hirnself, I have met in Geneva many delegates
from South America. who must have expressed
to him, as they did to me, their desire that
Canada should loin the Pan-Am'erican, Union.
I noticed that what wau iappermost in their
rninds was the presenýce of another North
American power. They seemed ta f eel that,
turning northward, they had been facing only
the United States, and they expressed Vhemselves quite clearly to the effect that they
would like very much to have Canada's voice
occasion'ally heard.
0f course I do not know what matters are
discussed at the meetings of the Union in
Washington. I take it for granted that
monthly meetings of delegates are held in
the famous Pan-American 'building at Waahington. Whether the matters discussed there
Uaon. Mr. DANDURAND.

are restricted to subjects of commerce I do
not know, but I understand that those meetings are attended. by m'inisters or ambassadors
living in Washington and represeniting the
various countries concerned. This is a inatter
which is worth studying.
I understand that a meeting was lield ini
New York some months &go of officiai.
delegates from Boards of Trade of the United
States and 'Canada. At any rate, it was a
big gathering of commercial in.terests, and I
remember that this matter was mentioned at
a dinner helM on that oocasion. I thought
rny right honourable frien~d was referring to a
speech made at that time by some rc4pre.sentative of a Canadian Board of Trade, who
expressed a desire that Canada should j oin
the Union. It seerned to m~e that the Board
of Trade delegate rnight well have consulted
bais Canadian friends before making sucli a
statemrnxt.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
May I refer to that latter incident? If my
memnory serves me aright it was the representative in New York of our Department of
Trade and Commerce who made Vhat statemnent in the course of an address, -and, if I
arn not wrong, hie intimated that Canada would
be very glad ta join. It was with regard to
statements of that kind that I thought some
caution should be exercised, and we should nlot
be held responsible for ûny statement, whielh
was not based upon real governmental authority.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: May I ask the right
honourable gentleman a question? In bis motion there is mention made of the Pacifie
Council of the Institute of Pacifie Relations.
Is that a body distinct fromi the Pan-American Union, or it is an offshoot of the Union?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is another devWiopmnent. Its attitude is
chiefly directed towards the Pacifie. It has
bcpn in existence for a number of years, and
its mernbership comprises unauthorized representatives; I mean, members who take part
personally or as represening organizations
rather than governments. It has met annually for a number of years at Honolulu, I
think, and it has decided to cstablieh, and bas
actually formed, what is called an Institute of
Research. It is rather widely distributive in
its activities, and in the opinion of sorne it
verges towards the formation of a League of
Nations Union for the Pacifie countries. I
noticed in one of the reports that the Government 'had appointed a representative to attend one of the meetings, and it was for the
purpose of ohtaining information on that
point that I put in that portion of my request.

Report of Special Cornmittee
The Special Committee, appointed on the lst
of May last to miake an inquiry into an old age
pension system for Canada to which was ref erred the correspondence arising from the proposai reeommendei1 to Parliament on the Ist of
July, 1924, for co-operative action on the part
of the Federal government and the governments
of the soveral Provinces, bas the honour to
report as follows:Your Comimittee bas given careful consideration to the aforesaid correspondonce, and also
to the corrospondence more recently received
from Premiers and Ministers of several Provinces. Briefly, the views of tlue several Provincial governments are as follows:1. New Brunswick.-Under date of May 23rd,
1925, the Premier (Hon. Mr. Veniot) writes:
"This Province is now considering the establishment of wbat is known as Widows' Pension,
and we are flot prepared to take any decision
in the natter of an Old Age Pension. Whihe I
do flot disapprove of the Old Age Pension, and
f eeh that it vould be a good thing, yet it would

MARCH 15, 1927
be impossible for me to commit the Province
to any action in this miatter at the present -moment."
2. Quebec. Under date of Frebruary l7th,
1925, the Minister of Public Works and Labour
(Hon. Mr. Galipeault) writes: "On the occasion
of the recent visit of the delegates of the
Trades and Labour Congress of Canada, this
questipn was taken up and, although it was
not submitted in the regular way to the
Cabinet, I understood from the remarks of
my colleagues, that it could be no question for
the Province of Quebec, considering, the obligations actually imposed upon it, of adopting a
law whjch would take care of the old age
pensions in this Province."
3. Nova Scotia.-Under date of June 2nd,
1925, the Premier (Hon. Mr. Armstrong)
writes: "In view of the importance of the subject-matter, and the lack of an opportunity to
f ully consider the samne, I was instructed to
advise you that without a further and better
understanding of the subject-matter and without an opportunity to f ully discuss it with your
Committee, no action would be taken upon the
matter at preet."
4. Prince Edward Island.-Under date of May
22nd,. 1925, the Premier (Hon. Mr. Stewart)
writes: "In this Province, as you probably are
aware, except in the towns, we have no municipal goverment, coisequently all assistance
to indigent and aged persons is furnished
directly by the Provincial government, either
in the Provincial Infirmary or by monthly contributions to private persons who become responsible for their support. I have read over
your letter and the accompanying report with
interest. I shall place the matter before my
goverinment at its next meeting and will then
advise yon of its decision."
5. Ontario.-Under date of 24th November,
1924, tbe Premier (Hon. Mr. Ferguson) writes:
«'I shahl bc glad to consider the matter."
6. Manitoba.-Under date of 25th February,
1925, the Attorney General (Hon. Mr. Craig)
writes: "We are in the midst of our Session
just now with the multiplicity of matters requiring immiediate disposition. 1 shail, however,
take up the matter with the Premier and the
Minister of Public Welf are at the earliest
opportunity."
7. Saskatchewan.-Under date of l9th November, 1924, the Minister of Labour and
Industries (Hon. Mr. Gardiner) writes: "The
Government of Saskatchewan is of opinion that
an old age pension scheme for Canada can bent
bo adopted by the Federal government alone.
There would seem te be uo much difficulty in
the way of providing ainy scheme that would
be suitable te all the mune provinces of Canada
as to make it almost imopossible, and it will be
readily underatood that if any number of the
provinces were te remain out, it would be
almost impossible to adopt any scheine that
would net subjeet those provinces within the
arrangement te considerable expense that abould
the
ri htfully be borne by those outoidethat seheme.
While we are disposed te thînk
an old
age pension scheme should be undertaken, the
difficulties in the way af the suggested acheme
appear almost, if not entirely, insurmonntable."
S. Alberta.-Under date of June 2nd, 1925, the
Acting Premier (Hon. George Hoadley) writes:
"T'his Government has reviewed the recommendations of the Committee and approve the
general principle of old age pensions. We are
not prepared however, te accept the recomnmendations oÏthe Committee. The three main

77

objections are: (1) We believe that the Federal
go vernment should assume a larger share in the
fnancing of an old age pension scheme as it is
more a Federal obligation than a Provincial
one; (2) We are not satisfied that a nots-contributing scheme is the best one; and (3) There
is no guarantee that the Federal government
would continue for a definite time to carry out
the mutual arrangements with respect to finaneing the scheme."
9. iBritish Columbia.-Under date of February
5th. 1925, the Minister of Labour (Hon. Mr.
Manson) writes: "This matter has been carefully considered by the Govermuent and also
by the Provincial Legislature at its last Session,
and the consensus of opinion is that the matter
of old agepensions is one entirely in the sphere
of the VFederal Parliament and this Government
does not concur ini the suggestion made by the
Committee that a portion of the cost of such
pensions be borne by the Provincial Crown."
In the resolution passed unanimously by the
British Columbia Legislature on the l8th December, 1924, the following statement is noted:
"State responsibility in the matter of the proper
maintenance of aged citizens has been recognized by Great Britain, Australia, New
Zealand, and a number of the nations of the
continent of Europe."
In a letter dated March 5th, 1925, the Minister of Labour of the Province of British
Columbia (Hon. Mr. Manson) writes:"1 beg to say that the matter has had very
serions consideration on the part of this ])epartment and the opinion is confirmed that the
matter of old age pensions is a subject for the.
consideration of the Federal and not the Provincial Parliament."
On June 2nd, 1925, the Premier of the Government of British Columbia (Hon. Mr. Oliver)
writing to the Chairman of the Committee, Mr.
Raymond, says: "Your explanation of how the
prupoeed scheme was expected to work certainly
tends towards a botter understanding. Should,
the Parliament of Canada pass legîsiation along
the lines suggested in your printed report o0f
last year, I presume the question would then
arise as to whether or not the Province would
co-operate."
In view of the position taken by several of
the Provinces and more particularly by Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia, and
having in mind what the British North America
Act, under sections 91 and 92, defines, your
Committee resolved to obtain an authoritative
opinion from the Department of Justice in
respect of the points thus raised, and on the
23rd of May ]ast, the Deputy Minster of Justice
replied as follows:S"Referring to your letter of the 12th instant,
asking te be advised witli regard to the authority of Parliament te legislate on the subject
of old age pensions, I may say that this subject
doea not f al specifically withfjn any of. the
enuinerated sub;ects given te the D<>minion
under section 91 of the British North America
Act, but does in my judgment faîl within the
subject "'Property and Civil Rights in the Province" committed te the provinces under section
92. 1 arn of opinion, therefore, that the subject
matter of pensions bas bean entrusted to the
provincial legislatures rather than te Parliament. I do not mean te suggest that Parliament has not the power te 1 isate upon the

subjeet no au te amst the provinees or te
establiah an independent voluntary seheme, provided that in either case the legisiation does not
trench upon the subjeet matter of property and

SENATE

78

civil rights in the province, as for example by
obligating any province or person to contribute
to the scheme.
"The enactment of such legislation would,
however, involve the assumption by the Dominion of obligations involving heavy expenditures
with regard to a matter which does not falil
specifically within the Dominion field of legislation."
Recommendations
Having given very careful consideration to
the opinion submitted by the Department of
Justice, and also to the respective views of the
different provinces, your Committee have come
to the following conclusions:Firstly. that if the Dominion Government
were to proceed now with a scheme of old age
pensions, it would have to be prepared to bear
the entire expense, cwhicli would approximately
amouit to tweinty-three million ($23,000,000)
dollars annually, according to the data contained
in your Coimîittee's investigations.
Secondly, that in view of the present financial
conditions and heavy taxation of Canada, your
Comiittee would not feel warranted at the
present moment in recommending such a large
additional expenditure, annually.
Thirdly, that this measure of social reform,
in the opinion of your Coimittee, is very important, and
Fourthly, that since it is the opinion of the
Department of Justice that the matter is one
coming under the jurisdiction of the Provinces,
although open to assistance from the Federal

ST. REGIS ISLANDS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 55, an Act to e~ovide for
special control by the Superintendent General
of Indian Affaire of certain islands ini the
St. Lawrence River being part of -the St. Regis
Indiaii reservat4,)n.
He said: 1Xunourable gentlemen, thbe et.
Regis band af Uidians owne f ror time immemorial, certtin islands in tube county cf
Huntingdon, epposite the town of Cornwall.
They do not live on these islands. They
leased et a nominal -rentul a century ago, and

the varicus leses include the right of renewaI
for another hundred years. Thbe Department,
feeling that the leases ehould Piot be renewed
and that their continuation could be prevented
by law, applied -ta the courts and obtained thbe
cancellation of some of çthem, but a couple of
cases are still pending before thbe courte.
By virtue of this Bill the Department asks
the righ.t to deal with tube ieiands in so f ax
ae the re-leasing of them is concernied, and
sk thaut it be empowered ta do so without
the necessity of obtaining a surrender of the
is!ands from the band. Those who know
anythb-ing of Indian lands are aware that
ordinarily the baind mu.st. be conulted about
such matters. These pieces- of land are exceptionally situated, inasmuch as they do flot
form part of the reserve inhabited hy thbe
band. They are smahl islands which could be
leased for summer residences et much larger
rentais than have been derived fromn the leases
made a hundred years ago. The Department
feels that there would be much scheming and
wranglinig among the Indians and considerable
difficulty in h.aving tuhem agree upon the party
who slaould be granted a lease. They would
perhaps agree upon the figure, but if many
persons were desirous of obtaining a lease
there would be inside the.band a good deal
of wire-pu4ling for thbe purpose of influencing
thbe decision one way or anotjuer. The Department Vuinks that ini thbe interest of the band

SOLDIER SETI'LEMENT BILL
SECOND READING

Bon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Biii 61, an Act te amend the
Soldier Settiement Act.
H1e said: Honourable gentlemen, the Senate
gave considerable study to this Bill wben it
came before us lest Session.
It had bad a
somewhat difficult career in passing through
the ot.her Huse. There were two or three
sets of amendments, and the Bill had to be
reprinted a few times before it reached us.
Then the ýSenate amended it in various respects. The amendments made last year by
the Senate have been mostly adopted by the
Government and the Commons, but there is
one exception of no mean importance.
The
Bihl as it now comes to us provides that lands
sold to soldiers and flnanced by the Board
may be revalued upon application to the
Board. If the parties agree the Department
may enter into a new contract; but if the
parties do not agree there may be an appeal
to an arbitral court to be composed of a
County Court Judge, a representative of the
Department, and a representative of the
soldier claiming a revision of the price of bis
land. Last yeaýr the Senate decided that that
appeal shouid go to the Exchequer Court. I
confess that I1 have not 'before me the Bihl as
in.troduced in the Commons a few weeks ago,
but I know that it was not in the form in
which it now comes before us. The commons
have ag-reed upon restoring the appeal to an
arbitral commîttee, the chairman of which is
to be a County Court Judge.
As the remainder of the Bill is on the
same lines as when it hef t this Chamber iast
year, I need not give in detail the reasons
for it; but, as we have some newcomers- in
the bouse, I xnav explain that in certain
cases land was soid to the soldiers at boom
prices. It is aileged that some land of inferior quality was soid at exorbitant figures.
A few thousand of the soldiers have fallen
behind with their paymente of interest and
capital. The Department is well aware of
those cases, and it is felt that if there were
no revaluation a number of the purchasers
would abandon their land, or that f oreciosure
would become necessary, and the Department
would have to find new purchasers. Parliament has thought it weil to give the preasent
holders of the property an opportunity of
Hon. Mr. ROBERTON.

showing that they paid too much for their
land, and, if that is proven, to make an
allowance which would bring the price to a
fair value. Parliament has aiready reduced
the indebtedness of the soldiers on stock
purchased by them; so the principle has
been admitted, and 1 thnik there need be
no discussion as to the propriety of moving
in this direction. The question is as to the
modus operandi.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
there is no reason that I know of why this
Bill shouid flot receive its second reading, because we agreed iast year, and I think we
probably agree again, that something must be
donc along this line.
The fact about the Bill is that it was introduced in the other Bouse this session in
the form in which it left the Senate iast
year, but the Minister, I understand, was prevailed upon to iay aside the amendmaents
that we made last year and to restore the
Bill to the form in wbich it was originaly
sent to us.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Bearing on that
point.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. The main point
of the Bill has to do with the arbitrai board,
as has been stated by the honourabie leader
of the Bouse. Under the Bill as it came
to us last year there would be a special court
for each particuIar case, owing to the fact
that each man having a dlaim would have the
right to name lis own arbitrator and this
wouid 'possibly resuit in great expense. We
did not know how long one of 'those boards
might protract the time it gave to the consîderation of a claim. We faiýt that if there
were oniy one board it couid go over the
matter and in a day or two settie upon the
principie to be adopted, which is the main
factor in determining the award; whereas if
there were to be a distinct board for each
case that process would have to be repeated
innumerabie times. We feit that that ~WouId
be very unsatisfactory, and that it might be
very slow and very costly.
Another difflculty was the fact that if there
were a distinct board for every case there
would pro'bably be a variety of deoisions;
the boards might not ail aot on the same
principle; and when the settlers came to
compare their awards thereafter great dis..

ticaily one point, that of the constitution of the
tribunal, it seems to me that we cao weli deai
withi the mea,,ure in Committee of the Whole.
bon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable ýgentlemen, the honourable leader on the other side
of -the House (Hon. W. B. Ross) has properly
explained t.he Bill as paesed by this honourable bouse last year. I u.nderstand that all
the amiendm-ents were accepted last year by
the other buse. The Committee týo wh'ich
the Bill was referred gave great attention to
it. It was found that there were some 11,000
cases in which application might be made for
arbitration. If the practice were adopteýd of
allowing each applicant to namne his own
arbitrator the do-or would be opened to the
creation. of a great nuiber~ ef different
tribunals. and the Committee thought that
these might involve a very large expenditure,
possibly reaching millions of dollars. That
was one point.
The Committee found that the Board had
followed very closely each of the soldiers
coming under the provisions of the Act, and
had valuable information in regard to the
financial position in each instance; therefore
the Committee and this bouse decided t.hat
the best course would be ýto ]eave it to the
Board to decide each casc, but to give to the
applicant the right of appeal. This appeal
should bc to, the Exchequer Court, and the
last provision to which the honourable gentleman called attention was inserted in the Bill
with the view to facilitating these appeals. Io
the discussion here the view was expressed that
it should not be necessary for the appellant to
come to Ottawa at ail; under those regulations
the appeal could be made by corirespoodence,
so that it would be very easy for any applicant to exercise bis right of appeal witbout
any expense.
For my part, I think the ameodments were
in the proper direction. One of the points
whieh this bouse had in mmid last year was
that the plan first suggeted would Iead to a
large expenditure, and also to a number of
different .judgments or awards resting on
altogether different principles. In a province,
or part of a province, one tribunal mighit
deoide in one way, and in anotber province,
or some o-ther part of the samne province, a
tribunal might decide differently, so that
uniformity would be destroyed altogether and
dissatisfaction created. For these reasons our
Committee reported the amendments, whioh
were adopted by this 'honourable bouse and
approved by the bouse of Commons.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.

INDIAN ACT ÂMENDMENT BILL
CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion

of Hon. Mr. Dandurand the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 56, an
Act te amend the Indian Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would like
,Mr. Williaîns to come to the floor.
On section 1-if capital does not exceed
$2,O00:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the province
of British Columbia alone there are approximately one hundred bonds whose capital
ranges from $9.17 to $2,000. The annual
înterest on such funds is negligible. Many of
those bands consist of very few members,
and in some instances there is no occasion
for the expenditures enuînerated in the said
subsection. The purpose of the proposed
amendment is f0 enable the Governor iii
Council te dispose of small capital accounts
among -the Indians intcrested in any way
whatever that moy bo deomed te be for their
benefit, even f0 a cash distribution of the
account among the members of the band.
Section 1 was agreed to.

MARCH 16, 1927
On section 2-regulations:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is an enlargement of the clause relating ta the operation af pool rooms, etc. The Department
has received complaints with regard ta abuses
in connection with the operation of pool
rooms, dance halls, and other places af amusement on Indian reserves, and it is desired ta
have authority ta regulate such matters.
Section 2 was agreed ta.
On section 3--disorderly conduct:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is on the
saine lines. It is desired ta give the Indian
Councils power ta deal with cases af disorderly
conduct and nuisances on their reserves. It
is considered that this will better serve their
needs than the present verbiage "repression
af intemperance and profligacy," which. has
given risc ta some confusion as ta the scope
and powers af the Councils. The procedure
with respect to intoxicants on reserves is iully
covered by the clauses ai the Indian Act
relative thereto. The terni "profligacy" is
somewhat vague. Offences against morality
are dealt with under the provisions of the
Criminel Code which obviates the need of
canferring special pawers on Indian Cauncils
with respect thereto. These new ternis are
much wider, and will allaw greater autharity
for the maintenance ai order.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:
Has the word
"inuisances", in this section, any technical
legal significance or interpretation?
Hlon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Yes. In the
Criminal Code.
Section 3 was agreed ta.
On section 4-acquisition ai totem pales,
etc., iorbidden; penalty:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is a considerable attempt made by tourists in variaus
parts ai the country, and more especîally in
British Columbia, ta buy these totem pales,
grave pales, and ether articles that represent
an aIder civilizatian. It is felt that these
should be preserved for Canada, and this
regulation was made ta prevent the sale and
exportation ai those things.
Section 4 was agreed ta.
On section 5-certificate ai analyst ta be
accepted as evidenýce:
Han. W. B. ROSS: Would it flot be passible ta imprave that section by requiring
that the certificate of the analyst reierred ta
there should be accompanied by a statutary
declaratian?
It seems pretty high-handed

ta produce a certificate ai an analyst and say
that is evidence. There shauld be some littie
protection in order ta make people careful
if they intend ta use thase certificates in
court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The only infarmation I have is the nate which accampanies this Bill. It says that fram the
reports ai the Rayal Canadian Maunted
Police officers with respect ta prasecutions for
selling intoxicants ta Indians it appears that
from time ta, time cases have been dismissed
by magistrates an the ground that there was
no provisian in the Indian Act for the admissian as evidence ai certificates ai analysts
flled by the police in these cases. It would be
a matter ai considerable expense ta summan
the Government analyst who gives the certificate ta attend court in a remote part ai
a province. This amendment remaves the
difficulty by making the certificate ai the
Government analyst evidence in itseli.
My honourable friend suggegts that the
certifleate shauld be accampanied by an affidavit, but, subject ta, correction, I think the
analyst is under oath in making hie analysis.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
sufficient.

If sa, that would be

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps I could
suggest something which would meet my honourable iriend's views and at the same time
be generally acceptable. Under the provisions
ai this section as it stands the certificate
would not only be prima facie, but it would
be conclusive evidence. Why not simply
make it prima facie evidence? That would
gîve the party complaining the right ta examine the analyst if he desired ta do so. I wanld
suggest that the section read:
In any prasecutian under this Act the certificate of analysis ai a provincial or dominion
analyst shaîl be accepted as prima facie evidence af the fact stated therein...
It would be taken merely as prima facie
evidence, so that, if so desired, it mîght be
contradicted by some other testimany.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
jection ta this amendment.

I have no ob-

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I will move that.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It is moved
that in the third line of new section 146A
in section 5 ai the Bill, the words "primat
facie" be placed before the word "evidence."
The amendment was agreed ta.
Section 5 as amended was agreed ta.

SENATE

On section 6-receiving money for the
prosecution of a claim:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There have
been considerable abuses in this connection.
People have been allowed to enter those
reserves, and under ail kinds of reres;entations have obtained money fromn the Indians
there. For several years past complaints have
been made to the department with respect
to persons visiting Indian Reserves and collecting money for the purpose of prosecuting
some alleged dlaim. Recently the R.C.M.
Police arrested at Caughnawaga two Amenicans and two Canadians who were collecting
money for the prosecution of an alleged dlaimn
of the Six Nations Confederacy against the
State of New York in respect of là nilq fonrmerly
in the occupation of the Six Nations. Visits
of this kind have taken place from time to
time among the Indians at the Oneida Reserve in the province of -Ont.ario, at St. Regis,
Caughnawaga, Oka and even at the Reserve
of the Huron Indians, in the province of
Quebec. Ail sorts of representations have
been made to these Indians to induce them
to contribute and it appears that scveral
thousands of dollars have been collectcd in
this way. The charge laid against tliee four,
persons who were recently arrest4ed at Cauglinawaga wvas that of obtaining money from
these Indians under false pretence. We are
advised, however, that owing to the teschnicalities of this charge there is a possibility
of these people being acquitted, and, if so,
they will likely continue the collection of
funds as heretofore from many of the most
needy and unienlightened Indians of tlie
bands. The purpose of this amendment is
to prevent a continuance of takina, moneIv
from the Indians in this way.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: 1 have no objection
to this section. I think ýit is good.
Section 6 ivas agreed to.
Section 7 was agreed to.
The preamble and the title were agreed to.
The Bill was reported as amended.

Hon. Mr. DANDIIRAND moved the third

certain islands in the St. Lawrence river being

part of the St. Regis Indian reservation.
Hon. Mr. Belcourt in the Chair.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

My honourable

friend the late Minister of Labour (Hou. Mr.

Robertson) asked me if there had been any
attempt by the Department to obtain the
consent of the Indian bands at St. Regis to

the Department leasing those islands, when
they are frecd from the present leases, without submission to the band. The answer the
Department gives me is that no0 sucb attempt
bas been made, for more than one reason.
They are expccting judgment in the case of
two islands thagt are stiiJ1 under the old

leases, and since they have obtained judgmient freeing the other islands fruin those
leases, they hope that a similar judgment
will be rendered in the cases of these two
remaining islands. When this is done the
Depart.ment will be in a position to deal
with ail those islands. The Department hias
not approached the band, because for a ilumber of years thle band has refused to have

any dealings with the Department, and tlaey
have systematically abstained from appointing a Councii; su there i5 no0 council at
St. Regis. Thae Departmnent is quite convuaceed that it could not succeed in getting
a satisfactory answer fromn the Indians if it

appealed to thcrn to surrender their rights in
those jalands, ýsuthat the Department might
lease themn in the interest of the band. There
would be agitators who would try to prevent
the surrender of 'those islands, and in the
meantime the Indians, at least the most
aggressive amongst t.hem. would jump into
those islands and commit depredations by
cutting wood standing on those islands, which
gives themn value as summer resorts, or they
would try to take possession as squatters
there. The Department is convinced that it
would simpily mean chaos.
Under those circum.stancè's' they appeal to
Parliament, in the interests of the band as
a whole, to allow the Dcpartment t0 deal
with those islands and lea.se them in the best
interests of the band itself.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

On what ground is

it expected that these lcases will be declared
nulI and voîd? They wcrc made a great
many years ago, and I presume the lessees
have invested money there, and they must
have some vestcd property interests. The Bill
here makes nu allusion to anything of that
kind at ail. On what ground is it expected
that those lessees would be put out of court?

MARCH 16, 192781
0f course, I
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
do noV know as I have noV Vhe judgments
hefore me, but there was a contested case.
There were three actions Vaken to end those
leases at the expiration of a hundred yeare,
and a judgment was rendered in one case
annuling the lease, putting an end Vo iV. The
other Vwo parVies who were sued and who
had been in possession of the two neighbouring islands abandoned Vhe contesV and
confessed judgment. So there are three judgmente entered which have freed the Départment and Vhe Indians fromn those leases and
there are two judgments now being awaited
upon the two remaning islande. I have noV
the judgmenV which settled the matter and
gave the resons why those leases should end
there.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:- No doubt it is because under the law of Québec a lease cannot
be made beyond 99 years.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Will my honourable friand tell me if the case in which
judgment was given je the case of Donald

Yes, it is.

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, Vhe
Senate wenlt inVto Committee on Bill 61, an
AcV to amend the Soldier Settiement Act.
Hon. Mr. Stanfield in the Chair.
Paragraphs a and b of new section 68 were
agreed to.

On paragrapli c, new section 68-how
depreciation shaîl1 he comnputed:
Hon. W. B. ROSS : Mr. Chaîrman, we
changed this paragraph lest year, makin-g what
we thought, a.nd I sVill think, is a simplex
definition of depreciation. The clause that
we inserted in place of this paragraph c
reads in this way:
The depreciation in value Vo be determined
shall be the diminution, noV due Vo negleet or

mismanagement on the part of the settier, in
the present value of the land and the improvements sold to the settier, as compared with the
price at whieh the settier agreed to purchase
the said land and improvements from the Board.
It ie very simple. The trouble is that in
many cases 'the original price was in oui
opinion too high, or the value has depreciated,
until the 'price is out of proportion with the
existing value. In arriviiig at the proper
valuation, assuming that the settier was not
guilty of neglect or mismanagement, you
simply take the price which he agreed to pay
for the land and improvemients, compare it
with the pregent, value, and find the compensation due Vo him. The clause as we had
it is simpler than in the present Bill, and I
would suggest that we substitute it.
I Vhought that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
phraseology was quite olear, and I interpreted
it as my honourable friend does; but others
f elt great difficulty ini understanding the
wording, and, although there was soe
reluctance in yielding Vo an amendment, an
effort was made Vo satisfy them with some
other formula. If the wording now in the
Bill means exactly the saine thing, 1 suggest
that we leave it as it is, in order net to
encounter the hostility of those who have
f ound difflculty' in understanding the draft of
lasV year.
Paragraph c now reads:
The depreciation in value to be determined
shail be the amount by which, through no neglect or mismanagement on the part of the
settler, the price at which the Board agréed to
seli the land and improvements to, the settier
exceeds the amount representing the present
value of the said land and improvements.
I Vhink iV means the saine thing; it is
simply another way of putting it.
IV
Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLESWORTH:
occurs to me that the section might be a
little olearer in meaning if, from. Vhe line
before the laist, on the page, the last three
words were omitted altogether, so that it
would read that the depreciation shaîl be the
amount by which Vhe price at the time of
purchase exceeds the present value. The
words "Vhe amount, representing" would be
lefV out of *he clause.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. Those words are
noV necessary.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has tihe honourable gentleman Vaken note of the suggested
amendmenV?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: In the last line but one
strike out the words "ýthe amount representingl'. That will shorten it up.

SEINATE
The Hon. thie CHAIRMAN: Shall the clause
carry, as amenlded?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Jusf a moment, Mr.
Chairman. There is another question that I
should like to ask the bonourable gentleman
in charge of the Bill. I refer to tihe top of
page 2:
In determining the present value of flic land,
improvements made by the settiers shahl fot be
included; provided that in any case where the
actual sale price is greater than the maximum
amount which under section 16 of this Act may
lie advanced by the Board in the purchase of
land on hehiaif of any settier, sucli maximum
aniount shahl be deemed the sale price for the
purposes of this section.
Subject f0 correction, I think fliat the
soldiers themselves advanced one-tcnth of the
purchease price in any ca.se in wiiroli if could
be cxtracted fromn tbem.
If fliat
the
does not this section meen fliet isthat fact,'
onetenth is to lie qconfiscated?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I tbink tbis sec4ion
bas reference to flic case of a soldieýr settler
who agreed to pcv more fhan tlic Board was
willing fo pay at the fimie.
Hlon. Mr. TAYLOR: That is nof my point
at cil. My point is entirely different. As I
said, I am under the impression that in every
case in iwýhich ten per cent could bie got fromn
the settler if was obtained from him. If land
was purclicsed for $1,000 and f en per cent
was paid by the settfhr, the Board advanced
hinm only $900; and this section says in effeet
t.hat now we are to fake $900 as the full
purcliese price; s0 if the land is diminished
$100 in value the settler will get nothing. 1
do not fhink t'bat is what is intended.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do nofbelievc
that flic case thle bonourable gentleman gives
would be covcred by tibe present clause. As
far as my memory carnies mie, and fromn reading the clause, it is my opinion fliaf it simply
covers the cases in which the purchase price
is greater thani the amount agreed to by the
Department.
Hon. Mn. TAYLOR: Tlia. is another point
altogeflier.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: It seems f0 me that
this is to coven cases of this kind. Unden the
law, as I undcntand if, the Government
restricted the advance f0 eny settier for fthe
purchase of land f0 say, $6,000 and in some
cases flic sefflers, on flic other hand, decidcd
to purchase ]and wonth $10,000. This simply
means that w'hen you come f0 consider flic
value of tlic land flic purcliase price shahl lc

Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: With ail due deference, fliaf is not flic point I raised just now.
Wc discuissed thet lest year, but I

On paragraph (e)-Board to determine depreciation in value, Arbitration Committee:
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Is there any change
in this from the Bill that we passed Iast year?
At that time the appoal went to the Judge of
the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I explaîned yesterday that the House of Commons had returned to the procedure approved by that
House last year, and had replaced the Exchequer Court by Arbitration Boards which
would each be headed by a County Court
Judge.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Mr. Chairman, this is
really the most important feature of the Bill,
as far as I can see, subject to some explanation being given of paragraph (c), which is
becoming a littie more mysterious to me. If
honourable gentlemen will look at paragrapli
(c), on page 2, beginning at uine 15, they wvill
sce this provision:
-and unless the Board and the Settier agree
within one month thereafter on the amount of
the depreciation in value sucli amount shahl be
finally fixed and determined by an Arbitration
Committee appointed by the Minister and selected as f ollows: The Chairman shahl be the
Judge of the County or District Court or in
the Province of Quebec the Superior Court
having jurisdiction in the judicial district in

which the land is situate, one member nominated

in writing by the Settler, and one member
nominated in writing by the Board, and the
members of the Arbitration Committee, when
appointed, shaîl have ail the powers and authority of a Commissioner under the Inquiries
Act.
Under that provision there may be, and
there is almost sure to be, a distinct arbitral
court for eacli case, with the possible result,
as I pointed out yesterday, that the proceedings may be very costly, and that different

courts may act on difforent principhes.

For

that. reason we thought hast year-I do not
think the idea originated with me; I think
there was complete -agreement on both sides
of the House-that, we -could improve that
clause by striking out everything f rom the

words "and unless" down to the end of tihe
paragraph, and inserting:

suggested in the Bill as it has corne back to
us, and 1 wouhd move -that that change be
made.
][on. Mr. DANDURAND:
1 behieve that
the Bill whioh was brought down to the Commons contained the ternis of the amendment
now moved by my honourable friend, and that

the Commons replaced that by the text of
paragrapli (e), which ia now before us.
This Bill cornes to me for the second tîme
as the expression of t)he will of the other
Chamber. Before a decision is reached by
this Cha.înber. It is rny duty to explain to it
the point, of view of the other House. The
reason given for the change which 'las bcen
made there is that the soldiers are diserninated throughout the land; that if they are
dissatisfied with the offer made by the Department they wîll be doubtful of a tribunal t-hat
is so far away from them. that, they cannot see
it or understand. its working; that Vhey would
rnuch prefer to go before a court cornpoeed of
the County Court Judge and two other
arbitrators, one norninated by the Department and the other by the soldier settler who
is comphsining, a court which wih be near
at 'hand and which they will be able to
a.pproaoh. The fear lias been expressed that
the soldior settier would not care to support
an appesi to a tribunal oituated a thousand
or 'two thousand raflesa way. This, 1 think, is
the main argument which vua made in favour
of the present systeni, and this opinion being
sharod by many, the Minister agreed to revert
to the text of last year. We are now dealing
with that question, and it will bc for tihe
Sonate to dieclare, in view of the staitement
which I make, whother or nlot there is sufficient security for the sottier in coming bofore
the Exohequer Court. Practically, we are
faci'ng for the second time the decision of the
other Chamber; so we mnust dehiberate calmhy
and seriously s.nd decide whether we wiql
accept the present text or will revert to what
we docided upon st yoar. 1 believe that I
amn giving fairly ithe situation which induced
the ýother ÇChambor to change the text of the
Bill.

-and if any applicant is dissatisfied with the

decision of the Board he may, within such
time as is prescribed by regulations made by

by the cost.
Paragraph (f)

of clause 68 says:
Expenditures necessarily incurred by or in
connection with the administration of this Act
as may be provided by regulation, shall be paid
out of moneys appropriated from time to time

From that clause I should judge that the

severil of their replies, which are to be found
in tle Debates of last year, because I thought
tha. the spirit displayed by the soldiers was
remarkablc. A large number of them answered
that they had not paid more than the value
of the property and tihey did not think they
were entitled to any relief.
Others said,
"Well, we paid too much, but we made a
bargain. and we intend to stand by it." There
were a number of letters to that effect.
I think I am warranted in saying, in the
name of this House, that our desire is that the
soldiers should be ýtreated liberally, and that
the Government should come to their rescue,
but we must be careful, as we were last year,
to prevent unnecessary expense; and I remain
satisfied, as I was last year, that it would
be a great mistake to revert to this arbitration
clause.

every soldier, who will be afforded ample opportunity to produce evidence by affidavit,
without inconvenience and expense of coming
to Ottawa for the purpose of substantiating
his claim for revaluation.
The Soldýier Settlement Board bas the machinery; in every part
of the country it has valuators who can be
employed to make proper assessments, and if
necessary check the valuations made by the
Board itself.
I repeat that ini my opinion it would be
a mistake to open the door to the establishment of a great many different tribunals,
which would be very expensive and muiglt
produce judgments or awards based on principles differing altogether in their application,
so that one soldier might get relief on one
principle, and on that same principle another
might be deprived of relief.
For my part I will support the amendment.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Honourable gentlemen, last year I opposed the proposal of
the Arbitration Committee, and I do so still.
My objection last year was to the possible

suffer from that lack of uniformiry. Tliere

to spend it on the soldier and not on the
tribunal. Therefore I agreed to the proposal
that the Exchequer Court should handle the
appeals.
A year bas passed since that time, and
tlero has been some opportunity of discussing
amongst ex-service men the matter of the
handling of appeals by the Exchequer Court.
As bas been pointed out by the leader of
the Government, the objection to the Exchequer Court is that doubt exists in the
minds of the soldiers as to how this machinery is to be set in motion; hîow the appeal
is to be laid; how the discussion is to be
carried on, and the argument advanced, and
how the Excliequer Court is te acquaint itself with the essential facts of the case.
My honourable friend from Montreal, with
whom I had some discussion yesterday, points
out that the Exchequer Court would be
guided as to its procedure by the discussion
which takes place in this House. Well, that
is interesting, and I hope it is truc, but it
does not assure us that the procedure will
be as we think it should be. In the first
place, it should be speedy; for unless the Exchequer Court is able to deal speedily with

SENATE

Now this Bill comes with the stamp of
approval of the other House, and it is before
us. I present it as I have received it, but
I draw the attention of the Senate to the
fact that for the second time the other House
has adhered to the idea of arbitration. Now
my honourable friend suggests that if we are
to accept the idea of arbitration, one arbitration court should be appointed for a province,
instead of a dozen or a hundred arbitration
courts. Well, that is a suggestion, but it is
not contained in the amendment before us.
My honourable friend fears the multiplicity
of tribunals and desires to limit them. All I
can say is that I am here with this Bill in
hand, submitting it to this House with whatever virtue there is in it. Having read the
Debatms in the other Chamber, I have
explained why that House adhered to the
arbitration court, and my duty ends there.

pressure at all, no appeal to a Mindster, either
politically or otberwise, and in that fair atmosphere for coming to a decision they said:
" What the Senate gave us as their opinion
last year in this clause appeals to our judgment; we have it in better form than the
clause as we had sent it to the Senate lat
year; and in presenting our Bill we wi'll
adopt the opinion of the Senate, and will
make that part of the measure our own."
That came down before the other House,
and was being discussed, when there came
some particular pressure from some particu1ar person, perhaps not representing any very
great amo'unt of thought or opinion or tendency in the House as a whole; but, the point
being put pertinently and sharply to the MinSter at the time, the Miinitster, to avoid
trouble, said: " We will let it go, then, in
that way, and we will reverse ourselves."
No,, I ask the members of this Senate to
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I said I was not

matter; and surely we must come to the
court of appeal, but if there was any objecopinion that the Government, in i'ts cool jud:gtion to it the dispute could be referred to the

between us in this House as to the principle
Coming down to the particular item itself,
of this bill. It has been sympathetically received by al! members of the Senate. Last you will remember that we examined that
whole question last year. We totalled up the
year we went to a good deal of trouble in discussing and examining the foundations of this number of applicants who would possibly

When the settler is offered an opportunity

that the settlers themselves had no better for an immediate appeal, his tendency to
ask for more is stimulated. Though the
friends, either on the point of sympathy or
of actual knowledge of the conditions, than the Department may propose what it considers

officer wherevcr there ia a settier. The whole
history of the settier and of the dealings
bebween him and the Board wit'h reference
ta his particular piece of land is known, and
sympathetically considered, by the Department or some of its afficera.
Now you have in contemplation thousands
of boards of arbitration. Each board may be
constituted dîfferently from every other;
because a -ettler, having the right ta name
his own arbitrator, will not take a gencral
arbitrator appointed by a judge, or recommended for engagement throughout a section
of country. The settler wild -have hie own
particular friend ta act as arbitrator an his
behaîf. You will have as many 'boards of arbitration as you have aettlers making appeals.
Surely we muet have same regard ta expenditure. Let us ýcalculate in aur own minds
what would be the total if we liad a board
of arbitration for every single application of
the thousands that will be madle. Every
board muet consist af three memibers: yau
have your county judge, you have the
arbitrator for the settier, and you have the
representative of the Department. The cxpenses muet aïl be met by funds from the
treasury of the -country.
What we desire is an even and fair valuation
for every settler. If we get that for him,
'we have a right to take into accounit the
means whereby wc may get it as cheaply as
possible and avoid extravagance in carrying
out aur purpose. Sa the argument is a simple
one. la it on the ground of economy that
you would have the separate ;boards of
axrbitration? Will you nat utilize an institution
which has been cstablîshed for ycars amongst
us, lias experienced men at its hiead, has
travcllcd scores -of times frorn one end of
this country ta the other, has sources of
information in every part of the country and
is aecustomed ta d'ealing with these matters
of valuation? It is already paid. We do
nlot need ta go ta extraordinary expense in
carrying out this operation. There is a
sympathetie Board which bas been father and
mother ta the settler for the last ten or twelve
years, end is interested in his case. The
moncy camnes, not out of the pockets of the
officiaIs, 'but fromn the consolidated fund, and
the Board desires to sec that its clients receive
fair compensation ta the very lirait.
Is not aur proposed amendment better on
the ground of actual service ta the settler,
on the ground of public economy, for which
I think we ought ta stand, and on the ground
of avoiding causes for dissatisfaotion? The
gentleman who macle the plea to the Minister and prevailed upon hira ta reverse his
decision probably represenîted that the settler

9

would nlot obtain justice in that way, and that
this method should be taken to give him
a better chance. Well, it seems ta me that
hie would obtain justice from the Exchequer
Court, with its machinery, its knowledge, its
adaptability, its technicil- experience and the
faet that it has sa many sources of information and has been gathering information for
years and years.
ls there not a graund for passible dissatisfaction in the fact, which has been mcntioned
here again and again, -that if various arbitratien courts wcre established different methods
would certainly be f ollowed and different
principles adopted. An application might
seem unjust ta ane board while a similar
application, macle by a neighbour, might be
allowed by another board. There woiild be
countless causes for dissatisfaction resulting
from that unevenness.
These are some of the reasons why I feda
that we had 'better reaffirm the position tbat
we took last ycar. Our conclusion was reached
after a very careful and very sympathetic
examination of the whale question, on the
groundsg of public convenience and public
economy, and because of the fact that the Exchequer Court would render judgmcnts which
would be just as sound and as equitable
as any we could have from these specially
constitutcd small courts.
Hon. Mr.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
Ross (Middleton) moves that after the word
"esection," in line 15, the following words bc
substituted:
-and if any applicant is dissatisfied with the
decision of the Board he may, within such time
as is prescribed by regulations made by the
Governor in Council, appeal ta the Exchequer

Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Is it the intention
that those regulations should apply ta the
procedure of the Exehequer Court?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII: That is the questien in which 1 arn primarily interestcd. I
arn in favour of the Court off Exchequer, but
it is very essential that this matter of regulations should be covered and well eovered.
What is required now is that the proeeedings
before the Court of Exehequer shall be
speedy, uniform, simple and cheap. Those
are the four requirements off the procedure
before the Court, and I arn asking the bonourable leader off the Government to assure us

Court by a letter, a statement, a petition,
or anything that states bis name, his location,
and the necessary facts, witbout formal pleadings off any kind.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Arn I correct in interpreting tbe proposed amendment as providing for a set off rules governing the

neot be distinct ffrom the now existing rules
off thbe Exebequer Court?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes. They are tecbnical to a certain extent, made for lawyers;
Hon. Mr. NIURPHY.

but now YOU give the Governor in Council
power to ignore the Exehequer Court Act
and f0 simpliffy the procedure.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Is the bonourable gentleman moving in that matter?

Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND: My bonourable

That takes the place off tihe section which

MARCH 16, 1927
The Governor in Council May make sucb
regulations as he deems fit for procedure in constituting the Arbitration Committee and respecting hearings before such Committee and
generally to make effective the purposes of
this section.
1
We change it so that t he Board May do
that. Then Ühere is paragraph (i) to be dealt
with, which relates to, what the honourable
(Hon. Mr.
Edmonton
from
gentleman
Griesbach) refers to, as to, how a man is going
to get before the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I do not understand that at ail. ýMy understanding is tihat
you have before you section (h), whieh la
drafted to provide for regulations when you
have a Board of Arbitration. Now, you have
donc away with that Board, and wat you
require is a provision that the Governor in
Council inay make such regulations as are
neccssary to provide for the conduct of the
case before the Excihequer Courtr-that and
no more. I cannot understand why the Soldier
Settiement Board should have to do with the
drafting of those rules. This is one of the
objections taken in another place: that the
Board had nothing more to do with the case
after they had been unable -to agree with the
soldier as to what he should have in the way
of reduction. I cannot un-derstand why the
Board is mentioned at ail in this section.
Hlon. Mr. BEIQUE: Id I arn allowed,' I
wiIl move that paragraph (h) be stricken out,
and be replaced by the following:
The Governor in Council may make such regulations as he deems fit for the procedure ini appeals to the Exchequer Court under this section, and may by such regulations modify or
dispense with any provisions as to procedure
in the Exehequer Court Act or in the rules
or practice of that Court. Ahl such regulations
as made shall be published forthwith in the
Canada Gazette.
I think the 'honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Griesbach) May rest assured that the
Government is anxious to corne to the relief
of the soldiers and to treat them liberally.
Now, it will be the duty of tlhe Government
to see, tihat such reguhations are passed as will
enable that to be doue.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACHI: Ail I was asking
was whether the honourable leader of the Governrnent could tell us that now, on behalf of
the Government, ini order that we snight leave
the Bihl, knowing it was in odfe hands.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman bas not noticed that I wanted to

order that I might inform the Goverument. I
do not know what the decision of the Government will be.

Hon. 'Mr. GRIESBACH: The Governmnent
has wobbled týhree times on this very clause,
and will wobble again just as easily.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
my honourable friend is attacking the other

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It coul:d not

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I ýask that the

The motion was agreed to, and progress was

J# OLD ÂGE PENSIONS BILL
MOTION

FOR SECOND READING-DEBATE
ADJOURNED

Hon. Mr. DANDUIIAND moved the second
reading of Bill 70, an Act respecting Old Âge
Pensions.
He said: Honourable gentlemen are familiar
with this Bill. Even those honourable members who were not here hast Session have heard

sufficient of it through the press to know
what it covers. In a few words, it provides
f or a maximum pension cd $240) yearly for
people of 70 years of age who have been in
Canada for twenty years immediately preceding the commencement of the pension, and in
the province applied to for the last five years.

The said pension is to, be subject to reduction
by the amount of the income of the pensioner
in excess of $125 a year. In other words the
pension will supplement the income up to
$365 a ycar, but flot further. This grant -is
not made direct to the pensioner by

the

Dominion Goverument, but is suhject to an
agreement with the provinces by which they
contribute one-haif of the pension and provide
the machinery f or administration.
The Bull cornes to us in the samne form as
last year, somewhat strengthened, however,
through the f act that this piece of legisiation
was 'before the people at the last election,
when there was a general consultation with
them on many matters. Among the people,
as well as in this Chamnber, there was a
differeuce of opinion as to the method or
procedure to, be followed; but the principle
cd the Bull, I believe, was approved of
generally. I suggest that, as there seems to

SENATE
be a consensus of opinion in favour of old age
pensions, the Senate should not hesitate to
approve -of the principle of this Bill by voting
for the second reading.
I suppose it has occurred to most of the
honourable members of this Chamber who
have given thought to this matter that the
policy embodied in this Bill may not be the
permanent policy of this country.
For my
part, I confess the honest opinion that this is
rather what I would call provisional legislation, which will stand as a preliminary step
to permanent legislation in that field.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL:

A sort of chart?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No. If my honourable friend will follow me, he will understand how I cy that tis measure, even if it
came with another piece of legislation, which
would be on a contributory plan, would stand
as a necessary part of lit. There has been an
expression of opinion by some labour unions
in favour of the contributory plan, but most
of them have agreed that it must be preceded
or aecompanied by such a plan as is ernbodied
in this present Bill.
The reason is obvious.
We want to do something for aged people.
Well, there are aged people who are 70 years
or mure; quite a number who are below 70;
and as we go down to 65, from 65 to 60, and
to 55 and 50, we find a much larger number.
It is impossible to present to any Parliament a
Bill on a contributory plan which will take
care of men who are hovering around 60,
because if they were taxed a sufficient amount,
according to tables based on maturity at 70,
the load would be too heavy for them to
bear. That is why I say this is an emergency
or provisional measure which would necessarily
accompa.ny or precede a .contributory Bill.
The policy which was adopted in Great
Britain is the one embodied in this measure.
Great Britain passed legislation granting pensions to men of 70 years of age without asking
them to contribute, but a few years later, in
1925, they brought up and 'passed a Bill
organizing contributory pensions. That is
what I believe should be seriously examined
as the next step to be taken; and since a conference of representatives of the provinces
has been announced for the coming summer,
I believe that they will be asked to come in
under this scheme, and at the same time to
study or prepare for the next plan, which
woulld call for the people contributing to
these pensions.
I may say that the Montreal Council of
Social Agencices, Dependency and Delinquency
Division, has suggested, by communication of
December 14, tlhe following resolution:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

That in view of the proposed enactment of an
Old Age Pensions scheme by the Dominion Government, the Dependency and Delinquency
Division of the Montreal Council of Social
Agencies recommends that a non-partizan Coinmittee of the House be appointed to collect
data from all countries that have passed Old
Age Pensions Acts, and that, acting on this information. the Dominion Government, either
with or without financial participation on the
part of the Provincial Governments, should
forthwith pass an Old Age Pensions Act, the
main conditions of which sbould be:
(1) Contributions from the assured, the enployer and the State.
(2) Adequate pension at the age of 65.
(3) Reciprocal arrangements between the
Dominion and the British Governments.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
Who are those
people? I did not hear who they are.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is the
Montreal Council of Social Agencies.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:
ad.dressed?

To whom

is it

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is a motion
moved by Mr. Charles Fyfe, seconded by Mrs.
Saxe-Holmes, and ca-rried. It was addressed
to the present Government, or the Minister
of Labour: I obtained it from the Minister of
Labour.
Now, representatives of the National Unions
appeared before the Cabinet lately, and they
favoured a non-contributory plan for the present-day indigents, but requested a contributory system -for the future.
Honourable gentlemen will see that svhen
we decide te pass old age pensions we have
either to provide for the present indigents,
those who are in a position to qualify under
this Bill, and those who will be se within
the next ton years, by giving them a pension
without asking any contribution from them.
or else leave them aside. You may say, "We
will provide old age pensions which will come

this" but the Governments that have discussed the matter, and Parliaments that have
legislated on it, have provided for the presentday indigents and the indigents of to-morrow.
and have concurrently, or later on, brought
in a scheme of contributory pension.
I may state that the Minister of Labour
has declared that his Department was charged
with the study of a definite plan of pensions
for all time, which will have to be brought
before Parliament in the not distant future,
and I find that when such a plan does come
into effect it will not be a heavy burden upon
the people of this country. In Great Britain
the employer is asked to pay a share; the
beneficiary pays his share, and the Govern-

MARCH 16, 1927
ment its share; thus these are three parties
who contribute. In this country we may
dYraw upon four sources: the federal exchequer, the provincial exchequer, the employer and the employee.
1 find here that one of the tables worked
out under the direction of the Minister contemplates a dollar-a-day pension for if e for a
worker who attains the age of 65 years. As
honourable gentlemen will sec, the presentday pension contained in this Bill starts at
70 years of age. The definite plan by which
the beneficiary would contribute woul entitle him to a pension at 65. We know how
fast we move towards the seventieth year,
and quite a number fail before they are 65,
and feel the need of support. The next plan
to be studied-which I hope the provinces,
when they m-eet, will study-will be the contributory plan, and, although it has nothing
to do with the present Bill, it may be of
interest te the members of the Senate to hear
what will be the cost of a contributory
system.
One of the tables worked out under the
direction of the Minister of Labour contemplates a dollar-a-day pension for life after
the worker attains the age of 65 years. The
neeessary contributions to finance such an
annuity have been estimated for aIl ages from
18 te 50. The following age periodsý are
iluetrative:

Ho0nourable gentlemen will see that the
labour unions themselves, who, have given
some study to the matter, feel that it would
be more satisfactory te them, if such a sysstemn were established, for them to contribute.
1 am very glad to think that such a feeling
existsamong the labouring elements of this
country. But, asI said, this does not provide for the present, generation that is meving towards the seventieth year, and the <3overnment offers te the provinces a contribution
of $10 per month, that is, $120 per year, if
the province will contribute as much to the
needy, under this Bill.

Among the many objections I -have 'heard
formulated-I do nlot know that I heard- themi
here-was this one, that it would be very
difficuit for the provinces to find out who are
the indigents. Well, -the ipresent Bill bas simplified the solution of that question. It is
fairqy automatic. An indigent is one who bias
not an income of a dollar a day. If he bas
below a dollar a day this Bill cornes into play,
and hie will be helped up to a dollar a day.
Representations have been made that the
amount of $20 a month is very smali indeed.
Well. thousands of people have got along up
to this time withbout $20 a month, and this will
be an addition to whatever they have in hand,
and whatever they have lived on up to this
date.
The provinces, as represented by their
various Goverumients, have not yet indicated
their state of mmnd. They did last year, but I
would point out to xny 'honouralile friend
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien), who
is smiling because I handed him the answers
that I gave him last year, that the question
was a new one to rnost of them. Mean-time
the people have ibeen asked to express an
opinion. I think in very many quarters they
have expressed theïr vie"s in no uncertain
way, so that if the provinces were asked today how they view the matter they would
probably be disposed to accqpt the gift which
the federal treasury, through the action of
both Chambers of Parliament, is ready to
*hand over to them. Se fur, only the Legielature of British Columbia hias paased an Act
enabling the Lieutenant Governor iu Council to take advantage of this legisiation which
is before us to-day.
I do not know that I have *covered t-he
whdle ground, but I think tha-t I have given
a fair, idea of the projeet which is submitted
to -the Senate, and if -and when we go into
Committee, as I hope we shahl, I may be in
a position to explain the machinery which
às to be provided for the application of this
Bill.
With these few remares I move the second
Teading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. CURRY: Honourable gentlemen, before the motion is put I would like
to eall the attention of the honourable leader
of the Govern.ment in this'House to the fact
that more than haif of his supporters aire
absent, and that this thinning-out process
fhas been going on ail afternoon. It lookse to
me as though the Goverment wished to kill
this- Bl, and then they would be able to go
to the country and say that the wicked Tory
*Senators were the murderers. If I amn wrong
in my surmise I would euggest that the vote
be postponed until at leaet a reasonable num-

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
as I infend to vote against the second reading
of tIis Bill fia matter who votes for it, I null
try ta state to the House in as few words as
possible my reasons for oppasing it.
The honai'rable leader on the ofler side
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) lias faken about twothirds of lis time in expiaining the contributory Biil fliat wili came in the future. He lias
flot enlargcd upon cither tIe merifs or flic
demerits of tIe Bill an whicli we are now
askcd ta vote, ta tlic ext ent fIat I would have

The Biil that will lie presented Inter is connected witli a subjeet with which cvery lioncurable member of this House is familiar;
that is, fthe subject of aid age pensions. Proliabiy ail of us have heard of this question and
studied it more or less for tIc last twentyfive ycars, and in the case of serme mcn for a
longer period. I would have liked ta hava a
littie mare detail about this coming measure.
For instance, the lionourable gentleman used
the fterni "workmen". Now, if yau are going
ta have an Old Age Pension Biil you, wiil have
tu enlarge upon thaf word and give it a very
extensive meaning. Five years from naw the
word "workmen" may include a contractor or
employer. In my opinion you will flot have

Hon. Mr. ROSS: If the pensioner lived
for ten years, how rnuch would his pension
arnount to?
Ail the groceries he would eat
in that tirne would flot make any grocer in
Ottawa or any other city mucli richer. However, this is one of the details and I do not
want to dwell upon it now. What I desired
to ËaY with regard to this measure is that a
memrber cari vote against this measure--and I
think hie ought to vote against it-without
passing any definite opinion upori an Old Age
Pension BiJll based upon contribution and
appiying to everybody, and I desire, in what
I have to say, simply to guard myseif in that
respect.
I arn quite prepared to consider
symp'athetically an Old Age Pensions Bill thait
would be applicable to every man and every
womari in the country, if it were contributory
and made pensions payable at the pýroper time
without conditions or limitations of any kind,
or without any inquest as ta whether the applicant is worth $50 or $5,000. I have deemed
it necessary to say this, bocause there' is a
tendency on the part of a mind flot trained to
reasaning ta canclude that a person speaking
against a Bill of this kirid is opposed to every
form of old age pension. In my case it is not
true.
I think I have said eriough to guard
myseif in that respect.
Before coming to deal with the Bull itself
I iwish to mention a matter to which the
honourable leader did not refer in lis speech,
but of which I have heard others speak. It
been stated that this Bill has been p
proved of twice by this country and therefore we ought to pass it. Now, I do not
agree that it has been approved of by this
country at ail. It rxever went as a flat, single
question before the people of this country,
as questions are submitÀted ini the f orm of
a referendum. I will admit that if this one
issue were submitted as the sole issue to the
people of this country, anid if a substantial
mai ority of the people voted for it, it would
be ini ry opinion the duty of this Rouse
to give way. But such is not the fact. There
were ail kinds of issues ait the Iast general
_j-_election. There was the so-called constitutiorial issue, which I know, figured largely
in some places. Each meinber of this House,
after ail, lias only a amail circle as to which
he can give prirnary eviderice, and no member as in a position to say that- the people
of this country voted on this Bi-I and approved of it. Ail I can Bay a-bout it le that
I was interested in the measure anid made
careful inquiries of men who were in charge
of wards in the general election, and the
information I received fromn the Consei-vatives
wau that in the eaalier part of the eampaign
they thought they were going ta be hurt

rhas

320.5-4j

by the action taken by the Senate hast year,
but before the close af the carnpaign, or bef ore election day, they let the niatter drop,
finding that there was no trouble ait ahl; and
they were located in city districts occupied
by artisans and labouring people.
A man in a constituency may have heard
sorne noise about this question, and he may
have seen the walis plastered with pictures
showing the leader of the Government standing with a big basket cantaining large quantities of money, ta be handed out to men où
reaching the age of 70, provided they will just
defeat tbis Tory party and return the Liberals
to power; but there is na evidence at ail,
that is worth considering, ta the effect that
the country voted on this Bill. I wili admit
that there was a littie noise about it here
and there, but I can refer you to other
counties where the managers say that this
question was neyer mentioned, but that the
issue was the tariff, or the constitutional question.
Passing f rom that aspect, I want ta point
-out that rny main objection ta this Bill is
the interférence of the Dominion Govemnment
with the provinces. Now, you have nine
provinces, and the extraordinary thing is that
the Bill is constructed upon the a.ssumptioeî
that aIl nine provincesl are ta corne in. It
rnight be worked ta scene extent if aIl the
provinces did came i, but if one or twa
provinces either cannot join, or will not, there
will arise problems which I defy any marn ta
work out. While the Dominion Government
may xnake an agreemnent with any province
separately, it is nat openi ta the Dominion
Goverriment ta make an agreement say,
between Ontaria and Quabec. The provinces
mnust be left to, them.sel-ves ta make their own
contracts. Now, the Bill practically uses force
in that respect-I need not say "practically,"
for it does. It means that though a province
for a particular reason declines ta participate,
the people of that province will be assessed
in part for what is paid by way af contribution ta a province which does corne in. For
instance, if British Columnbia cornes in, and
Nova Scotia gays it cannot do so, you would
have this state of thirigs, that Nova Scatia
would ha paying in part for the contribution
t-hat British Columbia would get. The same
would be true ail round. If Quebec remains
out, it will stiil have to support this achare,
while getting n'othing out of it.
The Province of Nova Scotia, for sorne
reason or other--and I wiIl not enter into the
details as to the why and the wheref<>re-ls
financing in its budget for a de6icit cd
$1,000,000. Let us assume that that province
dbtains ail that is aéked for in the report
that wihl be deait with ini another place onie af

SENATE
these days, namely, $870,000. That wiIl not
balance the budget. It is estimated, with
substantial accuracy, that if Nova Scotia
camne in under this Bill it would have to pay
sornething between $750,000 and $1,000,000. 1
have only once seen the charge on Nova
Seotia estimatcd at a lesser figure, narncly,
6500,000. The province of Nova Scotia siniply
cannot corne in. It now bas in force probably
every system of taxation that it can think of.
So the Bill is unfair in so far as it applies
to provinces which are in the position of
bcing either unable, or, for reasons of their
own, unwilling to participate in the scheme.
I do not know where this Parliamnent gets
its commission or its power to pass an Act
compelling the provinces to participate, or,
what is th.- sane thing, infliet.in-v apelt
indirectly on a province if it does not corne
in under a scheme of this kind. Therefore
we have to face the question of interference
with the province on the part of the Parliament of Canada.
Another objection I find in this Bill-and
it can probably be dealt with better in Cornmittee, when we are taking up the sections
one by one-is that it is a tremendous mixture. For instance, a man may be five years
in a province that has not corne under the
Act, and then he may move to a province
that is under the Act. The resuit is a complication th-at is not provided for here at aIl.
I can suppose cases of this kind, and when
we corne to deal with the sections I mean to
.ubmnit sorne of thern. Under this Bill a man
app]ying for a pension must have resided
five years in the province frorn which he
makes application: Suppose he is sixteen years
in one province and four years in another;
he cannot get a pension. You may say: "That
defect can be cured." I arn not sure that it
can. I do not want to detain the House;
I would like to finish by 6 o'clock; but my
main objections to the Bill are its interference
with the provinces and the fact that it is unworkable, owing to the political situation of
your nine provinces and your Dominion Government. Further, I do not like the other
feature of it, that it is a charitable affair,
and the sooner you get away frorn that sort
of thing and let the people be self-respecting
and pay their way, the better it will be for
Canada.
I tbink I have stated to you succinctly rny
objections to the Bill, and 1 cannot under
any circurnstances vote for it.

Hon, C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honeurable gentlemen, I dlaim the indulgence of this honourable leuse wbile 1 deal witb a matter
whicb of necessity will constrain me to lay
before the House a long series of figures. 1
shall du su because I consider this one of the
mnost serions questions than can engage public attention.

MARCH 17, 1927
The honeurable gentleman frem Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson), with the ability and
competency that everybody recognizes in him,
bas made a strong appeal te this Housm, and
through it te the press and te public opinion.
He bas, for two reasons, claimied justification
for his appeal. To one of these I do net
attach much practical importance. The first
reason given is that he felt bound te vindicate
a very respectable and useful clasm of our
population cf certain judgment passed upen
them some years age by Hon. Mr. Carveli.
1 do net intend te touch that part cf my
heneurable friend's speech, except te say that
the Latin proverb holds true: "De mortuis
nihil nisi bonum"ý-"Of the dead nothing but
praise should be heard."
But the ether part cf the bonourable gentleman's argument is much more serious and
practical. In a few words it amounts te
this: those that have ears te hear. let them
hear; if they do net hear let themn be responsible fer the consequences. At the present
tilue an investigatien inte railway rates is
taking place, and it is intimated that in the
fixing of new rates provision *must be muade
for wage increases. In other words, there
must be an increase in raîlway wages, or there
will be a atrike.
Henourable gentlemen, we have learned, te
our sorrew, that the railway enterprises of
this country are very &,osely rellated te the
life cf the people. In the first place, we own
more than one-haîf the mileage cf the railways---and geedness knows how dearly we
have paid for it; and in the second place-and
this is what interests me mest-that railways
are the arteries cf the nation through which
circulates its very life.bleod. I predict that
it will be a day of bitter suffering for the
whele nation when public opinion permits the
railway systerus of Canada te he crusbed
between the upper and the nether milîstones
of an increase in wages on one aide and a
decrease in rates on the ether.
No sooner had my hopourable friend fremn
Welland (Hon. 'Mr. Robertson) made bis
earnest plea and sounded bis warning than
an eche was heard in this Chamber: the
henourable member fer Aasiniboia (Hon. MT.
Turriff) rose in bis place and said in effeet:
"Those that have ears te hear, let them hear.
If there la not a decrease in railway rates, we
betide the nation!" I was reminded by bath
honourable gentlemen of a classical French
play called "Les Pl-aideurs "ý-The Pleadersby Racine. In that pl.ay there is erganized
on the stage a tribunal censistin-g cf the judge,
the lawyers fer each sîde, and the criminal,
but there still remnaîns one member of the
group who bas ne part. Se they turn te

103

him and ask, " What part are you going to
play?" And hie says: "I arn the audience1 amn ixe public you have fergotten. Now,
honourable gentlemen, will you allow me for
just a moment te play the part that has
been forgotten, that of the public, and will
you be the jury while I place before you a
few statistics? I apologize again for the
dryness of the subject, but I cannot answer
figures except with figures.
The first question thart I. would ask is this:
la it true thut the railway employees of t.his'
country are now labouring under a grave
injustice? In the next place, is it true that
in the past these saine employees have suffered a grave injustice?
Let me take the first peint. My honourable friend from Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has complained that these whom he
represents are not sufficiently renumerated.
May I caîl -the attention of this honourable
House to the wages, net the apparent wages,
but the real wages, paid to the three classes
of railway workers? If I may be allowed,
I will caîl the first class te which I shahl
eddress myself the privileged class. In doing
so I hope 1 may net insuit my henourable
colleague fromn Welland. In this class I include the train-moving classes: the conductors,
the trainmen, the engineers, the firemen, and
their helpers. The second class, those engaged
in the trades, I will caîl the middle class. The
third class, those engaged in ordinary labour,
Iwill caîl the proletariat.
Now let us take the first ciass. I must say
that I had censiderable difflculty in ascertainmng exactly what remuneration was paid members of that clasa. I will net say that there
is a conspiracy between the Labour Department and certain labour organizations--not at
all !-but mhen the Labour Department
compile their statisties it has very acant
consideration for peer laymen like myseif.
Indeed the wages of these classes are predicated on a certain mileage. For instance,
apparently you have a wage cf $4.27 a day.
But what is a -day? A day may 'be 100
miles. If at is a f reight crew that is referred
te, it is 100 miles if it -is a paasenger crew
it, is 150 miles; consequently there is considerable variations. But I was curieus te
learn whether there was not seme more
positive and exact way cf ascertaining the
ameunts earued by the privileged classes.
Upon inquiry what did I find? That the
railway statistics of Canada comprise two
pages shewing ail the classes of employees
in the railways, the total ameunt received
by each class, and the total number of men
in each class. I found, for instance, that there

104

SENATE

were so many conductors, and that altogether
they received a certain amount of money.
Therefore I divided the total amount of
money received by them by the number of
men in that class to determine exactly what
each man received per year.
Honourable gentlemen know that the railway statistics are based upon affidavits from
the officials of the railways. I found that
the average remuneration for passenger conductors was $2,611 per year, including men
who had been in that service for periods of
from one month to twenty years or more
which means. of course, that a conductor who
has been in the service for twenty years must
receive a great deal more than this amount.
Now let me run over the figures quickly.
Freight conductors receive an average cf
$2,527 a year; brakemen on passenger service,
$1,858; brakemen on freight service, $1,846;
baggagemen,
$1,972; passenger
engineers,
$3238. That is in each class the weighted
average, which is, I suppose, exceeded by
many of the employees. As engineers are
rated according to the weight of their locomotives-the heavier the locomotive the
greater the remuneration-some of them
must receive a good deal over $3,500. Freight
engineers receive on the average $2,831 a year.
Fireman's help, that is, the man who helps
the man firing the engine, is paid, in the
passenger service, $2,395 a year, and in the
freight service $1,933.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: The honourable
gentleman speaks of a fireman's help. Does
he not mean an engineer's helper?

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I will hand my
honourable friend the statistical book from
which I have taken this information. the
Statistics of Canada, and he can verify it
himself.
As you see, those are very remunerative
wages. Let me compare them with remuneration paid to people who in order to fit
themselves for their vocation have to go
through a long and expensive course of
education? Take for instance the Department
of Agriculture lecturers who have to go about
the country teaching people how to cultivate
the soil.
What do they get from this
country?
Such a lecturer is paid $2,400.
Take an entomologist, a man who must
possess certain qualifications, who must know
all about injurious insects and their destruetion in order that our crops may be protected

have here a long list taken from the Auditor
General's Report, and as I do not wish to
tire the House I will ask leave to have it
placed upon Hansard.

Many of these men, civil engineers, for

can enter upon their career.

Coming to our financial institutions, what
do I find?
As many honourable gentlemen
here who are directors of banks know very
weiJ, the branch managers of banks receive
salaries averaging about $2,500 a year. These
men have millions of dollars in thoir care,
and must exercise judgment in allowing
credit. They must possess very special qualifications. Nevertheless, all they get is $2,500.
I am not quarreling with what I cail the
privileged classes of railway em.ployees.
I
know they have heavy responMbilities-they
have our lives in their hands; but I think
that after the speech delivered by my honourable friend from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) it is proper that the public should
know what remuneration those men receive,

MARCH 17, 1927
as compared with the remuneration paid ta
what I might cail the .privileged class in other
callings of if e.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? The honourable gentleman has taken
into consideration différent classes of em,ployees in different branches of work a.nd
bas given us their average salaries. Has hie
made any research into the number of bours
of work -requisite in those different vocations
ta earn the amount stated in each case?
Hon. MT. BEAUTBIEN: I think I can dispel
any anxiety ais to that on the part of my
honourable friend. A day's work for railway
employees is eight heurs, or seven a.nd a 'haîf
heurs, and I think it will be adxnitted readily
that employece in osther vocations work at
least as long as that.
Hon. Mr.. ROBERTSON: I hesitate ta interrupt the honourable gentleman, but hie liae
quoted, and probably correctly, the average
earnings of men in railway train service, and
I desire ta assure hlm that if he will look at
the Industrial Cornmission's Report issued
last year hie will find that, on the average,
their hours of service greatly exeeed eight
heurs per day, that in many cases those men
are on the road for sixteen hours out of
twenty-four, and that the compensation ta
whioh lie lias referred ie for their total services, regardless of the number of hours
required, ta earn it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Certainly I understand that, and -if it were not so, the wagee
paid to those men wouid be ridiculously higli.
The distance from Ottawa ta Montreal le 116
miles,' I Vhink, It takes tVhree -heure for a
train to corne here and three hours ta go
back; that is six hours. Tliat mileage. is
oounted much more than a day's work; and,
remember, I have not spoken at ail of
overtime, as I do not desire or intend ta
toucli that. In six hours the raiilwaymian is
supposed ta have done mucli more than a
day's work.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I interrupt
my honourable friend for juist a moment? I
do not desire ta interrupt him, but I do desire
that lie sliould understand the facto. Using
the illustration thst lie lias just mentioned,
the three-hour run between Ottawa and
Montreal, it should be said that -the C. P. R.
starting point le over ln West Ottawa and the
engineer muet be on duty 45 minutes before
lie is due ta &eave. He muet move hie englue
around 'by Chaudiere Junction, or Hull, ta the
Union Station, and hie -is on duty probably
two hours before the departu-re of the train.

105

When lie reaches Montreal lie muet stand at
Windsor Station until the paesengero and
baggage are removed, and muet then back hie
train out ta the yards at Westmount, and
bring his engîne ta the rouudhouee. Sc these
duties make the trip consume twice the time
of the more rua, between Ottawa and
Montres,4. 1 hope my honourable friend does
not overlook these facto.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I take the word of
may honourable fniend for that, but I may
reply that the conductor is not in exactIy the
sarne position.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: He doas not get
as mudh money.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: He gete a very fat
incarne, accurding ta the figures I have just
cited.
The engineers are the strongest labour
union, 1 think, in the world. T-hey have
constantly refused ta loin the Federation of
Labour in the United States, and they stand
by themselves.
Now let us leave the privileged classes and
corne down ta the ordinary bourgeoisie, as we
may call them-the middle men, men of
different brades. Let us make a comparison
of the wages paid on the ailway, and those
paid elsewhere in similar occupations.
I
wanted ta ascertain whether it was true or
not that injustice was done ta railway
employees, and wliat did I find? May I
point out that railway workers are employed
mueh more steadily than other classes. For
instance a painýter ernployed by the C.P.R.,
painting cars in Monteeal, is empioyed practically ail the time, whereas an outside painter
in the open labour market lias oly seaisonal
employment. I bave taken the trades that
are ordinarily ernployed outside as well as
on the railways. Take carpenters: on the
railways they are paid 63.6 cents, say 64
cents, while those outside are paid a little
more-73 tents. 0f course there, le steady
emnployment in one case and only seasonal
employnent in the other. Painters get 66
cents on the railways, and exactly the saine
outside; thieTe is therefore an immense advantage for those on the railways. Machiniste
la railways get 73.6, or nearly 74 cents, while
those outside get 63.4; boiler makers, on
railways, 73.2, ou-tside 61 cents; blacksmiths,
on railways, 73.5, outside 61 cents; electrical
workers, on railways, 68.8 cents; outside, 76.8.
Outside labour in the case of electrtical
workers, appears to lie higlier.
I h-ave com'pu.ted ail these amounts by
taking the average of the wages paid in every
city mentioned ln the offciai statistics. There

SENATE
are 13 cities throughout Canada, and the man
who works in Vancouver gets very much more
than the man in Montreal. We have ten
men in Montreal as against one who works
in Vancouver, but I 'have made no difference;
Vancouver is counted as one unit, therefore
this whole calculation is again to the advantage of the railway man; they suffer no
injustice from the comparison.
What I can say, therefore, as to railway
workers of the middle classes is that they
are at least as well treated in the matter
of wages as the other trade workmen employed in Canada. There is no doubt of
that, and I think I am justified in saying
their position is much better.
But now Jet us take the labourers. There
is a great difference in the wages of these
men, and of course it is quite evident why
this should be so, for ordinary labour is nLot
easily formed into unions. Whether ordinary
labour is wanted or not depends on the
condition of the free market, and therefore
when a railway applies for ordinary labourers
and promises steady work during the whole
year, they offer 34 cents, but when labourers
are out in the free labour market, they get
higher wages, 42.5 cents, because they lose
a good deal of time.
My conclusion, therefore, regarding ail
three classes of labour on the railways is this.
The highest class is treatcd very generously;
the middle class is treated at least as well as,
and I think it is fair to say better than the
corresponding class in nther employment in
Canada; and if for ordinary labour the rate
shows a difference in favour of those not
employed on railways, it is because they do
not gt steady employnment.
Furthermore,
the railway labourerb canuot very well form
themselves into unions, and thus they often
]ose the opportunity of artificially maintaining their wages above the ordinary, reasonable market price.
My honourable friend has made a very
skilful plea. He has said that the increase
in railway wages has not kept pace with the
increase in the cost of living; that there
has always been a lagging bebind, so to speak.
of the railway wages, and that therefore, in
all justice, the railway men have a claim for
back pay of $346,000,000. It is ao heavy that
I think I had better call it a moral claim,
lest it might affect the credit of the railways.
Now let us see if that is quite right. There
is the apparent truth, but if we dig a little
deeper we get the real truth. Perhaps I should
not even call that statement the apparent
truth, for I have here a letter from the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics which conloin.

Mr.

IEAÀiE,.

tradicts it, and I intend to refer to very
different figures in a moment. This letter
dated Mareh 11, 1927, says that the cost of
living has increased in Canada from 1913 to
1926 from 100 to 155-55 points. It says,
further, that railway wages during the same
lapse of time have increased from 100 to 159.
I am going to place this letter on the table
for the information of my honourable friend,
but I do not think he will use it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
May I ask my
honourable friend if he would be good enough
to give the comparative figures as to the
same dates?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The letter refers
to the same dates exactly.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: That would not
be accurate, because the figure for the end
of 1926 was 158.9 for wages, and 157 for cost
of living.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I have further information to give concerning the cost of living
1913 level being taken as
'e
and wages.
100, the cost of living index figure for 1926,
So I am clear as to that

first figure.
On the same basis the index
of the wages for steam railway men was 159
in 1926. The source of this information is the
report on Wages and Hours of Labour in
Canada, 1920-26, page 4.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
friend will not find that figure.
If be looks
up that record ho will sec that it is 158.9 as
against 157.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
I will now put
a little problem to my honourable friend. Of
course he is always skilful, and I have done my
best to follow his example in a little computation which I have resorted to. He told us
that the railway employees in Canada, from
the president down to the lowest messenger,
were paid, 57.7 cents an hour, which was less
than the street sweepers of Toronto received.
That seems extraordinary, but let us verify it.

I took the statistics of steam railways of
Canada for 1924, the year which my honourable friend quoted, and I found that be was
right for that year. I found that the total
number of hours worked in 1924 by employees
of all classes was 415,773,205. Then I found
that the compensation had been $239,864,265.
I divided this by the other, and the result
corroborated my honourable friend. I doff my
hat to him. But now let him be generous
and come back with me to the first year for
whcl
information of this kind can be
obtained from the statistics, that is, 1917.
Unfortunately we have not the figures for
1914.

MARCH 17, 1927
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: They go bsek ta
1900.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I have not obtained
that information for 1914, though I did rny
best to gat it, but I have it for 1917. 1 arn
at a little disadvantage, but I do not mind.
Very weli, what have I found? That there
was in 1917 a total of 449,278,533 hours of
labour, and that the compensation was
$129,626,187. 1 divided one by the othar, and
reached the astounding conolusion that the
rate par bour was 28.7 cents, say 29 cents, as
against 58 cents in 1924-a diffeirance batwaen
the two years of no less than 101 par cent!
Thara is the truth, and we cannot gat away
from it, Let me tell my honourable friand,
further, that from 1914 to 1917 railway wages
had gone up 10 par cent; therefore the figure
o'f 101 par cent increa.se is 10 par cent less

of 1917. 1 leave it ta my honourable ýfriand
ta review those figures, because they turn al
the arguments against him.
Now, if what 1 have stated is true and there
is no doubt about it- what is the situation?
Ha says the railway wages lagged 23 points
behind the inicrease in the cost of living, but 1
Eind now that the incereaa in railway wages
exceeded the increase in cost of living by 25
points, and that the moral dlaimi which hae
sa.id the railway men liad against the railways
of this country for the trifiing sum of 8741,000,000, rmust therefore ba turned back against the
men for an amount excaeding that surn.

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: 1 amn referring to
the Department of Labour figures which shows
the cost of living to average about 155 in Canada.
Hon. Mr. ROBERT-SON: About that.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: But I arn going ta
be generous: I will make it 157. We have
plen-ty of leeway. Now, will my hon-ourable
friend be good enough to take the figures I
have quoted as ta the total compensation
and the total hours in the year which hie himself has mnentioned, namely, 1924? I suppose
hie will nlot deny that it establishes a rate
per man per hour of 57.7 cents.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Quite so.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Very well. Then
will hie bc kind enough ta make a similar
calculation for 1917, putting down the total
compensation paid in 1917 ta railway men,
$129,626,187, and dividing it by the total
numbar of hours of work, in the samne fair
way as hie bas done for 1924, and than will
hie tell me whether hie does not arrive at this
answer, the only correct one, that the average
wage per man par hour was 28.7 cents in
1917? Will the honourable gentlemian admit
that?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON-: I will admit it.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Very well. Therefore, honourable gentlemenHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But will my
honourable friend allow me ta qualify that
admission? It is quite true that that was
probably the hourly rate at that tirne, but
surely the honourable gentleman woulId agree
that 28 cents an hour in 1917 was a ridiculous
wage for the average railway employee in
Canada. My honourable friend is attempting
ta mix the two questions of wages and hours.
Prior ta 1918 the railway employaes in Canada
worked a ten-hour day. Since 1918 the day's
work has been 8 hours. Ail my computations
were on the basis of money earned, not upon
hours of service rendered. The question of
hours bas nothing ta do witb the earnings.
The money aotually earned and received was
correctly quotad, and I arn sure that my
honourable friend can reacb no other conclusion than that in the figures placed on the
record st week the truth was fully told.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Then I must be
vary dense. I have taken my honourable
friend a exact figures, and I now invite him
ta correct me if I -arn wrong. Let him. take
down the figures, make the calculations and
ascertain the rate of wages per man per lieur
in bath 1917 and 1924. When the rates are

108

SENATE

ascertained in that way the bonourable gentleman cannot deniy and I maintain that it 15
a perfectly fa.ir way to determine the inorease
in the average hourly wage from tbe one
year to the other. It is no answer to tell
me, "Yes, but our men do flot now work
10 hours a day." That mnay be so, but surely
in determining wbat a man earns you take
bis total remuneration and divide that by
the total number of heurs. In this case it is
quite true that he works shorter bours, but
that makes no difference, because I take the
average arnount earned per man per hour.
Hon. Mr. IROBERTSON: Tbat bas nothing
to do witb the final resuit. It is tbe carnings
that count, nlot tbe bours tbat tbe einployee
works.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I do not understand
exactly wbat my honourable friend is drivinat. After ail, 1 arn quite sincere, and I want
to be corrented if I arn in error. I know tbat
tbis is A., process used by tbe statisticians
of Canada in1 every case. How do tbey determine, for instance, bow mucb a carpenter
earns in Montreal, Quebec, Winnipeg, or any
otber city? They tako tbe number of hours
that be works and the wages that, be receives
in a day, a montb, or a year. I bave used
exactly tbe same metbod in both cases and I
find, on comparing the hourly remuneration
per man in 1917 witb tbat of 192,4, there is an
increase of 101 per cent. Remember, tbe
McAdoo award, wbicb practically strangled
ail our railways at the time and was a real
scandaI, giving outrageous increases to certain
mon witbout any justification. Tbe bonourable gentleman knows tbat as weII as I do.
Mon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Will my bonourable friend agrce that the MeAdoo award was
adopted by Canadian railways voluntarily and
was nex or requosted by the employees?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Certainly, I admit
tbat; and I wilI go further and say t'bat tbe
railwavs could do notbing- but adopt it. Tbey
were obliged to do so. May I be allowed to
illustrate tbat? A man was relating tbat once,
as be was going up tbe Nule to Assuan, be saw
a turtle emerge from the river, followed by a
crocodile. He said: "You know, it was very
interesting to watcb the turtle. Sbe went as
fast as sbe could along tbe shore and tben sbe
climbed a troc." His friend said: "Wbat? A
turtie cannot climb a tree." "No", he replied,
"but tbis one had to." Tbe railways bad to.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I sbould be interested in knowing wby, because tbey were
neyer asked to, do so.

EB

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: WeIl, there are
metbods by wbicb powerful organizations like
those to wbich the railwaymen belong may
verýy easily signify tbeir intentions, and tbe
sooner tbat is understood, the botter. However, I wiIl deal a little later witb that phase
of tbe subjeet. I must burry on.
I arn asking my bonourable frîend to be
gond enough, before answering tbese arguments of mine, to verify tbe figures and tell
me wbetber I arn wrong or not. I want him
to do tbat.
Tbe second point brougbt up was tbat tbe
increase in wages of railway empînyces bad
fallen bebind the increase in wages in ail otber
occuipationsq. I think tbat tbe argument wvbich
I bav e just presented dennstrates that tbc
increase of railway wages kept abead of the
ineroeap in otbpr wages, for tho increase in tbe

wvages ni railwaymen was more tban 101 per
cent, wbo*reas tbe average incroaso in ail other
xvages in Canada was 75.9.
Tberefore,
reverting to the $740,000,000 to wbicb tbe railwaymen are supposed to bave a moral claim,
mv bonourable' friond can see that sucb a
dlaim would mucb more equitably bclong to
otber workmen becauso tbeir wages bave
increased 26 points legs tban tbe wages of
railway empioyees. So tbe sboe is on tbe
otber foot.
Another contention on wbicb great stress
bas been laid is tbat raiiwaymon in Canada
shouid be paid tbe same wages as the railwaymon in tbe United States. My honourable
fricnd has admitted that tbere is a difference
in conditions bet.ween tbe two countries and
tbat this differenco must be taken into consideration. We know wbat a man in a certain
trade can get for an honest day's work in Canada as compared with what he wouid get in
tbe United States. I take tbe ye:ar 1924,
because tbat was the year selected by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson),
and I find tbat ýcarpenters earned 73 cents an
bour in Canada, and that in the United
States tboy earned $1.16, or over 50 per cent
more; I find tbat painters in Canada were
paid 68.3 cents, wbiie in tbo United States
they received $1.16 an bour, or 60 per cent
more; I find tbat machinists were paid 63
cents an hour in Canada, and 87 cents an
bour in the United States, or 40 per cent
more; I finil tbat blacksmitbs in Canada weto
paid 64 cents an bour, while in tbe United
States they were paid 95 cents an hour, or
over 50 per cent more; and finaliy, I find
that bouler makers in Canada recoived 61
cents an bour, w'biie in the United States they
recpived 84.1 cents an bour, or 40 per cent
more. So, if you take tbe weighted wage

MARCH 17, 1927
average of ail those trades, you 'wil find that
the United States figures are about 50 per
cent in advance of those for Canada.
Now, what i-s the difference between railway wages in the UJnited States and railway
wages in Canada?
When *my honourable
friend dlaims that railway empioyees are paid
57 cents an hour, he makes no distinction
regarding the three classes of which I have
spoken. I think it will be admitted that
the privileged classes of railway employees
in both countries are about equally remunerated. But let us say that there is a maximum
difference of 10 per cent. I do not think it is
that much. I think it is true that certain of
those employees, but not ail, are paid about
7 or 8 per cent less.
We have seen what artisans are paid in the
'United States and what they are paid in
Canada. Is that fair? I submit that it is
flot; I say those railway employees should
be paid a wage governed by the general
economic conditions of Canada, like the rest
of labour remuneration. They shou*ld follow
the law of supply and demand. Why does
a man who earns his living at a trade get
50 per cent less for his labour in Canada
than he would in the United States? We
know, mu-eh to our dissatisfaction, that that
is the fact~ because by resson of it many of
our eidren have gone across the line. But
why, honourable gentlemen, should this normal
law of supply and demand be thrust aside for
those privileged employees? Is it beonuse a
man is an engineer or a conductor or a telegrapher? No. The reason is very simple, and
in itself it constitutes a very serious problem
for Canada. It is because the labour unions
very strongly entrenched in the United States,
overlapping into Canada, are strong enough
to impose their will even upon such
tremendous organizations as our railways. I
ask you, honourable gentlemen~, iis it fair that
the wages these men receive should be artificially maintaîned by the strength of foreîgn
unions?
Possibly we may have to seek some remedy
against the imposition of unjustified rates,
'because wily nilly we cannot get away from
the conditions under which. we live. %è are
a young country; we are establishing the
nation, and in what we pay as weJll as in
'what we earn, we cannot compete with such
a tremendous country as the United States.
The difference between the remuneration in
one country as tompared with the other for

this class of labour and in fact for labour
generally is enormous. Why should it be so
much less for 'the privileged classes of railway exnployees in Canada? Now is the time,
during the building up of Canada, for those
who are patriotic to f ollow the law imposed
upon them by national conditions, and to
accept reasonable remuneration commensurate
with these conditions, otherwise, some day
corrective mensures will have to be taken.
Now, honourable gentlemen, just one last
word. 1 want to ask my honourable friend
from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff) to be
good enough to bear with me while I quote
a- few figures. The very life of the railways
is at stake, caught between the two relentiess
j aws of the pincers--a decrease in railway
rates, and an increase in railway wages.
Has the western farmer a genuine right to
coniplain? Let me put before you as quickly
as I can certain facts. The population of
Canada is 6,650,000 in the East, and 2,701,600
in the West. In the Eust 'theïre are 15,187
miles of railway, and in the West 18,731 miles.
The freight revenue of the East, notwithstanding its lessr mileage, is $458,410,461; whiie
that of the West is $38,831103. The revenue
per mile of line in the East is 82,085; in the
West it is 81,596. The net revenue per tonmile in the East is 81.17; in the West, 80
cents. From these figures it is evident that
our railways are making much lesa profit in
the West than they are in the East.
The snext question is: are the rates charged
by the railway companies for the transportation of wheat excessive? Firet of all, what is
the total tonnage carried? In 192 the total
was 109,850,925 tons, of which 11,965,782 tons
were wheat. If you deduet from that 10
per cent for wheat grown in the East, upon
which no reduction in rates is asked, you
have 10,768,204 tons of wheat remaining as
against a total of 109,850,925 tons. That shows
the relative importance of western wheat in
the matter of transportation.
What are the rates? I find that on an
average run of between 700 and 1,200 miles
-from Regina, Saskatoon, or Edmonton, to
Fort William or Port Arthur-the rate per
bushel par mile in Canada is one and onehaîf cents, as against an average rate in the
United States of three cents. Another comparison with the Argentine, whera, of course,
the runs are short, appears in the comnputation
I have in my hand.

This comparison of rates in Canada and in

and that therefore it is impossible for us to
go any lower.

SOLDIER SETTLEMENT BILL
FU-RTHELR

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE. AND
REPORTI)

The Sonate again went into Committee on
Bill 61, an Act to amend the Soldier Settlement Act.
Hon. Mr. Stanfield in the Chair.
Honourabh
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:
gentlemen, at the last sitting we considered
all of this Bill except paragraphs (e) and (i).

Hon. W. B. ROSS:

We carried paragraph

There was just a little

confusion about the lettering of paragraphs (h)
The honourable member for De
and (i).
Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique) moved an
amendment to paragraph (h), which was
adopted. That is all right. That should go
in as paragraph (i), and the present paragraph (i) should become paragraph (j).
Hon. Mr. OOPP: I understood that paragraph (h) was stricken out altogether and
another paragraph substituted for it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is the error that
was made. Paragraph (h) will have to be
amended, and thon the amendment of the
honourable gentleman frem De Salaberry
(Hon. Mr. Béique) will have to go in as
pargaraph (i). Paragraph (h) as it stands in
the Bill relates to the Committee, referred to
in section (e), for which we substituted the
Exchequer Court. So paragraph (h) will have
to be amended to correspond with paragraph
(e) as amended.

MARCH 17, 1927
Hon, Mr. COPP: 1 understood that paragrapli (h) was strieken out altogether and a
new paragraph su'bstituted for it.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: That was the mistake.
Paragraph (h) haz to go back, as amended.
Then the amendaient cornes in as (i) and the
present subsection (j) becomes (j); then the
Bill is complete.
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND:
Yesterday 1
hnd two questions put to me. One was by
the honourable gentleman firom Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach), who wanted to know
what would -be the action of the E'chequer
Court in ,proceeding Vo inquire into the facts
of an appeal which would be lad before it.
I believe amendaients were moved yesterday
allo-wing regulations to be made which will
govern the Exchequer Court. As my attention
bas been drawn Vo a clause of the Soldier
Settiement Act, s-etion 58 of chapter 71, I
wiIl not move the third reading of this Bill
to-day, and after we corne eut of committee
and before taking the third reading, we can
see if the amendaients which. have been made
overlap section 58.
When the Soldier Settiement Bull was
enacted it gave power to the Department to
purohase ]and, and even gave it rights of
expropriation, and all-owed the Exehequer
Court to deal with such matters. It went
further, and in clause 58, said:
If the judge of the Exchequer Court shahl so
request, the Governor in Council may, as and
when requested. appoint one or more persona,
qualified for appointmnent as judges of the Exchequer Court, to be judges ad hoc of such
court for the purpose of assistjnq in the performance of the duties whîch are imposed upon
such Court by this Act.
If the Bill as amended by the Senate becornes Iaw, this section will apply to the proceedings of revaluationand will give elasticity
to the Exchiequer Court nxerely through a
request to the Governor ln Council, and allow
it to call f or help from various parts of the
country for examination of claims, the receivîng of evidence, and the reporting to the

111

Hon. Mr. DAN1XJRAND:
But -we shail
have opportunity Vo examine into that between
the committee stage and the third reading.
That is the reason I have read the section,
se that we may examine it ln relation to the
amendments which were proposed yesterday.
On paragraph (c) reconsidered-how
preciation shaîl be computed:

de-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I believe that subsection (c) was
suspended in order to allow me to give an
explanation to the honourable gentleman from
Ncw Westminster <Hon. Mr. Taylor). My
memory did flot carry me back Vo the discussA~ whlch took place last ycar on this
question, and 1 called for some information
from the Department. Here is the answer
which I got from John Barnett, the Chairman of the Soldier Settiement Board:

The section in the Bill which was questioned
by Senator Taylor is the last part of subsection
(c), in which it states that the actual sale

price of land shaîl net be deemed to be greater
than the maximum amount which the Board
could advance for land under Section 16 of The
Soldier Settlement Act.
Section 16 of The Soldier Settlement Act provided that the maximum amount which the
Board could seil any land to a settier at was
$5,000. The price at which land was sold Vo a
settier is, of course, set out in an agreement
for sale which recites the total purchase price
and credits to the settler as an initial payment
whatever initial payment he made to the Board,
the balance of the purchase price being spread
over twenty-five years. If the total purchase
price w-as more than $5,000, then the settler
must have paid a large initial deposit himself.
In such cases no consideration would be given
to that extra large initial payment which hie
made hiinself, but in the ordinary cases, where
the total purchase price did not exceed $5,000,
revaluation would be based on that price, which
would, of course, include any initial payment
that he made and, therefore, the settler would
not be prejudiced in revaluation se f ar as his
initial payment is conccrned.
Two illustrations may make the matter clear.
We will suppose that a settler bought fromn us
a piece of land for $4,000, on which hie paid
$400 himself. The agreement for sale from the
Board to him would state the purchase price
as $4,000. It would acknowledge receipt of an
Exchequer Court.

that the balance

did so, and it now transpires on revaluation
that his land was not worth $6,000, but only
worth $4,500, the only revaluation that hie
could gct under the Bill would be the differenCe between $4,500, its presenit value, and
$5OOO. which is the mnaximum that the Board
had any riglit to advance under Section 16 of
The Soldier Settiement Act.
These two illustrations should mnake it clear
how the section should work ont.

noon that representations had neyer been delivered to him, but in the evening lie corrected that and said, in effect, that they had
been delivered to him *by an officer of his
Department. But the fact that he added
nothing ta that indicated that no consideration
had been given up to the 4th of Mardi.« Two
weeks have passed since then, and there
has been opportunity during tis time to give
consideration to. those important representations. That is why 1 raised the question
just now.
In effect. the Legion requested the Government flot to proceed with this Bill in the
shape in which it left Parliament last year.
They represented that the proceedings would
be very tedjous and cost-ly, very unsatisfying, and would nlot settie the grievances under
which the sýoldier settlers of Canada were
labouring. l'le reasans for those statements
were set out in very great detail, and I will
not detain the House hy attempting ta retell them. but would refer members ta HansaTd of the date mentioned. The principal
request made was that there should be no
attempt at revaluation as proposed, but instead that there should be a complete remission of interest ta the soldier.
They
pointed out the impossibility of soldiers paying for their lands out of the profits of operation, and gave authority for the statement
that nothing of the kînd had ever been accomplished in Canada. They referred very
feelingly ta the number of years of gap ia
the lives of those soldiers, the labour that
they had put -into this sehemne in their endeavours ta make good on the land for seven
Or eight years. They urged upon the Government in the strongest possible way ta reieve these men before it is tao late-before
they are compel'led ta abandon the land in
despair-~by making such an arrangement as
they suggested. I must express my disappointmient as an ex-member of the forces and
one of those interested in the work of the
League, that when they have taken the
trouble ta organize, as they have done, ta
settIe their own differences and amalgamate
s0 many of their former associations into ana
big union under sane and reasonable auspices.
with officers of the highest standing at the
head of it, and after they have made representations of this kind ta the Government-a

lately strengthened by the addition of a gailant soldier as Minîster of National Defence
-that a measure repugnant ta Roldiers as a
body thraughaut Canada is to be passed
through bath Houses of Parliament without
the appeal af the Legion having been considered. I would suggest that even at this

late date it is worth while for the Government in Counoil ta conside-r the representatians of the Legion before this Bill is finally
passed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Do I understand that the Legion. suggested that instead
of revaluing the land of the soldiers who are
in arrear in their payments, the amounits due
by those soldiers abould be completdy remitted ta them?
Han. Mr. TAYLOR: Oh, no; that -the whole
interest should be waived-that the allowance
made ta the saldiers should be a complete remission af interest.
We have already remitted interest from tirne ta time. There was
a ga-p of Vhree or four years in the interest
so remitted.
But they point ta the impassibility of arriving at any satisfactory conclusion
in the way af revaluation of the land, and they
refer to the example of the Gavernmfents that
have waived înterest af the national debt or
fixed it at a nominal figure. They say that
a measure of justice ail around. would, be done
by remission of the interest at preeent being
charged to the soldiers for the money that
they owe on their land.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does the honourable gentleman imply by Vhat statement
that the Legion would be satisfied if interest
were remitted and the capital were not reduced?
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: They ask for bath,
but in the discussion it was made very plain
that they would be satisfied if the interest
were remitted. Here is the text of the request.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: What clause are we
digeussing, 'Mr. Chairman?
Han. Mr. TAYLOR: We are discussing the
report on the Bill.
I am calling attention
ta the desfrability of considering the representations made by the Canadian Legion before
we repart the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Can we not take
that on the third, reading?
Hon. MT. TAYLOR: This is the proper
time ta discuss it.
I bave almost finished
anyhow. I hope it is not desired ta shut off
the representations.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

No, no.

There is a paragraph (e), but it has been incorrectly copied here and does not make sense
as copied.
All I can say
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
is this, that I believe that the Bill which is
before us will largely cover the desires of
the Legion as expressed in that resolution.
It must not be forgotten that last year a
rather large proportion-an astounding proportion-of the soldiers who answered the
inquiry declared that they were satisfied with
their purchaso and did not intend to apply
for a revision. Now, the Department knows
each case and, as we heard in Committee last
year, is ready to examine in a fair and equitable spirit the whole situation and afford
relef in indiviidual cases. We must not forget, cither, that 400,000 or 500,000 soldiors
The
were mobilized and went overseas.
soldiers who were settled upon the land were,
I consider, a privileged class, for they obtained credit from a very liberal and paternal
banker, the Government of Canada. Since
advancing that money we have shown by our
actions in two pieces of legislation our desire
to do the fair thing. The present legislation
allows a review of each case in a generous
spirit for the purpose of ascertaining the actual market value of the land. If a foreclosure were made, or if the settler abandoned the land, it would be necessary to find
a purchaser to whom that piece of property
I believe that on
could be transferred.
examining this legislation the soldiers will
find in it all the remedies that they are seeking by their resolution. It is very easy to
make a sweeping demand or request covering thousands of cases, but the Department,
Hon.

Mr. TAYLOR.

or the Board established for the handling
of these matters, knows each case and I am
convinced that under the legislation which
we are now passing the soldiers who for
some cause or other are in arrear will be
treated in a most equitable manner. They
have no legal claim. If they had applied to
a banker and bought property they would
now be facing the stern right of the banker
to claim every dollar he advanced. The
soldiers bave had the advantage of obtaining
help from the Government. We know that
they are being treated fairly, and we all desire
that they should be dealt with most liberally.
Thte Hon. the CHAIR.MAN:
port the Bill as amended?

Shall I re-

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Just before you
do that, I think it would be proper to observe, in reply to a remark by my honourable
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Taylor), that the Canadian Legion is not the
one big union which he says it is. It is a
very influential soldier body, but it by no
means embraces all the soldiers' organizations
there are. As I happen to be the head of
one organization which is not in the Legion,
I wouild like to make that fact clcar.
With respect to the resolution to which
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Taylor) has
referred, I could not agree to the recommendations myself. Firt of al], it ures that al
interest be rormittcd and that aill interest paid
There you
be applied on purchase price.
hAve no removal of the inequalities that exist
between man and man, and proposition and
proposition. They are just where they were
before. You would be reduciog the interest
in the case of a man who was perfectly satisfied with the price that he paid. Further, it
it recommended that there should be an allround reduction of 25 per cent. There again
you leave the inequalities previously existing;
there again you have a man getting 25 per
cent reduction who may be entitled to more,
and you have another settler getting 25 per
cent reduction though he has claimed no reduction at all.
Those were thc two principal recommendations, and neither of ther appealed to me
as an equitable solution of the difficulty.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: With all due deference to the gallant soldier who has just
spoken, I do not think be has given any
reasons why the representations of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service
League should not be considered by the Government in connection with a Bill of this

MARCH 17, 1927
kind. I have very great respect for the
Canadian Legion, who represent the mass of
the soldiers of Canada and who are in very
great earnest in the work that they are attempting to do for the soldier settlers.
Hon. Mr. GREISBACH: I join with my
honourable and gallant friend in his condemnation of the honourable leader of the Government for not having consulted Vhis body.
I entirely associate myself with the honourable and gallant gentleiLian from New Westminster.
The Bill was reported, as amended.

What is the principle of the Diil,

Hon. Mr. DEIQUE: The patent envers an
invention of considerable importance; it is
for the manufactnre of cement be.ams for
bnildings. flnring the war there was no cali
for the goods, and the patent wvas allowed to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I have been asked by an honourable member of the Senate who happens to be
absent to have the second reading of this Bill
postponrd until to-morrow.
Right Hon. Sir G EORIGE E. FOSTER: If
honourable gentlemen would permit me a
word, I woul'd like to call the attention of the
honouraýble leader to this Bill.
It is an
important' measure.
Evidently there are
grievances which exist, and which are pretty
weil founded, on account of certain things
which have happened; at the samne time it
fooks very much like a general jubilee remission. of debts, put practically in the hands
of the Department itself, although to be done
through the Governor in Council.
I think we shahl require a pretty fûIi explanation of this Bill before it can pass. It
looks hike giving the Department unliinited
pcwer.
The âmounts involved may noît be
large, or they may aggregate mil-lions; we do
not know. It is a pretty wide power to put
practitally in the bande of a Department.

SENATE

118

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Of course it is
quite natural that one should have more confidence in himself than in his neighbour, and
I do not intend to recriminate when I mention
the fact that the right honourable gentleman
showed more confidence in himself in 1918
than he seems to show in the present Minister
of the Interior. In 1918 he and his colleagues
passed an Order in Council giving to the
Department the very saine powers under the
War-time Measures Act, and those powers
remained in effect until that measure was
repealed.
I think my right honourable friend will find
that the causes which justified the Order in
Council which he passed in 1918 still exist, and
In reading this small
in aggravated form.
Bill I can sce the very wide powers given to
the Department. I have made it my duty
Io read the whole debate that took place elsewhere; so I am fairly conversant with the situation.
In accordance with the wish of the honourable gentleman from Alberta, who happens to
be absent, I am willing to have the second
reading of the Bill postponed until to-morrow.
The order stands.
EXCISE BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 119, an
Act to amend the Excise Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-"vessel"; "vehicle":
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: We passed
rapidly over this Bill at the second reading,
but I was going to suggest a proposition for
the Government to consider. Here is a Bill
with many amendments, five or six, indicated
in the margin, and we have many other Acts
in which there are a large number of amendments shown in the same way. It is difficult
for anybody but a lawyer who has the statute
books at hand to trace these amendments,
and the ordinary layman has not access to
those books. Even a lawyer would be put
to a great deal of trouble to find the references.
I do not know any reason why we should
not in Parliament here revise and bring up
to date for the very great convenience of the
public, important Acts which have been frequently amended. This can be done, and it
has been in many places. I know it has
been done in the Province of Saskatchewan.
There are certain Acts, like the Municipal

Act, which are subject to annual change.
Every new man who gets into the Legislature
thinks he can improve the Municipal Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That tendency is
not confined to Saskatchewan.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No; I fear it is
universal. But what the Legislature of that
province has done is to bring many public
Acts of that kind up to date by codifying
them. The codification ,is a great convenience.
I am not suggesting a mere consolidation of
Acts for the use of departmental officiale.
When the ten-year revision comes in, of
course, the statutes will be brought up to
date. My suggestion would not apply to a
verv large number, but it would apply to
those Acts that are being constantly amended
and are subjects of trouble and inconvenience
when reference to them is necessary.
I believe this suggestion to be wholly
feasible, for the plan has been carried out in
the Province of Saskatchewan, and in other
places as well.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Would the honourable gentleman inform us whether, in the
annual volume of statutes, the whole Act
as anended is reproduced? Is that what is
done every year in the printing of the
statutes?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No, that is not
donc every year.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When they are
printed?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Take the Excise
Act as an examiple: we would have that Act
brought up to date, and this would be a very
great convenence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: In the statutes?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: In the statutes.
I notice that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the various Departments, for their own convenience and that of their officers keep the
Acts up te date by incorporating the amendments.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Those are office
conveniences.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I find the plan
very useful when I have to refer to some
amendment, and the honourable gentleman
is right in believing that the public would
find it as convenient.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Yes, but that
office consolidation of which I speak is only
for office purposes; it does not reah the
general public at all.

whole Act; but the suggestion should be

It would 'be a great convenience to have the

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: 1 did not
suggest that an Act should ho printed as
amended every year. We would leave the
matter of reprinting to the discretion of the
officer. When un Act is amended frequ'ently,
or when, with its amendments, it bas become
troublesome, or cumbersome, even if it should
be a lengthy Act, there is a great advantage
in having it reprinted. I know the method

120

SENATE

Hon. W. B. ROSS: But look at the clause
that is being amended or struck out. Subsection 3 of section 180 now reads as follows:
[n every prosecntion under this Act the certificate of analysis of a departmental analyst
or of a provincial analyst shall be accepted as
prima facie evidence of the alcoholic content
of any beer, wash or sprits...
What I do net understand is why there
should be a departure from the language of
the section that is struck out-a change from
"prima facie evidence" to "evidence."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The other night
in regard to a clause very similar to this, we
inserted the words, "prima facie." I suggest
that those words should be put into this
clause. I thoroughly agree with my honourable friend that in this case the same
words shouild be interpolated.
Hon. W. B. R'SS: If it means what the
honourable leader says, there can bo no question of argument about putting in the words
"prima facie."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I would rather
that the clause bc suspended, se that I may
consult the Department before accepting the
amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOIRT:
The danger in
these cases is that an ordinary magistrate
reading this subsection as it is printed here
would accept the certificate as final and conplete evidence, and not allow cross-examination even if the analyst were produced.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes; and it is worse than
that. You could point out to a magistrate
that we struck out the words "prima facie" in
the old Act and substituted something, and
that it was not done for nothing; it was done
to make the evidence conclusive.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Exactly.

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Also the fact that in
certain statutes the words "prima facie
evidence" are used, and in other cases they are
not, and there is a difference in interpretation.
Section Il stands.
On section 12, new section 185-Penalties
for sale of spirits unlawfully manufactured:
Hon. W. B. ROSS: That is a section that
I think we ought to study pretty carefully.
There is a part of it which, so far as I am
concerned, is quite unexceptionable. It mentions "every person who sells or offers for
sale," and se on. If such a person is dealt
with under the Act, I have no objection to
that. Then the clause reads:
-or
who purchases, or has in his possession any
spirits unlawfully manufactured or imported,
Hon

Mr. DANDURAND.

whether the owner thereof or not, without lawfut excuse, the proof of which shall be on the
person accused, is guilty of an indictable offence.
Well, a man may buy spirits that have been
unlawfully imported or unlawfully manufacturedHon. Mr. STANFIELD:
be given him.

Or a bottle may

Hon. Mr. ROSS: -or, as my honourable
friend says, a bottle may be given him, and
he becomes subject te this frightful penalty
of $2,000, when as a matter of fact he may
be really innocent. I have been told of one
case, and I believe there are others, in which
this occurs. Say A and B have a quarrel.
B gets a case of whisky or gin, or some other
kind of alcuhol, and deposits it in an outbouse belonging te A, and then informs the
Excise authorities that if they go to this
place they will find liquor there. They go,
and this poor wretch is put on trial and is
held guilty. This clause could be used as a
great instrument of tyranny and it opens up

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Is there any

The word is mentioneçl in that section.
Hon. Mr. ROSS:

There must be.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I rise mcrely to
to an illustration of the argument made

just now. Take the case of stolen goods. If
I remember rightly, the Code requires knowledge on the part of one who deals in stoien
goods. At the time he sells or bargains in
these stolen goods he must know that they
have been stolen. Applying the same reasoning te this case, I think there is similar necessity for providing a clause such as my honourable friend suggests.

posed for an offence of that kind is, I think,
simply outrageous. I cannot conceive of any
pemsn asking for such a thing. " Every person who has in lis possession any spirits unlawfully manufactured " is liable te the
penalty. H1ow is a person to teli whether the
spirits were manufactured unlawfully or not?
You may be out in some part of the country
and somnebody may give you, say, haif a pint
of liquor, and you may take that home.
The penalty for that is sa great that it does
not seem to be based on any administration
of law that 1 have ever known of. Even if
s. persan purchased the spirits that hie has

How many thousands of -persons in this

Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND: My honourable
friend has not ta a.pply the Act. He does not
encounter daily the difficulties with which the
officers of the Department have to cope. Now,
what is laîv at present on the Statute Book?
It says:

the word "knowing."

Now we are dealing with the manufacture

and sale of spirits unlawfully manufactured.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Why are the words
'knowing them ta have been" lef t out?
The reason is
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
that it is very difficult for the prasecution to
establish the fact of that knowledge. Now,

what is the amendment? The new section
reads:

The anus will be upon the persan who is

hie will have to explain how they corne to be
there. I do not believe that this section is
ta he applied ta one who is found in possessian of a pint of whiskey. Wc are dealing with the sale of unlawfully manufactured
spirits, and it seems ta me that the accused
shauld nat find it very difficult to justify
himself under this clause. He is bound to
justify himself, however, and, as the penalty
is increased from M50ta $2,000, it should
act as a deterrant ta thase who venture
on the illegal manufacture of spirits. Within
the last month two large stills, apparently
manufacturing for general consumaption, were

Han. W. B. ROSS: I wauld suggest to the

185 into two sections, the first dealing with

the persan who selîs or offers for sale, and
i mpasing a penalty of $2,000, as it is in the
Bill, and the other dealing with the man wba
happens ta have liquor in his possession.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Or the purchaser.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes; the man who
buys, or who bais in hie possession. That
man is on an entirely different footing fromn
the man who sets -up machinery for the manufacture of alcohol. In some sections of the
country you have virtually a reign of terror
under the law as it stands.
Hon. Mr. DANDIJRAND: What does my
honourahle friend say as ta the man who is
carrying on the wholcsale distribution of
those spirits?

SENATE
Hon. W. B. ROSS:

I would go after him

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He would be
a purchaser, not a manufacturer.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: He is a dealer
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, that man would be
dealing.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: He would have
it in his possession at least.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is all very well to
provide for the enforcement of the law, bu
we have to be careful that we do not go too
far and do more injustice than good. It reminds me of the man who wanted to kill the
rats, and set fire to his barn-a rather costly
way of getting rid of the rats. I think that
this is rather extreme legislation, and that
every demand can be satisfied by breaking up
this section and treating these classes of persons on a different footing.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I would suggest an addition soimewhat to this effect: "Provided that
if the acetuaîd is not a dealer in spirits the
indictnent shall be authorized by the Attorney General." That would close the door to

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If it is proper
to draw a line between the dealer and the
ordinary consumer, would not the honourable
gentleman make the penalty less for the man
who is not a dealer?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I think the best remedy is to demand the authorization of the
Attorney Ceneral; then persons whom it is
not really intended to reach by the Act would
not be prosecuted.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I quite agree with a

good deal that the honourable leader (Hon
Mr. Dandurand) bas said, but I recall a case
in which a man was found with a pint of whikey and was hailed before a court. Under this
clause, even if he were innocent as a child,
he would be liable to a very stiff penalty. All
I want to guard against is such a case as that.

of spirits that

some neighbour has taken to him, and someone who bas some grudge against him may inform on him, and he may be liable to long
imprisonment and a very heavy fine. Already
there have been cases of that kind. Surely
we cannot afford to pass legislation that will
put the people of this country in such a position.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is so much the worse
now in that you are extending the jurisdiction
of justices of the peace. In country districts
where there may be local quarrels or local
prejudices, a man who wants to injure another
can deposit some alcohol in an outhouse belonging to that other man and inform on him,
and he will be brought before a justice of the
peace and fined $2,000. It is worse than
Turkey or Russia.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is absolutely
contrary to the spirit which has dominated
the criminal legislation of England and of
this country. One principle of English law
that I am always sorry to sec departed from
in any way is that a man is innocent until
he is proven guilty. That principle has stood
the test of time. Now you are implying that
flie man is cuilty whether he knows or whether
lie does not know that the liquor in his possession is unlawfully manufactured or imported. Such a presumption is absolutely
subversive of, and goes to the very root of
English criminal law. I do not know why we
should break down a safeguard and destroy
a right that bas always been granted to the
subject in all British countries, in order to
impose a few fines or make sure of a few
penalties, or to prevent some people from
manufacturing or drinking good whiskey. It
seems to me that the remedy is far worse
than the disease.
Hon. Mr. BEIQTJE: I think the honourable gentleman will find that the principle
of this clause bas already been adopted in a
number of different Acts, and bas been acted
on for many years.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That makes it all
the worse.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend will not argue that we cannot vary the
general principle. It bas been varied, and
necessarily so. Under the criminal law, there
are numerous cases in which the accused must
justify his action.
Otherwise it would be
impossible to establish his guilt. He is guilty
of the fact-the simple fact of having in his
possession--and he must explain that fact. A
man having spurious bank notes in his possession must explain and justify his posession
of them.

Such a requirement would be a guarantee

Riglit ýHan. Sir GEORGE E. F-OSTER: I
also would like to suggest to the honourabie
gentleman who bas charge of this Bill (Hon.
Mr. Dandurand) that when we take up these
sections again he should be prepared with the
specific reasons why this legislation has been
put before us in its present shape. It is quite
possible for us to run away from what is an
actual neeessity; it is possible that our extreme
observation of the rights I the individual
may incline us to open 'the door to great
abuses. I would like ta know veiy clearly
what was in the mincis of the, people who
bave ta carry out the law, and who have
instances of infractions bef are thein every
hour of the day and every day of the year.
We have passed through a period of deep
research and reflectian in these matters during
the past year or so. The contempt in which
the law lias been heki is an absolute scandai
tlhroughaut the country, and in many respecte
we have nat improved our reputatian as a lawabiding people.

not blind us entirely ta national neessities
in respect ta the carrying out of the law.
We have judges, juries and magistrates. They
are nat ail set against every inan who cornes
before them under an accusation. The jucige
himself la in large measure a protector of
the innocent persan, and the jury is the sanie;
and 1 do nat see any particular difficulty in
any man giving a lawful and valid excuse
why hie bas an unlawful thing in bis passessien. 11e bas na business witb it, in the
first place. lIf it is tbrust upon him with a
lie, or an imposition, and in good faith he
tbiaks hie is daing nothing more than engaging in an honest act, ýhe would get a chance,
between the judge and the jury, ta give his
lawful excuse in ninety-nine out af a h.undred
prosecutians, I think.
On the Cther hand, there is sucli facility
for a prime mover in, an illegal ýact ta get
himself under the sereen of a third persan in
these cases that it is very well ta have third
persans fully apprised that it la their duty

opportunity for fences, and shelters, and all
that kind of thing whereby he shields himself
and makes his own profit. The general citizen
should feel -that he rnust be on his guard
as well, and I have not much faith in
the extreme lack of knowledge and of intelligenice, and the extreme simplicity, which
lead the average citizen to engage indifferently
in these things. Our people have sense and
intelligence enough to know whether they
are close up agaifist a dishonest thing or an
honest thing. and if they have not that
intelligence, they might well be reminded by
good stiff penalties that there is something
of a duty for which they are responsible in
regard to the carrying out of the laws of our
country.
I want to see, from my honourable friend's
presentation, when we come to this subject,
just what the cases are. I am quite certain
that actual cases before courts, and in the
process of carrying out these particular laws,
can be found, which w ould make us think in a
very responsible way as to how far we should
take the teti onut of a law of this kind.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen, I want to say just one word to the
right honourable gentleman who bas just
spoken. If he wants to bring this law into
disrepute he will do all he can to impose a
penalty of $2,000 and 12 months' imprisonment upon a man-whether he is learned or
ignorant does net make any difference-who
happens to have a pint of whiskey in his
possession and is unable to satisfy a couple
of magistrates or a judge that be is entirely
innocent as to knowing where that liquor was
imported or manufactured. To my mind, the
penalty is so much out of proportion that if,
there is an attempt to put this penalty into
force the Act will be brought into disrepute.
There ought to be some sense of proportion
in it.

Progress was reported.
CANADA'S RAILWAY PROBLEMS
T)NCUTSSION CONTINTUE1)
The Senate resumed from March 17 the
debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Robertson:
That he will cal] the attention of the Governent to certain matters affecting Canada's
transportation activities and problems; will inquire of the Government whether or not it has
any definite policy in relation thereto, and if
so, will ask that it be publicly declared.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen
the reason why I am speaking at all on
this matter is that I want to ask the Government a question which would not be intelligible without a little explanation, and I did
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE.

not want to interrupt either the honourable
member for Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson)
or the bonourable member who spoke last
on this question (Hon. Mr. Beaubien).
Some two years ago I asked here for a
return based on the payroll of the Atlantic
Division. I got that, and it is still available for any member of this House; but I
am bound to say that I was no wiser after
I received it than I was before; not that
there is anything the matter with the return,
which was probably all right, but sim'ply
because of my incapacity to interpret it.
Wben I look at the rules or regulations with
regard to the pay of those men I find that it
is necessary to niake a mathematical caliculation in order to find what pay a man will
get for a day's work upon the Canadian
National Railways.
His pay will depend upon how mîany heurs he works, and how many
miles ho goes, and whether he is getting
ordinary pay or getting overtime, that is, pay
and a Ialf, for part of his time. In the case
of some men the pay will depend uipon what
class of engine they are on.
Sometimes it
depends on .whether a man is working in the
yard, or out of the yard; whether he goes on
a long run or a short run, with a turn about.
Sonetimes, so far as I could read the return,
it is possible for a man who bas gone 25 miles
and corne back, to call it a day, and I think
it is im the power of the authorities to work
the man, if tlere is work, for his hundred
miles, or the equivalent of eight hours.
I do not think that the average man who
is not a railway man would understand the
matter any botter than I did.
I tried my
best to master the situation, but I came to the
conclusion that it would help me, and also
help the average man of this country, for the
Governient or the railway people to give
us the naines or nunbers of a thousand men
on each of the divisions, and along with those
naines or numbers give us in dollars and cents
the amount that each of those men got, say,
for the year 1926 or 1925.
If it turned out
that a man had a gross earning of $1,800 because he had worked for a year under these
compilicated criss-cross rules, we could analyse
the result, and with the aid of an accountant,
taking the $1,800 as a basis, we could find how
nany hours he worked, and how much of his
time was at ordinary pay, how much was at
pay and a half, and what other qualifications
there were in the case.
In that way, I think,
we couid get a pretty reasonable and accurate
notion of what the railway men are paid.
I said before, and I repeat, that I regard the
railway men as picked men, and a large
number of them as experts, and not on the
footing of ordinary labour at all. It takes

MARCH 22, 1927
an engineer or a driver of ten or fifteen years'
training before he is aible to take out one of
those big engines.
Firemen, station masters
and train dispatchers also need training. There

men, and others that I need flot mention.

I can see of having this clone is to, get the
figures as I have suggested, and analyze them.

difficult to answer the questions seriatim, and
I have a general answer which covers all
the questions.
The Government is aware that the Department of Railways and Canals is constructing
a retaining wall, and the Departmnent of Public Works bas appropriated 825,000 for the
construction of a wharf, net near the foot
of Waverley street, as stated in the forcgoing
inquiry, but on the opposite bank of the
Rideau Canal, along Echo Drive, for the
purpose, cventually, of trabhsferring te that
location the dockage facilities which have for
many years existed between the Plaza and
Laurier Bridge, and which it is intended
to remove in order to make way for the
extension of the canal driveway. The Ottawa
Improvement Commission is aware of the
proposed location of the new wharf and
dockage facilities and lias made no objection.
The City Council of Ottawa or the Ottawa
Board of Trade have net been consulted, but
representations were made by a large number of merchants and business men of Ottawa
that, as the value of the merchandise handled
at the present docks totalled over $7,000,000
annualily, the existing docks ougbt net te be
abolished until similar facilities were provided in some locality convenient to those
business interests. Subsequently, the Echo
Drive site was chosen as the more advantageous from all points of view.
One delegation waited on the Department
of Railways and Canals, asking that the new
docks be located on the Ottawa River. The
delegation was referred te the Public Works
Department, whose engineers after due consideration recommended the establishment of
the wharf at the Echo Drive location.
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

The proposed new docks are net to be
located at a point " on the beautiful driveway already constructed" as intimated by
Senator Robertson's concluding question; but,
as already stated, on the opposite bank of
the canal.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I assume that it
is net in order to discuss this matter, but I
would like my honourable friend to make
some further inquiry, because information
which I have, and a document forwarded to
thef Minister of Railways, of which I have
sen a copy, indicates that when the present
driveway was built on the west side of the
canal from Waverley street down to the
subway, a number of property owners donated
land for tbat purpose on the distinct understanding and agreement with the Government
tliat it was for the beautification of the city,
and therefore was beneficial to the owners
of adjacent property. They hold, according

this action of the Government in placing
docks on that very canal, even though they
may be on the other bank, is net in keeping

I would suggest to my

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As the matter
lias been dealt with, apparently, by two
Departments, I will draw it te the attention

SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from March 16 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Dandurand for the second reading of Bill 70,
an Act respecting Old Age Pensions.
Hon. L. McMEA NS: Honourable gentlemen, the principle of old age pensions I
beartily endorsýe, but I arn in a position somewhat similar to that of the honourable leader
of the Government with regard to this Bill,
inasmuch as, to say the least, I arn not wildly

friend is in errer. 1 said that it wvas a first

which would necessarily accompany or precede

periment.
llowever, as I have already said, the honcurable gentleman wa.s not enthusiastic in introducing the Bill, and in my opinion one of
the rùeaýons is that this preposed legislation,
aswell as the Bill that was brought down last
year and discussed je this House, is not a
Liberal measure. It was neyer a part of the
Liheral programme or platform. Considering
f or a moment the nature of the legislation
and the reason why it was introduced, I think
I may state without fear of contradiction that
it is net a measure for which the Liberal
Pension Bills,
Party cani take any credit.
even in Australia and in England, have been
the produet of the ILabour Party. If we cast
our minds back te an event which occurred
in another House about a year ago, we find
ibiat the leader of the Labour Party in that
House sent te, the Premier, and also to the
honourable leader of the Opposition, a letter
demanding that certain legislation should be
passed, and one of the measures that lie
pressed then upon the Governrnent and suggested te the leader of the Opposition was
this Pensions Bill. The letter can be f ound
at page 560 of the Deýbates of another House.
The ,.tiggp,tion of the Labour leader was
adopted by the Geveroiment and we had the
Old Age Pensions BilI a Bill that I arn sure

MARCH 23, 1927
does flot meet with the approval of the people
of this country.
Ilowever, I amn going to
support this Bill, for reasons which I wiil
give hereafter. We find Mr. Woodsworth, the
leader of the Labour Party, stating in the
city of Toronto, at a large meeting, that the
Labour Party were entitled tu credit for the
Bill; and at a meeting Which I attended in
the city of Winnipeg I heard the Labour
Party congratulate themselves on the situation existing at that time, that enabied the
Party to demand f rom the Liberai Government a Pensions Bill.
I mention this fact because I want to say
that, whiie I endorse the principle of Old Age
Pensions, I believe in giving credit to whom
credit is due. Ânyone who attended meetings
during the iast election and listened to the
speeches by the Prime Minister of this country and the other Liberal orators knows that
they claimed that the credit for introducing
thjs Pensions Bill into Parliament was due
to the Liberai party. It would make the tears
streami down your face to listen to the
pathetic tones in which the people of this
country were toid that the Liberal Government had provided them. ail with assistance.
But they were not satisfied to declaim
throughout the country that they had provided for the needy and the aged; they added
the astonishing statement that had it not
been for the wicked Tory Senate the people
wouid be by then in possession of pensions.
I attended in the city of W.innipeg a meeting
nt which the Premier of this country, addressing an audience of 5,000 people, said: "I had
given you an Old Age Pensions Bili." This
was greeted with enthusiastie hand-clapping
and cheers. "But the Tory Senate destroyed
the Bill and took it away from you." As n
member of this honourable body, sitting un
this side of the House, I object to a statement
like that being broadcast, throughout, this
country. It was without foundation and there,
wa8 no truth in it.
'Does the Bill that is now before us, or did
the Biii that wss passed by the Huse of
Commons last year, give pensions to the
people of Canada? Was it the intention to
give them pensions? The titie, "The Oid
Âge Pensions Act," is a misnomer. In my
,opinion it is an Act to prevent o>ld people
from obtaining pensions. The Prime Minister knew when he made that statement in
the city df Winnipeg that the provinces were
opposed to the Bill. H1e knew at that time
that the Legisiature of the Province of Manituba had passed a resolution in which they
declared that tbey could not take the advantage of it, and asked that the Dominion Gov32&qs-9ai

131

ernment assume full control of, and full liability for, a Pension Act. The Government
knew that at the time.
What is the resuit? You tale away from
the Labour Party the credit tu which they
were entitied, and you go through the country
and tell the peuple that it is you who are
going to gîve them this pension. You mislead the peuple simply by telling themn that
if it were not for a Tory Senate they would
stili get this pension.
Honourabie gentlemen, if this had not been
a serious matter it would have been laughable tu bear the Prime Minister declaiming
at a huge meeting in une part of the city,
and then tu go down to another part of the
city and hear the gentlemen of the Labour
Party telling their story. What can be said
of statements that are passed throughout the
country to deceive the peuple?
I venture to say that nut. one per cent of
those who ýcheered the Prime Minister su
enthusiasticaily when he made those statements understoud that when this B-ih was
passed, before a pension became available,
the consent of the provinces wouId be required. I say it was a cruel thing tu deceive those old people who had gone tu a
meeting full of hope and who retired from it
believing that if they wuuld only place their
confidence in, the Liberal Party týhey would
get this pension.
The Liberal Party succeeded in doing une
thing, -however: they succeeded in securing
the votes of people who otherwise would nut
have voted for them. I venture to, say, further, that if the Criminal Code contained a
provision rnaking it an offence to, obtain the
votes of the peuple by misrepresentatiun or
false pretenses, and if a charge had been laid
against some of the gentlemen who had made
those statements, and they had been tried
before a nob-partisan jury, there wuuld have
been a verdict of guilty against theem.
I arn guing- f0 vote for the Bill, and for this
reasun: I want this issue to, be put squarely
before the peuple of this country. I want
the people tu, understand that when this DBiii
is passed and haýs received the Royal Assent
they will not get a pension until the province in which they reside endorses the legislation. When that issue is fairly and squarely
put befure the peuple of this country, then
they will gîve a verdict and will demand a
Pension Bill along proper lines, and of some
benefit tu the people and they will refuse tu be
any longer deceived by this camouflage. That
is my reason for vutîng for this Bill. I want
it f0 be cleariy understood. that I am in
favour of a pension bill, but 'this Bill is not
une tu give the people pensions. At most,

it might be said that any province that will
come in under it will receive a grant which will
be made at the expense of the other provinces.
The honourable leader on this side of the
House (Hon. W. B. Ross) said he did not
think this was an issue before the people. I
agree with him. I do not think the people
had any idea of what this Bill really was.
All they knew were the statements they heard
from the pl'atform, that if they voted for the
Liberal Party they would get a pension. For
these reasons, I am going to vote for the Bill.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: It is a poor reason.
Honourable gentleHon. JOHN LEWIS:
men, I do not intend to speak at any lrngth
upon the merits of this Bill, because that is
a good deal like pushing against an open
door. There is no doubt-and the speech of
the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg
(Hon. Mr. MeMeans) confirms it-that the
people of this country in the last election
endorsed at least the principle of old age
pensions. Further proof of that is afforded by
the attitude of the other House, which is
unanimously in favour of old age pensions.
The only criticism made was that the Bill
did not go far enough. Also I think I can
see signs of a change of heart in this
Chamber.
The honourable gentleman from Winnipeg
says that this is not a Liberal measure, but
a Labour measure. I am perfectly willing
to give credit to the Labour Party so far
as the credit is due. They seem to have converted not only the Liberal Party, but the
Conservative Party also, and I am quite willing that they should wear the crown.
I intend to support this measure, even
though it my be imperfect, because the only
way in which we can hope to approximate
perfection is to make a start and to remove
the difficulties as they appear in practice. If
we wait for a perfect measure we shall wait
until doomsday. This is illustrated by the
varied criticism directed against the measure.
In this Chamber last year the objection was
made that we were invading the jurisdiction of
the provinces; and in the other Chamber this
session the objection has been that we were
leaving too much to the provinces and that
the Dominion ought to do more. I mention this not to show that the critics are inconsistent, or that they destroy each others
arguments, but simply to show the impossibility of framing a measure that will please
everybody.
This Session we have heard another criticism, which if not entirely new, was not
emphasized or featured last year, namely,
that instead of this Bill there should be a

contributory scheme with a pension foi every
man of seventy, whether rich or poor. I can
see considerable merit in such a plan, and
the Minister of Labour evidently has something
of that kind under consideration. I might
point out, however, that a contributory measure does not conflict with this measure, but
that the one supplements the other. We have
to provide first of all for men who are now
seventy years of age, or so near it that their
contributions would be negligible, and then

they had the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908,

the two were intended to work together.
The Act of 1908 was sonewhat similar to
the one now before the House, and the Act
of 1925 contained provisions for contributory
pensions without any inquisition into the
means or other income of the applicant, and
I am inforned that the one is supplementary
to the other.
If we pass this measure we make a start
and bring it into the realm of practical iegislation, and it may be improved, as I said before, as defects appear in practice. If we
reject it or amend it in such a way that it
is sure to be rejected by the other flouse,
it will result in a barren conflict between
the two Chambers and an academie discussion which will lead to nothing.
Hon. J. J. DONNELLY: Honourable gentlemen, before this measure is voted upon, I
wish briefly to explain the position that I intend to take. Ujnlike the honourable member
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. MeMeans), I am
not in sympathy with the Bill.
I feel that
there are in this country many people who
think they have the assurance that when they
reach the age of seventy the Government will
provide for them, and who, therefore will not
make very much effort to provide for their
old age.
I think that in this way the Bill
places a premium upon extravagance and

on this side of the -Hous. I think it was

the electors of this country to think that they

and this Bill is the outcom5e of one of them.
Many old people feit that, no mnatter what

Honourabîs
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN:
gentlemen, notwithstanding tjie elections of
hast year I do not feel justified in changing
my mind as ta this Bill. i thin-k th at same
of my colleagues on this @ide of the Hous
have been over generous indeed towards the
Government in their interpretation of the hast
election. If ws take the.number of votes. cast
on the one side for the Conservative Party,
and on the iYther side for the IÀberaI Party,
as welh as those caat for the Progressive Party,
we flnd that there is a clear inajority of over
26,000 votes for the Conservative over the
two o.ther parties. How, therefore, can we
interpret t.he election as an endorsation of
any measure of this Government, much lsem
of this measure?
I amn greatly in sympathy with whist the
honourabie gentleman from Winnipeg (Han.
Mr. MoMeans) lias said. It la true that
during the iast election aid age pensions were
offered ta the people as sa perfect panacea for
ail the troubles of aId age, and now the
Govemment is face ta face with the difficuhty
of applying the panacea. Indeed, I believe
the Government takes coxnfort fromn t.he fact
that the Bill is now before the Senate in the
hope that they may 'be protected, on the ane
hand, against the odium of breaking their
promise or on the other hand, against the
respansibiiity of carrying it out.
I quite understand the great temptation of
honourabie gentlemen on this aide of the
Hous to say ta the Li-beral Party and ta
the Goverument: "You have concacted thia
measure; you have uaed it unfairiy during
the last cs.mpaign; now we will let you have
a taste of your awn medicine in its application." I understand, that feeling perfectiy,
honourable gentlemen, but what would be
the consequence of paasing this Bill?
This, in my opinion, is an iniquitaus
measure. First of ail, it is unheaithy in. its
basic moral principis. It is gaing to, stunt
the growth if it dos not aitogether bl.ight
and wither aR incentive for thrift and
providence in the land. Furtherinore, it resta
upon a very unsound financial structure. If
we pass this measurs, honourable gentlemen,
I very much f ear lest some day in the not
very far distant future that this country wil
be saddled with the obligatian of paying
yeariy suah huge sumo as 330,000,000 or
$4.0,000,000. How can that 'be proven? Very
simply. The measure before us is based not
on the population of today, not at ail; it la
based an the population of 1921-six years
ago. Therefore the annuai figures brought
ta us and submitted tai aur judgment are
very much below what they will be if the law

134

SENATE

is put into effect. Besides that, of ail the
old men over 70 in this country the Government bas taken the proportion of 40 per cent
only wbo will ta.ke advantage of this Bill.
On what is that baaed? Purely and simply
on the oxperience gathered by the application
of a somewhat sirnilar law in Australia, a
different country with totally different conditions, and as appliod to men of 65 years,
therefore of a difforent aýge. *Honourable
gentlemen con vory well surmise that at 65
a min carn work and provide for himiiuf, and
therefore flot need a pension as much as wben
he 18 70. Therefore the figures would be very
much lower for men at 65 than at 70. Notwithstanding that, the calculations of the
Government for the application of this la-w
colt for $24,000000 a year. It matters little
whether $12,000000 of that amount cornes
fromn the provinces; ultimately it ail cornes
from the people, and we will ail ho taxod for it.
Therefore I say that a measure wbich, is going
to saddle this country wvithi stich liuge obligations, rnuch greater than tliose uhich are
aceknowlodcgod, and that will ke-ep increasing
forover, rests uipon a very unsound financial
structure. Besides, it is ahsolutely uniust.
Why sbould the Government press the
poasing of this meosure knowing thot at least
three provinces cannot benefit by it? That
fact nobodv con deny. How does the CGov-ernment think it is justified in providing for one
kind of destitute people, the old men, and f orgettiog ahi the others? It is true that the
destitution al old ago is a sod thing, but the
destitution af a younger age is sadder, because is if going f0 last very much longer.
Therefore 1 soy this measure is unjust on
accounit of those who will have to contribufo
to it and receivo nothing in compensation,
and olso on occount nf the special class that
bas been selected by the Government as
beneficiories, to the exclusion of others equal]y
in need.
Honoîirable gentlemen, the only feature
that would commond this Bill to my judgment is the promise of the honourable leader
thiat it was headed for a complet e and not
far rernoved transformation. From a gratuitious scherno this is going to evolve gradually into a contributory system. But let me
tell bim that, what you give the people you
con neyer tako back, and therefore this
measure will nover evolve. What you do now
cannot be undone. If is therefore imperafivo
f0 improve this piece of legisiation at present

paid; but, secondly, tbat this gratuitious
system submitted to us shaîl gradually ho
evolved and changed info a reasonable and
sound contributory system? My honourable
friend who leads this House says if would ho
quite possiible f0 establish a contributory
sysfemn provided we were allowed 20 years
to build it up. Therefore I take if that the
difficulty in building up a confributory syàt-m
onýly affects the first period of 20 years. If
wo can bridge over 'thaf period we can graduoîîy go on witb the contribufory sysfom, which
of course is flnancially sound. If we esfablisb
a contributory system concurrently with the
passing of ithi!s low, arn I not .iustifled in
stafing that the contribution of the state,
wbich will reaob the maximum amount, for
the first yeýar, of fromn $24,000,000 f0 $30,000,000, will gradually decline unfil af the end
of 20 years it cornes to nothing, because at
the end of 20 years the premiums will take
the load and pay for pensions tbereo.ftez?
If that is the case, can we nof sit down and
caîl to our help mon who ]have built up the
greot insuronce companies of this country,
mon like Macaulay, like the President of the
Canada Life. mon like Mr. Fiske, who bas
establisbed bore a very important branch of
perhaps the rnigbtiesf insuronce institution in
the world, the Metropolifan Lufe?
Why
could we not ask sucli men to corne and
elaboraf e for us a systeifl by whiuh xo \4ould
care for our oid nien n0w by paying tbrough
the public excbequer whatever is necessary
for fbat purpose, but only for tbat period
wbicb. ve nieed to bridge over, until the contributorýy systern con take full charge of al
pensions?
Honourable gentlemen, I would
like f0 impress upon you tbe prima facie
possibility of doing thaf, by referring to tho
explanations given by tbe leader of tbe Goverrnent in this House.
Calculations have already been made for a
contributory systeni by the Labour Departmient of tbe Governmont, and wbat do we
find? We find thot a scbeme, tbe purposo of
whicb is f0 give a pension of $365--not $240
-to every man roaching tbe oge of 70
roquires very smýall weekly contributions during the early periods of man's life. For instance, at 18 yeors a man would bave to pay
only 28 cents a week; that is to say, a total
contribution for thot smalhl account wvhich
could vf'ry well be divided between the
Governînent and the bene.ficiary, and wbioh
wvould ho extremely ligbt.
When a mon
rcacbes 357, ho bas only f0 pay 72 cents a
week. baîf of whicb let us say would ho paid
by the Government; and so on. In the soberne
referred f0 the Goveranent subsoribes roughly
one-third of the srnaller prorniums and a mucb

MARCH 23, 1927
lesser proportion of the heavier ones. For
instance, in the total contribution of a man
of 18 years the Government furnishes, roughly
speaking, 33 per cent. In the total contribution for a man of 35 the Government subscribes 15 per cent. In the total contribution
of a man 50 years. old the Government only
centributes 4â per cent. An insurance of this
kind ia the cheapest than can be conceived,
since there are no coste for solicitation, for
medical examinations and similar expenses.
If the masses in the country did insure, the
overhead would be very smaîl, and we could
devise a scheme that would be light for the
beneficiaries as well as for the Government.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I would like to ask the
honourable gentleman this question: provided
the contrihutory systern to which hie refers
were put inte effect, if only 50 per cent of
those eligible paid to that systern, what would
becorne of the other 50 per cent when they
arrived at the age of 65 or 70? Would the
saine Government institutions which are now
in existence have to be continued to provide
for thern?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: As I rnentiened, if
there were not the first period of twenty
years, there would be ne difficulty at all; we
could sit down to-day and establîsh a contributory systern which would begin to funetien in 20 years frern new. There would be
no difficulty.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: That is nlot an answer
to my question.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Just a moment,
please. Therefore the question is this: how
are we going to bridge over that 20-year
period? Even if the Government had te pay
the entire amount of the pensions for 20
years, I ask my honourable friend whether
that would not be better than paying thern for
all times to corne? That is the proposition
that I arn putting before this Huse.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I do not think the hionourable gentleman has answered the question
yet. I ask him, assuming that 50 Per cent of
the people arrive at the age of 65 or 70, and
are therefore pensionable, what would become
of the 50 per cent who did nlot take advantage
of the contributory systern, and during those
20 years do not pay their portion of the

institutions which are already in existence,
provîded ýby the provincial Gevernments, have
to maintain those people, and would not
those institutions bave te be continued at the
end of 20 years in order to provide for those
who did net contribute?

135

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: That is quite possible; and if we do not make a contributory
system attractive enough we may not get all
the people in. But a system of that kind is
subject to all sorts of modifications and inducements. For instance, you may say to the
employer: "You must insure yeur employees."
I do nlot know that yeu could make it ceinpulsory, and to my mind that would operate
to restriet the liberty of the people far toc
rnuch; but insurance can be made so cheap
that it would be very attractive, and I tbink
the masses of the people would take advantage cf such a system.
New, just one other thought. If you have
the mass cf the people insured, the administration of such a national undertaking te
evexy man reaching the age of 70 weuld
be extremely heavy and difficuit. Then why
net caîl upon the insurance companies cf
this counitry te coiiperate? Suppesing that
we would form a corporation of all those
insurance companies willing to enter into it,
and turn ever te them the administration
of this acherne cf pensions on two conditiens: firat, that there would be preper
supervision; and, scendîy, that there would
lie the strictest limitation as te profits. With
that systemn establigbed you would 'have practically the bulk of the nation providing for
itself in later years, and great institutions of
this country helping thern generously te do
se.
Just one last word. I knew that the G-overnment, since it bas been in power, has time
and again played te the less desirable instincts
cf the people. Time and time again we have
seen the Government peinting an easy way
te tbe treasury cf this country, and inviting
the people to corne aleng, and help tbemselves freely. Remember the legialatien sougbt
fer the Home Bank, te cite -but one instance.
The Senate stepped in and stopped the raid,

the Goverument.

136

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am endeavouring
to answer. If that wise measure so modified
and improved is sent to the other House and
is killed, I don't think the Senate can be
blamed very much for it.
Hon. Mr. McDONALD: If it is in your
opinion a wise mea sure you can bring it in
every Session, and every Session the Senator
from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) could
kill it by a wise amendment; is that right?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
No, because I
believe it is the duty of this Senate, if it can,
to amend and improve the legislation which
is brought before it; and if out of this measure,
which is an unjust and dangerous one, you
can make one that is wise and prudent for
the nation, our duty is clear; and if the House
of Commons had killed the amendment we
made to the Home Bank Bill, What of that?
The House of Commons would Lave borne the
entire responsibility. If we can evolve out
of this measure, as I hope we can, one that
is sound and provident for the nation, we
will have performed our duty, and we can
very well let the responsibility lie somewhere else if that measure, so corrected and
improved, is killed there.
Therefore, honourable gentlemen, I shall
inove:

That this Bill be referred to the Committee

on Banking and Commerce, with a view to endeavouring if possible to replace it by legislation -(a) enabling the immediate payment of Old

Age Pensions to the same age classes and for

the saine amounts as provided by this Bill;
(b> providing for the said pensions by means
of imsurance to which shall contribute the beneficiaries as well as the public exchequer, the
contribution of the latter absorbing the surplus
cost of the first twenty-year period of operation:
(e) and creating a corporation composed of
the different life insurance companies of Canada
willing to participate therein, and charged with
the administration of the proposed law, subject
to proper supervision and to restriction as to
profit.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: He mighit suggest to the Senate that instead of examining
the Bill in Committee of ithe Whole we should

but Le need not give any notice for that purpose. This is a public Bill. I make this
remark because I desire to know whether or
not the honourable gentleman is moving
against the second reading.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Will the honourable leader allow me? My purpose was not
to commit anybody to the principle of the
Bill. As I understand, 'a Bill may be moved
into Committee at any stage, and my purpose was to move now, before the House
had passed on the principle of this legislation,
and send it to the proper Committee to
deal with a measure of this kind.
. Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, the honourable gentleman cannot do that. The House
has to pronounce on the principle of the Bill
before it can be referred to a Special or any
other Committee.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: There Las been
only one reading.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What my honourable friend might do is this: when the motion
to go into Committee of the Whole is moved,
le might move as an amendment what he
suggests.
Hon. GEORGE LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Honourable gentlemen, I am not going to addres you at any great length.
I do net
expect, nor do I wish, to influence the vote of
any member of this House; I wish only to
place before you, as shortly as possible, my
reasons for the vote I am about to cast on
the second reading of this Bill.
As I listened to the honourable gentleman
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) smilingly introduce
this Bill I thought that he was making an
argument in its support-that he was laying
a foundation for the structure.
In fact I
was sonmevhat like Alice when she saw the
Cheshire cat in Wonderland.
She thought
she saw a smiling cat, and, for a while, the
longer she looked at it the more certain she
was that she saw a smiiîng cat, but in the end
Alice was forced to the conclusion that she saw
only a grin. I had listened to the honourable
gentleman's speech, and when, next day, I
went to my room and read it I came to the
conclusion that I had net heard an argument,
but had only seen a grin. The honourable
gentleman said nothing in support of the Bill.
He is a dauntless leader and is net afraid to

MARCH 23, 1927
champion anything that he favours, but this
was too much for him. He rose and moved
the second reading, and Vhen hie told us about
the golden age that was to dawn on us when
the ether House would bring in another kind
of Bill. The honourable gentleman let it go
at that. He thought he 'would depend upon

men on hi sie iight vote for it, but lie knew
also th-at urp to the present time the Lord
had flot answered the prayer, 'Give us this
dey our daily dead Tory Senators," to a sufficient degree to prevent the defeat of the
Bill.
Well, I think this Government are riding
for a fail. I do flot believe that Vhey would
ever have mounted on a spaviiied stumbler
like this had they expected him to, make the
course. I arn sati8fied that they 'have hedged
and even if they dIo win the race, they wi'll
lose money on it. However, be that as it
lnay, I trust that they will not lose that
money.
To be serious, this Bill is within the jurisdiction of either the Dominion Government
or the Provincial Legisiature; it cannot be
within the jurisdiction of both. It cannot bc
that under the scheme of our Government as
laid down -in the British North America Act
-which, 1 must confess, is ignored time and
time again in the legisiation of the Parliament of CanadaHon. Mr. POIRIER: Honourable gentlemen, may I be permitted to rise to a point
of order? I would like to know whether the
discussion is on the amendment proposed by
my honourable friend from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien), or whether we are discussingthe second reading of the Bill. I would like
to kniow where we stand. My honourablq
friend will excuse me for putting the question. I did flot mean to interrupt him.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: This discussion is on the second reading, if I amn not,
like Alice, dreaming.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) did not move
an amendment: lie just gave notice of an
amendment that lie miglit move on some
other occasion.
I hope
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
my honourable friend has had lis mmnd clanified. Now, honourable gentlemen, ail the
legisiation for Canada is within the jurisdiction of either the Dominion Parliament, sitting in Ottawa, or the Provincial Le-gislature,
at the provincial capital. It cannot be within
the jurisdiction of both. I have neyer yet

137

heard that the Dominion Parliament and the
Provincial Legislatures had concurrent jurisdiction. I thought that the scheme of the
British North America Act was, to divide the
jurisdiction so, that those thing8 which should
be for the general advantage of Canada, or
should affect the people as a whole, sliould
be aseigned te ths Parliament, while those
thîngs whicli pecu.liarly related to the province were within the ambit of provincial legislation. If that is, in general, the selieme of
our Britisli North America Act, then either
tliis Parliament or the local Legislature hias
no j urisdiction regarding pensions.
My
opinion was, and is, that this is a matter
for the Provincial Legislature. F'or that
reason I voted against the Bill, and for that
rea.son I intend te vote agaînst it again.
The Government nover had any ide& of
bringing this legielation inito effect. 'Me ultimatum from Mr. Heaps compelled them to
bring in somo logisiation during the hast Parliament; so they framed up as unworkable a
proposition as ingenuity could suggest to
them. They knew that it was an enormously
expensive matiter; they know it was an outrage to try to buy tlie vote of the Labour
Party, or any other party, in order to support their tottering regime; and I must congratulate them on the form in which they
put this legislation.
But that time lias gono by. They do not
now need the vote of the two mombors from
Winnipeg, becautse tliose who sailed under
the colours of the Farmers' Party liave raisod
a new flag and -are real supporters of the
Government. This legisiaition is brought in
now either to savo tlie Government's face
or to try to embarrass tlie Sonate. Mr. King,
ever since lie lias been in power, lias pursued
the Senate implacably, for the soie reason
that lie desires to be tlie autocrat of this
country. He tried to pull down the soveroign
from lis higli place, but I do not think lie
succeeded; and lie is trying now to get absolute power. IÀke Richlieiu, lie wilh not serve
unloos lie lias absoluto power. Thero is no
influence to restrain liim in thie Houso of
Cornmons, and lie wislies ito sweep away the
power of the Senato. Wlien lie came back
from the Imperial Conferonco, with banners
flying, lie know tliat lie liad no riglit or power
to abolulli or to récommend the abolition of
tlie Senate. He found out that tlie Constitution was an agreement not botween the Bri.tish
Government and the Parliament of Canada,
but between the Britishi Govornment and the
Provinces of Canada, and that tlioy, and
tliey alene, as lie lias been forced teo admit,
have the riglit to «mend the agreement. This
being so, we have no reason to feol timorous

138

SENATE

or to believe that the present Government
can assassinate us. They 'can only pray for
us or against us, and as the prayers of the
unrighteous do not always prevail, when the
breath is leaving my body I shall not feel
that it is in answer to a prayer of Mr. Ring.
Honourable gentlemen, in my opinion this
Bill is not within our jurisdiction, and I
think it is unbecoming of the dignity of the
Dominion Parliament to intrude upon the
jurisdiction of the provinces. I think such
action is disrespectful. We should not endeavour to evade the law and 'try to assume
powers which it was never intended that we
should exercise. I think it is improper for
us, un'less we firmly believe that we have a
right to do so, to pass any legislation which
may impinge upon the rights of the provinces.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will the honourable gentleman tell us in wihat particular
this Bill infringes upon the rights of the
provinces? In what way is it different from
the Good Roads Subsidy Bill?
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
The
Good Roads Bill simply provided a grant. I
have net considered that question, and I will
confess that I am not prepared to answer it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This is a grant.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: I do not
think this is a grant: I think it is quite different from a grant. In my opinion-I may
be quite wrong; I am only giving my opinion
-the Good Roads Bill is quite a different
piece of legislation. However, I have not
considered it, and do not purpose giving, or
pretend ta be able ýto give, a definite opinion.
Let nie say further that this is most improper legislation, for another reason. I have
partially read the speech of the honourable
Minister who introduced this Bill in the other
flouse, and the discussion which ensued. It
was there stated and admitted that every
province of Canada, save one, is against this

legislation. Now, if ail those provinces are
against it, they are not going to concur in
it. If they are against it, only one province
is goig to secure any benefit from it. I
ask you, honourable gentlemen, is it just
or is it right that the people of all the other
provinces of Canada should contribute to old
age pensions which wiil be payable in one
province only? Is it justice, is it equity,
that they should be taxed when they cannot
possibly receive any benefit?
Then, is it fair, is it cricket, for this Government to try to force other Governments in
this country to adopt policies of which they
do not approve? Surely it is not proper for
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON.

this Parliament to take the Province of
Ontario and Quebec, and New Brunswick and
the Western Provinces by the throat and say
to them, "If you do not pass this kind of
legislation we will go up and down through
this country and condemn you, and say that
we offered to join with you in this legislation,
but coudId not kick you into it?" That is
not right. Let this Parliament stand on its
own feet; let it pass its own legislation and
not interfere in provincial matters at all. I
say it is a most cowardly act on the part
of this Government, in order to compass its
own ends, ta interfere in the jurisdiction or
with the legisiation of the local parliaments.
Why, I am told that the Province of Nova
Scotia says:
"We cannot enter into this
scheme; we have not the money." And that
Government is going ta be cursed up and
dcwn the side lines by all the old people,
because it bas not adopted this legislation.
I say such a state of affairs is absolutely unheard of. If the Dominion Government want
legislation of this kind let them bring in a Bill
under which they will pay the shot, instead
of trying to lug in other people who do not
want to join with them.
I am satisfied that this Bill is not within
our jurisdiction. I am convinced that there
is no such thing as a concurrent jurisdiction
of the Dominion and Provincial Patliaments.
Even if I were positive that the Bill was
within our jurisdiction, I would still vote
against it, because it is an effort to coerce
the provinces into a policy which they do not
desire to adopt. I consider that that is the
most serious and most weighty argument
against this Bill. It is taking away from the
provinces their freedom of action and is an
attempt ta become master not only in Ottawa,
but in every provincial capital in this country.
We are bore to see that there is no undue influence brought to bear nor improper action
taken by the Federal Government, and that
there is no impinging upon the freedom or
jurisdiction of the provinces in the matter
of legislation.
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, during the last twenty-five years a great
change has taken place, in this country in
regard ta the question of pensions. The banks
and the large companies have inaugurated a
system of pensions to their employees. At
first this system embodied the principle of
contribution by the employees, but in later
years the pension bas been provided by way
of insurance on the lives of the employees,
and in the great majority of cases the em-

MARCHI 23, 1927
ployees are not cailed upon to, make sny
contribution, the amount of the premium
being regarded es part of the salary.
In European countries old age pension laws
In
have been adopted airnost everywhere.
eome countries the contributions are volu-ntary; i others, such as Germany, they are
compulsory.
We approached this question in Parliarnent;
for the first time last year, when we had bef ore us for consideration a Bill similar to
the presenit one. It is incumbent upon us to
try to profit by the experience of other countries -and to try Ito study the measure to the
best of our knowledge and ability. As f ar
as I arn concerned, I arn in syrnpathy and
have been in syrnpathy with old age pensions for a great many years, and I have
followed the legisiation in various countries
with a great deal of interest. I arn in favour
of such a system provided it is applied in
such a way as to induce thrift and encourage savings; but in my humble judgment the
present Bill is not prepared on such lines,
and I arn afraid that it would rather encourage improvidence, and therefore I hope the
Bill will be referred to a Comrnittee in order
that we may properly diseharge our functions,
by studying the question frorn ail angles and
make the best suggestions of which we are
capable.
In my -opinion this question is within provincial jurisdiction, but I would not objeot
to the Federal Governrnent taking a part in it
-and I think the Government can do soprovided it is supplemented by legisiation
frorn the Provinces, as is intended under this
Bill. I would object, however, to the Provinces beîng coerced in any shape or form. I
believe it is but proper that they should be
consulted and that any measure of this kind
should be adopted only after consultation between the Federal Governrnent and the several
Provinces. That is a further reason for rny
suggesting that the Bill be referred to a Cornrnittee. I think it would be unfair on the
part of the Federal Governrnent to expose any
of the Provinces, which may be unable or
jinwilling to join, to the odiurn with their
own people of having refused to take the
benefit of the measure and at the same time
placing its inhabitants in the position of paying a share of the expenses of carryîng on
a pension sehenie for people in other Provinces.
If this Bill is referred to a Committee, as
I hope it will be, it will ibe the duty of the
Committee to wire ahl the provincial Prime
Ministers inviting themn to give their opinions
and suggestions in regard to the Bill, and
when the Cotnmittee bas obtained their

13£

answers, I think it will be its duty to go
further and, with the help of the proper employees of the Government and employees
of insurance companies, to have Bills drafted
in conforrnity with the systenis in operation
in several different countries, such as England, France, Belgiu.m, and Gerrnany, so that
the Comrnittee would have before them the
systema of those countries in a concrete forrn.
.This is an exceedingly complex matter. I
have given a good deal of attention to the
law as it stands ini England, and I have also
tried to fol-low the law as it exists in sonie
dthee countries, and I find that the application
of a Iaw of that kind is exceedingly complex,
and that minute study must be rnade by men
of experience in the matter in order to prepare
a measure of this kind.
The information obtained by the proposed
Cominittee would help the Prime Minister
and the representatives of each province to
reach a decision. If there were a conference
to-rnorrow between -the Prirne Minister of
the Dorninion and those of each province, I
do not think Vhat this question could ha discussed fu'rly, or that any of thern would be
properly prepared to discuss it on its menits.
It requires special knowledge of the whole
machinery, and the work of the proposed
Cornmittee would help ithern to arrive at a
proper conclusion.
One important question is as to whether
ernployees or beneficiaries should be called upon to contribute. We are in t!he undesirable
position of having to inaugurate a system in
which provision will have to be made for
people who can hardly pay contributions, and
as a consequence it will be more onerous for
the firet 15 or 20 years ithan it will be in the
future. But I believe that this country can
appeal to insurance companies of ahl kinds
doing bu-siness in Canada to lend a hand in
the inauguration of a scheme of that kind, -and
The into co-operate as much as possible.
surance cocnpanies are interested in the welfare
of the citizens, old as well as young, olld age
pension tending to prolong life, and involving
a humanitarian question of great importance,
I think the public would have a right to expect insurance companies to assist in the inauguration of a systern of that kind.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Before my honourable iriend finishes bis
speech, would he gîve us his view in reference
to the position of Canada cornpared with that
of the different States, and the federal power
in the United States? He has taken us over
the European countries, and given us an idea
of their general trend of policy, and suggested
that they have all old age pensions Bills or

140

insurance arrangements.
Is it not the factor does my honourable friend hold against that
view-that conditions are more comparable
ambetween Canada and the United States of
America, and its different States, than they are
as between Canada and the Old Country?
There are 48 States, dividing amongst themn a
population of 120,000,000 people, some States
larger and others smaller; but, if I arn rightly
informýed, there is flot in a single one of those
States the necessity for, nor d'oes there exist,
an old age pension :arrangement, enaeted either
by federal or State legis4atures.
The point
with me, which is rather strong, is that a young
country like Canada, with conditions very
similar to those on the other side, has something to learn from the general trend in this
matter upon thbat side of the line, where they
are prosperous, and where the great bulk
of thie people do not seem to have feit the
nced for anything like old age pensions.
If
they could get along and prosper so well, why
is it necessary for us to emhark on a system
which they have not found necessary for
thernselves?

crete formn the systemn of the different countries, and decide as to our final action on the
Bill.
My ultimate suggestion would be that this
Bill should flot be passed during the present
Session. I týhink, in aIl fairness to the provinces, that it should be discussed between
this Government and the provincial Governments before any legisiation on the subject is
passed. I will have no objection to voting
for the second reading of the Bill provided
we receive the assurance that it will be sent
to a Committee such as I have mentioned,
and that the Committee will have the means
of getting proper information such as I have
indicated.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: ilonoutrable gentlemen, it is not necessary for me to discuss
at length the subjeet before the buse, or
the principle embodied in this Bill, namely,
whether or flot Canada shouhd have old age

us, perliaps ail of us, agree tbat in many

tlirown out in this Huse, and not even given
a second reading. 1 believe that ail that lias

of that fact in the iast general election ia
true; but I arn nat going even ta discusi
that feature, because I think it is a shame
ta make the oid people of this country a
pawn in the poiitical game. I do, however,
suggest that within tlie Iast few days, wlien
this Bill was under discussion in another place,
the Government refused ta accept amendments
ta tbis Bill. Why did tliey so refuse?
Because they said tbey proposed ta put the
Biil up ta tlie Senat-e in the same form in
whicli it was presented st, year, and dare
the Senaf e ta axnend it.
Now my lionourabie friend from De Salaberry (Han. Mr. Béique) proposes tbat this
Bill should be amended, dlscuased and considered by a Standing Gommittee. I feel
sure tbat de.maocracy in the Senate is demonstrated to-day in the fact that lie, at lest,
is not pledged ta support or follow the poiicy
witli respect ta tliis Bill tliat was declared
in- the-otlier-House. But 1I wonder wliat will

that has been used i this House several

141

times may nat be applicable ta the fate of
tliis Bull, namely, that it would get a decent
burial; because my honourabie friend lias even
suggested that lie does not think it will pass
during this Session of Parliament.
Honourable gentlemen, 1 think tlie position
is clear ta us all, and is seriaus enougli ta

there is no use calling tlie çonference ta

prabably net one persan in a liundred knowing anything about the detailed contents of
the Bill, but of thle opinion, as tliey were
last year, and during tlie campaign especially,
when the details were not explained, that
every persan reachîng tlie age of 70 years,
regardless of their financial circumstances,
were gaing ta get a pension. The young
people wlia were supporters of the elders
wouid feel tbat their obligation would thus
be discharged, and Vliey would liold up bath
liands and throw up their hats ini faveur of
aid age pensions, hecause they believed they
were going ta be freed of respansibiiity.
Let us do aur duty, and see fliat tbe situation is set riglit hefore the people. The only
way in wliici fliat can be dont, in my judgment, is ta give this Bill a second reading, let
if go ta a Committee of tlie Wbole bouse,
let us approve of tliis Bill and send it back ta
tbe bouse of Commons absoiutely unamended,
and then let flic Government cail flic conference, and let if sit down witi flic provincial

expect that the amendments will flot ho accepted and the Bill will be killed. Then the

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: 1 say to my honourable friend that, in viow of the statement
that is said to have heen mado in the other
House, and the refusai to agree to an arnendment of the Bill there hecause they intended
sending it to the Sonate without change, so
that the Sonate would ho faced with the necossity of accepting what it rejected iast year
-that in viow of that threat, and the feot
that thero has been a general election and the
people have passed upon this question, it
would not ho good formn for us to rejeet or
amend this legisiation at this time, and so far
as I arn concerned I intend supporting the
Bill on the second reading. I wiIl support it
in its entirety, althorgh I ahsolutoiy disagree
with somo of its provisions. I helieve that

wvant to make an observation with roference
to the remarks of my honourable frieod frorn
Ham:ilton (Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) on thtquestion whether or flot the Federal Parliament in this instance is trespassing upou
provincial jurisdiction. I arn induced to do
this by roason of exporience had with similar
measures passod in times gono hy. For example, we have had, I think, four different
picces of leislation whicha to my mind are
based upon the samne underlying thought,
namely, assistance to the provinces. Under
the Technical Education Bill of 1919 we said:
"We wiil give to the provinces, in proportion
to population a million dollars a year, to
help themn in technical education and help in
the development of brains among the people,
to make them more skilful and increaso their
earning power." That was a purpose comnmendable in itsclf. Nobody objecteil to the
principle. But the Federal Goveroment did
not say to the provinces: "We are going to
hand out this money, and you may do mrhat
you like with it." XVe said: "You might huild
techoical sehools with these grants. \Ve intend that this assistanice shall ho for the de'veiopment of brains and not for the building
of brick walls." Therefore ive held a string
upon the grant, by providing for certain assistance to the provinces if they cornplied
with certain conditions. A similar arrangement was made i0 regard to the construction
of roads, and indeed there are one or two
other measuros that might ho mentioned. By
this Bill, as I sec it, the ýGoveroment are in
effeet saying to the provinces: "We have
corne to the conclusion that sorne sort of nId
age pension legisiation oughit to be in effeet
hore, because it is needed.
Now. we wiiI
heip you to the extent of paying 50 per cent of
the p).ensions, not to exceed $20'a month, provided you stop in and contrihute your share."
It is on exaothy the same basis, I believe, as
the other legisiation in that regard.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Wouid the honourable gentleman allow me .iust a moment? Jo
I
the case of ail the other legisiation ho mentions the provinces requested the grants. Take
the case of the Technicaî Education Act. Was
there a single province in Canada that was
ot askingý for assistance from the Federal
Goveroment for technical education? In the
case of the road grants every province in
Canada, for a long period of years. had heen

MARCH 23, 1927
asking for federai assistance of this kind. But
in the present instance, according ta, the evidence befare us, not a single province in
Canada bas asked for this legisiation. There
is only evidence to the effeet that one province in Canada is prepared to accept it. I
think the illustrations given are on an entirely
different footing.

quickly be discovered. Ail these difficulties
will face the Governrnents, bath Provincial

to do?
If they ýcan find a solution, well

they put all their possessions together in order
that the needy, mostly represented by the
elderly brethren, might be better cared for
and assisted in their old age. This is the
principle of the Bill.
It is idle to say that this Bill is revolutionary, that it smacks of Sovietism, or radicalism, as I have heard it said. It does
nothing of the kind. It is an altruistic,
philanthropic Bill worth putting to the test;
and, if it is to be put to a test, Canada,
a young country highly civilized, and I might
say Christianized-a country unfettered by
traditions hallowed and hoary, a country
newly garbed in a Magna Charta, with a
tissue so delicate 'that it is hardly visible to
the naked eye-should make the attempt.
Canada stands in the van of civilization, and
if there is any legislation tending to improve
the fate of humanity or a part. of humanity,
we have the right and I believe the duty of
putting it to the test.
My opinion is that we should pass this
Bill as it is, unchanged, because if it is
changed that action will be interpreted against

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I was ready
to proceed with the Bill until we reached a
vote on it this evening, but I hear that many
members of this Chamber, knowing that the
other Chamber takes a holiday on Wednesday evening, would like to do the same. I
notified them that we should have to quicken
our pace at a certain moment if we wanted
not te delay the legislation to come from
the other Chamber.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

Why not proceed?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am ready,
but I am in the hands of the Chamber, and
I am strongly impressed with the suggestion
that we should adjourn at 6 o'clock instead of
continuing this evening.
My honourable
friends know that I am never in the way of
what seems to be the general will of the
House. If there is really a desire on the
part of the vast majority that we should not
sit this evening then we will take our adjournment, but if needs be honourable gentlemen will remain here until Saturday.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: I think the honourable leader should adjourn until to-night.
Many hunourable menibers want to go houme

their plans to go, under the arrangement we

bien)-that a most careful and exhaustive
examination will be made of the methods of
group insurance and similar schemes in order
that we may get the benefit of them. The
Government already has an admirable system
of annuities; but a few notices occasionally
in the favoured press, placards in post offices
and custom houses, will not induce people to
take advantage of them, excellent though
they may be, to the same extent that they
would if there were trained people with the
stimulus of a reasonable profit to themselves
putting before the public information with
regard to this 'method of providing for the
future. For example, I spoke a moment ago
of the tremendous growth of group insurance
and gave some instances. In 1919, when that
system began to any extent in Canada, there
were $11,00,000 of group insurance in force.
In 1925 there were $141,000,000 in force. In
other words, the amount had increased about
thirteen times in six years, which is a stupendous growth, showing admirable success in
converting people to see that need and take
advantage of the scheme, and begin to provide
for the contingencies of life.
A somewhat extended question was asked
this afternoon in reference to the practice in
the United States, where there are only tbree
States that have anything in the way of old
age pension-two western States and Pennsylvania. Anyone who has read the better
class of American periodicals within the last
year or two must have been struck by the
number of articles written by people of importance, dealing with the danger to the
people of the United States in the habit, which
is rapidly growing there, of attempting to do
things through the federal Government which
ought to be done by state Governments. Many
people who are thinking seriously about it
are warning their fellow-countrymen that this
is a bad course to pursue. The last article
I saw is in a magazine called "Nation's
Business," published by the Chamber of Commerce of the IJnited States. It is an article
written by one of the best-known American
Senators, Senator Borah, who entitles it,
"The Cancer of too much Government." The
editor of the magazine says this, about the
article:
We are weakening the fibre of our political
life. There is always someone ready to suggest
that the federal Covernment take charge of
our every activity, fr.om birth to death.
From Senator Borah's article I quote:
No one is better aware than I how hard it
is to resist the appeals which are made in the
name of humanity for the support of some of
the legislation to which I refer.
It seems
flinty-hearted to oppose measures having such
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN.

meritorious objects, for example, as the abolition of child labour, but the federal Government is not the agency for such purposes.
The problem is one of public education. The
people must be taught that in encouraging the
centralization of their affairs in Washington

they are digging the grave of the American
Government as it was conceived by the Constitution-makers.
They must learn that, in looking to the
national capital to cure all their ailments,
they are weakening the fibre of truc citizenship and destroying the self-reliant spirit of
Aiericanism without which this republie cannot endure. And we in Congress must stop
heeding every little group which, like the
Tailors of Tooley Street. solemnly petition us
as "We, the people of the United States."
That is the attitude of very many American
people of importance and of patriotism in
reference to the constant appeals to the
federal Government to do things which really
lie within the province of the State.
That tendency is net so highly developed
in this country, and there are certain things
which, for the sake of unformity, may possibly
be donc by the federal 'Government rather
tihn by the provincial Governments.
Personally I believe we would develop more selfreliance and independence, and have one
Province learning from another, by the experiments they make along any new lines,
rather than by turning to the federal Goverement to do things which each province
should take up and do, net only to the best
of its ability, but in harmony with the
traditions and methods to which their people
are accustomed.
The temperament of the
people, the morale, will produce better
results in Quebee, Ontario, Nova Scotia or
wlherever it may bo, than will a uniform plan
which is modified here and there in order
that it may go from coast to coast. While
not entirely perfect for any one province, it
may at least satisfy all of them, and work
with a reasonable efficiency in all.
My own preference would be for leaving
this legislation to the provinces. As far as I
know there is no province where there is not
now adequate and handsome provision, either
through municipal or provincial institutions
or by the countless myriads of religious,
philanthropic and benevolent organizations.
Even if we got this old age pension scheme,
while it would relieve those other agencies
of beneficience that are now working admirably, they would have to be left in existence, and they would practically cost as much
as they do at present, because the relief to
them would not be sufficient te allow them
to go out of existence.
I notice in the report of 1925, where 135
questionnaires were sent out to variousmayors
-and incidentally I may say that the demand
for this legislation brought responses from

MAROR 23, 1927
only 30-one of them that was quoted here
said: "Do something for deaf people." The
deaf, dumb and hlind people falling by the
way, neot reaching the age of 65 or 70, will ail
have to lie provided for. The scherne of old
age pensions, if is it to be carried out by the
Dominion Government, ought to be taken up
only after the most careful consideration. It
does flot speak well for the constructive
ability of the Parliament of Canada that we
should definitely and designedly and straightforwardly say: "Oh, well, we will just start
this as a rough block, and then gradually we
will hew it into shape."
This Blue Book contains information whieh
is, stili quite applicable, and I agree with the
suggestion that every source of information
should be sou.ght. The people who know
conditions in each province, the people who
can speak for those provinces, should lie asked
to give the benefit of their knowledge to this
Parliainent, or the Governrnent, or a Comrnittee, so that the scherne rnay ble shaped in
proper fashion, and put into effect. We
should flot go fumibling in the way that is
suggested in reference to this Bill, assuming
that the Bill is flot right, but that. it is
merely a heginning, and that little by little
we will improve it. Mucli as I would like.to
see the needy people of Canada obtain
assistance-and there is no one of 40 who
can lie sure that at 70 lie may flot need
assistance frorn someone-I cannot see that
this Bill is a proper and effective step towards carrying that out.
Hon. G. G. FOiSTER: Honourable gent lemen, in a few words I wish to express my
opinion with regard to Bill 70, and give the
reasons why to-day, as at the last Session,
I am not able ta support this legisiation. This
Bill is known in the country as the Old Age
Pensions Bill, and if you ask a man or
woman in rny province which is the
only place for which I arn going ta
spea.k, what that means, you will be told,
without. exception, that it means that the King
Government had got a lot of anoney together,
and had decided to hand it to the old people,
who were ail ready ta take it, and incidentally
ta support the source frorn which it came, and
then it was taken away by the Tory Senate.
Hionoureble gentlemen, I say that the Bill
as it çame before us then, and as it cornes
to-niglit, is not calculated to bring the relief
that those people believed they were going
to have. It means Vhat the Parliament of
Canada goes to the provinces and says: «'If
you contribute in connection witih this legislation, we will pay the balance." I believe,
there ie not one province in this Dominion
where that legislation will be accepted; but

I only speak for the Province of Quebec. That
Province lias nId men and old women, and
people who have been unfortunate, but they
are ail cornfortable. Some of them do not
know how comfortahle Vhey are. They are
not rich.
An Hon. SENATOR: They are Swedes.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: No; they are not
Swedes; they are first-class Canadian stock,
and they are provided for by institutions that
have existed for ages and generations. They
are provided for hy municipalities, by the
generosity of their neiglhours and friends, and
they stand to day perfectly able to weathex
the istorms with which they are being
threatened, and the old people of Quebec do
not need this legislation.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: May I ask a
question? I have noticed in the streets of
Montreal different people beging-icensed
beggars. Are they taken care of?
Hon. Mr. OASGRAIN: Certainly; they are
best taken care of.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: I say that there may
lie some poor men in the Province of Quebec
who would receive the generosity of rny honourable friend. That man is not on the street
as a heggar, *he is there because lie prefers to
sell pendIls or other articles, in order ta help
himself; but there arc in Montreal institutions
to which hhind mcn, Catholic or Protestant,
can go, where they can be comfortable and
be warm and fed, and they do not need ta
bcg on the streeta of Montreal any more than
they dn on the streets of Ottawa or anywhere
else in Canada.
Hon. Mr. CASORAIN: That is right; they
make more money, $5 or $6 a day. I offered
to keep one of those men in a institution,
and lie refused.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: I yield to sno mani
in this House, or anywhere ecs, in my desire
ta see old -and unfortunate mens and wornen
assisted and provided for; but I say that it
is going to do more harmn ta young and
middle-aged men of this country to paffl
legislation hy which they wilI lie told that if
they are lazy and indiffeyent and Teckless in
their expenditure they can get about 75 cents
a day, or whatever this ocheme arnounta to,
when they arrive at 65 or 70 years. What we
need in this country is to encourage thrift,
and those elements *hich go ta make up a
strong country. We have bad poor men i

was first settled. We had meni Who Went ta

SENATE
men have misfortunes to-day, but those
troubles were all met by the help of neighbours. That help was given with good-will
by the neighbours, and it was patriotism that
helped them to live together in peace and
happiness, and the neighbours themselves
were helped in many ways by the assistance
they gave to the unfortunates.
What we need to do in this country is to
create a desire on the part of our people to
pay their debts, to stop all the lavish expenditure which is the curse of Canada today in every province in the Dominion-expenditure which means national disaster at
some future time. We should learn not to talk
about those matters that divide us, and agree
more on those on which we can unite, and
co-operate in the development of our country.
That is the spirit which we should incuIcate
in the minds of our people, and not encourage
them to go to the public crib for help if they
do not attend to their own business, but
rather do what they should as descendents
of the hardy men who originally settled the
country.
I agree with every word that my leader
bas said in regard to this legislation. I spoke
and voted against this Bill before, and I intend to vote against it again, because I believe that the principle of it is wrong and
unhealthy. Somebody said to me this morning that everyhody in the country was in
favour of it; that everybody wanted it; that
down in Quebec there might be a few who
did not, but that here in Ontario and in the
West, as well as in the lower Provinces, the
country was swarming with people who
wanted it. I arm going to close the few remarks that I have made by reading to this
House an opinion. This is not the opinion
of a lawyer, it is not the opinion of a politician; it is the opinion of an editor who has
behind him the best element of the farmers
of the Province of Ontario. I want to read
to this House from the Farmers' Sun of
March 17, 1927:
'l'e pensions Bill
It is tob ha oped that tia Senate will again
reject the bill for old age pensions, which has
passed the Cominons. The measure is pushed
iy the labour unions, who have long had their
own way, and by the Communists, who seek by
ai means to distribute private property or capital. It is based on the disputable assumption
that society owes everyone a good living. That
is an assumption, whieh has no warrant, at all
events, in natural law much as it may appeal
to the prevailing sentiment of the day. It is
not clear that in the long run old age pensions
will tIo anyone any good. It will raise wages,
reduce the profits of indtustry and diminish inlustry and employmtuent. Its tendency will be
to consume savings and capital and to render the
country incapable of conmpeting with its more
virile neighbors. However, the experience of
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

England and Germany is not convincing and it
must b admitted that the world bas corne a
long way and done very well by requiring every
mati to look after bimuself. An unanswerable
arguaent against the enaetment of the bill at
this timne is that the country is now so overburdened with debt and taxes that it cannot
support a new levy. The Senate may, therefore,
justify rejection on the ground that the time
is not opportune and will not be opportune till
the debts have been reduced and industry is
again encouraged by sufficient rewards.
I submit to this House, the above opinion
of a friend of mine, who is an active farmer,
a man who stands high in the councils of the
farmers of Ontario, as an example of the
statement that would be made by the farmers
of our province with regard to this legislation if they were here to vote.
I shall vote against the Bill.
Hon. N. A. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I am impelled to say a few words
because of the attitude which I took on this
Bill when it was here before. Before I do so,
however, may I venture to offer my congratulations-and I hope I shall not appear
impertinent in doing so-to the two gentlemen who have last spoken on this Bill. They
have spoken with moderation, and have discussed the Bill itself on its merits. /I confess that
I was-I was going to say shocked, but I will
say that I was very disagreeably disappointed
this afternoon at the spirit evinced by honourable gentlemen opposite in approaching and
discussing this Bill. I think we were given
this afternoon an exaample which I hope will
not be repeattd. With one exception, I think
I may say that every honourable gentleman on the other side who addressed the
Senate this afternoon did so in a partisan
spirit and from a partisan point of view. I
had hoped along with a great many other
members of this House that the Senate had
once and for all given up the idea of discussing
Bills from the partisan point of view. I was
therefore disagreeably disappointed, I say, in
having put before us an example te which
I must take exception.
There was a question of jurisdiction raised
by the honourable gentleman from Hamilton
(Hon. Mr. Lynch-Staunton) about which I
should like to say a word. It does not appear
to nie that there is any difficulty with regard
to that. This Bill will not impose on the
Provinces any obligation whatever. The Provinces are left perfectly free to join with this
Parliament in aiding or assisting in the carrying out of the measure, but they may with
absolute liberty completely ignore the Bill
and take no share in its administration and
execution.
This Bill is not different from other similar
Bills that have gone through this Parliament:

MARCU 23, 1927
I may mention thie Bill to give aid and assistance in road making which we had before us
a few years ago. This Bill like the highways
Bill is merely offering assistance to the Provinces, without in any way interfering with
their juriaiction.
1 have always entertained the idea-and
the longer I live the more attached 1 become
to it-tiat governments ought to confine
themselves to governing. The people, 1 believe,
especially on this continent, will be better off,
will progress more steadily and more permanently, if govcrnments confine their operations *to what are really governmental funetbons. We are constantly departing from that
safe and good rule.
As was pointed out by the honourable member for Cape Breton (Hon. Mr. MoLennan)
a few moments ago in the article which hie
read, we in America are expecting our governments to go out of their natural field and
endeavour to do ail sorts of things not of
their concern and which should be done exclusively by the citizens. Honourable gentlemen may not think it quite germane to discuss here the policy of government ownership
or government operation. But it seems to me
that such questions are on a par to a considerabie extent with this kind of legislation.
Why, we have got to such a stage in this
country to-day that the state is managing and
operating not only railways, but hoteis ,and
steamiboats, and many other business enterprises, and indulging in many operations,
commercially and financially, which reaily belong only to the people.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Seliing liquor.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And selling liquor.
I quite agree with my honourable friend in
thinking that that is one of the things that
does not beiong to any Government, and 1
cannot concur in what bas been done in most
of the Provinces in that particular direction.
We are graduaily going back to the middIe
ages; we are graduaily going baek to the
common miii and the common bull; "le taureau banal." How far and how long are we
going to carry on as we are now doing.
Governments were not made to compete
with subjects in matters of business and trade.
Just imagine wbat may happen in this country in a very short tîme with its immense
mileage of railways and the innumerable employees engaged in their operation and in
other incidentai employment. 1 do flot think
it is stretching the imagination very much to
think of the day wben one-haîf of the nation
will be at the service of the other haîf. Do
you realize., honourable gentlemen, what
dangers are implied by such a situation?

What is to prevent, on occasion, this haif of
the nation from combining and assuming the
Government of the country for its own benefit? I think the time has arrived when we
must tryto get back to the soundand sane
policy of governing the people and not competing with them.
As the honourable gentleman from Montreal (Hon. G. G. Foster) bas pointed out,
under this measure we are usurping the funetions of charitable and social institutions of
different kinds which in the past have always
been found quite sufficient to provide for the
needs of old or infirm people. Why do that?
Why not allow the citizens of Canada to continue to perform the social duties which as
good neighbours nnd good citizens they owe
to »themselves mutually? The societies organîzed for that purpose, it seems to me, have
.completely and well fulfllled ahl the necessities
of the case. I arn quite sure, speaking of
the Provinces of Quebec and Ontario-and in
this 1 quite agree with the honourable gentleman from, Montreai (Hon. G. G. Foster)that there is in these provinces every possible
means of affording ail reasonabie assistance
to those who need, it, wbether because of
oid age or infirmity, incurable disease, or
anytbing of that kmnd. Again I repeat, let
the citizens do that. I see no reason wby
the Governinent should assume any share in
it at ahl.
Let us think of what is happening in the

more dispiriting or more discouraging, than
wbat is being done to-cùiy in England.handing out doles by the million to millions
of people most of whom are quite able to
work? And that in a country like England,
wbich has given the world the best example of
individual activity, enterprise, and success, a
country which bas practically taken possession
of the world comrnercially! How long is it
going to hast? To whiat lengtb is it going to be
carried? What about the initiative of the
people? What about ambition; what about individual initiative? If you are going to provide
for everybody who is unable or unwilling to
work, or wbo may meet witb some .injury,
there is no imit to what you wiil be compelled
to do./ May I remind honourable gentlemen
also that, according to the law of some of the
Provinces-mi the Province of Quebec, for instance, where it has always existed as part of
the Civil Code, and in the Province of Ontario,
which I was giad to see reeently adopt similar
legisation-there is a duty cast on relatives,
especially on children, to look after their
parents if they are in want. Why shnuld
the State take away from the indivîdual a
duty whicb the Iaw imposes upon him?

150

SENATE

Why should the State discharge that duty
in bis place?
Nobody in the Province of
Québec or in the Province of Ontario need
look for public charity; everyone bas a perfect
rigbt to ask tbat his bilîdren and relatives
shail give hlm the necessities and requirernents
of if e and the law bas provided a 'légal
ilemedy. It is besides a natural duty imposed
upon us by the law of nature; and this duty
bas been sanetioned by the law of man.
I think I bave said ail that, 1 need to say.
1 feel very much inclined, as I have feit before, to vote against the second reading of the
Bill. I propose, however, not to do so. The
honourable, gentleman from Montarville (Hon.
Mr. Beaubien) and my bonourable friend wbo
sits next to me (Hon. Mr. Beique) and in
wbose judgment 1 have the greatest possible
confidence, have opened a new vista tri me.
Tbey bave both hel.d out to us the possibility
that, if we were to inquire from the insurance
companues of ýCanada, w-e migbt witb tbeir asisistance devise sonie mceans of doing for our
peop-le aIl that it is proposed to do under
this Bill.
I have flot absolute confidence that
the insurance companies would be willing to
do, or are capable of doing, anything of the
kind.
I arn very much afraid that they are
not; greatly interested or particularly concerned
about men who are, or are about to be seventy
years of age, wbether rich or poor.
If tbey
aqre ricb, companies will not give tbem insurance ýbecause of their age; and if they are
pour, they have net the money to pay the
premiums.
However, there is a hope and a
possibility of sometbhing 'heing done in that
regard, and I arn not disýposed to close tbe
door completely on an investigation of the
problem along those lines. I w-il! vote for the
second reading- of the Bill in order tiiat
it may be referred to a Committee wvhich will
licar the representatives of our insurance coinpanies and will weighi and consider tbe proposaIs that have heco placed before us by the
bonourable member for Montarville (Hon. Mr.
Beaubien), and the bonourable oîcmber for
de Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béique).
I tbougbt I owed it to mysellf and to the
Huse to explain why on tbis particular
occasion I felt callýed upon to vote in favour
of the second reading, because on a former
occasion I voted differently.
Hon. Mr. McMEANýS: May 1 ask the bonourable gentleman a question before he sits
down?
I think he referred to a partisan
feeling on the part of aIl the members on
this side of the House.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I tbink tbe honourable

Hon. Mr. BELC'OURT: Wbat I said was,
and I repeat it-and I said it deliberatèly and
after consideration-thait honourable gentlemen opposite, with few exceptions, had approached the Bill witb tbe idea-and they sQ
eta'ted -that it was brought before the public
and submitted to Parliament for élection purposes. That, I think, was repeated, and often
repeated. -That, I tbink, is discussing a Bill
,fromni a partisan point of view, and I repeat
wbat 1 have already said, that I hope tbis is
the last occasion on wvhicb i"e will bave an
examiple of that sort.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: 1 want te say, with
ail due deferenice to rny bonourable friend,
that 1 think lie is the Iast inember of this

Hon, Mr. BELCOURT: If miy bonourable

ever made in this House of a partisan character 1 will admit wbat be says. I defy bim

Hon. JOHN McCORMICK:
Honourable
gentlemen, (last year I voted against this Bill.
The honourable ýmember for ilamilton (Hon.
Mr. Lynch-.Stauinton) bas doubts of tbe juridiction of tbis Parliament to pass a measure
of this kind. My honourable friend from
Ottawa (Mon. Mr. Belcourt) says there is
no obligation placed upon the provinces by
this Bill; but surely lie knows that the Bull is
based on the consideration Iliat the provinces
shaîl co-operate witb the federal Government,
and that if the provinces do not join the
federal Government in a monetary way the
Bill will be inoperative, and there wouild be
no use in paýssing it, at all.
1 arn going to refrain from giving anybody
reason to say that 1 arn acting as a partisan

MARCH 23, 1927
in relation ta this Bill. I arn inclined ta believe, from the situation hast year when the
Bill was intraduced, that there was ground
for thinking that the Government did flot desire that it should be passed. In a measure
of this importance we would expect t1hat some
effort would be made by the Governrnent ta
obtain the judgment and opinion of the men
in charge of the Legisiatures of the provinces
which were 'expected, ta ca-operate. But we
have no record of anything that the provinces said last year, or that they are prepared to enter on the scheme if this Bill
passes. There is no evidence this year of
any legisation by a. Legisiature such as is
necessary ta enable a province ta co-operate;
no evidence that action has been taken by
any provincial. Government in regard ta cooperation. I understand that a resolution
went throu-gh the Legidhature of British
Columbia, but no action could be taken on
that resolution if 'this Bill goes through.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There was an
Act passed.
Hon. Mr. McOORMICK: But that is only
one province. I arn very much in sympathy
with the plan of assistance ta people whom
this measure designs ta belp, but I apprave
of the suggestions ýthat have been made ta
ôbtain further information and advice in regard ta, this meamure, and ta add provisions
with regard ta contributions from the men
and women who to-day would be beneficiaries under it. These are not provided for
in the Bill, which is on an entirely different
principle.
I arn convinced that if amendments such
as those suggested were put in this Bill, they
would not be entertained ini the other Huse,
or adopted by the men who fathered this
meastire in the other bouse. We aJl know
the cii-cumstances. There was a critical time
of strife i the other bouse when this measure
was suggested. If it had -gone through hast
year, or if it goes through this year, there
will not be anything worth while paid out
under this Bull, and those who expected aid
from it will be disappointed. The mnen who
promoted the Bill do not represent a body
of people iW this country who are prepared
ta contribute ta it; they are representatîves
of a body of so-called labour who do not
want ta encourage or practice thrift; they
are muen who work to "Burn the candle at
both ends; spend ail you make, and when
you, are 65 or 70, and unable ta work, go ta
those people who have been leading wei1ordered lives, who have been practicing the
good aid habit of thrift."

151

I arn opposed to this Bill because my owfl
province of Nova Scotia is unable to take
advantage of this Bill, even if they wished
ta do so, by reazon of the financial situation.
Tbey had a deficit last year of something like
$870,000, and they are budgetting this year
for a defiGit of $1,000,000, and even if they
get the assistance that is. promised from the
Government here tbey will scarcely be able
ta balance thelir budget. Besides that, I
believe that in Nova Scotia we have a larger
numnber of old people per thousand than any
other province, and on account of this larger
number of men who would benefit under this.
Act if it went inta effeet, co-operation by
Nova Scotia would involve, a very serious
strain, and I know that the Province is not
prepared ta enter on it on that account.
1 cannot see how any body of men in the
Government of the country should bring in
a measure of 1,his importance and call upon
the provinces for their co-operation without
previously consulting the provinces, and this
has not been done.
But I propose ta support; this measure, for
the reason that I believe if it isipassed, it will
prove a delusion ta the people who. expected
something. While I do nat behieve it is right
ta pass a measure like this, -that is fooling
the people-and I believe it wifl have no
other resuit whatever-I will support the Bill
in order ta let it go through, and thus let the
people in the country who ere expecting
benefits fromn it see what a delusion and
hollow mockery the whole thing is.
Then there is the other reasan, that I believe that some kind of assistance is proper,
prov'ided it la given under suitable safeguards.
I would support a measure of that kind if
provision were made by which a man or
wom!an, who hopes ta take adivantage of this
measure in his aid age would in some way
contribute ta the fund that would provide
for him at age 65 or 70, or whatever other
age was tihought proper.
I will vote for this measure hecause it will
open the eyes of the people of this country
ta the lack of menit in the Bil4 and also for
the purpose of hiaving the legislatures deal
with the problemn by passng a sensible and
reasonable measure that will be of some advantage ta, those whom. it is intended to aid.

Lhey should or should nlot support this
measure. I do flot intend to occupy rnueh

whichi it is presented to-day, wvas before this
Uouse last year, and I then gave the reason
for the faithi that was in me, from the Mari'ime peint of view.
1 opposad the Bill last year, and I oppose
it this ye'ir. I did so last year because I
believed it was bad in principle, because there
was no demand for it, and because it wvas flot,
from another standpoint, an old age pension
schcme. I oppose it on the very saine grouind
to-day. In the minds of many of us there
may be a question as to whether a pension is
a ri.ght or wrong thinýg, but that is nlot worth
arguing, because we have passed the stage
for Anglo Saxon cnuntrica, at ail evonts, are
very mueili interested in old age pensions, and

MARCH 23, 192715
In voting against this Bill I would like ta
inform the honourable member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) that with me this is
nat a matter of politics; it is, a matter of
principle entirely. I think the principle of
the Bill is wrang. I agree with my honourable friend from Alma (Hon. G. G. Foster)
that so far as aur province of Quebec is
concerned there bas been no demand for it.
and sa far as I have learnedi by personal
interviews with at least two or three Prime
Ministers of other provinces, that they have
not mnade any demand for the measure, nor
do they want ta.
Now, it is one of the f unctions of this
Chamber, as I understand it, ta prateet and
conserve the rights of the provinces; and
if there is no demand from the province.s.
and this Bill bas beaen mare or less forced
upon them, I think this Chamber wauld not
fulfil its functian if it did not appose a Bill
of this character.
Sa far as I arn caneerned I will vote against
this Bili as a matter of principle; I thinik it is
wrong.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honaurable gentlemen, following the idea put forward by the
honourable gentleman fromn Westmoreland
(Hon. Mr. Black) 1 desire ta make a Westminster Confession.
New WestHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
munster.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: Having approached
this Chamber to-day in the attitude of friendshîp towards this very important Government
measure, I was disappointed at Tealizing the
markedly absent treatment with whichi the
Bill was being received on the Government
side, finding that fram the great vacant spaces
surrounding the Covernment leader, there wais
only one lone voice raised in this Chamaber this
nfternoon, or this evening, for Vhat matter,
in support of this measure. I recali the scene
of hast year: the splendid leadership I had
then in my attitude at that time of opposition
ta the measure. I had the unusual privilege
of following the brilliant leadership of the
honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon.
Sir Allen Aylesworth); of hi4tening ta the
persuasive eloquence of the leader of the
Progressive party in this Flouse (Hlon. J. G.
Turriff), also sitting on the other aide; and
finally, capping the climax, there came the
sturdy argument of the inember from Prince
Edward Island (Hon. J. J. Hughes), showing
the impossibility of applying the measure ta
the conditions in his Province. I wonder
where that headership is to-day, and whether
I have gone wrong aIl by myaelf, or whether

the others too have reversed their opinion.
I wau opposed to this measure last year because 1 regarded it, to use the vernacular, as
a put-up-job on the Labour Party in the
House of Gommons; I was opposed to it
during the election 'period, because of the
conviction that at that time it had become
a put-up-job upon the electorate, a mesure
of cruel deceit to the aged people of British
Columbia; and I arn opposed te, it this evening, although 1 intend ta vote for it, for
reaSons which I will state.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. TAYLOR: I arn opposed. to this
measure this evening, and I intend to follow
the brilliant example set for me acroas the
Hanse, by voting against my expressed conviction, because I regard it naw as a put-upjob on the Senate of Canada. -If I have the
intention of voting for the second reading of
the Bill, it 'is certainly not because of any
intrinsic merits, or the sequence of events
associated with its presentation here. I have
noticed i connection with the legislature of
iny own Province, and i the argument before another Flouse, that the reason -put f orivard for presenting this Bill now in the ack-*
nowledged imperféect, shape in which we have
it, is the staternent, whieh bas been made,
that to alter the Bill in any particular would
be to risk its acceptance by the Senate. In
other words, the promotors of the Biih, having
been convinced by the logic offered by the
Senate a year aga that the Bill was contrary
ta the principles held by the members of this
honourable body, seemn to bc determined ta
make no concessions whatever; not because
they t-hink the Bill is perfect, -but because an
easy way of .getting out of the awkward mess
is ta send the Bill up to this Chamber again
in precisely the f orm in which we rejected it
last year, in the hope that it will again ineet
a similar fate. For my part, taking the good
advice offered by an honourable gentleman
.!ust now (Hon. Mr. Belcourt), to, remnove
polities from aur consideration, I decline to
be a party to what I consider ta 'be that brand
of politics.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not believe
that that statement, which is practically the
repetition. of a statement which feil from the
lips of a brother member, is a fair one. In
the debates that occurred in another place,
objection was taken to i.ncreasing the
Dominion's share for fear of antagonizing the
Upper Chamber, which had baulked at the
contribution of 50 per cent, but ià was thought
that this Chamber would be ready to, accept
that, but that it would flot increase the vote
ta 75 per cent. I heard that twice, and I

SENATE
think it will be found in the record. This was
nlot a challenge to. the Upper Chamber. The
statement was made i'n a conciliatory spirit
with the idea perhaps that the measure as
it is, approved as it was by the people geneýrally, would bc accepted by the Senate if
the charge upon the Exchequer was net largor
than proposed last year.

in this bouse that a sans, comrnon-sense,
practical systern of old age pension, including
contributions, built on the British lines, woubd
be a good thing; and, I say it is flot creditable
to the Government that they have alIowed a

practical in the matter, 'but have corne back to
Parliament with a half-baked measure such
as is now proposed.
I do not go so fan as rny honourable friend,
and say that it is a 'bad measure. 1 do net
think it is an immoral messure, or that it is
wicked, but in my judgment it is defective
and unworkable. Yet I arn noV going Vo

defective, for several reaisons. I necall that
a year ago in this bouse we rej ected a Bill

general elections in the country; we gave the
people of Canada tirne te think, time to
considen, and to, judge whether our action was
right or wrong, whether our judgment was to
be appnoved of by thern or not.
Now, as I understand the argument, it is
said that we should stand in the way fer ail
tirne because we thînk this legisiation. is not
prudent or that it is defective. I do not hold
that view. I say that this Chamber gave

and they will then have an opportunity to ait

every possible effeet of this legisiation -both
from the federal and provincial standpoints.
I say this in ail seriousness. I consider this
one of the moet important pieces of legisiation
with whidgh we have had to deal for a long
tirne, involving enormous sums of money, for
this Bill, if it goes through, will be a burden
on the people of this country for ail generations to corne, and flot merely for to-day or

I say in ail seriousness that we

age pension legisiation into such shape that
al! the people of Canada and ail the provincial
authorities may agree with it.
So 1 would suggest to the honourable leader
on the other side of the Huse that before
this measure finally goes through he should
consuit bis ccilieagues, and if thought adqisable
a provision such as iI suggest ehould be put

eyes te the fart that the 65 men frem Quebec,
and the members from Ontario, and Nova
Scotin, and the other provinces, represent
public opinion and public judgment in their
respective provinces; and they bave twice

deliberately set their seal, unanimously, te the
mensu-re which. is now before us.

Se that I

cannot justify opposing this Bill by merely
saying that tbe Taschereau Goveroment, or
the Ferguson Government, or tbe Rhodes

Government, er nny other local Government,
bas net bren consulted in the matter as it
might have been censulted.
These are reasons whicha influence me,
altbough, like Cther honourable members of
this Housô, I look on this measure as
uniworkable; but at, the expiration of a year's
tine I arn willing te defer te the judgment

of the Government, of the flouse of Cernmens, and of the country as expressed in the

general electien.
Anyene wbo rends British parliamentary
history during the period when Campbell-

Bannerman :ind Lord Asquith were occupying
prominent positions, and when tlhe flouse of
Lords deliberately set itself te throw eut
legislatien whirh was passed by the bouse of
Couinions at the instance ef a Liberal
Goveroment, knows that when that Liberal
Governrnent wvent te the country and was
again endorsed, and in the follewing, Session
sent hnck that saine legislation. the bouse of
Lords put il, through as a matter of course,
without, a murmur. That serns te me te be
ihe situaîtion in which wve are placed in this
i egaril te-day.
I do net know that I have an 'ything further
te saY excrpt this, I ani go.ing te vote for this
Bill, but like another honourable member of
this IIouse I want ne liole-and-corner Cernmittee on it. 1 want it carried throug-h in tbe

broad sunlight, in a Committee of the Whole
flouse. Let every honourable member take
his responsibility. I arn net willing that wben
this flouse closes its deors the Liýberal members and Liberal politicians will ho able te
parade the country from east te west and say:

"The Tory Senators threw the B3ill eut."
If tbere is te be any tbreswing eut we will all
take a hand in it, and if there is te bae any
keeping in we will ahi ýtake a band and al
take the responsibility, and take it here in tbe

wil'l be no back dooýr te scutthe out after the

flon. Hi. W. LAIRD: Reonourable genthemen, I did not intend te participate in this
debate, but 1 have been quiethy waiting, as
H.n.

Mr. TANNER.

it proceeded, in the hope that we might get
sorne further information upon which we might
base our judgment in the vote thaL îs about to
take place.
This is a question which apparently is very
far-reaching, and the best evidence of that is
the length of time it bas been under discussion in this House. When the leader of
the Government introduced this Bill, 1 wa8
interested to see how 'be would put it before
the Huse, in view of the action that was
taken in this Chamber on a previons occasion.
1 listened te himi with very great intcrest, to
learo what arguments he would -put forth io
support of this Government Bill, and at thie
conclusion of his address, I arn stihl waiting
for information which he bas faid to give. lIt
was nt until I read bis speech ;n the record
the ncxt day that I realized how littie he had
said in support of the Bill. I have bis speech
here. I fis some two and a quarter pages of
the record, and I find that, out of that total of
twe and a quarter pages bis remarks in support
of this Government mnensure are confined te
merely a quarter of a column.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Did the honourable gentleman expert that I should repeat
the fairhy long speeches that 1 masde last Session on this Bill?
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: 1 did not, expect the
honourable gentleman would repeat bis fairly
long speeches on the previous occasion, but 1
did expect th it he would elucidate, the sub.iect at ic:îst te a sufficient extent to carry
conviction te the Ilouse which hiad rejected

it, on a previeus occasion. My argument is
this, that he flot onîy did net do so. but that
eut of four and a quarter celumns devotcd to
bis address there was a more quarter of a
column that related te this particular Bill, and
aIl of the balance of bis remarks was a prediction about sometbing that might corne in
the future, and which this lieuse ;s net called
upen te decide at this time.
Not having received any information from
the honourabie leader of the Government, and
in view of the general attnck which bas
been made from this side of the Chamber, 1

naturally expected that the supportera3 of this
Bill would furnish some information or argument to supplement the remarks ef the leader
of the Government. I think we may take it
for granted that if there was anytbing that
couId be said for it, it w-ould be said by the

leader of the Government.

We know bis

eminent capacity; every ene of us bas admired
his ability and efflciency in this Huse. We
have seen him in some pretty tight cornera
frem which he emerged with flying colors, and
there is ne man in this House or in the

MARCH 23, 1927
Government of Canada who is more astute
in presenting a subI ect than the leader of the
Government in this 'Chamber. I say that to
do him credit. But 1 also say this, that not
hav'ing had the information from hlm, I
naturally expected that ai this debate proceeded we would have heard from some of
-his supporters who are sitting behind hinr.
Why have wie not heard from them? I appeal
to, honourable gentlemen, la it because there
is not ample talent bebind bim? I do not
think anyone can say that. The bonourable
gentleman bas sitting beside bim a gentleman
who bas held high positions in this country,
(Hon. Mr. Murpby), one of the most capable
men wbo ever graced a Cabinet position in
the Dominion of Canada, one whom 1 heard.
on one occasion, with much interest, "nailing
a hide on a fence", a performance that will
stand ai a classic in the history of parliadiscussion in this country. There la
-mentary
no kind of fighting in which. the bonourable
gentleman is not an adept; he la good botb in
defence and on the àttack. I naturally expected that be would supplement an support
bis Leader, but so far we have beard nothing
frons hlm.
We have another eminent gentleman witb
us.here, the right honourable gentleman from
Brockville (Rigbt Hon. G. P. Graham) a man
wbo bas probably occupied a higher position
in the Government of Canada than any other
man in this House; and entirely capable and
able to express himself and defend a legislative propo.sal which ithe Government, of which
he was a member, only a year or two ago
pre.sented. Have we beard anytbing from him
in support of his Leader'a contention that
this la good. legisiation which shoud be
approved by this Chamber? If he bas said
anytbing to assist us, I have-not beard it.
We have also another gentleman who bas
occupied a place in the Cabinet Council, the
honourable gentleman f rom New Brunswick
(Hon. Mr. Copp); and we have heard not
one word from bim.
Then there is our frîend from De Lanaudiere
(Hon. Mr. Casgrain) a gentleman who bai a
knowledge extending over a very wide range
of subi ects. There is hardly a subject you
ean mention upon wbich he does not give some
intelligent expression of opinion. No man is
more versatile than he la, and no man makes
more real use of bis versatility than the
bonourable gentleman. Yet, be is as dumb as
the proverbial oyster.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: They are all
qualifying for the old age pension.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: There la no pension
provided under tbe Bill for the dumb.

159

I can extend this further indefinitely. We
have in this flouse a gal1axy of 'new ta-lent,
gentlemen wbo were members of the House
of Commons wben this Bill was presented
and received with sucb acclaim only a year
ago. We bave net beard from them ini
justification of fheir position at that time,
or in justification of this Bill.
We have anotber gentleman, reeently appointed from the city of Montreal (Hon. Mr.
McDougald), who, I understand is the white
hope of the party; a gentleman wbo is quite
able to express himself and to give this flouse
the information whicb is so sadly lacking in
view of the failure of tbe Leader of the Governinent to produce it.
So, I say, bere we are, face to face witli
important legiÉlation of this kind which is
being attacked from every angle and corner
of tbis side of the House. It is called a bad
Bill, it is called an unworkable Bill; it is
called an unconstitutional Bill; and yet there
is net a soul on the 'Government side to get
up and lend bis support to the Leader of the
Government in presenting it. What is an
unsophisticated member of this House, .like
myseif, to do under the circumstances? What
are any of us to do? Well, in the absence
of information from these honourable gentlemen. in the absence of any further justification than we have had, I am forced to use
my own best judgment; and I have just come
to a conclusion-arrived at only a few minutes ago-as to what it should be. It is nlot
necessary to repeat what happened after this
flouse dealt with the Bill last year. I was
one of those who voted against tbe second
reading at that time. As I say, it. la not
necessary to repeat, for we all know, what
bappened as a result of our action. Honourable members on this side of tbe House were
placarded from one end of the country to
the other as baving been the destroyers of the
Bill, and as having taken part in the Tory
defeat of the Bill in this flouse.
Then the general election followed, and
this was one of tbe important issues submitted to the electors. In the P-rovince of
Saskatchewan it was discussed on every platform from one end of the Province to tbe
otber, and from reaing the papers from
different parts of Canada, and in conversation
wîtb 'gentlemen from different parts of the
country, I learn that it was the subjeet of
discussion in every Province of this Dominion.
I tbink we can safely say it wss one of the
important factors which led to the decision
at the poIls in Beptember last, as a result of
which the people returned to power the Gev-

if)o

SENATE

ernnwint which. originaIly brought in this
Bill and which wvas rejected in this Chamber.
The people by their action declared this Bill
to be one of the factors at least, and an important factor, in the election. Tbey declared
that they wanted this legisiation.
Now the Government again presents this
Bill, as they are justified in -doing, and we are
face to face with the saine situation whicb

confronted us Iast year. What are we going
to do about it? Last year I opposed the
Bill on principle. I arn of the saine opinion
stili, but I arn face to face with the fact
that since last session a generai eleetion bas
t:îkerî place and the people of the country
have deciared in favour of this legisiation,
and the electcd represcntatives of the people
in the flouse of Commons-representatives
wlio are responsible to the people-have deciared in favour of it and have passed it.
The question arises how far we, as members
of this appointive body, are justified in interposing our own opinion, our own private
judgnient of legisiation of this kind,' in defiance of the registered -wiil of the peopie
and the registered vote of the elected representatives; of the people in the other Chamnber.
My honourahie friend frorn Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Belcourt) suggested that in dealing with
this matter certain niembers of thîs flouse
were actuated by partisan motives. I want to
disibuse anybudy's mind of that narrow view
so far as I arn concerned. I want to take
thie lîrger vicw, in rny opinion the constitutionial vicw, notwithistanding wlîat my owa
personal opinion may be. I believe that the
Bill is unworkable, that it is bad legisiation,
that it is a Bill which could properiy be rejec'ed by this Charnber-nevertheless. the
people of this country having pronounced in
its favour, and having demanded it hy their
votes at the poils, and their elected repre-

sentatives in the other Chamber baving deciared that they wanted it, there is nothing

else for us in this Chamber to do but to
accept it as brought in by the Leader of the
Governrnent and explainei to the best of bais
ability, but yet unexplained. I say the only
thing, for us to do is to accept the Bill and
see that it is put upon the statute book

as it bas corne fromn the people and the
eiected representatives of the people; and if it
shouid turn out later on that our predictions
are correct, there is no responsibiiity upon

us; it lies upon the people wbo demanded it,
and the representatives of the people who
brought down the Bill and put it into effect.

1876 and continue ta 1926. The total repayments of principal to January 31, 1927, and
the amount of principal outstanding as of
January 31, 1927, are shawn ini this statement.
From 1876 to 1928 the security taken amounted
to $15,340,016.63, while the repayments of principal amounted to $12,005,353.77. The balance
of principal outstanding as of Ja.nuary 31, 1927,
amounts to 33,334,662.86. In connection with
the joint boans, or loans made under the 50
per celit agreemnent, payments by the Dominion to the province af Alberta amounted
to $875,108.09, -and to Sa.skatchewan to 1290,91352, while the total repayments from
Alberta have arnounted to $163,305.31 and
from Saskatchewan to 337,514.20, or a total
repayment of $200,819.51. That is the statement regarding the two provinces and the
boans on this accofunt. It shows the financial
situation as it stands to-day.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: As I underst-and it, then,

SECXOND) READ)ING

The Sonate reiiiined from yesterday the

an Act respecting Old Age Pensions.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:

Right Hion. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Tlieni I will witlidraw iny reînark in that
res~pect and say that during the consideration
of this Bihl in the Honu.e I expresscd at length
nmv own views and opinions on the Bill. It is
net nece-sary for mie te repeat those, but since
last wec liad tbis matter beforC us some things
bave taken place.
Shortly, my ideas run along this line, and
1 have formed those ideas largely ont of experience and observation during my lifetime.
Contemporaries of my own time, are in my
mmnd now, many of them, who considered it
net only a duty but a privilege, after having passed through the sustaining years of
parental caro and provision-a duty which
thicy cheerfully assumed, and a privilege of
which they gladly availed themselves--to take

MARCU 24, 1927
car~e of those who had been the source of
their nourishment and care througb rnany
years of youth.
1 have noticed that in those cases tbis conduct; bad a double effect: it made for personal
self-reliance and responsibility, and for the
strengthening of family ties, that a boy
should tbink himself flot only as fulfiliing a
duty but exercising a privilege, in the old
age of his parents, when they needed bis effort
and his aid, by helping them. 1 arn sure
sueb convictions aid and strengthen that invisible but very important family tie that
binds youth and old age together and makes
a soliid and durable unit and thus adds stability
to the nationhood which is made up by those
units.
On the other hand, I have observed that
under the old age pension system there is a
certain arnount of influence taken away from
the thouglit, whicb should be in every man's
mind tbrough his business and working days,
that by frugality and economy, by methode
of life insurance or otherwise, he shouid prepare in days of health, strengtb and labour
capabîlity, for rainy days, as we sometimes
eall tbem, which are sure to corne to ail af
us sonie time in Our lives. My fear is that
if we give the youth the idea that when the
rainy days corne the Governrnent will step in
and do what formerly was withîn bis own
power to do, there will be a weakening of the
bond of which 1 have spoken and consequently
an injury to the character and stability of
family life and nationbood.
As a niember of tbe Senate I do flot have
to go back for election-I have bad my fuill
share of elections in My lifetime-but as a
Senator I have opinions wbich are partly personal, but which also have been evolved from
experience and observation during my course
of public life. From these I have formed my
view of aid age pensions, but in my opinion,
when once measures of an important character of this kind corne up in the popular
Chamber, and are debated and canvassed and
passed, and corne here, it is quite within tbe
purview of a Senator to say: "This legislation wili flot be hurt by being held for a
tirne for furtber consideration."l
But 1 think there cornes a time wben the
Senator takmng that view which bas been
çvolved through bis observation and experience durinig a period of public life, must
say. .to birniîf : "Af ter ail, if the popular
body, and tbe people directly responsible for
iti election, have had an opportunit>' ta think
it over and pa.ss upon a certain subjeet, and
then a second opportunit>' to deliberate upon
it and reacb conclusions, and if the popular
bcidy lateiy elected, in circumetances of that

165

kind, concludes to persist in its legislation,
shall I strong>' press my personal opinion
against this tendency of the popular view as
expressed in the popular House, or shail I
to a certain extent subordinate that, and let the
measure go througb?"'
Now, witb reference to this measure, I do
flot believe in the principle on wbich it is
founded. I do flot believe it bas the elements
of justice or fairness in it. I do not believe
it is possible in its present state to be carried
out. But it bas been placed before the Senate
for the second time, after the popular body
lias been cbanged. Therefore my position today is this: I let it go back witb ail its
imperfections on its bead, witb aIl its inconsistency and practical impossibility, witb
the idea that when it cornes down to the
point of application, wbere flowery speeches
and general approbations bave very littie force,
whien it gets before members of the Federal
Government, and members of different provincial Governments, it will be found to be
sucli an arnalgami of impossibiiities, impractieabilities and unfairnesses, that there will be an
attempt to produce a measare wbich may
corne ag-ain before the popular assembl>' and
before the Senate. having as its principal feataires those factors which I believe are essential ta the proper working otit of a successful
pension insurance scherne for old age.
Taking that view, I do flot propose to vote
agamnst the second reading of this Bill; but
in letting it go back to follow tbe course
which it seems to me it is bound to take I
bave hopes that in future we may have a
meastxre before bath Houfes which will include contributions ta the scbeme, and there
will be within it the nerve and soiidity and
fairness that wiii dû something towards belping eacb penisioner in each case. It may also
liave a double or trebie contribution, from
the, man wbo labours, bis employer, and tbe
io%,ernment of the pravince or the nation
wbich is vitaIlY interested in getting a happy
citizensbip.
B3' combining these things we
may untirnately meach a measure whicb it
'seems to be fairly impossible ta avoid seuring in view of the trend in variaus countries
of the worid and the trend amongst OUT own
population.
When that measure cornes it
may work out to the benefit and stability of
Our common country.
I like ta have my views, and I like to fight
for tbem as lon~g as the>' are tenable. I iike
also ta be i the position of mraking fair com-,
promises when I sec a proper opportunit>'.
That is my position now, and -I think my
honourable friend for hie courte.>' ini allowiiig
me ta state tlhat before I give my vote.

SENATE

166

Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Honourable gentlemen, before we get to second reading of this
Bill I would like to take a few minutes. When
this measure was before the House last year
I voted against it, and I see no reason whatever why I should change my vote this year.
There did not seem to be any good reason
last year why the measure should be passed,
and nothing tas occurred since then to make
me dhange my judgment. I understnod last
year, and I think it was stated in the Senate,
that the Prime Minister was going to have
an interview with the Prime Ministers of the
different provinces, to see if some arrangements could not be made by which a measure
could be brought in that would receive the
assent, more or less, of the different provinces.
So far as I know and understand, that meeting has never taken place, and no effort whatever bas been made to find out the views of
the different provinces on the subject.
Personally, I think this is a subject that
ought to be left altogether to the provinces,
which have the care of the old and infirm,
and wlbich have made different arrangements
for the care of those people. I cannot understand why the Dominion Government
should rush in and want to take that duty
from the provinces, and expend large sums
of money for carrying out such a plan, which
bas been estimated, by those familiar with
the matter, to cost in the course of a few
years something like $25,000,000 to $50,000,000
a year from the Dominion treasury. That is
a lot of m.oney, and why should we expend
that money when nobody, or practically nobody, is asking for this measure?
There is another reason why I do not like
this Bill. One province may agree to join
with the Dominion Government and pay its
50 per cent of the pension, and another
province riglit beside it may not do so;
but the province that does not join tas to pay
its share of the 50 per cent that the Dominion
pays, which to my mind is absolutely unfair.
Why should one province be able to pay a
half, and have the Dominion pay the other
half, while a province that does not want to
go into the arrangement bas to pay its
share of what the Dominion pays? To my
mind that is certainly unreasonable and unfair, and, What is more, it cannot be worked
out in practice.
However, I think there is another
reason, and I believe it is one on which
a great many honourable gentlemen in
this House are going to support the
Bill, and that is that it will put the
child on the doorstep of the Dominion
I do not
Government, where it belongs.
think the Dominion Government has any intention of putting this measure into force.
Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

Its whole object is to put the Bill before
the Senate on purpose that the Senate may
knock it out. That is what they want, and
if the Senate should knock out the Bill, it
would create a good election cry for the Goverinment at the next election; at least, they
think so. Personally, I doubt it very much;
and, what is more, I do not believe in voting
for a measure that I think is iniquitous inerely
for the purpose of putting the Government
in a hole, for that is what it will amount to.
Therefore, I intend to vote against the Bill
under any and all circumstances, because I
think it is not good legislation.
The Government refused to allow any
amendment in the other Chamber. Now, Iam
in faveur of old age pensions properly put
into legislation, but I do not favour anything
that might be jumbled together without any
common sense. Under this Bill, those who
participate in a pension would not have to
contribute anything. Now, if there is anything on earth that will make people unthrifty,
it will be a plan under which they can
say: " Well, it does not matter whether we
are prepared for our old age or not: the
Government comes to our rescue, so we may
as well have a good tiie and spend all our
We know that many people do
money."
spend their money in all sorts of folly, leaving it to someone else to look after them in
their old age; whereas if we had contributions
from those who are to receive the pension
when they reach the age of 70 years, or whatever age might be fixed, there would be an
incentive to them to be thrifty, to work and
to save their money; but under this Bill the
opposite will be the case. For that reason
I am very much opposed to the measure. If
something along the line suggested yesterday
by my honourable friend from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) were introduced, I
think we might perhaps get a Bill that would
be more or less acceptable.
We should remember that we have a
measure on the statute book to-day, the Annoities Act. which I think was introduced
by the late Sir Richard Cartwright years ago,
by which there are small payments made,
and towards which the Government helps. I
would rather see the Government help, and
help extensively, to provide a pension for
the old people when the time came, provided
that during their lifetime the pensioners had
That
paid something towards the fund.
would be a workable scheme; but this one is
to my mind altogether unworkable, and I
do not propose ·to vote for it.
I did not intend to say much about this
Bill, but I wanted to make my views clear;
and I am not going to be coerced into voting

MARCE 24, 1927
for a mneasure that I think is ne good, for
the sake of helping the Government, or the
opposition, or anybody else.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Before the honourable
gentleman begins to speak, se that I may not
interrupt him, I would like to -ask a question.

word.s, not at ahl by way of argument sa te
how any other honourable gentleman should

attitude in the matter of the vote I intend
te give.
When this measure was before the House

of what I thought was right. I have been
subjected te considerable criticism on the
part of friends, and on the part cf otihers
»fio perhaps are not friends, for the vote I
gave and for the course which I toolk, and it
is on that account principally that I want
toe peak to-day Tather than vote again in
silence.
]f voted against the measure last year sirn4ply
because, as a matter of principle, I personally
arn unalterably oppoeed to the w'hole ides
of pensions being .paid by the State. We
have pensions to the right of us and pensions
to the hef t cf us; pensions very plentiful, it
seemne te me; and in thinking over the list
of the different classes within the country to
which pensions are alotted by law, I can thin],
cf but one clam by whom, it seems te me,
they are earned, and te whom payment
is just right-tbat is, te the soldier, or tec
the soldiers' family when a man lias lest his
life in the service of his country.
.Hon. Sir ALLEN AYLEÏSWORTH: But,
thinking cf other classes in the eommunity,
is it possible te consider payment cf a pension in any other light than as the payment
of a gratuity, a gift, pure and simple?
That I arn net insincere in holding strong
views on the subject, I have an opportunity
cf demonstrating. Twenty years ago or more
I came into the House of Comnmons et a turne
when pensions iiad just been established for
Ministere of the Crown. I thought-I think
stifi-the general public feeling in the country
7as very mucli oppcsed te, that clamsocf pensions; and when, during the firet Session in
which I was sitting as a member cf the Houae
cf Commong, a proposition was made te repeal the statuts which awarded such pensions
to Ministers of the Orown, I teck ocasien te advocate aud support the repealing
statuts as strongly as I was able.

167

It is a matter of lif elong conviction, I may
say, on my paTt, because from my earliest
recollection i the household at home, the
matter of pensions to publie servante used
frequently to be a subi ect of conversation
and discussion, and possibly I arn prejudiced
by my knowledge of the way in which the
ordinary farmer of this country of fifty or
sixty years ago Iooked at the whole subject.
To his mind it was the payment from, or the
taking from, the public treasury of money
which was neyer earned, and which it was
morally wrong that anyone should pay or
1hat anyone should receive.
I arn not for a moment losing sight of the
views of honourable gentlemen opposed altogether to mine, but I amn greatly fortified
by some of the -opinions which were exprssed during the debate st year by different members of this House. I want to,
speak especially of the admirable presentatiosi
of the tase again8t the payment ot-pensionh
which was then -made by the right honourable
gentleman from Ottawa. I felt myseif entireiy
in accord with every argument which he then
put f orward in such a masterful f ashion. I
regret that circumetances have so changed that
to-day it seems that he and I cannot stand
side by side i our vote, any more than we
have been able to do se i the past. It is
only a few months since, in the voting i the
provincial elections in Ontario, each of us
found hi.mself ,in the position Jn which the
Indian was when he sai "Indian not lest, but
wigwam lost',. Apparently we are stI flot
able to see things from the eame point of
view.
.Now, 1 want to say sirnply that the way in
which this question strikes me is this. We are
here as members cf Parliamient, dealing with
moneys which are flot our own. Bach of us
has contributed bis share, it ie true, but in
the main the public moneys are paid into
the treasury by the general body cf taxpayers.
We are in eontrol of thuse moneys. Have
we any more righit, morally speakcing, to
legisiate to pay out one dollar of those moneys
etherwise than for the general public benefit
of the country, than we should have if we
were private trustees holding in our hbands the
funds of other people? It does not seecito
me that we have, honourable gentlemen, and
I cannot bring myseîf to vote in support cf
this measure.

coming year? Would it amount te $20,000,000, $25,000,000 or $30,000,000?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:

$40,000,000.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.
I cau readily
answer by honoura-ble friend by telling him
that the Main Supply Bill contains nothing
for tbis puirpose. If the Senate passes the
Bill the Governiment may include a certain
suma in the Suppementary Estimates; yet I
arni inclined to doubt that it will, because
wvhen the Bill becornes law, and then only, it
wvill be the duty of the Goverement to get in
touch with the Provincial Governments to se
if tbey are inclined to accept the present
s'cbeme.
If the Provinces are inclined to
accept the scheme, then there will be negotiatiens as to the conditions surrounding the
contract or agreement. This will take place,
I suppose, sorne time; and then a sum may be
included in next year's Estimates te pay
whatever would he due to the Provinces thiat
have corne under the scheine. My bionourable friend rnust net forget that the expeniture wil fir.'c bave te be made by the
Province s, anI thiat it xviii be aftcr a certain
îîu'ied that the amiouint xviii be asked fromn
the Federal treasury. The Federai Government cannot pay anything under this Bill,
nor under any agreement with the Provinces,
tili they have made their election.

Now, bonourahle gentlemen, I do flot intend
to speak at length on this matter in spite
of the invitation of certain bononrable gentiemoen on the other side cf the House. I have
iust listened to my honoîîrahle friend from
Tor-onto (Hon. Sir Allen Aylesworth) stating
that last year bie gave a silent vote against
the Bill, and that be intends to maintain
the saine attitude to-day. He tells us tbat
he is actuated by principle.
Well, thiat, is
very haudable,, and I applaud bim for following a principle to, xhich be bias adhered from
cbiidhood. I confess that I bave net been
abie te find wbat principle actuates me in
my present decision, or to go back to a
principle upon wbich I can rely; I confess
that I have been actuated more by sentiment.
I have been actuated by sentiment because
of my daily experience in coming in contact

MARCH 24, 1927
Employers have 'been withdrawn from the
contact that they used to have with their
employees.
Now, this i.s an age of demnocracy and Parliament is supreme.
Parliament represents
the people, and the question now arises in
every Paliament of the world: "Shall not the
State becorne t3he father, or -the employer, and
represent the anonymous employers Who sit
in board rootns within four watts, a mile or
more away fromn their emiployees, and shall
nlot Parliument think of the men in the street,
the men in the rain, who have done a good
day's work snd who have neyer feIt that their
employment was secure?"
I amn speaking of
the mas,;s of men working in the streets and on
the farms, who have net enjoyed Vhat security
of employment wh'ich our emp]oyees and the
employees of large corporations have enjoyed,
but who ïromn week to week may be turned
off and compelled to return home 'to their
wive.s and their childen and tell thema that
t'hey have lost.their jobs and their means of
earning a livelihood.
During their lifetime
these men have been haunted by the fear
which faces the labouring population throughout the world, and -the knowledge that from
day to day and from year to year old age
an'd inability fo labour are creeping upon
them.
Now, what are we doing?
The Federal
State, which has a mucli more buoyant treasury
than many of the Provinces, as has been
stated during this debate, tells the Provinces
tha*t if they wîiý accept help the Dominion
will share witli themn fifty-fifty in establishing
old, age pensions.
It is nlot coereing those
provinces.
The very first clause says that
the Government rnay enter into an agreement
with any province.
It has been said, and repeated more than
once, that we would discourage thrift. WeIl,
to this date there has heen no old age pension
system in Canada; thrift has not been discouraged by the existence of pensions; yet we
have throughout the land that sorrowful situation of men reaching 65 or 70 'without having
saved any.thing for their old age. We find
that oondition amýong the classes. We find it
amonég our so-called aristocracy, which is
hothing but our bourgeoisie, as weil as among
those wbo work with their brawn. There are
thousands of men -who become incapacitated
without having laid aside anlything for their
old age.
tIon. GEO. LY1NCH-STAUNTON: Would
*the Ixonourable gentleman allow me te ask
hiiù' a question here? I have in mimd a. numlièe f 'Men who are contributing to a pension
fund. from. which they will receive, say, 844 a
m~nhIam not sure of the exact amount.

Now, will those men be eligible to receive
anything under this seheme after they have
begun to Teceive the pension to which they
have been contributing?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My simple
answer is that alI men and women who. are
not in possession of an income amounting to
$365 a year are entitled to something under
this Bill. If they have $350 they are entitled
to $15, and sO forth.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: Wîll it
not be to the interest of people now contributing to a pension seheme to drop out of it?
WilI not this Bill, if it becomes law, kill al
the pension associations from which men who
are now contributing are to receive, say $30?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I doubt very
much that any man who has been contributing
for some years to a fund froma which he is to
be allowed a certain amount will relinquish
the advantage of that fund.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But what
I mean, honourable gentlemen, is this. WiIl
it net be money in such a manes pocket to drop
eut? It will ho to his advantage, se far s I
can sec. I am not speaking now as to the
policy. A mnan may now be contributing to
a pension fund which will give him, we will
say, $400 a year. If this Bill becomes law,
wili he not say to himself, "It is money in my
pocket te drop this altogether"?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not think
that he would. My honourable friend cites a
case where the beneficiiry would receive, at
the end of a certain period, $400. In this instance the amount he could get would be 3240.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH--STAUNTON:
No; he
will get double. It will be from the province
and the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It is $240 ail
told. It is 8120 per annum, or $10 per month,
which is contributed by the Federal Government.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: He gets 820 a month.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That m-akes 8240
a year, but the Federal Government furnishes
only 50 per cent of that sum.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It seems
to me you will kill ahl the pension funds in
the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I doubt that
very much.
1 have 'listened with considerable interest
Io the whol.e debate on this Bill. There has
been in three or four instances some critic:smn
of the speech I made on Presenting this
measure. It wvas held that my remarks were

SENATE
not sufficiently affirmative and lacked enthusiasm.
The honourable
member for
Reina (Hon. Mi'. Laird) wvas one of the
complainants. I think I arn justified in asking him to read again my short explanation
of the Bill. I wvonder if it did flot inspire
hais own speech. I have listened to ail the
reason- he lias given for altering his vote and
favouring the measure, and there is net one
of those reasons which I have flot stated in
my own speech. The honourable gentleman,
as weIl as others, Ivas surprised at the time
I devoted to an explanation of'a contributory
seheme.
I did so for a purpose. Allilie
details of that seheme I took from statements
made, either in the Huse of Commons or in
public, by the Minister who introduced this
Bill, and I emphasized, the contrihutory phasc
of the scherne hecause Great Britain has felt,
the necessity of adding te its first measure.
its gift of free pensions, a contributory system. I feit, and I stili feel, that even if we
had a contrhbutorv scheme to present te the
honourahie niemibers of this Chamber it would
ho absolutely necessary te pass an enactrnent
containing the principle of this present Bil:,
becaus 'e men of 70, 65 or 60 cannt he asked
te pay the premiums which wou]d he necessary te entitle thema te a fair pension at 70.
There is a period which we rnust take care
of, and that period may be fifteen or it rnay
be twenty years.
I mention the importance of a contrihutory
scherne in order to draw the attention of the
Prime Ministers of the varieus provinces te
the desirahility of hastening te place upen
their Statute Books a scheme of that kind,
and I arn in hopes that when they mneet in
Ottawa next summer, or ncxt autumn, they
will to-ether examine the question whether
thev shlould net enaet sucli a Iaw in their
respective provinces. I say this because 1 arn
aware that a seme like the one I present
te yeu, which should last, and must last, about
twenty years, is in many instances a radier
heavy burden. One does net need te he a
professor of econemies te recognize that you
cannot charge a budget with a fairly large
sum without providing the ways and means.
The treasurers of the various provinces wil
have te examine inte their finances and se",
how they are te meet that fairly large obligatien, arid from this day forward they can
make arrangements for a Bill which will cover
net the present tîme, but the future, and
which will help the scharne te become selfsupporting.

the Gevernment dees net
anticipate that the Bill at present undýer ceninterrupt-that

sideratien will be acceptable te tihe provinces.
That hein.- the case, hew dees the heneurable
leader justify the action of the Government
in going te the country, in the recent election,
and promising relief under this present
measure?

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Government could net promise more.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Gevernment could net promise more than ivas within
the four corners of the Bull introduced last
year. I do net know how political discussion
is carried on in the ether provinces, but in
oui' province there are often joint meetings
and a public man who innunts the rostrum
and advances an argument that can be assailed
and destroyed by the speaker following him
is a very bad tactician indeed.
Hon. Mr. LYNC'HSTAUNTO'N: Oh, ne;
hie will be talking te another audlience.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Tlie campaign
lasts five or six weeks, and lie can easily be
aiiswercd hy another speaker the day after
lus remna'ks have appeared in the press.
The reasen why the Government have
însisted upen placing this legislation on the
St.atute Book is t.hat the Prime Ministers may
know what is the will of the Federal Parliament and what Parliament is prepared te
give them. It will then be for them te decide
whether or net they will corne under this
sehieme.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
Ceuld
they net he told that at the conference?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: At the conferencr', among the niine or' ten different parties,

are ail in the same boat. They mnust ail turn
te their ewn people for money with whieh te
pay the pensions. If nny suggestion cernes

from them whicha weuld justify an amendment, the Federal Government wihl undouhtedly take hced and embody the amend-

ment in a Bill at the following Session. Se
I do net sec that we need be very much
alarmed ever the accusation that we are
inorally coercing the provinces. They often
stand together te reisist federal encroacliment,
and fromn to-day on they can adopt a uniform
pol-icy for thr'ir own governance in the years

te corne.

The Federal

Governrnent might

ask the conference, "Would you be disposed

MARORI 24, 1927
ta do this if we did that?" but that wauld be
only an academic question. Who knows what
the House of Commons, and more especially
the Senate of Canada, rnight decide?
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: May I ask the honourable gentle.man a question? The Governinent
knew that a conference was to be held between
the provinces and the Federal Gavernient.
Why didthey flot delay this piece of legisiation until the conference was held and somne
conclusion reached as ta what the provinces
wanted?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This Bill wil
ha an officiai expression of the opinion of
Parliament, which the provinces will have
before them. I may answer my honourable
friend by teliing him that the decision ta call
a conference for next summer, or next autumn,
arase out of the 'Maritime Rights question,
treated in the Duncan Report, and nat diréetiy
in connection with aid age pensions. It is
my own idea that this matter should corne
before the next conference.
Now, as a prelude or preface ta aur discussion on old age pensions yesterday afternoon we had a reference by the houourable
gentleman fram Pictou (Hon. Mr. Tanner) ta

I rise to make a
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE:
suggestion to the honourable gentleman, as
to whether he will accept this amendment:
That this Bill be referred to the Standing
Conînittee on Banking and Commerce with the
following

instruction:

Several Hon. SENATORS: No, no.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Will honourable
gentlemen permit me to read what I have
prepared before they say no?
That this Bill be referred to the Standing
Comnittee on Banking and Commerce with the
following instructions:
lst. To invite the Prime Minister of each
Province to give his own opinion or that of
his Governenient on the Bill with all snggestions he may be prepared to inake.
2nd. To obtain from the Dominion Government or proper Departnents, and experts in
the inatter, stateinents showing approxiiately
the total amount of the expenditure involved
from year to year, for say twenty years, by the
operation of the Bill.
3rd. To cause to be prepared by experts in
the natter, draft Bills as per 01(1 Age Pensions
systems in force in Great Britain, in France,
in Gerimany am in Belgiie, respectively, with
sueli modifications as mîay be necebsary to imake

such draft Bills applicable to and workable in
Canada.
4thî. To examne and report back Bill No. 70
with such aiendiments as the Coinmittee miay
deei advisable and with the statenients and

draft Bills above nentioned.
If I am allowed, I will say this.

I have

consulted perhaps the best expert in America

-I am not authorized to use his name today-and I have before me a statement
showing the amount of the expenditure, and
honourable niembers of the House will be surprised when those figures are given. I think it
is the duty of every member of this House,
before finally passing upon this Bill, to have
an open mind and receive any information
that may be available for us. I ask the
honourable leader of the Government if he
would be disposed now to move that the
Bill be referred to the Committee, as has been
suggested, with the instructions which I have
read.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I will move that this Bill be
referred to the Committee of the Whole
House now, but if any honourable gentleman desires to move in amendment that it
be sent to a Special Committee I will leave
every member free to express, by his voice,
his preference.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: But the honourable
member would vote against it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, but I took
care to qualify. I am moving my Bill into
Committee of the Whole, and of course I
will have to vote for the Committee of the
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

Whole, but I declared, so that my voice might
be heard' by every member, that whatever
the Senate decided, in its free mind, would
be agreeable to me.
I inove that the House go into Committee
on the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I move, in amendment, that all the words after "that" be
struck out, and that this Bill be referred to
the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, with the instructions I have read.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: The honourable gentleman would oblige us by reading his amendment again.
Hon. Mr. BEiQUE: It is intended to oblige
the Committee to report back all the informat:on it may have received, so that this House
in Committee of the Wiole may bave the
entire record before them.

Hon.
Mr. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, I think it should be kept in mîîind
an-id pointed out at this tinie that it is now
three years since a Special Conimittee o: auother House niade a study and a report.
That report was to the effect that the Governnent of Canada should sumnion a conference of representutives of the various provinces and go into al tiese matters tht the
honourable neniber froin De Salaberry (Hou.
Mr. Beique) now suggests should be taken
up by a Comimîitttee of this House.
It is between two and three years since that

was proposed.

Now, approaching the close of

this Session, with prorogation of Parliament

runoured to occur around Easter, it is proposed to go into an investigation which should
have been commenced at least two years
ago. I feel that the honourable member is
not wholly sincere in naking that suggestion
at this late date, and lue did not do so last
year.
Hon. MIr. BEIQUE: Does the honourable
gentleman feel justified in saying that I am
not sincere? To show my sincerity I am
willing to add a date within which the Comnittee will be obliged to report, and I will
be satisfied with 15 days, possibly 8 days, I
think that in 8 days the Committee will be
able to report.

MAROH 24, 1927
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourable friend were wholly sincere it would seem
to me that he would want ta follow the lead
of the Government and let this Bil go to
the Committee of the Whole House; then,
if difficulties arose, - and imperfections were
found of such gravity that it would be necessary to get information of the character outlined in his amendinent, it would be time
enough to suggest some back-parlour antics
in connection with this Bill.
I respectfully submit, honourable gentlemen,
that the proper thing to do is to submit this
Bill to the Committee of the Whole House
and discuss it openly before the House and
the country, and arrive at our conclusions
here and nowhere else.

CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

The Senate went into Committee on the
Bill.
Hon. Mr. Robinson in the Chair.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would ask Mr.
Brown ta please corne to. the floor.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Mr. Chairman, I move:
That the Committee rise and report progress
and ask leave ta sit again on the 31st of this
month, and that in the meantime the Clerk of
this House be instructed:
lst. Ta invite the Prime Minister of each
Province ta give his own opinion or that of his
Government on the Bill with all suggestions lie
may be prepared ta make.
2nd. Ta obtain from the Dominion Government or proper Departments and experts in the
matter, statements showing approximately the
total amount of the expenditure involved from
year ta year, for say twenty years, by the operation of the Bill.
3rd. To cause ta be prepared by experts in
the matter, draft Bills as per Old Age Pensions
systems in force in Great Britain, in France,
in Germany and in Belgium, respectively, with
such modifications as may be necessary ta make
such draft Bills applicable ta and workable in
Canada.
I would suggest that the Clerk wire to the
Provincial Prime Ministers for information.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Lost.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Mr. Chairman, I gave
my reasons for voting against the Bill and
now I wish to give my reasons for voting
against this motion. I voted against the
Bill, and I will vote against it again if I
ever have the chance. The Bill interferes
with the Provinces-there is no getting away
from that; it is a usurpation by the Parliament of Canada of the powers of the Provinces under the British North America Act.
When the national Government takes it upon
itself to appropriate one of the duties that
falls to the Provinces within the constitution,
and says in effect: "We are going ta tell you
what to do with that particular thing," as
they do in section 3 of the Act, and then
say, "If you do not do it we sec a way
Whereby you may be made to do it-"
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I rise to a point
of order. My honourable friend is discussing
the principle of the Bill.
Hoan. W. B. ROSS: No, I am not: I am
giving the reasons why I am going to vote

against this motion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I be allowed
ta state the point of order?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Orderl

SENATE

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I am not discussing the
principle of the Bill. I discussed that before,
and I am not going to do it again.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If my honourable
friend permits me, I will go on; if he will
not, I am going on anyway.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Oh, ohl
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am rising to a
point of orderSome Hon. SENATORS: Order!
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: -which I have a
perfect right to do without the honourable
gentleman's leave.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Oh, my!
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: My honourable
friend is now making on this motion the
same argument that he made on the motion
for the second reading of the Bill. That is
past and gone. We are now in Committee
of the Whole, and my honourable friend
must confine himself to discussing the Bill
clause by clause.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: We are net discussing
it clause by clause; we are discussing an
amendment that is now before the Chair,
and I am giving my reasons for voting against
that amendment.
Hon. Mr. POIRIER: You are right.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I want to point out
to the honourable gentleman what the principle of the Bill is, not ·o argue it over again.
t
I want to say that this motion, if it leads to
anything, is not going to lead to tihe amendment of this Bill but to the substitution of
another Bill.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: It is net an amendment: it is merely asking for information.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I know that; but I
say that if it leads to anything it must lead
te the substitution of another Bill for this.
Amending a Bill is one thingHon. Mr. BEIQUE: Wil the honourable
gentleman allow me?
Has the honourable
gentleman realized that under this Bill persons confined in the penitentiaries will become
pensioners?
Some Hon. SENATORS: Sure.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: They need it.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: And it is because I
find that a great many here 'have made up
their minds te pass the Bill as it is that I think
it is my duty to try to show that we should
have some light upon it, se that we may
reach a proper conclusion in regard te it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

There may be no amendment at al.
The
honourable gentleman must net take it for
granted, as he is doing, that this will lead te
an amendment Which will change the principle
of the Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: My view of this Bill
is that it is so bad that it ought to be killed.
But I do not get my own way about that.
It is so bad that it cannot be amend'ed. To
refer it to a Committee and get information
from the quarters indicated would net help
me a bit, because there is nothing to be done
with this Bill except to either kill it or let it
go.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Will the honourable
gentleman allowSoen Hon. SENATORS: Order.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I am asking the honourable gentleman who has the floor if he will
permit me to put a question?
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Give him a chance te
nake a statement.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: With his permission.
Does not the honourable gentleman think that
it would be interesting te know if all 'the
Provinces, for instance, are against the Bill?
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: We found that
out before.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I may tell the honourable gentleman that it is just a little late
in the day to be finding out where the Provinces are on this matter. That is one of the
things in which this Government lias been very
negligent-in not finding out before this Bill
was brought here what the 'position was.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We are net the
Government here.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It is the Government
of the day that should have known that.
What we do know, but net in a formal way,
is that two or three or four of the provincial
Governments are against it. We know that,
but the reason why I object te this Bill
going to a Standing Committee is that it is
a Bill which in my view cannot be amended
at al], and to substitute another Bill now is
not within the functions of Parliament. It
is not at all a question of jurisdiction on the
part of either House. Te amend the Bill
would be one thing, and another would be te
attempt te substitute another Bill for it, and
that is the only thing that this Committee
could result in, and the only good it would
do, and that would be irregular. It is not
parliamentary practice.
If there is to be
another Bill brought in, in which provision
would be made for contributions and other

MARCHI 24, 1927
ternis and conditions, as indicated by some
honourable memïbers here, that wili have to
corne as an independent measure: it cannot
be brouglit in by a side wind as au amendmnent
to Vhis Act.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: Mr. Chairman, I
rise Vo a point of order. On a motion for a
Committee Vo rise there ehould be no discussion. IV is the same as with a motion Vo
adjourn. I would like to have your ruiing.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN:- 1 arn noV sure,
honourable gentlemen, that this motion is ini

amn really noV clear on that question. An
ordinary motion Vo rise, report progress, and
asic leave Vo ait again would ha eieariy in

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I could noV
give a decision on the point now. I will have
Vo put the motion as it is, uniesa sonie honourable member can give a reason why it is
noV ini order.
The motion was negatived.
Sections 1 to 7 were agreed Vo.
On section 8-what persons are pensionable:
Honourable gentleHon. Mr. BEIQUE:
men. I rise to move an amendment Vo section
8 The first paragraph reads:
Provision shall be made for the payment of
a pension to every person who, at the date of
the proposed commencement of the pension(a) As a British subject, or, being a widow,
who is noV a B3ritish subject, was such before

Then follow a number of items. I move:
That after the word "who," in the second
lina of section 8, there ba added the words,
"not belonging Vo a class of persons excluded
front the operation of this Act by regulations
passed under section 19 hereof."
Under section 19 the Governor ini Council
lias power Vo make regulations, and Mny mntention is Vo supplemant Vhs amendmnent
which I now propose by an amendaient to
section 19 which would read as follows:
That section 19 ha amended by adding a paragraph giving power to provide by regulation

or a motion hie must put it in writing.
The Hon. the CHIAIRMAN: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I ask if this motion
has been put in writing? I think the honourable member must write out his motion. We
must have it for record. We must know who
makes the motions and who writes them. We
have to watch this Bill very carefully, Mr.
Chairman.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: I have this
motion in writing.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ,DANDURAND:
gentlemen, my honourable friend from, De
Salaberry lias stated why hae desires thia
amendment: it is for the purpose of cover-.
ing an amendment which hie intends aVomove
to section 19, to exclude from the operation
of that clause any prisoners in jail or penitentiary.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is one of my
objects. There are a number of other classes
that might be exciuded f-romn the operation
of the Act.
Hon. G. G. FOSTER: Yea; inmates of
lunatic asylums.
If that is the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
only object, I wouid decline to accept the
amendment, because the persons Vo whom the
honourable gentleman refera would noV be entitled to a pension, as they would be already
pensioners of the State.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: They would be in
receipt of $365?
Yes; they
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
would 'ha in receipt of as mnuch as would

The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: Shail section

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Mr. Chairman,
I desire Vo draw the attention of the Committee Vo an aspect of the matter whieh is
worthy of consideration. I refer particularly
Vo paragraph (b):

17(j

SENATE

May I point ont that one incidence of
the late war was the premiature ageing of
individuals who served in the theatre of operations. This fact is known to ail those who
have corne into contact with ex-service ruen,
and in the view of the Department af
Saldiers' Civil Re-establishment it canstitutes
a distinct problem. Sa I have brought here
an amendment, which is written out, to provide that the iollowing be added at the end
of paragrapb (b) :
Or, in the case of ex-miemibers of His Mlajesty's
For-ces. w)îo have served la any theatre of
oppration for' not less tbiin foin nioîîths anid w-ho
have rcached the age of sixty five years.
It miay be urged that in view af the iact
that the provinces are called upan ta pay a
certain proportion af the pension, this amendment would seek ta lay upon the provinces
a liability which properly ought to rest upon
the Federal Goveroment. The answer ta that
is fairly abviaus. We have already discussed
the constitutional aspect of this case, and it
is agreed by ail ýcancerned that the matter
af aid age pensions is primarily ane for the
Provincial Gavernments, and that the Federal
Gaveroment gratuitausly steps in ta cantribute. Theref are the contributian made by
the Federal Gavernment amply compensates
for this increased obligation. Sa I mave that
amendinent, seconded by my hanaurable,
gallant and learned friend frra Winnipeg
(lion. Mr. MeMeans).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honaurable
gentlemen. I aiii very sorr *v that I e:înnat
accept tiat, amiendment.
There, are twa
rea.sons.
First, the case of the soltliers
described by my hanourable friend must be
taken care ai under a special Bill conccrning
the soldiers..
Secondly, the honourable gentleman would by bis amendment necessarilv
increase the charge which bias been allawed
by resolution -of His Excellency the Governar
General. Under these circumstances. 1 think
the amenclment is out af order.
Hlon. Mr. GRIESBACH: 1 would asýk the
opinion af the Chair on that stîbjeet.

Let us consider the case ai the ex-service
mnan who bas a yearly pension, whi-ch may
or may flot exceed the sum ai $W65 a year.
Let us cantrast twa men who reach tbe àge
ai 70 at the same time. Let us assume for
the sake of argument that a man of 70 is
now 50 per cent disabled, and Jet us put
bis case side by side iNith that af an exservice man of the sane age who bias alsa a
35 per cent disability. One ai these men hias
a total disability ai 85 per cent; tbat is ta
say. 50 per -cent dýisaibility because hie is
70, andl 3.5 per cent disability which hie bias
suffTer'ed as a resuit ai the laite war, and for
wlîich hie is pensianed. The ather man's disahility af 50 per cent is due ta the iact that
lie is 70 years ai age. 1 snbmnit that this
Parlianient, or this Gavernment, bas no rigbt
to deduet froîn that ex-service man the
ainouint af the pension which hie bias earned
under the Pension Act; that, in point ai iact,
the twa cases ai disability are flot at aIl
eqiial, and therefore there aught ta be
excepted from the operatian ai this Act the
amaunt reccived by the one man as a military
pension.
Sa I heg leave ta inove, Mr. Chairman,

tr'aaant and makes no provision at ail for
hie old age.
In the community from which
1 corne, rnany old peoplie--in fact, I think,ý
most of those who have reacdhed the age of
70-who are in indigent circumstances wiII
possess a smail home, and if I interpret this
section aright; it means that; that home wiIl be
taken from, them. This requirement, I think,
will lie a great disappointment te Vhem; not
only that, but they will refuse to avail thernselves of the pension if tliey are obliged to
give up -their property.
I wish to know
whether I interpret this section corréctly, biecause in the recent election. this Pension Bill
was one of the main issues in the constituency
from which I corne, -and it was held by
Li'berals that tihe interpretation placed upon
it hy opponente was not correct. I gave the
interpretation whicli I hawe mentioned as
being the correct one, and I met a number of
oid people Who were surprîsed to learn that
such was the case.
As a resuit, they voted
against the Goverzvrnent candidate, and the
Conservative received. a larger vote in the
constituency than on any former occasion. I
would like -to know if I amn correct.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
This is the
answer which I arn authorized by the Department te make:
This section deals with the case of a pensioner who owns an interest in a dwelling house
in which he resides, and allows a transfer of
the pensioner's interest in the dwelling to the
pension authority which is charged with the
payrnent of pensions. In such case the amount
payable to the pensioner is not subjeet to any
reduction in respect of the annual value of
the pensioner's intereft in the property, but on
the death of the pensioner, or upen his ceasing
to use the dwelling as hie place of residence,
the pension authority is entitled to seli the pensioner's interest and to retain out of the proceeds of such sale the amount of any payments
which have been made by way of pension in excess of the amount which the pensioner would
have recejved if such intereat had not been
transferred te the pension authority, together
with interest at the rate of 5 per cent. In other
words, the section does nlot sanction the repayment of pensions by the sale of the pensiener's
dwelling, but only the recovéry of any excess
amounts with intereit beyond what the pensioner would have received if lie had not made
the transfer.
Section 9 was agreed to.
Sections 10 to 18 inclusive were agreed to
On section 19-power to make regulations:
Honl. Mr. BELCOURT:. 1 move to add
as subsection (s), the following:
(s) The exclusion of persons, or any clasa of
persens, front the operation of the Act.
This is an amendment which my neighbour,
the honourable member for De Salaberry

(Hon. Mr. Béique) was going to move, but he
had to leave the House, and asked me te
move it for him. It is based on an argument
he advanced, that there are people who surely
ought to be excluded fromn the operation of
the benefits of this Act. He mentioned oe
instance, which I need not repeat, but it seems
to be clearly one that would be advisable.
Hon. Mr. DAINDURAND: 1 cannot aceept
that amendment either. Section 19 allows of
regulations, but they are to be "not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act." The
amendment which my honourable friend seeks
was germane to the section which defined
"what persons are pensionable," section 8, but
I cannot sec that this section 19 should define
the classes of persons entitled to benefit. Il
is Parliament that shou¶d define that.'
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I cannot think
that this suggestion of mine is inconsistent
with the general spirit of -the Act. I cannet
conceive for one moment that anybody in the
Government, or the Government as a whole,
ever intended to apply this Act to the people
who are in penitentiaries.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, my honourable friend smiled when I answered hirn
a moment age, but a man who is in a peni.
tentiary is receiving shelter, board, liglit and
heat, and is outside the advantages of this
Bill.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: And lie gets entertainment: they give hima concerts, and ahl
that kind of thing.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Il you want to
make the Act ridiculous, ahl you have te do
is leave it as it is.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Belcourt was
negatived.
Section 19 was agreed to.
Section 20 was agreed te.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I wish to add a
new section 21 as follows:
21. This Act shaîl nlot corne inte force until
and unless at least six provinces shahl have
agreed te co-operate in its application.
I amn not going to ýmake any argument, but
I submait this.
An Hon. SENATOR: That should have
been said belfore the election.
The motion of Hou. Mr. Belcourt was

The preamble and the tithe were agreed to.

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURANiD moved the third
reading of the Bill.
He said: I consider this the most important
Bill of the Session, and I believe that we
should give a twenty-four hour notice for tie
third reading.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: It seems to me that
the phrase "te any other part of Canada" is
wrong.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If the honourable
leader objects to the third reading now, it
cannot be gone on with.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will give the
explanation from the Department:
The amount of fur secured annually from the
N.W.T., is valued at about two million dollars.
Although for upwards of 250 years furs have
been taken fron the area now known as the
N.W.T., yet no tax bas ever been imposed. Net
only Britisi Subjects but Foreigners are privileged to trap fur in that country and expert
it. without a tax or royalty of any kind, except
a nominal fee for hunting and trading licenses.
The object of this amendment is to place in
the bands of the Commissioner in Couneil authority to enact an Ordinance providing for a
tax on the exportation of fur when it is taken
out of the N.W.T.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do not intend
to obstruet my own legislation.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is meant by
"Commissioner in Council"?

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is the title
of a special official, who is at present Mr.
W. W. Cory, but not in his capacity as Deputy
Minister of the Interior.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am ready to

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
SECOND REAI)NG

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 123, an Act to amend the
Northwest Territories Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
is a very simple one. We may be surprised
at one expression used in the Bil. It makes
an amendment to section 8 of the Northwest
Territories Act, chapter 62 of the Revised
Statutes of Canada, as amended by chapter
48 of the statutes of 1925, by adding tiereto
the following paragraph:
The levying of an expert tax upon furs exported fron the Territories to any other part
of Canada or te any foreign country.
When we go into Committee I will ask te
strike out the word "foreign" and say "other
country." I would ask the second reading of
this Bill, and we will now go into Committee
of the Whole, and I will give explanations
there.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not know that I
completely understand this matter. Is it an
expert from the Territory into one of the
provinces, or an export fror the Territories
into a foreign country?
They are two
different things. There is a clause in the
B. N. A. Act which makes trade inter se free.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I believe that
the word "export" is a misnomer. It is rather
the word "royalty" that should be used.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But you cannot call
it royalty if it is connected with a duty.
Hon.

Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: When did he get
that title?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: From an Act of
Parliament. We learn every day of some
functions which are used in the Departm.ents.
I confess I did not know this last week. The
memorandum from the Department proceeds:
A similar tax is in effeet in every other Province, but one, that is in Prince Edward Island,
where there is little fur other than that raised
on the fox farms. In the Yukon the tax takes
the sane form as proposèd in this Bill, namely;
an Export Tax. It is more easily and conveniently administered in this form. The other
Provinces call it a Royalty. It is considered,
however, that the tax can be more advantageously and effectively collected in the N.W.T.,
in the form of an Export Tax.
Another reason is that it is not desired to
levy a tax on fur remaining in the country. The
natives and others who live in that cold country
use fur for their clothing, and it is not the intention of the Government that furs made up
and used for that purpose should be taxed. It
is only when they are exported from the Territories and sent to the fur markets of the World
that it is proposed te levy a tax.
It is proposed that the tax will be se much
per pelt and will amount approximately te 5
per cent of the value of the pelt. The Game
officers of the Prairie Provinces and British
Columbia have come together on this question
and have fixed on a definite tax on each pelt.
It is the intention that our tax will be precisely
the same as that in force in the Western Provinces. There are a few exceptions, such as white
bear and white fox, which animals do net occur
in the Prairie Provinces. In these cases it is
the intention te fix a suitable tax.
The Provinces are also urging us te impose
this tax. The Game officers ef the Provinces
tell us that any time a package of fur is

MAROH 24, 1927
seized the dlaim is made that it came from the
N.W.T. It will materially simplify their work
if the TJ2erritories also impose such a tax.
The value of fur exported yearly from the
North West Territories je approximately $2,000,000 and it ie estimated that the tax the
firet year will amount to over $75,000. This will
assist very materially in the administration of
that far away country.
I believe this is a very fair proposition. It
relates to publie property belonging to the
Crown. People get licenses as hunters, but
large companies are sending out numbers of
men to gather these furs, and the stock may
be depleted. Thus property of importance is
allowed to go without any levy whatever,
while the cost of administration of that Territory is considerable, and if we can colleet
$75,000, that is nlot *a negligible item.
I confess that the words "expert tax" surprised me, but as a matter of fact it is a royalty. We seli timber limite, but we get a stumpage tax for every tree felled.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That does not contravene the Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
No, but I say
that this is a property that belongs to Canada
in the Northwest Territories, juat as is the
case of the forest, and it is only just that
those who assist in opening that territory
should pay a emali tax of 5 per cent.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Honourable gentlemen, there seems to me to, be a principle
involved in this Bill, short though it is, that
ought to have consideration on the second
reading. As I understand the Bill as read, it
proposes that the Northwest Territories, although part of the Dominion of Canada, and
administered by thîs central Government, are
going to set up a tax against the products of
the Northwest Territories that go into other
parts of the Dominion. If that is permissible,
or made lega], so far as the Northwest Territories are concerned, every one of the nine
provinces of Canada can set up tariff walls s
between themeelves. Surely the B. N. A. Act
neyer contemplated that that was going to be
donc.
1 quite agree with my honourable friend
that it je probably desirable to obtain some
revenue so far as expert from Canada is concerned, because there je no market for fure in
the Northwest Territories, and they muet be
exported from, there. If furs eome into some
other part of Canada, and are subsequently
exported to England or the United States, an
export duty might be colleeted; but surely
nlot an export duty on the raw materials corning from one part of Canada into another.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: They are doing that
now.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If that is the intention, surely it je a serious principle to
adopt.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But I draw the
attention of my honourable friend to the fact
that this tax je levied by the western provinces
in the case of their own fure.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If that tax je
levied on furs produced in Saskatchewan, and
sueh furs are shipped jnto Manitoba, doee the
province of Saskatchewan tax the Manitoba
purchaser?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No, it taxes its own.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: They only tax
their own furs in each province.
Hon. Mr. ROÏBERTSON: Surely that is
beyond the juriediction of the provincial Government.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 'My honourable
friend je troubled, as I was on first sight, by
the words "expert tax". I would have no objectionHlon. Mr. ROBERTSON: The objection je
to the exporting "'to any part of Canada."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, but as to
the levy of an expert tax, I would add "or
royalty", s0 as to qualify what the phrase "export tax" means. I have not consulted the
Department, but I can take the second reading of this Bill, and if there je any very great
objection to the words "export tax" it seeme
to me that we might qualify those words by
adding the other words, and making it "export tax or royalty," which would. exactly define what is sought by thie Bill. It je only a
ievy upon furs that belong to the Crown,
which represents the Dominion of Canada in
the Northwest Territories. The intention je
to levy a tax upon each pelt.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would think the better
construction of the Act would be to levy a tax
upon all these pelts as per schedule; but with
the proviso that the Governor of the Northwest Territories might remit the .tax on those
that might be used for home consumaption.
You are getting on to dangerous ground when
you talk of exports. If I went into the Province of Saskatchewan and bought furs, I
would have -te get thein out; and if I were
taking thein out I woukld have to pay a tax.
Another merchant might buy thea and use
thera locally and pay no tax. Yeu are discriminating againet the othear provinces.

SENATE

180

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It seems to me it
it a violation of the provisions of the British
North America Act, which prevents one province being subjected to any kind of customs
duty by another. If you call it a royalty,
or give it any other name, you are not changing the nature of it. The contents of the
package will remain the same. If it is a tax
of one province against another, it is clearly
against the British North America Act. The
Bill, of course, is confined to Canada, and
in that respect it is quite all right.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would suggest that
this Bill go to Committee, because it lias a
good many angles to it, and if we take it up
here we are .going to get into a discussion
a good deal of which will be out of order.
I think the reason why the Department
has put the Bill in its present shape is this.
The furs are gathered by thousands of Indians
and half-breeds in the Northwest Territory.
You cannot tax those individuals. The furs
are then sold to companies which take them
out of the country. If you were to attempt
te put a tax on the persons who first got the
furs, you would have the greatest difficulty
in the world; consequently the idea has been
conceived of imposing a tax on the furs where
they are exported. I think that is the reason
for the Bill, and I think that is the onlly practical way in which the tax could be levied.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
make it any better.

That

does not

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Not a bit. It is for
that reason that I suggested that the Bill
should be allowed to receive its second reading, on the understanding that we are not
committing ourselves to the principle of the
Bill. My own view is that eventually this
tax will be paid by the hunter and trapper
who gets the furs, and I object to the tax
altogether. It is true that the company may
pay the tax; but in my opinion the trapper
who does the work is going to get so much
less for his furs. This only amounts to some
$75,000, and when you consider the people
away out there in the wilds doing their work,
I think you will agree with me that it is
doubtful whether it is worth while.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: What is the use
of our passing a law which the courts would
declare to be in violation of our powers?
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY: The illustration
given by the Leader in regard to the payment of a royalty is not applicable in this
case. As I understand, the royalty is collected without regard to whether the furs
are exported or not.
Hon. W. B. ROSS.

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I would suggest that
the second reading go, and that we have an
opportunity to discuss the Bill in Committee,
without committing ourselves to the principle
in the meantime.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to that.

I am agreeable

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was
read the second time.
At six o'clock the Senate took recess.
The Senate resumed at 8 p.m.
RURAL CREDITS BILL
SECON)

READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 62, an Act for the purpose of
establishing in Canada a system of Long
Tern Mortgage Credit for Farmers.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I may say
that last year this Bill received very careful
attention at the hands of one of the Committees of the Senate, and some amendments
were made to it. The Bill which now comes
to us 'from the Commons establishes a Board
which will be known as the Canadian Farm
Loan Board, which shall consist of four members, one of whom shall be the minister,
who shall be the chairman thereof, and the
other three of whom shall be appointed by
the Governor in Council. One of the members so appointed shall be designated the
Canadian Farm Loan Commissioner. Compensation will be provided.
The Board shall have power to issue and
sell bonds to be known as Canadian Farm
Loan bonds, to buy the same on its own
account, and to retire the same at or before
maturity. It shall also have the power to
invest its funds in debentures, bonds, stocks
or other security.
The capital requirements of the Board shall
be provided as follows:
The Government of Canada shall provide an
initial capital to an amount not exceeding five
million dollars to be paid to the Board in such
anounts and at such times as the Board may
determine. The amounts provided from time to
time under this subsection shall be free from
interest charges for a period of three years,
after whicch time interest shall be charged at
the rate of five per cent per annum.
This part of the Bill is on the same lines
as the Bill of last year, which was approved
by this Chamber.
In addition to the initial capital provided
for in the preceding subsection, the Board
shall issue capital stock in shares of one
dollar each, which capital stock shall at all
times equal, as nearly as may be fifteen per

MARCH 24, 1927
cent of the total farm loan theretofore paid
and flot fully ropaid. The said shares shall
ho non-transferahle, except at the option of
the Board, and shahl be sixbseribed for in the
following manner: five per cent of the Ioan
by the Govermont of Canada, five per cent
by the provinces, -a.nd five per cent by the
borrower.
The Bill provides machinery for loans .being
made to farmers. Loans shall be made only
on the security of firat mortgages on f arm
lands up to fifty per cent of the Board's
appraised value of such lands.
The proceeds of such lean shahl ho used for
certain specified reasens, and the boans shall
be made only to parties engaged in the cultivatien of the farm.
-Hon. W. B. RO*SS: I think that if the
honourable gentleman woubd just point out
how far the Commons have gone hack on
what we did last year, that would satidsy us.
Hon. Mr, DANDURAND: What I do remember arc these two points. There was
considerable discussion as to the rate which
shoubd ho charged on boans. The rate was to
be the cost of the money plus the cost of
administration. When the Bill came to us it
said. "plus the cost of administration, net te
ho more than one per cent, and reserves for
depreiation and boss."
'Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Ail te ho included
in the one per cent?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, outside of
the one per cent for administration. The
Sonate struck eut that maximum figure of
one per cent.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No; we put it in.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE:
it eut.

No; we teok

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
in without the maximum.

Yes, it came

Hon. Mr. ROSS: Without a limitation, and
we put in a limitation of one per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bill comes
to us with this statement:
The interest rate oùl bans under this Act shahl
be such a rate in excess of the interest rate
yielded at thde time of issue by the last series
of Farm Loan bonds issued by the Board as
shaîl ho sufficient, in the judgment of the Board,
te provide for the expenses of operation not
exceeding one per cent of the amount of the
loanHon. Mr. ROSS: That is net in the Bibl as
it comes te us now?

181

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes. But my
honourahbe friend corrected me unduby. We
struck eut that maximum cf oe per cent.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Th«at is right.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We struck eut
the maximum of one per cent in order te
allow the cost of administration to e oahsorbed
in1the amount of interest te bc paid.
In answer te my honourahbe friend frem
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Grieshach), I continue
reading:
-te provide for the expenses of operation net
exceediing one per cent of the amount of the
beau and for the necessary reserves for losses.
Se my honourahle friend wibl sec that under
this Bill the interest will ho the cost of the
ruuney, the one per cent added as a maximum
for administration, and a certain amount,
which is net fixed, te cover the necessary
reserves for loases.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: But the one
per cent covers ahi that.
Hen. Mr. DANDURAND: Ne.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: That is the way
àt reads.
"One per cent
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ef the amount of tho boan and for the
necessary reserves for losses."
Hon. G. G. POSTER: We decided hast
year that that was not enough.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: If these bonds
are sold at 3ý per cent you are going te lend
that money at 4j, and it may ho worth 7.
No; if the
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
money is 5 per centHon. SMEATON WHITE: But it is a
Government bond. 'It is a apeciai bond; it
May ho sohd at 3ý per cent, or 4 per cent.
Say 4.
Han. Mr. DANDURÀND:
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Well, 4. Even
thougli the current priýce of money is 7 per

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If wo can obtain
money at 4 per cent.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Yeo.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
this Bill we shail add one per cent for
administration. That wilh make 5 per cent.
Hon. SMBATON WHITE:
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

And bosses.
No.

SENATE

182

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It looks that way
now.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: And something
more for loases.
Hon. SMFEATON WHITE: Nothing more
for los.se.s; one per cent.
Hon. Mr. DANDUR.AND: We will discuss
that in Committee, but as the Bill carne hast
year, there was a distinct charge of one per
cent for administration.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:

For everything.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
A fixed
maximum chiarge of one per !cent for administration, but there was no flxed amounit for
reserves. That is as far as my memory
carnies me.
Hon. Mr. GRIiESBACII: The situation
last year, as the Bill came to us, was that
the interast rate on mortgages would be the
cost of the moiney plus one per cent, which
includod everything.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
is my understanding.
Hon. Mr. DANDUPLAND:

Last year?
Last year.

That

No.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My understanding, further, was that the Senate ýCommittee
recommiended that the rate of interest to the
borrowor should be the cost cf the money
plus provision for administration, for reserves
and everything eisc, without any figure being
set by way of maximum or minimum.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: No. I think the honourable gentleman is right in st.ating that. they
had to add in the interest the oxpense of
operation, and that was not to exceed one
per cent; but they had to add also for the
necessary rasorves for loases.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII:
Bili from the Commons?
Hon. Mr. ROSS:

In the original

Yes.

Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
There was one
of the differences between the Bill as it
reached hore and the Bill as it ef t this
Chamber.
The Sonate rofused to fix a
maximum figure of one per cent outside
the cost of the mon ay.

provided also for a special accounting of the
operations in each province. I do net see such
a provision in this Bill. It was made at the
suggestion of the honourable gentleman fromn

Do Salaberry (Hon. Mr. Béiqua).
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes.
lIon. Mr. DANDURAND:

And hie gave as

a reason that with that amendment thare
were hopes of getting Ontario and Quebec to
corne inte this scheme, because then they
mi-ght expect to be able to ]end money te
thair people at a rate whieh would tempt the
farmers, whereas if the whole cost of adrnistration were left in a general accountîng there
would be reason to, fear that the interest
asked woiiid be se much higher than the cost
of the money in the markets of the East that
they would not enter this scheme. We remember that the province of Ontario was
lending money ohtained frein its savings
banks at 5ý per cent. 1 do not remember what
figure vvas mentioncd for current boans in the
province of Quebec.
At ail events, I think these are the two imaportant changes. There may have been others,
but, as I have not before me the Bill as
amendcd by the Senate and sent back to the
Cornmons, 1 cannot say exactly how nearly
the present Bill approaches that which we
worked upon.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: 1 woîild suggest te honourable gentlemen that they might have propared what I have here a comparison of the
Bili as it left us hast year with the Bill as it
cornes back to us now. It can bo made very
shortly by the officers of the House. It wouid
ho a great advantage to the honourahie muembers in dealing with the Bill in Committee.
Of course 1 arn opposed to the Biil, but I
know that it passed the second reading last
year hv a largo majority and was referred te
% special Committee.
'I think that it need
îiot go to an-v spocial Committee this time;
that it is quite sufficient now to consider it
in Comrnittee of the Whole; but it wouhd
ho enormouslv 'helpfuh to have before us, in
dealing with it, a copy of the present Bill
together with the clauses in the BiII of last
year that have heen taken out.

Hon. Mr. ROSS: Some of the evidence was
that it wouhd .cost 1.45 for administration.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Bihl as it
left the Sonate 1ast year was flot reprinted
with the amendments, and 1 do not suppose
it w-as reprinted for the Commons.
So we
wouid have te ask the Clark te try to obtain
for us the Bibi of hast Session.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not
rememýber now, but we did have evidence
on that point. The Bill as it left the Sonate

part with regard to the rate of interest as
stated at the top o! page 5. There seems ta
be a diversity o! opinion as ta what this
means:
Shall be such a rate in excess o! the interest
raite yielded at the tinie of issue by the last
saries of Farm. Loan bonds issued by the Board
as shall be suffcient, in the judgment of the
Board, ta, provide for the expenses of operation
not exceading one per cent of the amount of
the loan andIt is when you corne ta the word "and"
that the trouble occurs. I think it means
aloo:
-and for the nacessary raserves for lasses.
That is, in addition ta the 5 per cent. I
read it ta mean "and also."
Han. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 would ask my
honourable friend ta look at the words "ta
provide"ý-"shall be sufficient, in the judgment
of the Board, ta provide"ý-what? "To provide for the expanses of operatian not excaeding ona per cent of the amount of the
boan and"ý-to provide, remembr-"f or the

Hon. Mr. GRI-ESBAGH: That is, ana per

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That. is cxactly
rny viaw, but I hear some honourable gentlemen advance the opposite view. I think it is
right to read it as meaning "and also."
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think the twa
phrases are governed by the words "ta pravide."
Hon. Mr. CALDER: H1onourable gentlemen, I Lave a suggestion to make. We considered this Bill at great length in a special
Committae 'last Session, yet for the if e of
me I cannot remember the details of aur
discussions or decisions. We had with us Mr.
Finlayson, of the Finance Department, who
fohlowed our proceedings very closely and
gave us a great deal of assistance and advice
in connection with this measure. I would
suggest that the honourable leader on the
other sida gat into touch with Mr. Finhayson
and have himn prepare a statement af the
diflarance betwaen thiýs Bill and the Bihl which
ici t aur bouse last Session; and that the
honourable leader aimoply place that an
Hlansard, so that we may all be able ta pick
up the threads and understand where we were
a year ago. Mr. Finlayson, wha knows al
the details -of the BihI and hbas ail the records
before him, will be able ta prepare that statement vary easily, and I think that once we
get bis statement ai the changes in the Bill
wa shaîl be able ta follow it more easily.

183

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The first thing
to do is to obtain the Bull i.tself as adopted by
the Senate, ini order to send it to Mr. Finlayson.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: But when we
have got that Bill we can ai see whs.t the
difference is. However, 1 'have no objection
to asking Mr. Fininyson to give us that statement.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Just a brief statement as to the changes t-hat were made.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Our own clerks can
give us that, because they have the record.
I have a copy.
0f the Bill as
Hlon. :Mr. DANDURAND:
it ieft the Senate?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes. I have had it
prepared so as ta show the differences between
the present Bill and the Bill of hast year.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: The trouble is that,
while my honourable friend has a copy of the
changes, and the honourable leader on the
other side has a icopy, we ail have flot. I
would like to have it before me. My suggestion is that a statement of the changes be prepared by Mr. Finlayson, instead of the Clerk
of the House being asked to make copies for
us ail, and that the honourable leader of the
House sirnply place -Mr. Finlayson's statement on Hansard at our next sitting. Then
we shall ail have it. It is very easily prepared, and there is no hurry for it.
I am moving
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the second reading now, and we shall go into
Committee on Tuesdýay next.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: This Bill is of such
vast importance to the whole of Canada that
I do not like ta let the opportunity pass
without'making a few remarks. The honourable leader stated this afternoon that in bis
opinion the Pension Bill was the most important measure that had corne hyefore this
Huse. I consider the present Bill of far
greater importance. The Pension Bill provides
for the expenditure of huge sums of money,
but this Bill, if it is drafted as it shauld ha,
and if it is carried into effect, will probably
provide the money to pay the pensions.
In my humble judgment, if this Bill is going to ha a success, it must ba along somewhat
different lines. It 'provides for the Loan
Board selling their bonds for what they eau
get for them in the market. The primary
abject is to raise money s0 that it may be
lent ta the farmers in a scheme of repayment

184

SENATE

extending over thirty years, and the great success of the Bill will depend upon the amount
of interest they can get. The Government is
to lend $5,000,000 for three years without interest. The Government is vitally interested.
But if those bonds are not guaranteed by
the Government, how are you going to sell
them on the market, especially on mortgages
in western territory, of which the company
representatives called before the Committee
that examined this Bill did not speak very
favourably. The Government is willing to
advance this Farm Loan Board $5,000,000 for
three years, and that will no doubt be an
advantage, but in order to carry out the
principle of the Bill and make it a success
the Government might as well consent to
guarantee the bonds of the Loan Board.
There does not seem to be much risk about
it. It is behind the scheme,-and its guarantee
will make the difference between failure and
success. I point this out to the honourable
leader of the !Government. I do not know
whether he has ever considered it or not; but
it is of vital importance to the West, and
indeed to the whole of Canada, that this
scheme should be carried to complete success.
Dr. Tory gave evidence at great length,
showing how the Government of the United
States, in order to secure money at a cheap
rate for the scheme there, had subscribed for
bonds to an extraordinary amount, which I
am almost afraid to mention; I think it was
about a billion dollars. The only way to
make the Canadian scheme a success is to
have the Government guarantee the bonds, so
that the Loan Boards may go into the markets of the world and get money at the lowest
possible rate.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What is the actual
risk taken by one of those Farm Loan Boards?
Is it the risk of failure of the whlle scheme,
or what? Is there not a bond guarantee by
implication, in any case?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I think those
bonds stand very high in the American market.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Because they are
guaranteed specifically?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

No.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Yes, and more than
that, they are tax-free; that is what gave
them their standing.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I would also point
out that local Governments like those of
Saskatchewan and Manitoba raise money for

the Farm Loan Boards that way, by a guarantee of the Farm Loan bonds. I would like
to see the A ct amended in that way, if pos4
sible.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am ready for
the second reading of the Bill and the sending
of it to Committee of the Whole, but it
would appear to be desirable to have it studied
in the Banking and Commerce Committee,
where it could be examined clause by clause,
with the amendments that were made by the
Senate last year. Of course my duty is to
present the Bill as it is, and move the adoption of every clause.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: It may be found
on examination of the Bill as it comes from
the Commons that some features have been
introduced which would require investigation
by a Select Committee-such investigation
as the Committee of the Whole louse cannot give-involving the calling of witnesses,
experts, etc.
lon. Mr. CALDER:
My recollection of
this feature of the Bill-and I tried to follow it very closely-is that, while the Dominion Governnent advances $5,000,000 in the
first place, it is going to be a long time
getting it ba.ck; consequently there is security
for $5,000,000 there. I remember quite wel
that both Mr. Finlayson and Dr. Tory spoke
of that feature, and time and again I asked
when that $5,000,000 would be going back
to the federal treasury, but I could never
get a satisfactory answer. The result is that
so far as those securities are concerned that
are issued by the Farm Loan Board, the
amount advanced by the Dominion Government, this $5,000,000, is held as well as the
mortgages behind it, so the Loan Board will
have no difficulty at all in getting money
at a low rate of interest.
After the very full and complete investigation we had last year on the controversial
points in the Bill, I doubt very much wbether
there is any necessity for sending this Bill
back to the Committee. We spent weeks on
this measure, and I think if we get a clear
statement from Mr. Finlayson as to the
changes that have been made in the Bill in
another place we shall know the exact situation and can then deal with the Bill on its
merits.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

All right.

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS:
I think that
Dominion loan of $5,000,000 is repayable at
6 per cent after three years.

185

MARCH 24, 1927
I am not certain
lion. Mr. CALDER:
about that, but I am quite sure that that
loan from the federal Government is going
to remain a long time out of the Dominion

No, it is printed

the introduction of this legislation would be
the saving of the country. He quoted what

WAR CHARITIES REPEAL BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 114, an Act to repeal the War
Charities Act, 1917.
He said:. Honourable gentlemen, I asked
for some information from the Under-Secretary of State, who has had something to

do with this Bill, and who supervises all those
societies. He says, in regard to the War
Charities Act:
There appears to be no substantial reason for
perpetuating it. The war justified this Dominion legislation. Paragraph 7 of Section 92
of the British North America Act should be
borne in mind in discussing the subject. It is
as follows:
"The establishment, maintenance and management of hospitals, asylums, charities and eleemosynary institutions in and for the Province,
other than marine hospitals."
There can be no doubt that charities are subject to provincial control, and it was the mere
fact of the war that gave the Dominion jurisdiction. If a crop of these societies started
to-morrow, as Senator Ross suggests, they would
be subject to provincial control, and the ordinary provincial machinery is sufficient to cope
with any difficulty which may arise in this
way. During the war and shortly thereafter
there was a very large number of societies
which required close supervision, and it was
for this purpose mainly that the legislation was
enacted. Now we find that, with the exception
of twenty societies, the only licensed societies
are all branches of the Daughters of the Empire
or of the Great War Veterans Association.
These organizations are under sufficient control
without the War Charities Act. Moreover,
the bulk of the twenty remaining are also under
control to this extent, that they are required
to make annual returns, as they are incorporated
associations. The fact that the necessity for
this legislation bas passed is shown from the
few applications to come under the Act which
have been made within the last few years.
I move the second reading of the Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As there is no
reason for taking the Committee stage, I
move the third reading of the Bill.
The motion ws agreed to, and the Bill was
read the third time and passed.

On section 12-Penalties for sale of spirits
unlawfully manufactured.

186

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have a new
draft of section 185. Honourable gentlemen
will remember that it was suggested that the
penalty was too high for the purchaser who
was found in possession of a bottle of whiskey.
The penalty was $2,000 as a maximum, and
$500, I tihink, as a minimum. The draft makes
a distinction .between a person who sells or
offers for sale and a person who is not a
dealer, but who purchases. This is the new
section which I propose:
185. (1) Every person who sells or offers for
sale, or who being a dealer therein purchases,
or bas in his possession any spirits unlawfully
manufactured or imported, whether the owner
thereof or not, without lawful excuse, the proof
of which shall be on the person accused, is
guilty of an indictable offence, and shall for
a first offence be liable to a penalty not exceeding two thousand dollars and not less than two
hndred dollars, and to imprisonment, with or
without hard labour, for a tern not exceeding
twelve months and not less than one month, and
in default of payment of the penalty, to a further tern of imprisonment not exceeding
twelve months and not less than six months,
and for every subsequent offense to a penalty
not exceeding $2,000 and not less than $500,
and to imprisonuient with hard labour, for a
tern not exceeding twelve months and not less
than six months, and, in default of payrnent of
the penalty, to a further terni of imprisonment
equal to that already imposed by the court for
stoh suibsequent offense: and all spirits so unlawfully manufactured or imported wliresocver they are found, and all horses, and vehicles, vessels and other appliances which have
been or are being used for the purpose of renoving the saie, shall be forfeited to the
Crown, and salial be clealt with accordingly.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
What do the
words "removing the sane" nean? That is
very Jirnited. It might mcean used in connectien with this unlawful business.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
from one place to another.

The carrying

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
The common
meaning is the removal from the place where
it is to the place of custody. Surely a better
phrase could be used.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading):
And ail spirits so unlawfully manufactured or
imported wheresoever they are found, and al]
horses, and vehicles, vessels and other appliances
which have been or are being used for the purpose of reonving the sane, shall be forfeited
to the Crown.
That is all the vehicles, vessels and so forth.
Naturally they are for the purpose of removing the unlawfully manufactured alcohol.
Paragraph 2 says:
Every person not being a dealer therein who
purchases, or lias in bis possession any spirits
unlawfully manufactured or imported, whether
the owner thereof or not, without lawful excuse,
the proof of which shall be on the person acHon. Mr. BELCOURT.

cused, shall for a first offense incur a penalty
not exceeding $500 and not less than $200, and
for each subsequent offense a penalty of $500;
and all spirits so unlawfully manufactured or
imported wheresoever they are found, and all
horses and vehicles, vessels and other appliances,
which have been or are being used for the purpose of removing the same, shall be forfeited
to the Crown, and shall be dealt with accordingly.
I move to substitute this new clause for
the clause in the Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I had occasion the other day to make
certain observations with regard to the doctrine, or want of doctrine, involved in this
clause. To me it seems to be a violation of
the principle upon which the criminal law has
been based in the Old Country and in this
country. It is a very marked departure from
the rule which prevails in all courts under
British jurisdiction, that the accused is innocent until he is proven guilty. I strongly
object to the onus of proof of innocence being
put upon the accused. The rule of law is that
the onus of proof of the crime is upon the
Crown.
Why there should be a departure
froin that sound rule in this instance, I cannot
see. I do not think the matter involved is
of such a serious character as to warrant such
a departure. I would therefore move that the
words "the -proof of which shall be on the
person accused" be stricken out.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: There are two places
where those words occur. I am with the
honourable gentleman in his contention, but
I would point out to him that in the proposed
amendment section 185 has been broken into
two parts. The first- part deals with a person
who sells or offers for sale, or who, being
a dealer therein, purchases or has in his possession. The burden of proof is thrown on
that man. I do net mind that so much. But
in paragraph 2 of the amended clause the
1:urlen of proof is put on a man who, net
ling a dealer therein, purchases or bas in
his possession.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I am after too.

That is the case

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would suggest to
my honourable friend that in moving to strike
out those words it might be well to adopt
the language of section 185 as it has been in
former years, namely:
Every person who sells or offers for sale, or
who purchases any spirits, or bas any spirits in
bis possession, knowing thern to have been unlawfully mnanufactured or importedHon. Mr. BELCOURT:

I agree to that.

187

MARCH 24, 1927
Let us underHon. Mr. DANDURÀND:
stand well wbat we are trying to amend. I
have moved ta substitute a new text, which
ie in two paragraphs, for clause M85 as it
appears in the Bill. Io my honourable friend
trying to amend the two paragraphe, or only
one?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No, we are letting one
go.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: What jeithe meaning in law of the words "lawful excuse"Y?
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM': An excuse that
is good in law.
Hon. Mr. DANIYURAN'D: Yes, an excuse
that will be accepted as a satisfactory one.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Is that a happy
phrase in the statute?
Hon. Mr. DANDUJRJD: It le a phrase
that is to be found in many places in the
Customs Act.
Hon. Mr. BAPRNAR.D: It dace not include
ignorance, evidently.
Hon. Mr. DANDURÀND:
No. The
Customs Aict for many years has contained
sueh a phrase. I cite section 207:
Any person who, without lawful excuse, the
proof of which shaîl be on the person accused,

sends or brings into Canada, or who, being in
Canada, has in hie possession, any bill-heading.
or other paper appearing to be a heading or
blank, capable of being filled up and used as
an invaice, and bearing any certificate purporting ta show, or which may be used to show,
that the invoice which may be made frorn such
bilI-heading or blank je correct or authentie, je
guilty of an indictable offense.
Now, as the first paragraïph of this proposed new section has been accepted, I move
the adoption of the second paragraph.
My amendment
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
would be ta insert the word "knowingly"
hefore the word "purchases", and ta strike
ont the words "without lawful excuse, the
proof of which shaîl ha an the persan
accused."
The paragraph would then read:
Every persan nlot being a dealer therein who
knowingly purchases, or bas in hie possession
any spirite unlawfully manufactnred or imported, whether the owner thereof or not, shal
for a first offense incur a penalty not exceeding $500 and not lees than $200.
I abijet moet
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
decidedly ta that amendment.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would suggest that
the honourable gentleman nrake that read:
Every persan not being a dealer therein who
purchase% or has in hie possession any spirite,
knowing them ta have been unlawfully manufactured or imported.

Han. Mr. BELCOURT: That is ail right.
1 think it le the same thing.
I shall vote
Hon. Mr. GRoeESBACH:
against this amendinent although 1 quite
appreciate what, the honourable gentleman
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) say's of
the custom. in the past, as to the onus of proof
being upon the Crown in criminal cases. I
wauld draw attention to the fact, however,
that we are dealing with an Act to prevent
smuggling, which has ta do with liquor. The
great hulk of the people do net regard
smuggling as a crime; neither do they look
upon. dealing in liquor as a crime. In many
of the liquor laws of Canada at this moment
the burden of proaf is upon the accused;
otherwise the officers of the Government
wauld be absolutely unsble ta prove their
cases. Everybody conspires ta amst the secalled criminal. Unless you gîve the officers
this leverage they will neyer secure a conviction; and inasmuch as many people, as 1
bave already said, do not regard smuggling or
the handling of liquor as a crime, perhaps we
should not be too strict in the application
of the old principle.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The answer ta the
honaurable gentleman is that this case is not
in any way different fromn the case of stolen
goods. The difficulty of praving the receiving
of stolen goods is exactly the same.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Everybody in
Canada admits that dealing in stolen goods
is a crime.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: This wilI be a
crime from now on.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: We say that it je
a crime, but the public do nlot helieve it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If they do not,
they may have ta go ta gaol for twelvc
monthe and pay $5,000. They will soon have
ta believe it. I do not see any difference
at ail betwecn the two cases.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: The honourable
gentleman's amendment would take the
teeth out of this law.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Perhaps it has
too many teeth.
I abject ta
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the amendment proposed because it will
place upon the prosecution the obligation of
establishing that the persan found with the
alcohol in bis possession knew that it came
from an illegal source, or that duty bad nat
been paid upon it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

Certainly.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
With the section in that form on the Statute Book it would
be impossible, or nearly impossible, to establish the guilt of the accused. As I say, the
Customs Act and similar Acts declare that
in such a case the onus is upon the person
found in the possession of unlawfully obtained
goods to give a lawful excuse. When a man
is caught with goods in his possession, that
fact is clear; and, as in the case of stolen
goods, it is for him to justify himself. If
the onus is laid upon the prosecutor, in 99
cases out of 100 there will be no prosecution. The Act is amended in order to conform with most of the enactments in the
Customs Act bearing upon similar cases.
We are trying to prevent the unlawful distilling of alcohol, to prevent the work of the
bootlegger. There has been considerable discussion as to the value of the Customs Act
in this regard, and we are asking that the
Department be given a chance to wrestle with
the botlegger and those who buy from him.
I repeat when a man is caught with the
goods in his possession, it is for him to
establish his good faith and sincerity, and to
furnish a lawful excuse. Under these circumstances I ask this Chamber not to entertain the proposal of my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: In this connection I
would like to relate an incident that came
under my own observation. A number of
young fellows who went into a restaurant
and were having a good time, had some
moonshine liquor with them, unknown to
the restaurant keeper. When they left the
place there remained behind in a corner a
small bottle with probably an ounce of the
liquor in it. The police happened to raid
the place the next day, and that man was fined
$200. I think the penalty under the Act as
it stood before was quite sufficient, without
making it any heavier for people who may be
caught in that way. Many cases of a similar
nature have been brought to my attention; in
fact, they are to be found practically all over
the western country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I draw the
honourable gentleman's attention to the fact
that we have stiffened the penalty only in
the case of the dealer. That paragraph has
been passed. Now we are dealing with another class of people, the purchasers, and in
that case the penalty is the same as it was in
the Act which we are seeking to amend.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I suppose the honourable Leader of the Government will admit
that these legislative rules are not Jike the
laws of the Medes and Persians, with one
fixed form and never a departure from it.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

The fact of the matter is, you have to make
the punishment fit the crime. You must
deal with your facts. I think that we have
done very well with him in regard to subsection 1. I do not see why we should deny him
what he wants there, because it seems to be
fair that a person who sells or offers for sale,
or who is a dealer, should have more legal
liability thrust on him than, say, a farmer.
or a carpenter, or a coal-hoaver, who is not
used to the ways of business at all. Someone may seld him or give him a bottle with
alcohol in it, and to say that this man must
justify himself and prove that it did not
come into the country unlawfully, or was not
imanufactured or distilled unlawfully, is, I
think, going too far. Subsection 2 is not on
the same lines as subsection 1. Possibly subsection 2 would give some sort of redress or
satisfaction to the distiller, who in one of the
preceding sections bas his fine increased froni
$500 to $2,000. Perhaps this would help him
out in that respect. But I am not interested
in the distiller at all. What I do want to
see-and I entirely agree with the honourable
member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt)is that the ordinary man moving about in the
country may feel that he is a free Canadian
and not be liable, at the turn of a corner, or
the opening of a lid, or the removal of his
overcoat, to find himself treated as a criminal,
without any evidence at all, but simply because he may happen to have, for a variety
of reasons, a small quantity of alcohol in his
possession. The man who is dealing and trading in alcohol, again, is on a different footing.
I do hope the House will insist upon making
this what I think is Christian legislation.
The Hon. the CHAIRMAN: It bas been
moved by Hon. Mr. Dandurand that subsection 2 of section 185 be agreed to. It has
been moved in amendment by 'the honourable member from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) that the words " without lawful excuse, the proof of which shall be on the person accused " be struck out.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Not only that; I
want to have certain words inserted. May
I read the clause as I propose it should read?
Every person not being a dealer therein who
purchases, or bas in his possession any spiritsI want to have inserted there the words
"knowing them to have been "-- knowing them to have been unlawfully manufactured or imported, whether the owner thereof or not-

Then strike out the words, "without lawful
excuse, the proof of which shall be on the
person accused."

MARCH 25, 1927
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 176, an Act ta amend the Canadian National Railways Act, 1919.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, under the
present Canadian Government Railways Act
the contrai of the standards of maintenance
is vested, nat in the Board of Raiiway Commissioners, but in the Minister. With respect
ta ail the rest of the Canadian Government
Raiiway Systemn the Board of Railway Cammissianers have contrai over the standards of
maintenance. After the matter bas heen
examined thoroughiy it is thought desirable
ta give the Board juriadiction over the former
Government Raiiways, as over the rest of the
system. That is the whoie import. of the
amendment as explained by the ýMinister of
Railways. With this expianatian I move the
second reading of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: 1 wouid like ta ask
the hon-omable Minister how this wili affect
the Intercoloniai Railway. As far as my
knowiedge goes, the Intercolonial occupies, or
did occupy, a position entirely different from,
that of the other portions of the Can-adian
National Railways. The Intercolonial Railway was huiit, as we ail knaw, for a speciai
purpose, and was kept under the contrai of the
Crown, and had a different organization. It
was later, I believe, attached ta some extent,
but nat entireiy to the other portions of the
Canadian National Railways. I say nat entirely, because I thin-k I am correct in stating
that, while the rates were ta be under the
contrai of the Railway Commission, the municipalities and Provinces through which it
ran were prevented from taxing it, heing told
that it was a Government railway; and I think
it bas anly been in the hast couple of years
that any taxes have been, paid te those municipalities and Provinces.
I would like the Minister ta expiain whether the Intercaloniai Railway has entireiy
hast its significance as a Government raiiway,
or whether it stili holds the important position
that it held after Confederatian as one of the
contracta of Confederation. I think perbaps
a littie information in regard ta that would be
advisable at the present time, so that down in
aur part of the country, we may know just
exaotly what the position of the Intercolonial
Raiiway is.
Hon. Mr. DANDURtAND: I wouid not hike
ta answer the question of my honourable
friend offhand; I wauld rather refer bis question ta the Raiiway Departîment, s0 that he
may have an authoritative answer. I have a

general impression; but when one is asked to
make an exact statement based on iaw, it is
better to hesitate for a moment and examine
into the situation.
The question of my honourabie friend has
very littie ta do with this Bill, because it
simpiy pute the question of the maintenance
of the old Intercoloniai Raiiway in the hands
of the Board of Raiiway. Commissioners* in-»
stead of it being, as heretofore, under the

advantage to be gained by having a uniforma
standard of maintenance, which is ail that wiil
be effected by the Bill, and I am sure this is
most desirable. On the third reading of the
Bill I wili have an answer for the hanourabie
gentleman, if he wiil be content with that.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I ask, because this Bill
evidentiy takes away from the Minister the
contraI that hitherto he has exercisedHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Oniy of maintenance.

CROWN DEBTS BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from March 23 the
adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr.
Dandurand for the second reading nf Bill 122,
an Act respecting certain debts due the
Crown.
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH: ilonourable
gentlemen, this Bill involves a certain sum of
money, and an important principle of legislation. It raises the question of financial
transactions between the Dominion and the
provinces, between the Dominion and municipalities, and between the Dominion and
private individuais. The Senate can come to
no sound conclusion in the matter unless it
bas an opportunity of securing information
from various departmental sources. Therefore
I suggest that the House would be wel
advîsed to ic-fer the matter to a Co-mmittee
in order that this evidence may 'be taken and
we may be informed precisely on the situation.
Hon. J. A. CA.LDER: Honourable gentlemen, I wouid like to say a wo-rd or two in
support of the suggestion of my honourable
friend from Edmonton. Tbis Bill involves
the consideration of many prohlems, and I
tbink that it is abso]utely necessary that we
sbould have from the Departmnent a good
dezal of information that we cannot get during
a discussion on the second reading. The
Federal Government, during many years past
as far back, I think, as the early seventieshave lent large sums of money, in the first
place to, individual settlers, in the second
place, as I vnderstand, to tnunicipalities, and
in the third place to the Governments of
the Western Provinces, in connection with
secd grain relief, the moving of hay, the
supplying of fodder and ail that sort of thing.
Now, it seems to me that before we can deal
with the Bill dnteiligently it is essentail tbat
we should have an opportunity to obtain from
the Department of the Interior full information, first, in respect to the parties concerned,
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

and. second, in respect to the amounts of
money invoived. I say f rankly I cannot
support the second reading of this Bili without knowing wbat I am doing. For the
moment I am flot saying that I objeet to
tbe Bili, or that I favour the Bill, but I
must know the facts before deciding wbat to
do. I think we shahl save time if we do not
bave a iengtby discussion on the second
readinýg of the Biii, but refer it to a Committee so that ail members of the House may
get the information that it is necessiry in
order to enable them to cast an intelligent
vote.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: The honourable leader
of tihe Governmen't, when Ibis matter was up
before, promised to get certain information
that I asked him for; that is, as to wbether
there is in the Act of which tbis Bill will
f orm a part, any clause making il compulsory
for the Minister to, lay on the table of Parliament a report on wbatever action he takes
in the carrying out of tbis provision.
Re
niay have to spend or give away a great deal
of money. There ought tobhoin some portion
of the Act a clause requiring that information
to be laid on tihe table of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is no
objection to sucb a clause being added to the
Bill.
Hon. W. A. BUCHANAN:
Honourable
gentlemen, I happen to bave somne knowledge
of the purpose of tbis gegisiation, because it
applies iargeiy to, a section of Alberta with
wbich I have fairly intimate acquaintance.
The legislation deais with a condition that
arose following the dry year of 1914, when
probaiaiy 75 per cent of the homesteaders in
the country from a line drawn eust of the city
of Lethbhridge and north to, the Red Deer
River, and extending beyond the boundary
of the province of Saskatchewan, received assistance in seed grain, relief for themselves
personaliy, or relief for their stock, because of
the acute conditions folhowing that crop failure.
At the time tbe Federal Government made
that boan a lien was placed upon the property
heid by those bomesteaders, and that lien
took priority over ail other claims againat the
land at that time and afterwards.
If a man
beld a homestead and a pre-emption and had
two or three other quarters of land, the lien
was against ail, and for the total amount of
the loan made to, him by the Dominion Government.
Since that time we have had a
series of more or less unfortunate yeare in
that section of the country, known now as
south-eastern Alberta, and there have been
cases whpre men bave acquired some of the

MARORI 28, 1927
land against whic'l these liens were placed.
If a ýperson held six quartera, the lien was
charged against every quarter ta the saine
extent; so if lie sold one quarter the purchaser
assumed that lien.
Now, the Departinent of
the Interior de8îres to confer with the loan
campanies Who are interested in muoh of this
land, with the provincial goverrnment, who
bave liens and have taken, over a good deai
of the land f or taxes, and also, with
the municipalities concerned, for the purpose of straigitening out the tangle,
and the Department i.s seeking this legislation
in an endeavour to shake doywn al the indebtedness and bring whatever is possible into
the Treasury of the Dominion of Canada, as
well as to make a settiement, which, if it does
not satisfy the boan companies and the othez
organizatioms interested, will at l'eut give
thern something where at the present moment
there is no possibility of obtaining a cent.
I may explain that in south-eastern Alberta
the mai ority of the people have gone away,
leaving the land burdened with these liens,
but some persona are remaining there ini the
hope that tbey may make a success of sheep
ranching or- cattle ranching in a sinaîl way,
Many of them. wish ta acquire some of those
abandoned liomesteads, but they cannot do so
as long as they are encumbered with ail these
liens. Once this matter is straightened out it
wîll, be possible for those individuals who are
remaining in that country ta acquire extra
land and try to, make a suacess of ranehiiig.
I might point out that in another section
of Alberta, from. Medicine Hat west te, what is
known as the C.P.R. inrigation area , along
the main line of the Canadian Pacifie Railway, and from the South Saskatchewan River
north ta the Red Deer River, an investigation was lield by a Commission made up of
two representatives of the Provincial Goveinment of Alberta and two representatives of
the Dominion Governinent, to inquire into
conditions in that area, which bas bèen almost
wholly depopulated. There were cases there
wliere thirteen or fifteen sehool districts in a
municipality had dwindled down until the
mnunicipality waa able f0 maintain enly one.
For the purpose of finding, if possible, a
solution of the problem, in that area an investigation was made, and the Commxission's
report recommends that it should be brought
back laîgely into grazing and th old-time
ranching conditions. But the Commission in
their inquiry were faeed with this condition,
that nearly alI the land was burdened with
liens. I have here the report of that Commission. In summarizing the evidence they
made this statement:
That it is necessary ta bring the land, as far
as possible, ta single ownership, that is, that

193

the lands now alienated maust revert ta the
Croivn either by tax recovery proceedings, exchange or expropriation, before it will be pass3ible ta work out any generally satisfactory
scheme.
I ar n ot as well acquainted with that
partieular aiea as 1 arn with 'the ares, on the
Crow's Nest line south and weSt of Medicine
Hat, and I would say that what fihis Commission have recommended in this particular case
would apply ta the extreme south-eastern
part of the province. As I said, the bulk 0f
.that land bas been abandoned, and the few
people who are there, would like ta acquire
mare land in order ta carry an rassihing but
cannot get a title ta i-t as long ns those liens
are registered against thein. I might mention that in regard ta the aiea of which I am
speaking, between the South Saskatchiewan
and the Red Deer Rivers and from west of
Medicine Hat the Commission recom'mended:
1. That thîs be declared a clased area, and
that no0fuither lands be alienated frain the
Crown.
2. That Parliamentaîy and legislative authority be secured ta enable the properly constituted authorities to make compromise settle.
nients. of arrears of taxes, seed grain and
relief liens, and any other Crow-n dlaims now
levied against the lands, or ta cancel in their
entirety any sucli Crown dlaims if fouuid necessary.
This Commission's report was made after
a thorougli investigation lield at points
throughout that area, and alsa after hearing
evidence of representatives of municipalities,
school districts, and the mortgage and boan
companies operating in the Province of
Alberta. I think that this legislatian is gaing
ta be warked out in this way: that the representatives concerned-tlie Dominion, the Province, flic municipalities and the boan companies
-will ait around a table and endeavaur
to reacli a settlement on the areas in which
tliey are interested, hoping. tliat tliey can get
something out of the land by an adjustinent
between theinselves. In many cases there cannot be a settlement witli the owners, because
thcy have left and abandoned everything;
therefore the problein is ta get the property
back into the possession of the Crown sa
that it can be utilized for ranchîng purposes,
or be acquired by farmers wlio have remained
there ini the hope that thcy can get more
land and carry on sinaîl ranching.
I amn not afraid of the power give to the
Departinent of tlie Interior, partîcularly as it
applies ta the area with which I arn acquainted, because I feel that this legislation
can only be made successful by conferences
between the parties interested. The adjustment lias ta be mutual, and ail the parties
will have ta stand lasses in nearly every
case. The abject is ta get frain this section

of country that has proved unsuccessful, as
much as possible from the wreck.
This would be my explanation of the meassure, and a statement of my reason for supporting it, as something that is necessary te

clear up the tangle in that section of Alberta.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I think this question is
a little more complex and perhaps a little
more far-reaching than I or anyone would
infer from the scanty outline of the Bill. There
appear to be in it at least two elements
which are somewhat grave. One is the interference as te the matter of transferring the

property, on account of those liens which are
held, seemingly in very large numbers. The
other is that touched upon by my honourable friend who just sat down, which opens

up another field of vision.
I have heard a great many men say that
if we had te commence over again in laying
out certain sections of the Northwest we
would not have transferred, or allowed to be

transferred, te the general farmer large sections of that country which were fit for
ranching and grazing but not fit for farming.
It may be that in some of those areas there
is sufficient at stake, in the condition of those
lands as described by my honourable friend,
te make it possible te revert te opportunities
afforded for grazing and ranging in certain
districts where land is ill-fitted for ordinary
agricultural work.

I raised no objection te the Bill on the
former occasion because of the principle et it,
or what it sought te remedy, but I thought we
should have some further information before
we are asked te pass upon the Bill. I am
in the same position as my honourable friend
behind me (Hon. Mr. Calder), se that I

cannot vote yea or nay because I do not
know what is involved. I think it would be
well te adopt the suggestion that was made,
and send it te a small Committee, or te a
larger Standing Committee of sene sort, because it has elements on which we would
like te be informed before being asked te vote.
I hope my honourable friend the leader
of the Government will take the suggestion,
and send the Bill te a Committee.
HonourabIe
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I did not believe that any difficulty would arise in relation te this Bill, because the matter of which it treats was dealt

with by the Government of Canada in a
very easy way under the War Measures Act,
on the 23rd of February, 1918.
The very reasons that are given for reenacting this legislation-because practically
the Order in Council passed under the War
Hon. Mr. BUCHANAN.

Measures Act had the value of an Act of
Parliament-are based upon conditions that
were recognized as existing in 1918. I believe
that two of the honourable gentlemen who
have spoken on this matter, the honourable
gentleman from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder)
and the right honourable junior member for
Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster),
were members of the Government who passed
that Order in Council, which recited:
That His Majesty advanced seed grain and
fodder to certain settlers in the Prairie Provinces in the winter and spring of 1914-1915, and
by way of security for the re-payment of such
advances registered liens against all the lands
of such settlers, which liens took priority over
all other encumbrances registered against such
lands;
That it bas been represented in behalf of persons who advance money in the Prairie Provinces and who had certain mortgages or loans
unpaid at the time of such distribution of seed
grain and fodder, that many advances were
made to persons who at the time worked two
or more parcels of land and who distributed the
proceeds of such advances for the benefit of the
varions parcels so held, but thiat cadi of such
advances are under the provisions of the authoriz'ing legislation a charge in its entirety
against each single parcel so held and that, in

the event of a mortgagee or encumbrancee taking
sale proceedings in order to recover the amount

of the mortgage or encumbrance, it is necessary

to pay off to His Majesty all of the advances
made by His Majesty in order to give a clear
title to the purchaser;
That it bas been represented in bebalf of persons wlo advanced money as aforesaid that, in
the event a mortgagee or encumbracee who
holds a mortgage or encumbrance against one
suc parcel, sells under the provisions of his
mortgage or forecloses and afterwards sells in
order to realize on his mnortgage or encumbrance,
be frequently sells at a loss by reason of the
re-paynent of the amount of snch lien as so
charged in its entirety against the parcel sold;
That His Majesty similarly advanced certain
other goods by way of relief to settlers and
registered liens by way of security for such
advances also, which liens rank as to priority
only from the date of the registration thereof
but have been held by the courts not to he diseharged by sale proceedings or other action so
that the lien for other goods by way of relief
also clouds the title given to a purchaser under
sale proceedings.

The Minister, therefore, recommends that in
case of sale or a foreclosure and sale by such
mortgagee or encumbrancee, the Minister may'
upon being satisfied that such mortgagee or en-

cumbrancee bas taken every reasonable and
proper means to procure the highest price for
the said land and has suffered loss by reason of
liens se registered, issue such discharges or
partial discharges as to the land sold as will
relieve such mortgagee or encumbrancee of loss
in the case of liens for seed grain and fodder.

bymond the amount thereof applied on such land
îwith interest, and in case of relief, wholly or to
such extent as the Minister deens equitable.
That was the law until the War Measures

Act was repealed or ended.
only asks that:

Now, this Bill

MARCH 28, 1927
The Covernor in Council shall have power to
inake regulations providing for the apportionnient and adjustinent of indebtedneas incurred
for advances of seed grain, fodder for animais
and other relief, and to discliarge and release
in whole or in part any monies due te Hie
Majesty in respect nf either principal or interest or both, as may be considered equitable
in the circunistances.
I stated in my opening remnarks that there
were sorne $3,000,000 stili due. In moat of
thle cases the land bas been located, and in
very rnany cases -tlie municipaiity bas sold
ià for taxes, but the lien of the Federal Gov.
ernment still remains, and there is the question of necessity for apportiennient.
The Minister stated that his dealings would
be with the Governments, municipalities and
corporations concerned.
There has been a
Board appointed in Alberta for adjustment of
these dlaims. The Dominion Government
would like to join that Board, -but under the
Doxfjinîon Lands Act it cannot do so; it has
no power until the &et now under discussion
is passed.
1 have no hesitation in believing that the
Departmnent wili act for the best interests of
ail, and of the Federal exchequer in particular; but when there je the least doubt in
the minds of some honourable gentlemen in
this Chamber, as to the possibility of corne
harm being done by the Department or the
Minister having such large authority, I 'have
ne objection whatever te clea.ring the atmosphere by sending the Bill before a Committee, where parties who are to administer the
Act wilh give al necessaiy information. For
tha reason, without consulting the Minister
-or the Department, I move the second reading of this Bill, and that the same be then
Teferred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
The motion was agreed te, and the Bill was

read the second time.

Hon. Mr. TANNER: I want to draw the
attention of the leader of the House to a
railway which was inder consideration in
this House two years ago. I understand that
this whole programme of railway construction
eomes to Parliament on the initiation and
with the recommendation of the President
Hon. Ir. ROBERTSON.

and Directors of the Canadian National Railways and has been accepted by the other
House, and is now being passed finally here.
What I would like to understand is why
the railway which was projected in Nova
Scotia, known as the Guysborough Railway,
is not included in this list. I did not know
that this matter was coming up, and therefore
did not bring Hansard with me, but my honourable friend will remember that in 1924
that railway project came down to Parliamnt
with the absolute, unqualified recommendation
of the president of the Canadian National
Railways, and presumably also that of the
officials under him. That railway Bill received the approval of the other House, but
failed to pass this Chamber in 1924 and also
in 1925.
The point upon which I would like to get
information is this: bas the Canadian National
Railway Management abandoned that project? They made a very distinct and positive
statement in answer to my inquiries. My
honourable friend will also remember that he
read a very full and concise statement of the.
reason why that road should be constructed,
that statement being signed by the President,
Sir Henry Thornton. Now, it is known that
there were elections in sight in 1924; but I
would be very slow to believe that Sir Henry
Thornton had been influenced by political considerations in making his recommendations in
1924, for Sir Henry bas been continually protesting publicly against the injection of political matters into the management of the railway. I would further conclude that he must
have considered that railway project on its
merits absolutely, apart altogether from political considerations. Taking that view, I think
we have a right to know why he has changed
his mind, and why the Board of Management
have changed their minds, if they have done
so, with regard to that project, or why there
is not some recommendation in 1927 of a project which was considered to be urgent and
so reported by them in 1924.
My honourable friend may not be able to
give me an answer to-day, but I think this
an opportune time to ask for the information,
since large expenditures are to be made in
the western country, quite properly, for railway purposes. For my part, I would like to
be satisfied in regard to the attitude of the
Canadian National Railway Management to
this Guysborough road.
The present
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Government tas been so fully engrossed with
the matters contained in the Duncan Report
that it bas not thought of going beyond it
in looking into the rights and claims of Nova
Scotia. I doubt if this matter of the Guys-

MARCH 29, 1927
borough reilway ha been exemined, or if
eamined has bean reported on by the Duncan

Commission.
I would suggest that my honourabla friand
put his inquiry on the Ordar Paper so that
I may get an answar for him. Perhaps whet

the presant, Government

or Parliainant is

about to do for 'the Maritime Provincas will
satisfy my honourabla friand for the tima
being, and ha mey consent to postpone till

Legislatura, for about thîrty yaars with assurances juqt lika tha one my honoureble friand
has given me, and I confass that I do not
sea very much fruit from. them. What I
want ta know is why the Canadian National
Railway Management have changad thair
minds, if thay hava chenged.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, the Canadian National Railways Management mey
net have clianged their minds, but the Sanate
affirmad its own mind, and that sattled the
point.

Canadian National Reilways Act.

information concarning the statuis of the Intercolonial Railway, and I poetponad the third
reading of this Bill until to-day in order to
The answer I

hava received reeds as follows:
The situation is very simple. The Intercolonial bas not either entirely or partially lost its
significance as a Government Reilway, nor bas
its statue as a factor in the Confederation
arrangement been in any manner impaired. It
is stili tha semae old Intercolonial, owned exclusively by the Crown and not emelgamated
with for consolidated as a part of eny other
company or systemn.
The following changes have been made in
recent yeers in respect of the management:
In former days a Geneal Manager was appointed by Order in Council, and bis duties
as General Manager were very carefully defined. Later, the Board of Directors constituting the Canadian Northern was appointed to
act as General Manager, with the semae duties

as that of a General Manager under the Order
in Council. After the Canadian National Railway Company was created the existing arrangement was changed and the management and
operation of the Government lines, including
the Intercolonial, was entrustad to the Canadian National Railway Company. The effeat of
this was merely to maka the Canadien National
Railway Company the General Manager of the
Government Railways. They had power in al
things to operate and manage the Railway, but
they had no power in respect of construction,
for could they sell any part of the property nor
buy other properties, that right being reserved
in the Minister under the Government Railways Act. They administerad simply the Railway as handed over te them, maintaining it to
the standard of the Government Railways Act,
slightly different fromn the standard of the Dominion Railway Act.
Where capital improvemants are to ba made,
such as building new stations or laying new
sidings or tracks, our Railway Company acte as
agents of the Minister, nlot under the entrusting
Order.
Taxes.-The property has always been exempt
from taxation as property of the Crown and is
still exempt from taxation, both Municipal and
Payments, however, have been
Provincial.
made ta the Provincial Governments in the last
f ew years on a voluntary basis, specifically authorized by Order in Council. This does not
affect the lagal statua of the property nor of
the Crown.
Workmen's Compansation.-By amendments
passed by the Parliament of Canada the workmen employed on the Railway are subjeet to
the Workmen's Compensation Acts of the
Provinces.
St. John and Quebec Railway.-This property
bas not heen entrusted to the Canadian National Railway Company for operation and
management. In operating it as a part of the
Canadian National U3ailways we do so as agents
for the Department, in exactly the samne manner as we now operate the Hudson Bay Railway.
The Crown has authority et any time to cafcel the entrusting Order or to impose conditions in respect of operation and management
by stating terme in a new Order in Couneil.
Board's Control.-Under the Act of 1919 the
Board was given control of operation, not of
maintenance. Operetion covered tells to hae collected and the running of trains. The Board
obviously had no power over construction nor
of maintenance, since these things were not
entrusted to the Company and it would not hae
reasonable ta order the Company to do something which the Company had no power to do,
pover being vested in the Minister. The prescet Act gives the Board power over maintenance
to a limited extent, that is, in respect of the
safety of employees and the safety of passengers travelling on the trains. At present the
authority is vested in the Minister. That authority is now being transferred to the Board
to the limited extent steted.
That is signed by Mr. Ruel.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:- Yes, it would
be.
Hon. Mr. COPP: 1 would like to ask my
honourable friend how far the authority is
carried in regard to maintenance. The memorandum says that the present Act gives the
Board power over maintenance to, a limitcd
extent, regarding the safety of employees, and
of passengers travelling on the trains. 1 presume that sucb matters are now referred to
the Board of Railway Commissioners to Inquire into and make decision upon.
Hon. Mr. DANDU1{AND:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. COPP: Does that mean that they
have autbority to say when a bridge is to be
inspe'cted, when dt is to ibe rebuilt, and
matters of that kind, or to deal with the
condition of engincs and equipment? How
far does that authority go? Does the Act extend or limait the powers of the Board?
Hon. Mr. DAN DURAND:
I have given
the opinion of the attorney, and one of the
directors of the Board, who says:
Thie present Act gives the Board power over
maintenance to a limited extent, that is, in
respect of the safety of employees and the
safety of passengers travelling on the trains.
Hon. Mr. COPP: That is very elastic.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND (reading) :
At present the authority is vested in the
Minister. lîjat authority is 110w being transferred to the Board to the limited extent
stated.
That is the only answer I cao give. It
cornes from the -Canadian National Railways'
attorney. I do not know whether the Departînent wou]d give the same interpretation
to the present Bi'll.
Hon. Mr. COPP: I th-ink the legisiation we
are passing is very indefinite as to wvho shall
decide how far it may go.
Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Is not that
"Board" the Board of Management of the
Cariadian National Railways?
It seemis to
mean, not the Board of Railway Commissioncrs, but the Board of Management.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I should be incliped to think, bonourable gentlemen, that
the reference is to the Board of Railway
Comnussioners.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: It is so stated in
the cxplanatory note attached to the Bill.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Under the Railway Act the Board of Railway Commissioners
have jîîrisdiction witb regard to safety appliances, el, cetera, on railways in Canada;
but their jurisdiction has apparently not extended as far on the Intercolonial Railway as
Tion.

on other roads. It would appear from this
Bill that it je proposed to give the Board
of Railway Commissioners the same jurisediction over the Intercolonial Railway as over
aIl other raiîroads in the country, thereby
standardizing the requirements relative to
safety appliances, equipment, et cetera.
I
think that is wbat it is intended to cover.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The explanatory note accompanying the Bill says:
This subsection as added to section fourteen
gives to the Board of Railway Comunissioners
juriediction over maintenance on the Goverament Railways to the extent stated. At the
preseat time the jurisdiction over maintenance
on such railways je vested in the M.Ninister of

NORTH

WEST TERRITORIEýS BILL

CONSIDERED

IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand. the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 123, an
Act to amend the North West Territories
Act.
lion. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.
On section 1-export tax on furs:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The explanatory
ncte states:
A4 similar tax is in force ini nearîrv aIl the
provinces of Canada.

and is

conqidered expo-

(lient for the North West Territories.
Can my honourable friend tell us what law
any province bas, similar to this?
Hon. Mr. DANDUTRAND:
I understand
that the provinces levy a royal*ty upon furs.
When we were at the second reading of this
Bill the constitutional question was raised, as
to the right of a province to levy a tax upon
goods entering another province.
R-igbt Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Going out from that province.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Upon goods
going out fromn that province to another
province. The Bihl was not introduced without that point having been considered and
the matter having been referred to the
Department of Justice. The Department of
Justice bais given the folhowing opinion:
Section 121 of the British North America Act
reads as follows:
"AIl articles of the Growth, Produce, or
MNan'ifacture of any one of the Provines, shall,
froîn anil after the Union, be admitted free into
each of the other Provinces."
You will observe that this provision bas no
ap)plication whatever to the admission into any

MARCH 29, 1927
of the provinces of articles of the grewth, pro-

duce or manufacture cf the Northwest Territories, and I de net know of any other censtitutional limitation upon the right of Parliament

te enact the legislation propesed.
I send yen herewith fer yeur information a
miemorandum prepared by Mr. Plaxten centaining references te the existing provincial legislation purperting te limit the right ef expert of
furs frem saime of the provinces. Yen will observe that provincial legislation of this kind
lias been questiened by preceding ministers of
Justice in their reports upon provincial legislation, but such objections would net of course
npply te the present Bill, which. contemplates
legisiation by the Dominion Parliament regarding the administration of the Northwest Territories, which is a matter undoubtedly within its
j urisdîction-inasmucli as sectien 121 of the British
North America Act refera te articles ef the
grewth, preduce or manufacture of any one
of tbe provinces, and the Nerthwest Territories de net constitutio>nalIy forrn what is
understoed as a province.
Some objection bas been made with regard
te the difficulty of -levying that tax. The
reasen why the Department insists upon
retaining the expression "expert tax" is that
it does net want te deprive the people living
in the Territories of the rdght te use the furs
for their own clothîng. The Deapartment feels
justîfled in levying only a reyal'ty in the forrn
of an expert tax upon the furs taken frem
the Territeries for commercial purposes.
Besides, in answer to the statemnent that it
weuld be the trapper who in .the last analysis
weuld pay tha-t tax, I arn informed that the
trapper is generally paid in kind and net in
rnoney; that hie hardly ever sees meney. He
cornes te the Hudson Bay Company post, te
Revillon Freres, or te some ether large cernpany, with a pelt, and is offered in, payment
certain things in the store-food, instruments
for trapping purposes, or other articles there.
What lie is offered fer a fine peit may be
worth onfly $3 or $4; but when the pelt is
sbipped te another country it is worth $25 or
$30. I understand that those large companies
recegnize the riglit of the Governinent te a
certain tax on each pelt taken from these
Territories. The arnount te be cla.imed will
cerne from those large corporations. It will
be a very srnall tax, indeed, upen the pelts
that they get there, but it will help the
Department in the administration of that part
of our country. Se frem aIl angles 1 believe
that the Bill beforeus is commendable. The
ordinary traders-the Eskimo, the Indian and
the wbite rnan-will continue te get in the
stores the same quanti-ty as they are
accustomed te getting, and the country wfll
benefit frorn a resource which belongs te it
and gees eut te enrich those large corporations.

199

Now, if the Chamber agrees with me a.s to
the menit of this .proposed legisiation, 1 will
suggest a saal amendment. The Bill reads
as follows:
The levying of an export tax upon furs exported from the Territories te, any other part
of Canada or te, any foreign country.
I would strike out the word "foreiga", and
substitute the word "other," se that it would
read, "or to any other country"; because 70
or 75 per cent of the furs taken by the Hudson
Bay Company go te London, and under the
expression "foreign" they would escape the
tax,
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER-:
Why do yeu need te substitute anything?,
Hon. W. B. ROSS: It miglit read, "experted
from the Territories."
Right Han. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That covers the whole thing.
Hon.. Mr. DANDURAND: It is perhaps as
well te leave the wordling as it is, because it
comprises the phrase "to any ether part of
Canada" and witheut it there might be some
difllcuity raised as te the right te collect on
furs in Canada. If the phrase is left there it
shows clearly that whenever furs leave the
Territeries, whether te corne to a province
in Canada or te go outside the country, they
are liable te t.he tax.
Honeurable
Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH:
gentlemen, I fear that for a variety ef reasens,
I cannot agree with the henourable leader of
the Governrnent in his observatiens as te the
desirability of this method of raising money.
He bas said that the tax will ulti.mately fal
net upon the trapper, but upen the large
commercial establ'ishments whe in the end
receive the furs. Well, these establishments
already arc taxed by ail the machinery of
taxation that we have, and they pay their
share. If it is urged that some of them pay
substantial dividends, this may be peinted
out, that nearly ail of them. are cngaged in
mercantile business spreading over the whole
West, samd their profits are largely derived
from that mercantile business, and net the
business of fur trading, which is very precanieus at best, and during late years has been
quite'unsatisfaotery as a result of the war.
By virtue of legisiation already enacted by
this Parliament the Indians, the Eskimos and
other wards of the Goverument are in a
priviieged position with regard te their indebtedýness: no dlaim for debt can, be enf orced againist them in thoe Territories. The
whele fur business is a system of trading,
as the honourable leader of the Goverament
has pebnted eut and is based upon a form of

200

SENATE

credit given by the traders to those aboriginal
inhabitants. This credit involves a very substantial element of risk. There is great risk
not only from that source, but also from other
contingencies, such as fire, flood, climate, et
cetera; and if actual statistics could be produced-which I doubt-they would go to
show that the business of fur trading is a
precarious one and ought not to be hampered
any more than it is at the present time.
Then there arises the question of collecting
this tax, and one wonders how it is to be
collected. It is obvious that there cannot be
collectors where the fur originates and that
collection will take place only at large centres.
This simply means that a great many persons
engaged in the business of fur trading will
escape by reason of the fact that they cannot be located.
The honourable leader of the Government
says that the Department of Justice, in giving
their opinion, have declared, as I understand,
that it would be intra vires of the constitution for this Parlianent to levy a tax on the
export of furs from the Territories, but ultra
vires to levy such a tax in respect of furs
in any province. Well, that is scarcely a
generous attitude on the part of Parliament,
because it applies to our own territory and
our own people. Parliament ought flot to
take advantage of the fact that these people
are not in an organized province.
Indeed that raises another question, whether
this Parliament has a right to levy a tax
where there is no representation. It is a
principle as old as the Anierican Revolution,
at all events, that there shall be no taxation
without representation.
The imposition of
such a tax is productive of trouble in the
end, and I submit that we have no right to
levy a tax upon a vital industry in that
country without consultation with those
people, which consultation can be had only
through the medium of representative institutions. I submit. therefore, that we ought not
to tax those people until we give them representation.
Then there is the constitutional and legal
aspect-the question whether or not this
Parliament bas a right to impose a tax of
this nature, which is in contravention of the
British North America Act. There is no
similarity at all between this form of taxation
and the form of taxation levied on furs by
the legislatures of the several provinces. It
is obvious that a province bas the same right
to levy a tax upon furs originating in the
province, or to charge, as some do, a royalty,
as it has to levy a tax on motor cars, theatres,
gasoline, or anything else within its jurisdiction, but here you have the Government at
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

Ottawa levying taxation on a territory with
respect to exported furs originating in that
area, and the tax is to be collected in another
part of the country, an organized part, after
exportation. I bow to the opinion of the
Department of Justice, but it seems to me
that this is an unconstitutional tax; that it
is productive of trouble. in view of.the fact
that you are taxing people without representation; and that it is unjust, for the reason
that it bears upon people already heavily
taxed. If the trader in the big centre is
ultimately to pay, if the tax is to be laid
upon the unfortunate individual who gathers
the fur-and, no doubt, an attempt will be
made to lay it upon him-you are taxing a
person who leads a precarious and hard
existence, who never knows from year to year
how he will come out, and who is least able
to pay. For these reasons I shall vote against
this clause and against the Bill itself.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend recognizes the right of a Province to
levy t ax upon things that are produced in
that Province. The North West Territories
are being adninistered by the Government.

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is a vital
difference. The people who live in a Province are taxed by the Government whici they
elecet: the individuals who catch the fur and
own the pack have delegated to their provincial Government the authority and the
riglit to tax thiem, and they consent to the
taxation; but here you have an attempt by
the Government at Ottawa to levy taxation
upon individuals who perhaps never heard of
this Government, and who certainly do not
consent to tiis Governmtent's action any more
than the people of Massachussetts consented
to the tax on tea.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I do not see
tiat there is any considerable hardship in the
operation, because those people in the North
West Territories who are without representation are not affected by this legislation when
the furs are used for domestic consumption.
They can even sell the goods that they produce without being reached by this tax. It
is only when those goods come into the hands
of large corporations that carry them outside
of the North West Territories for commercial
purposes that the tax becomes operative.
Those goods are not very valuable in the
first place, and do not bring much to the
original owner; but tupon reaching civilizatfin they yield three hundred or four hundred or five hundred per cent profit. It
seems to nie that under this Bill we are touching the inhabitants of those regions with a

MARCH 29, 1927
feather, so to speak, and are properiy levying a tax upon outsiders 'who benefit from
the riches which are to be found in that territory, and who should. contribute this paltry
percentage towards the cost of the administration of that territor.y.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER: I
agree in the main with the argument which
my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
bas presented for the passaige of this Bill
But I thirîk there is another consideration
that has not been mentioned, and it weighs
with me to a certain extent. The imposition
of such ail export tax will have some influence, and I should think a considerable influence, in protecting gaine in those wide
regions and preventing a slaughter which can
only eventuate in the extinction of the gamne.
A new danger threatens those far distant
parts of our territory. The aeroplane now
takes people beyond our sight and above the
ken of our customns officers, and transports
thein to the very centre of the haunts of large
and sinail game, and some measures wiii have
to be taken, I have no doubt, to prevent an
indiscriminate slaughter by adventurers and
sportsmen of that kind who will easily find
their way into those regions. It wouid be
a tremendous pity and a great shame if we
should wake up years from now or generations from now and find that those preserves,
which Nature thought she had made aimost
impregnable, had been denuded of their gaine.
I think, the Government, if it bas not already
done so, shouid take some steps with a
view to averting that danger. My honourable friend will remember that a few years
ago sporting parties frosu another country,
and sometimes, perhaps, from our own, made
their way in swif t launches up along our coast
and -hot the sea fowl as they were sitting
upon their nests and incubating the future
supply of birds of that kind. Fortunately a
Treaty has been made between Canada and
the United States which goes very far towards
protectîng sen fowl and large migratory birds;
but there is a great danger looming ahead,
by reason of the facility with which sportsmen,
so-called, in aeroplanes, may reach the territories inhabited by gaine and destroy what
we shouid try to preserve.
1 do not know whether there are any regulations as to the licensing of people froin
outside our own country, and preventing
thein froin shooting gaine -in such sections of
our country, or whether there is any preventive or supervisory attention given to
that phase of the subi ect.
Our birds and fourfooted game are distributed over wide areas; tbey are to be found in

201

the mountains thousands of feet high, and on
the lakes and rivers, and far up into the north,
where caribou and other large gaine animais
corne and go. I think that is something
which we ought to keep in mind, it is so distinctive of Canada and such a gema in lier
crown. Take the musk-ox, for instance, about
which some Departimlent of the Governinent
has issued a most entertaining and 'instructive
littie ýbook. It shouid be our care to preserve
our gaine and in that way make Canada
a country of abundance. We are doing that
to a certain degree by our gaine preserves
and parks, but there is a mighty region up
towards the north, which is open to, invasion
by ail kinds of sporting oharacters who may
easiiy reach those ares by aeroplane.
I amn in favour of this Bill because I think
it wiii have some -influence in diminishîng the
destruction of gaine. I do not suppose that
nmong the people who live in those distant
regions one out of a hundred traps with any
idea of exporting personaiiy. Their market
is in the stores in that country; but I think
the profit on furs is so large that even those
who buy thein in quantities and look for
their returas only after they have exported
thein, shouid have no objection to a fairIy
good tax.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I believe there
is a license. I will get officiai data in regard
to that question, and if this Bill reaches the
third reading I wiii present it to the right
honourable gentleman then.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I say a word
in answer to the Leader of the Governient
in this House? The fur gathered in that
northern country is ail sold. Nobody there
wears fur. The Indian, who catches most of
the fur, wears a straw hat and a shirt and
overalis in the summner turne, and a blanket
coat in the winter turne. So far as the protection of game is concerned, this Bill bas
not anything, even remoteiy, to do with it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, but I se
the point of the rîght honourable gentleman
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Pos'ter). This tax
wviii force a statement froin the large dealers
as ta what they are carrying out of the
country, and for the first turne we wiii have
an opportunity of knowing exactly what furs
are going out of that territory.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: As a matter of
fact, fur and gaine are quite different. Nobody shoots fur for gaine, and nobody shoots
gaine for fur. They have nothing to do with

SENATE
each other.
The buffalo is a prohibited
anima], and the rnusk-ox is in the same category.
My point is that aIl this fur is exported;
it is flot used by the people in that territory
at ali. I do flot suppose you wouid find a
fur cap in that whole country. This Bill
wiil flot affect the garne preservation in any
possible way.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I wish to 6ay a word
or two in support of the honourable gentleman frorn Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach).
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 would ask that
Mr. Finnie be allowed to corne to the floor.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: In the first place,
there is no relationship at ail, as the honourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Gricsbacb) has said, betwcen this Dill and the
protection of game. As I understand it, the
Coromis.sioner of the North West Territories,
with the approval of the Government, bas
pa.ssed for the protection of game the same
sort of ordinances or laws that we have in
our Provinces; and I arn sure their provisions
are very stringent indeed. In other words, the
protection of gaine is already taken cre of.
There are only two points I wish to make as
te wby 1 oppose this Diil. In the first place,
I do not agree with the Leader of the Governinent that this tax wili flot falu upon the
trapper; that if I arn a trader in that country
the tex is goiog te feli upon rne. It is quite
true that as a trader I rnay trade tobecco
and fleur and beads and other things for fur;
but if I have to pay this tex I arn going te
give a littie less fleur, ýtobecce, end se on
ail aleng the uine. I deam that the incidence
of this tax wiil fall upon the trapper. Now,
consider the condition in whicb that man is
living. I say the tax is a hardship, and I ask,
particulerly when you censider the arnount
that the Federel Governrnent is going te get
eut of it, ie it fair?
After ail, sornebody
ha; said--I think if was the Leder bimself
(Heu. Mr. Dandurend)-the tax will arnount
te only $75.000. If that is true, and if there
is any possibility of this tax felling on the
trapper, then I say it is a very unfair tax.
There is just one other point. We nmst
bear in mind that this tex will net be paid
by the big corporations. That is an entireiy
erroneous ie.
I had the privilege some
tbrre or four years cge of attending wvlit is
calcd the co-operative auction sale of fuis,
in the city of Winnipeg. The sale was held
in the Roya!l Alexandra Hetel, and lasted, I
suippose. sonne three or fouir days. I had nothing particlar te do at the time, and spent
the better part of two dnys attending that
lion. -Mr. GRIESBACH.

sale. There were hundreds of buyers there
from. ail over the World frein Europe, frein
London, and a great rnany from the United
States. There rnust have been in that roorn
at least four hundred people attending the
sale. The fîirs being sold et that saie were
net the furs of the big companies, but the
furs of tue sineil independent treders. The
day bas gene by when tlie Hudson Day Cernpany and Revilion Freres control that business. They have got rid of that monopoiy.
There are now hundreds of traders scattered
throughout that north country, and they
gather their furs and take thein down te the
Winnipeg mnarket, where they are sold by
auction. Those men, as the honoureble rnember frein Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Grieçebcch)
bas wel'l said, carry on a very precarieus business. I rernember the old days, thirty yecrs
age, when these independent traders brought
their furs te Edmonton. They were more or
less at the rnercv of the buyers, and rnany
a year they made neo profit at all.
It is ail very well te talk ,about profit in
the fur business; but thet profit dues not go
te the fur trader. It does net corne until efter
the fur lias passed te the manufacturer. That
is wliere the profit begins te corne in. Nobody knows w'hat the condition of -the fur
markct is going te lie to-merrow.
These
traders buy marten to-day at say $6, and
when they reacb the markct ncxt year tliey
inay get only $2 in the open sales; and many
ayear they lese money instead of making
it. Any profit there is in the fur business gees
te the man wvho gets the fur in a place like
St. Paul, Minneapolis, or New York, and
manufactures if in eccordence with the fashions
of tlie day.
I object te the Diil on tweo grounds. In
the first pliace, the amount te be coilected is
very srn.îi; in the second place, I believe the
tex wiil faîl on the trader. Further, I believe that the large number of smail independent traders eliuld nut bic caflld upun
te pay the tax because of the precarieus
nature of the business they are carrying on.
Hon. Mr. DANDTJRAND:
Frein the information that I have, I believe my honourable friend's argument is faulty. He wvas in
Winnipegý and saw furs being offered for sale.
Some of those furs came frein Aliberta, soe
frein Saskatchiewan, some frein Manitoba, and
some from. the Northi West Territories. The
furs that carne frein fthc three organized
Provinces lad paid a tax, end there was a
starnp upon thein. The trader offerineg tbpF
peits asked a certain pnie, and very iikely
tbat fax wais inchîided in the pnie, as is doue

MARCH 29, 1927
under good management, and was in that
way transferred to the purchaser.
Now, the difficulty which those three Provinces have encountered in levying a tax upon
peits has been that when a man was caught
with a peit that was not stamped, he could
always say, "I took it in the North West
Territories." So when we ask to put a tax
upon the fur which cornes fromn the North
'West Terrîtories, we are only asking to do
the same thing that has been donc by the
three Provinces, and to help the honest
traders of those three Provinces to meet on
an equal footing their rivais from the North
who at present do not pay the tax.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBAiCH: I would ask the
honourable gentleman whether the Government has been asked by ithe Provincial
Governments to help them in that fashion?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I cannot answer
that, but I believe I arn making a fair argument to est.ablish the fact that we are helping
to maintain. order and good morals among the
traders of those three Provinces and of the
Northwest Territories.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: But djd
you ever think of that before?
Hon. Mr. 4DANDURAND: I thought of it
when I came to ask that a very high penalty
be put upon gentlemren whose wives went to
New York and bought dresses. I think I
remember that two years ago in this Chamber
some nierbers thought that we were pretty
harsh on ladies who went to New York and
paid $105 for a dress and thus became hiable
to go to jail. What did we find then? We
were simoply trying to have the law respected.
Now I believe that in .this instance we are
dsoing the fair thing by the traders of the
western Provinces and of the Northwest
Territories, and that when my honourable
friend returns to Winnipeg and attends one
of those sales, he will perchance look a little
more closely to find the stam that is
im.printed on the pelt, indicating that a tax
bas been paid to one of those provinces. It
will have been paid also if it cornes frorn the
Northwest, and I believe this will help to
maintain the equality of opportunity arnong
all the traders who are selling on the Winnipeg
market.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: If this Bill had been
introduced for the purpose of clearly defining
its intention týo protect the Provinces, I doubt
very rnuch if I would have taken the attitude
I have. But that was not the explanatipn
tbat was gîven to us. The only Explanation
was that the Bill was to raise revenue. ,The

203

honourable leader of tbe Government spoke
of the Northwest Territories with their vast
resources, and said it coat so rnuch rnoney Vo
administer the law in those Territories, that
the Government needed the revenue, and that
this mea.sure would provide $75,000 revenue.
Now we have an entirely different argument.
now hýe cornes and says that that is not its
main purpose at alI, but that there are tbree
Provinces in western Canada that have a tax
on furs, and they bave these fur sales, and
perchance rnany of tbose fur sales will go on
wiathou-t having collect-ed the fax of the
Provincial Government, and therefore we
should pass this law so that the Provinces
rnay colleet their full revenue.
But what are the facts so far as the collection of revenue is concerned in the Northwest
Territuries? There are very few outlets for
furs. There is one at Hudson Bay, and I
suppose that is wby the change is proposed.
The furs will be exported at Fort Nelson or
Fort Churchill, and go direct to the Old
Country. But no one can say that the police
force at those outlets cannot collect the taxes
there. No fur cam go through the outlet at
the north, near the mouth of the Maekenzie
River, at Hersehell Island, with the police
force that is there.
The Province of 'ManitoMba bas only one
inlet from the north, and it is protectedi.
People do not carry their furs out through the
woods and wilds; tbey bave to follow the
beaten trick, and one or two, officers can watch
every bit of fur that cornes through.
In Saskatchewan, there are only two or
three points at whicb fur can corne in, such
as Prince Albert and Battieford.
In the Province of Alerta you have the
main inlet at Edmonton, and there is no place
easQt of Edmonton where they could get
through.
These furs are sometirnes carried
huind-reds of miles, or even a tbousand miles,
and the frappera can only follow the beaten
track. else it would be impossible to get
tbrougb.
So that in that wbole stretch of
country from Hudson Bay to the Rocky
Mountains there are not more than four or
five points of entry. The furs have corne
through those points in the past, and w-bile it
is possible that sorne odd fur rnay get through
otherwise tlie conditions are such that no
great quantity can ever reaeh Winnipeg for
one of those large sales without corning under
the review of the officers who possess the
power to colleect the tax.
My main objection to this Bil! is tbat the
tax will faîl upon the saal trader, and for
oel the money that is involved I do not think
the tax is reasonable or fair.

204

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Was not my
honourable friend a member of the Saskattchewan Government that imposed the tax
on ftirs?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Surely, but the conditions are entirely different.
Take Saskatchewan, for example; there are a certain
nuinber of traders in the country, but they are
living under entirely different conditions from
those in the territories.
Many of those
traders have different work during the year;
some are even farmers, and they go out into
the woods in winter, and set traps. They are
living within the bounds of civilization, with
all that that means. But take the man living
on the edge of the Riding Mountains who is a
trapper, and compare the conditions under
which he lives with those of the man north of
Athabasca Lake who lives entirely on his traps,
and who might bc said to bc outside of civilization.
Where people live in settled and
governed Provinces, with all that that means,
the tax is all right, and there is no objection
to it, but wihen you come to those traders
who are living under entirely different conditions I think the tax is all wrong.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I was asked by
my honourabile friend (Hon. Mr. Griesbach)
i. question whether the Provinces had asked
for this tax, and it happens that I have an
affirmative answer in regard to Alberta and
British Columbia.
They asked for it, and
gave the reason.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII:

Asked what?

lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The Governments of Alberta and British Columbia gave
the reason that they had great difficulty in
levying their taxes upon the peit, bcause the
argument was often made by a man who had
furs in his possession, that were untaxed, because te had taken them in the Northwest
Territories.
lon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That may have
been so some time ago, but now that argument is very mueh less prevalent.
But tere
is a suggestion I should like to offer to the
honourable leader of the Government. I think
it imay be asserted that the trader in a Province will get three or four times as much in
value for the fur that he trades as willl the
man coming from a remote part of the Northwest Territories, because in many parts of
Alberta a trapper is within fifteen or twenty
miles of a railway.
Along the whole of the
railway from Edmonton to McMurray, for
example, a man would get his groceries and
provisions from sonie village or wayside station
on the railway. Therefore the basis of trading
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

is so favourable to a man in a Province that
he wilil get perhaps three times as mu.eh for
his furs as the unfortunate individual who
lives, we will say, at the east end of Slave Lake,
where flour has to be carried and changed at
one time and another until it is worth $20
a bag.
Yet you a-re putting a tax on the
man who gets less for his fur than of any
trapper in Canada.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
If the
honourable gentleman is putting this tax on
to help the ProvincesHon. Mr. DANDURAND: Not to help the
Provinces: to help administer those Northwest
Territories.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
How will
that come about? They may put a tag on
the furs taxed in the Northwest Territories,
and when they come into a Province they
will be the only furs that will be exempt.
Why could you not put the tag on particular
furs that are taken in the Northwest Territories, without charging a tax?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I am informed
that there are large companies that to-day
monopolize about 75 per cent of the trade, so
that it would be easy to collect that tax te
the extent of that 75 per cent from those
large companies, most of which are exporting
directly to Europe. There may be three or
four of those large companies; I know personally of two. Although my honourable friend
from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr. Calder), who spoke
for the small trader, may think that $75,000
is a small sum, yet it is these small sums
collected by the various departments for
services directly rendered that help to maintain the various services of government.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:
But that
does not answer the argument that this is a
great hardship on the poor trapper of the
north country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Well, as to that
there is a legitimate difference of opinion.
The Departrnent does not believe that the
trapper will stand in any danger of receiving
a small offer for his fur because a purchaser
will have to pay a 25 cent tax on a pelt.
Hon. Mr. DONNELLY:
My honourable
friend is giving $75,000 as the estimate of the
amount to be raised by this tax; but could
te give us an estimate of the cost of collecting
the tax, or the method to be followed in
collecting it?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The collection
will be made by the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, and will cost nothing.

agree to pay when due all assessments, taxes
and other charges necessary to be paid for the
security of the Board in respect of the loan and

Should such taxes, assessments and
charges not be paid when due, they may be paid
by the Board and charged to the borrower, and
if not repaid to the Board on or before the
next interest date with interest thereon at a
rate not exceeding eight per cent per annum

SENATE

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think this might
stand over until to-morrow, or until the honourable member (Hon. Mr. Béique) is here.
There is some objection to these amendments.
I do not know exactly what it is. If the honourable gentleman were here he would probably explain, and there would 'be no difficulty
about it. Personally, I do not know anything
about the Bill except that one or two people
have spoken to me about it objecting to the
renewal of the patent. It has been dead
for about five years, I think. If the honourable member were here, he could probably
explain.
My recollection is
Hon. Mr. MURPHY:
that whven the Bill came up before, the position just mentioned by the honourable leader
of the Opposition was stated, and in addit.on a prospect was held out that the Patent
Office, or its representatives, would attend the
Committee and state what their position was;
because, on the face of it, it is an extraordinary thing that a patent wbich has been
dead for five years would be revived in this
off-hand way.
Ho. G. G. FOSTER: Because it has been
u-ed by a certain number of people.
Hon. Mr. MURPHY: Possibly, and there is
no provision to safeguard rights that might
have developed in the meantime.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I heard the discussion
of this Bill in the Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills. The parties interested
in the renewal were there, as well as one gentieman in opposition, and the Conmittee
were satisfied to the extent that they voted
unanimously in favour of renewal. There was
no objectien to this Bill by any member of
that Committee, and the objections that were
made to it seened rather trivial.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The practice is
that if there is not to be any opposition to
the report of the Committee, we may take
that stage, but if there is, then of course we
owe it to the gentleman in whose narne the
Bill stands to adjourn the discussion.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: In view of the explanation just given we might well proceed.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If there is no
objection to taking that stage, but I do net
know anything about the Bill; I have not
read it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I will be guided by
the Committec; they were unanimous about
it.
The motion for concurrence was agreed te.

CANADA'S

RAILWAY PROBLEMS
DISCUSSION CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from March 22 the
debate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Robertson:
That he will call the attention of the Government te certain matters affecting Canada's
transportaion activities and problems; will enquire of the Government whether or not it has
any definite policy in relation thereto, and if
so, will ask that it be publicly declared.
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: Honourable gentlemen, when I moved the adjournment of
the debate I bad no intention of speaking on
this matter, neither have I now. I simply
moved the adjournment in order to give some
other honourable gentlemen an opportunity
to speak.
Honourable
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, as I understood the other day,
the discussion of this matter is concluded; but
before my honourable friend the leader of
the Government makes his reply, I would
like to offer a few observations concerning
some matters mentioned and points raised.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Of course, the
honourable gentleman bas no right to speak,
except with the leave of the House. The discussion is not on a motion at all; it is only on
an inquiry. If the House bas no objection,
J have noce, to the honourable gentleman
gong on.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: I would respectfully as-k the leave of the House for a few
minutes, simply to make reply, in the hope of
jIacing upon the record, further information
which honourable gentlemen indicated their
desire to have.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My honourable
leader on this side of the House (Ho. W. B.
Ross) indicated that he had found diffliculty in
obtaining satisfactory information as to the
earnings of various classes of employees in
the railway service in Canada. Without attempting to go into a discussion or explanation of that matter, I would be glad to place
upon the record a copy of a published statement issued by the Department of Labour
under date of January, 1927, which gives that
information for each year, extending over a
period of years from 1920 to 1926, and gives
the rates of pay which various classes of men
in the railway service bad received, with the
fluctuations, during the period. Without further explanation, with the leave of the House
I will have it spread on the record:

My bonourable friend from Montarville
(Hon. Mr. Beaubien) made some observations
that were quite in order. I was glad to hear
that after a somewhat careful inquiry on his
part into the statement and figures which I
had put on the record hie f ound them correct,
except that he felt that I had flot told the
complete story, and hie drew conclusions on
the basis of hourly rates of pay.
I could carry my honourable frjend back
quite beyond 1917, the year that hie mentioned,
because I well recali that.in 1892 I1 worked
12 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 9 cents
an hour. If we were to base the percentage
of increase ini railway waxes from that time
forward it would look like a very substantial
improvement. But I thizik that the annual
earnings of working men form the fair basis

from which to judge, no matter in what capacity they miay be employed.
My honourable friend from Montarville
also had some littie douht. 1 think, as to the
accuracy of some statements which I made
with reference to the comioarative fluctuation
in earning power of railway employees as
compared with those in inidustrial activities
in Canada. Likewise I wish to place upon the
record an extract from a document published
by Parliament last year on this very question, which gives in tabulated form the comparative fluctuation in wages among railway
men and eight other classes of industrial
workers, the total amounting to over a million
employees in Canada. This statement speaks
f or itaelf, and it will give honourable gentlemen accurate information on that point. The
statement is as follows:

My honourable friend, in dealing with this
question, also drew some coniparisons between railway employees and civil servants.
F'or several reasons I hesitate to invade that
field, but if my honouarbie frie.nd will take
the pains-as I arn sure ho would ho glad to
do if ho is jnterested in the subject-te compute the hours of actual service which civil
servants render, as compared with the actual
hours worked by railway employees, ho will
flnd that on an hourly basis the percentage
woîîld hc' very substantial in favour of the
railway men. For example, if nsy honourable
frienýd, or any honourable gentleman, would
refer to page 27 of the publication issued by
Parliament in 1926, being a report of the
Industriel Relations Committee, ho will find
the information for which my honourable
friend from Montarville was seeking. He
refcrred particularly ta engineers operating
passenger trains. This record shows that ongineers of passenger trains worked in that
yoar 2,434 hours and that their average annual
earnirigs were $3,249, their average hourly
earning 'being $1.33. If my honourable friend
will turn to the Auditor General's report for
1924-the same year that these figures ceverho will find that head clerk in the civil service
received $2,760, but on the hasis cf the hours
of service performed ho received $1.68 an
hour, as again8t $1.33 cf the locomotive ongineer, who had been in the service cf the
railway for prohably thirty years before ho
reached the point where ho was entitled te
that position.
Therefore when we cerne te comipute wages
or make cemparisons on an hourly liasis we
woul find that persons who are in the civil
service would ma.ke the railway employees'
wages look like a peanut beside an apple.
Hon.

Mr.

ROBERTSON.

I happen te ho interested in one particular
class cf railway employees, perhaps, more
than others. That class comprises train dispatchers, station agents and telegraph eperaters, aIl cf whomn have a good deal cf responsibility in connection with their work.
I am sure that every honourable gentleman
appreciates the gravity and responsibility cf
the position cf train dispatchers, and in
Canada te-day they receive, I think, $1.11 an
hour. I was rather impressed, in ma.king a
comparison with a senior file clerk in the
civil service, te find that the rate cf the latter
is alsc 81.11 an heur. I wiIl net go further
into that, hecause the comparisens would ho
still more te the advantage of railway mon,
and perhaps this is net the time te enter
into a detailed discussion cf that; but I would
.îust refer honourable gentlemen to the record,
and they cen make their cwn comparisons
and draw their own conclusions.
One other point I would like te mention, that
cf the class cf railway employees that go te
make up the average railw-ay earning cf 57
cents an heur, there are thousands engaged
in construction and maintenance work in the
summer seeson that are 'net included at ahl,
whose rates cf pay run as low as 25 cents an
heur; se that the figures that were put on
the record cof March loth here do net inchide the large numnber cf mon who are working for a very small wage, that would bring
the average dowvn if they were te ho included.
Again, I would drew the attention cf the
lieuse, in aIl seriousness, te the fact that railwey employees in Canada are te-day receiving
more than 8200 a year less than comparable
empleyees on United States railroads; and,
as explained theoether day, in 1921, they cen-

MARCH 29, 1927
tributed $170 a year, each, by way of reduction
in wages, with a view of trying to help out
the difficuit situation with which aur railways
were then confronted.
I want ta point out one other feature that
has a bearing, and an important bearing. on
this question, so fat as railway men are concerned, of which the general public may flot
have thought. I note that in January last
a gentleman name&? Grant, who is a professor
of Economîcs in the Agricultu-ral College at
Winnipeg, a Provincial eump1oyee, made the
statement that in 192= the cost of .producing
a hushel of wheat in the Province of Manitoba
was 81 cents. He stated at the same time that
the cost of producing a bushel of similar
wheat in the State of Minnesota or the
Dakatas was $1.20--a difference of 50 per
cent. My honouraible friend fromn Montarville
in his remarks the other day indicated, I have
na doubt correctly, that the coet -of transportation af tlhat wheat an a Canadian railroad for
the same distance was approximately haif of
what it would 'be on a United States railraad.
Yet what do we find? I was in the city of
Detroit a few weeks ago negotiating some wage
adjustments with an American railway on
behaif of the employees, and while the average
rates are higher in the United States, thase employees are purchasing bread made from
American wheat, which costs $1.20 ta raise,
and twice as munch ta transport, and are paying 9 cents for a 2-pound loaf cf bread, or
t'hree boaves for a quarter of a dollar, while
in Canada, and right i Ottawa, for bread
made from wheat that coste 81 cents a bushel,
and perhaps haîf as much for transport, we
pay il cents for a 2-pound loaf. That is, we
pay 2 cents a loaf more for 'bread manufactured from our wheat, that ebviously costs
about 50 per cent less ta produoe, and haif
as *much ta transport.
The Canadian railway employee, with the
reduced wage, is paying a higher price for
bread as compared with the American railway
employee with the advanced rate, who is
getting the cheap bread.
I cail the attention of my honourable frieaxd
opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) ta the fact
that a f ew years ago his Gavernment created
what was suppased ta be a very efficient
machine, the purpose of which was ta pulverize comibines; and it may very well be
that that machine might be put into aiperatian
ta investigate bread pricea to-day. There are
9,000,000 people in Canada, and roughly
speaking, we consumne one-third of a loaf of
bread per capita per day. If casts were the
same in bath countries ta produce, on that
basis we are paying $W0,000 a day mare for
au-r bread in Canada than the people in the
32655--14J

211

United States are paying for theirs, the comparison heing based on our population; but
with the difference in cost of production of
the wheat, from which the bread is made,
we might expect a Iittle adIvantage in this
figure.
The railway employees feel that they a-re
peying $28,000,000 a yea-r to-wards that advantage which wheat growers are receiving.
On
the other hand they pay 20 per cent more for
their bread, and that entera inta their calculation cf the things that concern them ao
seriously at the present moment. I bring thet
ta the attention of the Government as one
matter whioh might be worthy of same consideration on their part.
I propose ta mention just one other point.
My honourable friend from. Mont arville, in
his very courteous and genial way, rebu<ed
me just a little for presulning ta bring this
question ta the attention of Parlianient and
the country because of what he seemed ta
think was the undesirable effeet that it had.
1 think his words were:
My honourable friend, înstead of emphasizing
the discontent of workmen, and encouraging
them ta go ahead and exact higher wages,
rnight restrain them and tell them: "No; in a
country like Canada, so widely spread and s0
sparsely populated, you cannot expeet greater
reniuneration naw."
I desire ta point out ta my honourable
friend and ta the lIeuse that it was not my
abject ta agitate for inicreased remuneratian
for railway employees, when I brought this
matter ta the attention af Parliament.
My
object was purely and simply this; knowing
the conditions as they are, I believed that the
people of Canada, the members of Parliament,
and the press in generally did not appreciate
the facts, but were of opinion ùnat Canadian
railway employees, as a whole, were being
paid equal ta if not better rates than those
of the United States. I felt that the Canadian
public were wholly unaware of the fact that
while we have been standing stili for the past
four years, similar employees in the United
States have been adIvancing at the rate of at
Ieast 7j per cent in that time, sa that the situation was growixng nat anly interesting but
acute.
That being sa.
I was canvinced
that any further interference in the adjustment
of the freight-rate structure-which aur friends
of the rarlway have always said was the reason
why they were unable ta treat their employees
in the manner that some of theni indicated
they would be glad ta do-would cast a seriaua
responsibiýlity upon the Board of Ilailway 0Cmmîssioners first, and the Governient second,

212

SENATE

for what might occur in the event of this
situation developing as there was danger of
it doing.
As a member of Parliament, with knowlecige of these things, I consider that it was nlot
nnly proper, but it was sny duty, to bring
them to the attention of the bouse.
I trust
that no one who bas sat in this bouse for the
past ten years with me wiIl ever for one
moment think that I had in mind any attempt
to stir the mincis of railway employees of
Canada to grec ter effort in bringing this matter
to the attention of the bHuse.
Indeed, may
I say that a few days after 1 addressed the
bu2e on the subi oct, our daiqy newspapers
came out with statements such as these:
Gross revenue for the 12-înonth period was
the greatest since 1920, being nearly $4,500,000
ahead of the fine showing made in 1925, and
gross earnings froim railway and lake steamers
the year resulted in a notable increaseAnd se on. Published in the daily press, it
lis had the effect, to a far greater degree V)han
anything I have ever saidi, of bringing to the
attention of the railway employees the fact
that our railways are spparently not wholly
consistent in the attitude they have taken
towards their employees when they bo.ast to
the public of the splendid increase in their net
earnings and yet attempt to continue telling
the employees, "Because of t)he freight rate
situation and the investigation that is going
on, wie cannot meet your reasonable request."
I arn inclined to think that the whole discussion will have done gond; that it will (have
haci the effect of bringing ail interests nearer
to a realization that something must be done
to mieet this situîation reasonably; and I have
no doubt in the world that, with sucli a spirit
as bas permeated and actuated the railway
employees ini Canada as well as the railway
managements for many years, they will ho able
to work out their problemns. But I arn anxious that neither the railway men for tihe
Goveroment or Parliament of Canada shoulci
finci tJhemselves in a position where they miglit
be held responsible for haviog created a situation that could not be taken care of without
difficulty.
I feel that the beat sumaming up that could
be made of the railwsy problemn and the
preserit situation with reference ta rates wotild
be to qunte from a farmers' publication if you
plea§e, known as tihe Farm, and Ranch Review, printed in Calgary, Alberta, an article
wvhich I think is ene of the sanest utterances
on the subjeet that I have seen. It comprises
just three paragraphs, and before closing 1
will put it on the record. I fancy that every
honourable member of this Houee knows the
writer. He says:
Hon.

Mr. ROBERTSON.

-No0 couintrY ini the worlcl depeiids so abjectly,
and completely upon the highest degree of efficiency in transportation as Canada does. Our
great exporting arca, contrihuting the bulk of
the railway tonnage, lies far inland and presents
practically a one-way baul and thus creates a
unique problem. Canada's whole future developiient in agricuilture and industry will be
absolutely liiinited and contrnlled by the skill
and ingenuity of our transportation leaders and
the expedition with whicl% we may succeed in
augmenting our population, so as to eliminate
the terrible handicap we beedlessly created
wb%-en we enibarked on our spectacular railway
expansion program somne years ago.
Canada has 42,692 miles of railways to serve
a pitiful aine million people. In 1900 we had
only 17,6.57 miles of railway. This cîjornius
expansion adventure. -%vas based on the .2onfident
expectation that the stream of immigration
w ould continue unabated, or even at a greater
rate thon prevailed during the carlier years of
the presenit century. Ia this we have been
m-oefully disappointed. We have to-day more
miles of railway than any other country, except
the United States, and more miles per thousand
inhahitants than any country on earth. This is
very impressive; also very expensive.
Ont
transportation plant is apparently about twice
as large as it ought to be. But it will be
needed one of these days, so we cannot profitably scrap any considerable part of it.
'lhe ('onsequences of Rate Control
Canada aow enjnys the lowest freighit rates
in the world's transportation history. Europeans look upon this creditable achieveinent
with envy and admiration. But aur gengraphical handicaps tender sucli a high standard
of efficiency ahsolutely imperative. The Canadian public is in intimate business partnership
with ail its railway systems, whether corporately or publicly owned. The impartial hand of
control tests
rigid effectively. But this upon them alI, equally
and public
safeguard against excessive rates naturally creates certain nnavoidable remponsihilities. In point of fact, Canada
must either provide a sufficient volume of
traiffc to yield ber railways a satisfactory net
return on capital invested. or submit ta inrreaseci rates. That seemsi to be the inevitable
choice andi logical consequence of rate controI.
So we cannot apparently afford to regard
our transportation problern -itb
nconcera.
Until sncb time as iacreased population more
nearly balances our railway facilities, we must
pay for the present uneconnmic situation eitber
through taxation or tbrough increased carrying
charges.
I think those few paragraphs very nice~ly
sum up our railway situation and the problems
of to-day. I hope rny honourable frienci the
leader of the Government wiIl keep in mind
the thought, suggestedj, that it would be
desirable to stabilize this situation by ending
the uneertainty that has prevailed for the last
five years with reference to railway rates;
that if this can ha done and an indication
given to the people that the Government
bas adopted -a policy and will carry it out,
conditions will settle down and automatically
adjust themselves by means of conferences

213

MARCH 29, 1927
between the railways and the employees concerning their difficulties and this shadow that
has constantly hovered over the whole railway situation for the last five years, owing
to, conditions which I need not repeat now,
but which we ai know, will pasa away. I
sincerely hope that my honourable friend will
feel that in bringing this motter to -the attention of Parliament my sole purpose was ta
do what seemed ta be the proper thing in
the interest of the people and the country
at large.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIFiN: Will the honourable gentleman allow me a questionHon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Surely.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: --ýwhich, no doubt,
the honourable leader on this side of the
House <Hon. W. B. Ross) would have put ta
him? I understand that the honourable leader
on this side complained that it was asolutely
impossible ta ascertain in any publication,
statistical or otherwise, exactly what -the railway men were earning. I understand the
honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) answered the honourable
Ieader's cornplaint by placing on Hansard the
document whi-ch I have in hand. N'ow, I
would ask the honourable gentleman, flrst,

whether this la not the precise document ta
which I referred, and of which I cornplained
as giving not -the rate of wage per day, but
simply an amount, with an marginal note
stating that so many miles or eo, many hours
would constitute a day. I will give an
example: "Conductors, passenger, $4.47 per
day." Marginal note: "Basis of 20 miles per
hour, 150 miles per day." Here is another
reference: "Conductors, freight, 86.16 a day."
Marginal note: "Batsis of 12J miles per hour,
8 houTs per day."
The honourable leader on this aide of the
House asked whether there was any document
that would enable ordin'ary persons like aurselves ta ascertain, not the formula for the
purpose of calculation, but the exact amount
that a man earned in a day or a year, as
suchi information can be dbtained respecting,
for instance, civil service enlployees. That is
my first question. Is there suth a source of
information?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Although I thiùk
the figures already given are complete, I will
gladly place on the record. in answer ta my
honourable f riend's question., an extract from
page 27 of the Report -made ta Parlia.ment

ate yesterday, but I learn on reading the
Debates that inquiries were made as to -the
reason which actuated the Committee in passing the Bill. I have not before me the affidavit, but there was an affidavit given by the
promoters of the Bill, which satisfied the Committee that the patent should be extended for
a reasonable period.
The Committee, however, amended the Bill
by substituting for section 2 this clause:
2. If between the date on which each patent
designated in the preamble to this Act expired
and the seventh day of November, 1926, any
person commenced in Canada to construct,
manufacture, use or sell any invention covered
by that patent, that person may continue to
construct, manufacture, use or sell that invention in as full and ample a manner as if this
Act had not been passed: Provided that this
section shall not apply to any person who may
have so used any such invention with the authorization of the patentee.
I understand that the honourable member
from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) will move
that the words, "or bis assigns" be added, and
I would have no objection to that amendment.
Hon. .Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, the words I wish to add, "or his
assigns", are merely for the purpose of covering this case. The patentee may in the meantime have assigned his rights under an agreement. I want to cover the assigns as well as
the patentee himself. I therefore move that
the words "or his assigns" be added after the
word "patentee' in section 2 of the Bill as
amended.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I hope I shall not be taken as opposing this
Bill, but my attention was called some days
ago to the fact that 'it was the renewal of a
patent that had been dead for about five
years, and I thought there ought to be some
explanation given. I understand an explanation has been given which has satisfied the
Committee.
Hon. MT. BELCOURT: The party gave me
bis memorandum on it; I called the attention
of the Committee tio the memorandum, and
the party was there and was heard.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: And the Committee
are unanimous in recommending the passage
of the Bill. For that reason I have nothing
more to say in the way of objections.

DIVORCE BILL (ONTARIO)
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY moved the
second reading of Bill B6, an Act to provide
in the Province of Ontario for the dissolution
and the annulment of marriage.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, let me
first read a memorandum of the present state
of applications for divorce at this Session. I
think there will be a moral that can be
drawn readily afterwards, which I hope will
induce support to the Bil. that I am proposing to introduce. The notices in the
Canada Gazette for this year cover 226 applications for divorce. The petitions already
presented number 198; of which 111 have been
heard and recommended; 4 heard and rejected; 10 partially heard; and 83 pending
hearing. There are now 30 cases set down
for hearing, which will be reached, the hearings
extending till the 8th of next month. That
will leave about 50 cases undisposed of. The
Clerk informs me that it will be practically
impossible, in the ordinary course, that we
should set any cases down for bearing after
the 8th of April, assuming that Parliament
will prorogue at the time now anticipated.
The net result of that is that about 50 cases
will of necessity have to go over until next
Session. Parliament is responsible to some
extent for that, because we have provided no
other forum to which the people of Ontario
and those who desire divorce in the Province
of Quebec can go.
The petitioner in a case does not know in
advance
when Parliament is going to
assemble; much less does he know when it is
going to prorogue. The petitions which will
not be dealt with could not be taken up until
much later in April or May, on account of
the publication required. so it would not be
possible for us 'to entertain them at the
present moment. There is thus the practical
difficulty, that petitioners for divorce cannot
know when Parliament will assemble or
prorogue, or whether they may not be met by
such unusual conditions as existed last year.
I hope to deal with the matter not too
lengthily, and perhaps furnish some information ta those who have not given as much
attention to divorce matters as I have. Though
it may not be a distinction to boast of, I
know that, as Chairman of the Committee,
I have sat on vast|ly more divorce cases, than
any honourable gentleman who has preceded
me in that capacity, although the position of
Chairman has been occupied by very distinguished predecessors, among them the
eminent jurist who now leads this side of the
House, (Hon. W. B. Ross).

MARCH 30, 1927
Parliament lias flot seen fit to pass a Divorce
Bili. An attempt was made in the House of
Commons, in 1875 by Mr. DeCosmos, but it
was not pursued very far, and it ended in
nothinc. In 1879 MeskTrs. Jones and Davis,
from the Maritimes, attempted ta make some
progress in the matter, but their efforts did
flot resuit in a Bill or in anything being done.
Mrý Nickle introduced a Bill in the Gommons,but it f el by the wayside before action.
The first concrete action on the part of
Parliament was that taken on proposed legislation introdueed by my di8tinguished leader
on this side (Hon. W. B. Roes). That was
in the f orma of two Bis introduced in 1920,
known as Bill I and B;11 J. Bill I was similar
to the Bill with which this House is 110W
asked to deal, but wi.th one exception, as 1
pointed out on the first reading of the Bill,
namely, that it is to apply only ta the Province of Ontario. It deals onily with the forum
that shall hear a divorce application, dn this
case an Ontario 'court. Bill J, which in 1920,
was introduced in this Bouse and passed by
a large majarity, dealt with the law of divorce
in very important particulars. These Bis
went to the other Bouse, but as they were
private Bis they had the misfortune of losing
their place on the Order Paper, and neyer got
on it again, a.nd nothing further was done in
the matter.
Now, may I deal in a retroepection just
for a moment? We are dealing with divorce,
the British North America Act having given
this Parliament jurisdiction in matters of
marriage and divorce. In the early years of
Parliament there were practically no divorce
applications at all. Later on I sh-ah submit
to the Blouse a list of applications deait with
in the various years. When divorce Bills were
first introduced in this Bouse they were
treated like any other private Bihls. The
publication went to our Committes on Standing Orders, aind the proof of service of the
documents on the respondent was made at
the Bar of the Bouse. Then an appropriate
Committes was mtruck-not the Standing
Committee on Divorce, which did not exist at
that time-and the honourable gentleman who?
movcd the Bill in the Bouse moved it as bis
own Bill, and it was referred to that Committee. Reports ooming ànto the Bouse from
that Gommitteea occupied a very considerable
amount of attention at that time, and caused
a very great deal of discussion. The continuance of sucli a course became obviously impossible, and it was ne0essary to create, as
we did in 1888, standing rules on divorce, and
we systematized the procedure which is ini
force to-day, with certain modifications and
changes.

217

Now, I want ta deal with the various Prov'inces of Canada in the very brief est way, and
it will lie seen that they did not stand on the
same basis.
Nova Scotia had the Act of 1866, 29 Victoria,
chapter 13, whîch established the Divorce
Court, and the grounds on which. divorce was
granted at that time in that court were consanguinity, aduhtery, cruelty and impotence,
and in application for divorce the status of
bath sexes was on an equality: that is, the
woman had an equal right with the man.
Prince Edward Island had a Divorce Court,
with procedure ta deal with divorce, prior
It was established by
ta Confederation.
5 William IV, chapter 10, 183, giving power
to the Lieutenant Governor and five mem-bers
of the Council to grant divorce on grounds of
consanguinity, aduhtery, or impotence. One
*divorce was granted in 183, and another in
1913, according ta the data that bas been
given to me.
New Brunswick had a Divorce Court prior.
ta Coniederation, by 31 George III, chapter
5, and the grounds of divorce were consanguinity, adultery and impotence.
I have thus deaht with the Maritimes, in
each of which the wif e and husband, as I
verily believe, stood with virtually the same
riglits in apphying for divorce, and on the
same grounds. These are ail before Confederation.
Then we come ta Manitoba, Saskatchewan
and Alberta. None of those provinces, until
a very recent time, had the riglit of granting
divorce. I pra.cticed in Saskatchewan for a
longer time than I wish ta say, but I was of
the opinion, as I must frankiy say every
other iawyer consuhted in those matters was,
that we had no riglit ta grant divorce. However, a client more daring than others, and
wilhing to take chances, brought the matter
ta court, and in Manitoba in 1917 there was
the case of Waiker vs. Walker, which went
to aur Supreme Court and then ta the Privy
Council, which held that under ans of the
Northwest Territories Acts the Province of
Manitoba did possess the right to deal with
divorce. Chapter 25 of the Northwest Territories Act of 1886 vested in Manitoba the
same riglit ta deal with divorce as was
possessed in Engiand on the lSth day of July,
1870.
Almost .concurrently a case went also from
the Prý,vince of Alberta-Broad va. Broad.
It algo went ta the Privy Council. The
Province o! Alberta had not been granting
divorces up ta that timae, thinking that it
had not jurisdiction, but in that case it was

going to tire the House ýby reading
the sections of the Act.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Might I ask my
honourable friend to read that and the previons enactment? I cannot understand how
the Western Provinces became vested with
the power to deal with divorce.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Here is the Act
of Manitoba, chapter 25 of 1886:
Snbject to the provisions of the next fo]lowing section the laws of England relating to
matters within the jurisdiction of the Parliament of Canada, as the same existed on the
fifteenth (lay of Jnly, one thousand eigbt bundred anti seventy, were from the said day and
are in force iii the Province of Manitoba, in so
far as the same are applicable to the said Province andI in so f ar as the same have flot been
or are not hereafter repealed, altered, varied,
modified or affected by any Act of the Parlia-ment of the United Kingdom applicable to the
saiti Province, or of the Parliallent of Canada.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is an Imperial
Act.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No. it is a
Domninion enuctment, and it declared that the
law as applicable in England to divorce was
likewise applicable to the Province of Manitoba.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Was that previous
to the creation of the Provinces?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHIBY: No; these Acts
of 1886 and 1888 are of course since Confederation.
Hon. Mr. BFELCOURT:
But they were
previnus to the Provinces being ereated as
Provinces?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Oh, yes, they
were Northwest Territories at that time. So
that we now have in each of the prairie Provinces a law of divorce, and courts empowered
to make procedure, which t'hey have done, and
te administer divorce law; but until we passed
the Act of 1925 in the Parliament of Canada,
placing wife and husband on an equality as
te to the ground for a divorce, namedy, adultery, there was a disparity hetween the rights
in those prairie Provinces and the rights in
the rest ofCanada. Until the dýecisions of the
Privy Council which announced that .we had
the Legislative power in Saskatchewan, Alberta
and Manitoba Supreme Courts, we had no
court at adi.
Then we got the courts with
the limited power that existed in England on
the 15th nf July, 1870. That is, it was only
the husband who at that time in England eould

get a divorce on the ground of adultery. That
law was changed in virtue of our legislation nf
1925, whereby the womnan was put on a parity
of righýts with the huniband, so that now ail
over Canada Vihe equality of the sexes before
the law is the saune.
Now, we have practically not legislated at
ail on the subject of divorce. We deait with
matters relating to divorce on four occasions,
but oniy once, so far as 1 can trace, was there
any legislation that could be treated as
peculiarly pertinent to divorce. We dealt with
the cases of the deceased wife's sister and the
brother of the deceased hushand, because they
offended otherwise within the degrees of consanguinity, -and came under divorce law. We
did something else, which did not relate to the
right of divorce, but related to the proceedings
of our Coinmittee; we had the Criminal Code
amended for the purpose of proihibiting the
publication, without the consent of the Committee or Parliament, of information pertinent
to divorce cases pending before the Committee.
That legislation passed unanimonsly in this
Honse in cornsequence of very sensational
reports thýat were made in a rather important
case from Mont/real. We are one of the first
British countries to pass sncb iegislation. In
England they attempted that when they
brought in thse draft Code first; I will deal
with that a little later. The Comumittee that
made the report on which the Divorce Act nf
England was passed had made recommendatione, in the first place, in reference Vo tise
restriction and limiting of the right of publication of its proceedings, that recommendation,
however, was neyer acted upon, sn that in
Enýgland, as you nil know, very sensational
accounts of current divorce proceedings frequently appeared in the press. We tisought,
rightly or wrongly-I think rightly-that a
very strict limitation in that regard sisould
be imposed.
We believed tliat tise public,
wîth the exception of certain seandal-loving
people that we are not catering to, were not
interested, and as a resuit no news at ail
appears in the press in connection with the
proceedings that take place before our Divorce
Committee.
You will be inteirested, honourable gentlemen, in knowing what grounds for divorce
existed undeýr the Englisis law as it was in 1870,
which is the law that we are going to ask you
to give to the Province of Ontario, except as
it has since been modifled. Prior to 1870 the
grounds for divorce in Great Br-itain were:

adultery wvould have entitled her te, a divorce

MARCH 30, 1927
-a mensa et thoro, adultery couffled with
desertion, without -reasona-ble excuse, for two
ycars or upwards.
The English law anticipated us by a very
short time in putting rnen and women on an
equality so faxr as divorce is concerned.
Then, in England there were absolute defences
to a divorce action. They were: (1) disproof
of the facts alleged in the petition; (2) connivance by the petitioner at the -commission of
adulterýy; (3) condonation; (4) collusion.
Those defences are aIl recognized in our rudes,
and every petitioner for divorce must prove
first, the fact of adultery; and then that there
bas been no connivance, condonation or collusion. Doubt-less the samne requirements will
exist in the court in ýOntario, if it should 'be
established.
In England there were also certain defences
under the Act which were left to the discretion
of the court. They were: (1) the adultery of
the petitioner; (2) unTeasonable delay in presenting or prosecuting the petition; (3) cruelty
Vo the other party to the marriage; (4) Viilfui
desertion, or separation without reasoilable
cause or excuse by the other party before the
adultery complained of was committed; (5)
wilful negleet or rnisconduct, such as to have
conduced to the adultery complained of. Al
those discretionary grounds are availed of by
us in the Cornmittee in dealing with tlhe
petitions that corne before us, and they will
pass into the law if this court is established
for the Province of Ontario..
By Section 92 of the British North Arnerica
Act, as honourable gentlernen will remernber,
the soînînnization of marriages cornes under
the jurisdiction of the Provincial Legisiatures;
and under Section 91 the question of rnarriage and divorce cornes within -our powers
Vnder Section 129 the courts that were then

in the Provinces prior Vo Confederation, and

legislation, were retained by the Provinces.

gentlemen, in sorne figures which I have before me. I arn going to aak permission to
*put sorne of thern on record without reading

are increasing in an almost geometrical ratio.
The total number of divorces granted by

granted to husbands, and 576 to wives.

Canadians?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is from

in 1922, 462 were granted by the courts of

Se far as I have been able te trace the
records, with one exception, the Campbell case
cf 1876, this Parliament, bas given no relief
other than that cf divorce-the absolute
separatien cf the two, parties. In that case,
which was a very peculiar and most interesting cce, the hus5band applied for divorce,
and the wife counter-petitioned. The divorce
wvas not granted te the husband, and under
the decee the wife was allowed alimony and
the custody cf the children. The right of this
Parliament te give alimony was questiened
by Chief Justice Wilson, of Ontarie, shortly
afterwards, which. raises a very nice question
cf what -other relief than the actuel divorce
can be granted. To some it might seem that
we have the right cf granting alimony, but
others take an opposgite view; and these upon
whom the duty cf dealing with divorce bas
been cast have made ne atternpt te trench
upen what might be regarded by semne people
as property and civil rights. Alimony can
be granted in the Provinces by the courts;
they bave machinery for dealing with the
custody cf the ýchildren and property rights.
One cf the very important benefits cf
giving the Province cf Ontario the right cf
granting divorces would be that thec court
could administer aIl the rights arid remedies
at the samne time in the one action. The
court could dm1i with alimony, which wc
bave refused te do, and witb the custody of
the children and property rights. The very
moment that we attempt te deal with
certain things, beyond aIl deubt our rights te
do so will be questiened, as it bas hemn

questioned heretofore.

Hon. Mr. BBLCOURT: May I ask if the

alimony by the Parliament of Canada? Has
that question ever come before the courts?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I do not know
that it ever came specifically before the courts,
but as I say, Chief Justice Wilson at one

time made an adverse comment-I speak from
recollection-as to the power of Parliament to
grant alimony.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The question is
not settled so far as Ontario is concerned.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I would not say
it is settled. We have never given alimony,
save as above, so it could be only hypothetically dealt mith. There mould be no
object in the court pronouncing upon it.
In England, in 1909, a Royal Commission
on Divorce was appointed, and in 1912 they
made a most elaborate report. Sir Gorrell
Barnes was at the head of the Commission,
which represented every class of society, and
included in its membership the Archbishop of
York.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
mentary report?

Is that a Parlia-

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It was a Royal
Commission created by Parliament, and certain people were named to make a report.
The report came before Parliament. It has
never been acted upon to the full. It contained many recommendations, including one
that the two sexes should be put on an equal
footing. As a matter of fact, that principle
had been recommended in 1850. The report
of the Commission, which was a majority report, recommended certain additional grounds
for divorce: desertion for three years and upwards; cruelty; incurable insanity; habitual
drunkenness, found incurable after two years
from first order of confinement; imprisonment
under commuted death sentence. The minority concurred with the majority as to certain
grounds; unsound mind; epilepsy and recurrent insanity; venereal disease; when woman
pregnant at time of marriage to a man, other
than husband, ignorant of the fact; wilful refusal to consummate marriage.
If this Bill should be passed by this House,
Ontario will have the law of Engeland as it
existed on the 15th day of July, 1870.
This is
the law which now prevails in the Provinces of
Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Al'berta.
Ali
the other Provinces of Canada that had
divorce courts before will still continue under
their present law, modified by any law that we
may pass relating to divorce.
Parliament will
still have to deal with cases from the Province
of Quebec, to which the Bill is not intended
te apply.

'Estixnated.

With ail the force that I comnmand I invite
your co-operation in the discussion and the
passage af this Bill. In 1920 you were good
enough to pass a similar Bill introduced bY
my honourable leader, by 37 ta 7, and you
passed the contentiaus Bill by a large
majority. The necesaity of new legisîstion in
this matter has grown. enormously since that
time, a.nd it is my opinion that if the number
af divorces keep an increasing at the present
rate we shall 'h wholly unable in the course of
three or four years mare ta, deal with them
in this Parliament. In any Session of Parliament hereafter we are liable ta meet with the
same condition as ie ccurring in this one,

namely, that a number of cases must, beyand
peradventure, go over ta another Session.
There will ba fifty lef t over this year, and a
similar situation na.y occur at any time. If
the Government were defeated during the
progreas of the Session, a;hl the divorce applications would go by the board. Nobody
knows for certain at what ti-me Parliament will
convene or at what time it will prarogue. It
js flot in keeping with the dignity of the
highest Legislature ini the land that we shauld
be doing work that could be doue better
somewhere aise. We have here vastly mare
important wark to which ta devote aur attention than the question of divorce. I therefore
bespeak the most favourable consideration af
this Bill by the Senate.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I would like ta say a few words in favour of
this propoeal, chiefly because I amn entirely
in synpathy with it an its merits, and secondly
because on a former occasion I had the hanour
of moving in this House for the adoption of
a sirnilar Bill.

Without going over the ground which My
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) has
covered s0 well, I desire to refer to juat two
points. The first is that this Bill does not
enlarge the law of divorce. It is absolutely
essential for the 'honourable members of this
House to understand that fact. We are not
giving any miore reasons for divorce bhan
exist at the present time. The fear on the
part of t.he publie that the means of divorce
are being enlarged and divorce is being made
casier under this law is not justified. This
Bill will flot 'provide a single ground that
does flot exist to-day.
But there is another aspect of the matter
which ja very important, and its importance
is understood only by those who have been
interested in the heaaing of divorces. In this
Parliament, when a petition for divorce je
heard and granted, the matter is ended. In
the English Court that is flot so: ail that ie
donc is to grant what is called a decree nisi;
that is ta say, a divorce on the condition
that notbing happens within six months ta
show that there should not be a divorce.
ln my own experience in this House I have
known of a case in which, if thcre had been
any machinery for a decree nisi, the divorce
granted hy the Parliament of Canada would
neyer have been approved. It is a curiaus
thing that a great many people are inclined

to hold their tangues when a trial is in prograse, but after the trial is over they begin
to talk. That is flot liar ta divorce cases,
pecu
but applies also ta cases of other kinds. Now,
if the Supreme Court of Canadia is given
power ta hear divorce cases, I arn sati8fied
that there will be cases in which, though a
decree nisi may be granted i the first instance, the divorce will be stopped inithe
long run. This, ta my mind, is the great

224

SENATE

gain you wvill derive from transferring the
jurisdiction from Parliament to the Supreme
Court of Ontario.
There is one othcr ground, but it is flot
so important, though it has some merits, and
that is that the machinery of the Supreme
Court is more flexible than that of Parliament.
It provides for the examining of
witnesses under commission, or outside of
the jurisdiction. Ail that sort of procedure
is very mucli more simplified in the Supreme
Court. of any of the provinces than in a
Committee of Parliament.
There is just one other word that 1 wisbi
to say about this matter. I -hope that honourable gentlemen, if they are interested in it,
will look back to what I had to say with
regard to the Province of Quebec when I
introduced a similar Bill some years ago. I
saw at, once, upon looking into the subjeet,
that the Province of Quebec had to be left
out. That Province bias a judicature that is
founded upon the old Roman law and is
comprised in wbat is ealled the Code Civil.
It is really a system of jurisprudence that
bas been worked ont by mankind for perhaps
nearly 2.000 years.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is of much more
recent oi-igin.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: There is provision for a
fainily counceil, for instance. It is a Nvonderfui systemr.
I was counting up the sections in
the Civil Code of the Province of Quebec,
and I think there are about 253 that you
would have to tear ail te pieces if you were
going to intro(luce a Divorce Bill for that
Province. The jurisprudence of Quebec bias
heen. as I say, founided upon the old Roman
juri,ýprud,nce, modîfied of course by Christiani [y. Then we have in England the Common
Law system, an equitable system whieh borrows more or less from the same source as
the systein in the Province -of Quebec. I refer
to this because I think it is important to
IIn(lr..tatid that thiýs Parliament is not in any
way trying to interfere witb the Province of'
Quebec on this question of divorce. We aie
s mply putting Ontario on the samne footing
withi Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, British
Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchcwan .
Hon. F. L. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, the honouralale member from Moose
Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) bias given very
interesting figures, and for my part I would
suggest that hie try to supplement them by
gîving ýals-o tbe figures for the iast five or ten
years-I w.ouid prefer to have t'.1e figures for
ton years-of the divorces granted by each
Province.
Hon. W.

B. ROSS.

Hlon. Mr. MILLOIjGHBY: Those figures
are in the tables and will be printed.
Hon. Mr. B3EIQUE: I did nlot understand
that. Now, under the miles and doctrine of the
Chur-cb to whieh I belong, I am nlot permitted
to vote for a Bill of Divorce of any kind, and
I have no intention of violating any mile of
ml-Y Church; but I must say that if it were
no t the rote of my Church 1 would gladly
support the Bill. I think that for several
roasons that have been mentioned by honourable gentlemen, it woold be an improvement, and there is this additional reason, that
divorce -in this country, as in other counitries.
will becoîne, I fear, a menace to society, and
if the matter is left te the courts of each
Province tbey will bie more ameniabie to the
leading nmen in the Province, who will consîder w'boc modification should be made and
%,vhether the miles s-hould not be more strict
than they are. I thinik that if divorce courts
must exist it is much better that they sbould
be the orditnary courts in each Province rather
than thjs Parliament.
Hon. G. H. BARNARD: Honourable gentlemen, as a memher of what I think may
now fairly be called the hardest worked Comnmittee of this House, I wish to say a few
words in support of the motion before us.
The honourable gentleman f rom Moose Jaw
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) bias deait, with the
question sýo f ully that there is really very
little necessity to discuss the matter at length.
Like the bonourabie gentleman, I appreciate
thýat there is a large section of the country
opposed on principle to divorce. That view I
respect. At the samne time I would ask those
wbo hiold that view to consider for a moment
this point. The Bill is not creatiîîg any new
right; it is merely a transference of jurisdictien frora this Parliamient to the courts of
the Province of Ontario, the Province from
which the great majority of cases eome. It
is perfectly fair to say that owing to the
practice thot in the course of years bas grown
up in this Parliament, of granting divorces,
it is regarded by the general publ-ic as being
the law of the land that any petitioner who
comes before the Se'nate, or bc-fore the Divorce
Committee, and proves a certain state of facts,
shahl as a natural consequence obtain a decrc
of divorce. I think that is not overstating
the matter; and, if it. is a fair statement, I say
it is obvious that ail that is being done is
mereiy the transference of jurisdiction, and
nothing more.
Many good reasons, which I do not wish
to labour, were given by my honourabie friend
in support of titis Bill, and in favour of the
idea that the Provincial courts would be able

MARCH 30, 1927
to deal with questions of this kind far more
satisfactorily than any Comrnittee of Parliament or Huse of Parliarnent.
In the first place, there is the cumbersome
procedure, and the expense to litigants. Time
after time we have had applications before
the Divorce Cornrittee for a refund of fees
in the five or six years when I have served
upon the Cornrittee. Invariably we inquire,
in those cases, into the financial circurnstances
of the petitioner, and also, as to how much
money bas been paid for legal expenses. In
many cases we have found that surns largely
out of proportion to the professional services
rendered- have been exacted frorn litigants.
We are powerless to tax costs, and there is
no supervising officer to do that in divorce
litigation, so the parties are left ahsolutely
ini the hande of thei.r profesional advisers.
Another reason of importance for this Bill,
which I think was flot rnentioned, is that tirne
and time again the sarne divorce case has
corne up on practically the sarne set of facts,
with possihly sorne new evidence. That- isto, say, a petitioner cornes in with the case
irnpqroper1y prepared; he doe n-ot call ail the
witnesses that might have been brought; the
case is dismissed, the petition refused, and
at the next Session of Parliarnent the sarne
case cornes again on precisely the saine state
of facts, the only dýifference being that the
petitioner may have an additional witness,
but the charges and incidents are the sane,
and the question is only one of proof. There
was one notorious case that carne up three
times, and I think I arn right in stating that
in a case last Session it was only on the third
application that the divorce was granted. Now,
that state of aiffairs could not obtain in a
court, where an action, once tried, would be
dismissed, and until there were new grounds
for divorce a second application would not
be entertaîned.
Another matter that ought to be considered
with reference to this question is the significance of the figures which were given by
the honourable gentleman fromn Moose Jaw
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby), showing the number
of Canadian applications for divorce which
are rnade and granted in the United States.
It is a weil settled iaw, if I arn not mistaken,
that any person going from Canada to the
UJnited States without the intention of changing domicile, but merely for the purpose of
obtaining a divorce, is guilty of bigarny upon
retu.rning to Canada and marrying again. Not
only that, but any children of that second
bigamous marriage would be illegitîrnate, and
have no civil rights. Surely that is an undesirable state of affairs. If this jurisdiction
RmZI5SD

225

to deal with divorce cases were transferred
to the courts I venture to say there would
be fewer cases of Canadians going to the
United States to get divorces.
I arn heartily in support od this Bill. I
consider that it is almost -grotesque to see the
Senators, the wise men of Canada, sitting here
day after day and hour after hour, going
through purely formai motions such as second
readings and third readings of Bills and reports, and sending them down to the bouse of
Comrnons, where they are neyer even looked
at. For these reasons I intend to vote for
the Bill.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Is there any record
of those persons who go to the United States
and get divorces, and corne badk and live here
under bigarnua reýlationshipa?
Are there
a.ny statisties as to the numiber of such personis?
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: The ho-nourable
gentleman who introduced the Bill gave the
figures of those 'Who go over; 1 do not know
whether hie bas the figures of those who corne
baok,ý but I think many of us can recail
numnbers of cases of such peope-and those
people flot in any particularly humble walk of
life, either.
1 know of several sucli cases
myseif.
Right Hon. GEORGE P. GRAHAM: Hrrnourable gentlemen, I would not care to give
a sUent vote -on this question, for I arn
absolutely opposed to divorce. To my mind
rnarriage is more th-an a civil contract, consequcntly I do flot thiink any civil authority
has a right to sepairate men and women who
have been properly and, legally rnarried.
I

MOTION FOR SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. ]IA"NUIAND moved the second
reading of Bill 139, an Act to amend the
Judges Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen., there are
Vhree Bis which relate to the saine subject,
which are on the Order Paper; Bill 139, the
one that has just been cahie.d; Bill 140, which
relates to an arnendment to the Exichequer
Court Act, and Bi-l 141, an Act to arnend the
Supreuie Court Act. I intend to explain these
three Bills at one and the same time. 0f
course they will have to -be taken, Up
separately.
The purpoee of this Bill is two4old. Bill
139 allows of the enlarging of the Supreme
Court fromn six Vo seven judges. From the
day of foundation of this court in 1874 we
have had a Chief Justice and five Puisne
judges. We now suggest that there be *a
Chief Justice and six Puisne judges insted of
five.:
The other enactment is the -limitation of the
age of the judges, and their retirernent when
they reach 75 years. IV applies to the present
judges as wel1 as ta those who shail be
appointed in future. Hoftourable gentlemen
realize that the highoet tribunal in the
country muet be maintained in the best state
of efficiency. Sinice 1874 the business hms
increased considerably in volume and in
importance, and it goes on increasing from
year ta year.
Although geographical conditions have noV
been constantly adherod to in the appointment
of judges, there has been a general tradition
ta appoint one judge from the MaritimTe Provinces, two fromn the Province of Quebec, two
fromn Ontario, and one from Brtish Columnbia.
The younger Provinces, on the Prairies, have
not been given a Judge, s0 iar as I remember,
upon that be'neh; a.nd that is quite explainable
when one remembers that although Manitoba
came into Coafed!eration i-nVa 1870, Alberta
and Saskatchewan were oonstituted as seiparate
Provinces only in 1905.
When I say that geography has not played
a role by law, but simply by tradition, 1
should make an exception in the case of
Québec, which, under the statute creating Vhe
court, was given two Judges. nhe reason for

that was that the systemn of law of that, Province was so totally different from that of
the other Provinces that it was deemed
judicious ta déclare that it should have two
Judges upon the Supreme Court benoh.
lt stands ta reason, if we have given a
Judge ta the Maritime Provinces, two Vo the
Province of Québec, two ta the Province of
Ontaria, and, one ta the Province of British
Columbia, that the new position upon the
Supreme Court bencli shouid allow for the
appointment of a representative of the Prairie
Provinces.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If I arn noV mistaken,
at anc time there were six Judges.
Hon. Mr. DANDTYRAND: T-here have
always*been six Juilges: one Chief Justice, and
five puisne Judges. Now it is suggested that
onie more Judge should be açppointed, which
would make seven.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: The Bill says six.
Hon. , Mr. DANDURAND:
Six puisne
Judges, and one Chief Justice.
It is realized that it is somewhat difficuit
ta secure the vittendance of five Judges out of
the six at the sittings of that court. Recause
of illness, or other reasons, which are somewhat
numerous, of late years there has hardly been
a session of the court when another Judge
has flot had ta lie appointed. This is rather
unsatisfactory. The situation causes considerable delay in the hearing of the cases,
and lawyers from afar who corne ta Ottawa

also been pointed out that when a litigant
takes the trouble ta corne to the Supreme
Court of Canada in order 'ta obtain a fin-al
judgment, hie is entitled ta have the Supreme
Court properly constituted of Supreme Court

of a second Power, it was the duty of the
officials of that chancellery to make a rebuttal as strong and as well supported as
possible, again without any influence from the
intermingling of the human element or of
the opinions or thought or conditions of the
Power with which communication was being
carried on. In brief, you had two stands
taken, concentrated, consolidated and buttressed. They were known not onIy to the
high officiais of each Power, but to a very
large number of prominent .men in each
country, and maybe, to a certain extent, to
the public itself; so that it became a position
advanced and fortified by each nation, and
therefore very difficult of modification or
compromise.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: A point d'honneur.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Oui. In a word, the conclusions preceded
the conference. So if the pourparlers eventuated either one way or the other, the officials
of each side met each other with a predetermined disposition to uphold the honour of
their own country and to make no concessions. Now, if I have made that clear, that
was one of the principal methods by which
international commuuications were carried
on and international affairs administered.
In the second place, there was what is called
the balance of power. Take Europe, for
instance. The aim was to keep peace in
Europe; or if peace could not be kept, to
initiate an impulse which should be carried
on when war took place. That was done
by what was called the balance of power.
That is, certain great Powers in Europe, by
intrigue and by secret correspondence and
secret agreements. came to a certain conclusion with regard to another group of
Powers, and said: "We must watch those
Powers. We do not know what they are doing,
but we are convinced that they are not colloguing together in our interest. Let us draw
our lines close together and be prepared to
meet them at any point, whatever may result."
Now note, that those Great Powers, before
the war, numbered probably some six, or
seven at most, but in the world at large there
were some sixty different Powers. The balance
of power therefore, was a piece of machinery
which was operated by at most seven great
Powers, and the small nations of the world
were absolutely shut out from any part in the
councils of the great powers, and in a word,
were simply the pawns. Whatever may have
resulted, or whatever might result from the
divers interests of those two groups of Powers,
the smaller nations were at their mercy. Their
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

interests might be vitally affected in some
way, but they themselves had no part or lot
in the matter of the predisposition of the case.
That was a distinguishing feature of the prewar relations between the different nations.
One thing that occurred amongst the great
Powers was, first, suspicion. Then jealousies
arose from these suspicions, and the warlike
spirit which led to the adaptation of groups
of nations to assist and support each other.
In that again the smaller Powers had nothing
whatever to say; therefore there was government by an autocracy composed of the
majority of the seven great nations, and in
such government there was no democratic
co-operation with, or no part or lot taken
by, the mass of the Powers of the world which
were smaller in area and lesser in power.
Before the war, under that system, there
was no international forum, and no constituted international executive which was
operative and efficient, and whieh could summon a conference of the nations on short
notice with any assurance that the conference
would take place. We all remember the statement which was made by the then Secretary
for Foreign Affairs of Great Britain, and which
has been repeated over and over again. O'ddly
enough, and the fact is singularly striking,
that statement was uttered again almost as a
complete echo by Mr. Streseman at the
Assembly of 1926. The British Minister of
Foreign Affairs said that if we had had a
League of Nations, with its maehinery and its
executive and the powers possessed by that
executive the probabilities are that we would
have had no great world war in 1914. Years
afterward Mr. Stresemann made exactly the
same statement that, after having reviewed,
and become a part of the machinery of the
League of Nations, and after having seen its
work to a certain extent, he was of the
opinion that if there had been machinery like
that for international business in 1914 the war
might easily have been averted. These, then,
are the main characteristics or features of the
system before the formation of the League
of Nations.
Now, let us take the system as it is at
present, after the League of Nations bas been
in operation for seven years. It is surely not
too much to say that a great modification has
taken place in the method of conducting
international affairs; and perhaps it is not
too much to say that a new system has
practically superseded the old system. What
are the contrasts? The men who represent
the great nations to-day, before asserting their
positions and laying down their claims, and
buttressing and fortifying them by arguments

and precedents, meet together, man to man,
and take inta consideration their own difficulties and the difficulties between themselves
and their neighhours, and they examine andi
discuss them andi leain haw their intereste are
intertwined; and afte? that thorough examinatien, in which there is the human element of
man facing man, and man's mind countering
man's mnd, they corne ta certain -conclusions,
which follow the conference instead of .preceding it. That is the great difference between
the twa methods, and anyone can see in a
moment what an essentially vital change it
is in the manner and znethod af conducting
international affairs.
Then, again, under the present, system, of
the 63 states or powers in the world, it is no
longer a question of management and control
and absolute direction by 7 or 5 great powers,
but 56 powers have this advantage af mutual
conference and conversation with one other.
They meet together; the whole system. is, as
it were, democratiied, and the influence of
each has a chance ta exert itself. Sometimes
it is said: 'Well, that does not amount ta
mucb; what influence, for instance, wouid
Holland or a South American state have in
the disposition of affairs when the greatpowers
are stili" the great powers?" But from my
own personal observation and experience I
have a ready answer ta that question, or
critical statement. Over and over I have seen
a smaill power, taking a correct position which
was defended by a man ai strength, ability
and character, which exerted as much influence
in the Council and Assembly of the League
as would one cd the great powers. It is altogether wrong for us ta condlude that thle
small pawers, because they haive not big armies
and navies, have therel are very little influence
in this forum af the nations wbidh meets from
time ta time at Geneva.
The great advantage we have gained is that
we n'ow have a world forum where an Executive of 14, coming from 56 naitions, meets six
times a year and each time, spends together
about :a week, making at least 30 or more
days in which those 14 men, the choice spokesmen oi the great powers, and the representatives cd the wbole 56 nations, meet face ta
face in conference and conversation, hour by
hour and day by day for 30 days of the year.
Besides that, you have 160 of the leading men
of .56 nations of the world vha sneet tagether
once eaeh year, and spend on an average 30
days together in this same cotiperative andi
mutual work af exarnîning and caming ta conclusions in reference ta the difficulties of the
niations, and flnding bow they shall best be

oi secret agreements are over. Ail treaties anti

agreements must be deposited with the League
and published. Since 1920 some 1,30 have
been so deposited
The f ew statements I have made in refer1
ence to this part of the subjeet sustain my
assertion that in the seven. years of the
League's existence, such good results have
been brought about, entirely due, as 1 think
it must be admitted, te the different principle
embodied in the Covenant of the League and
the work Of the League under that Covenant.
Secondly, during those seven years, I t'hink it
can be stated confldently, we have made
progress from simple ideas and wishes andi
desires ta the incarnation of those ideals into
cancrete and organized. activities.
I count myseif particulariy fortunate in
having been able, in the succession of politicail
events, after having taken some part in the
Canference at Paris, ta have been the Chairman of the delegation wbich represented Canada in the first- Assembly of the Leaýgue in
1920 , andi also ta ha;ve beeni permitted last
year the great pýivilege af again being the
Chairman of the Canadian delegation in the
Assembly of 1926. I thus had the oppartunity
of contrasting, from personal observation and
experience, the Assembly of 1920 with that of
1926. The difference was a most striking one,
and it was as encouraging as it was striking.
In 1920 the whole stock-in-traýde of the
League of Nations was its ideals, its desires
andi its wishes, ail more or less optimistie.
It had no achievements behind it, no basis of
comparisan. af what it might be expected ta do

Like every such great mavement, it had the
whole course of experienoe of the centuries
against it as to its methods, for it was an
entire rev-ersai af the international engine.
Instead of proceeding along the line of policy

one set of ideals to another and better set.
Sa when we came ta 1926 and take up the
situation in the Assembly of the League of
Nations, we are signally struck with the great
change that has taken place. The Assembly

232

SENATE

was then in the seventh year of its existence,
and all of its procedure, methods of work and
paraphernalia, both inside and outside, had
settled down into permanence and strength.
Our first Assembily was uncertain, hesitating
in every step on moving out into a future
whose seas were abselutely uncharted. The
Assembly that met in 1926 took up its work

and capacity of that court were concerned, it
stood equal to any in the wide wof4d; and it
was on that basis that the United States Senate
consented to pass a resolution to allow application to be made, with reservations.
So
that there is that achievement in 1926 which
was but a wish or prayer in 1920.
Besides these, we had a system of arbitrain the confidence of past achievement and tions and conciliation to the credit of the

SENATE
First, then, the League of Nations is operating what is called the Health Organization.
There was a health organization before the
League of Nations came into force. It was
a result of a conference in 1907, attended
by the representatives of a large number of
the nations of the world, and it found expression in what was called "L'Office InterThat was
national d'Hygiène Publique."
carrying on when the League of Nations, in
the matter of world health, undertook to
correlate all the energies of the different
nations. The League ws met by that organization wi'th a refusai, the reason being
that the United States was a part of the
organization and just at that 'time felt itself
impelled to say: "We refuse, in respect to
any organization in which we are interested,
to have it amalgamated wi'th the League of
Nations' efforts along the same line." So
the League of Nations had to draw back and
go around by another way. But the League
of Nations is prettv wise in its day and
generation. It did draw back, but it drew
back only to advance, and within two years
that organization and the other organizations
called together hy the Jeague were co-operating in the utmost harmony, and they continue to do se to this day; and still the
United States is a part of that organization
of which I have just spoken.
That health organization does a wonderful
amount of research work. It has now its
branches and its sources of research in every
part of the world. It is in the East, where
epidemics and violent diseases have their
incubation haunts. It is in South Africa,
looking after sleeping sickness and malaria.
It is in aIl quarters of the world, combining
scientific and medical expert knowledge in a
march against world diseases as a whole. And
what a splendid example in one instance!
When out of Russia loomed that danger to
Europe, if not to a wider world, of the advancing force of an epidemic which, if it once got
its hold upon the vitals of Europe, would
ravage every part of it and probably be extended to every other quarter of the world,
the hcalth organization put up its $2,000,000
fight along that line of territory. It sent there
its watchdogs and its guard of experts, and
its material and equipment for fighting the
disease, and stopped it there, and kept that
plague fronm spreading throughout the rest of
Eurone.
How did the organization get its $2,000000
in order to carry on that fight? It was
because in that great organization fifty nations
of the world were combined. That organization, supplying the men-at-arms and the

equipment, went to its 'Governments and got
contributions from this and that and the
other, which, added to private contributions,
made up a fund of $2,000,000 for the purpose
of stopping that great inroad upon humanity.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN:
disease?

What was that

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: It
was the epidemic of Typhus which always
folldws malnutrition and war and famine
conditions and is carried as a plague, with
great facility, into all adjoining countries.
The League has carried out that work.
It is also carrying on an economie and
firancial commission. That commission has
had two world conferences and has succeeded
in making a Convention which the world
powers are all carrying out. All you have
to do is to think of what bas happened in
Austria, in Hungary, in Greece, and to the
refugees from Russia. Everyone knows-in
a moment it makes itself apparent to youthat under certain conditions in Europe, if
one country fell to pieces finanicially and was
rushed into economic chaos, it would have a
very bad effect on the surrounding countries.
That economie commission put into operation
a certain kind of work and got public moneys,
by loans on the strength of its efficiency and
the confidence that these nations had in it,
and it has resuscitated Austria and Hungary,
and has sent back largely to their homes, or
has put into occupations, tens of thousands
of Russian refugees. When a million and a
quarter Greeks and peoples affiliated with
Greece were chased out of Asia Minor by the
Turks, and were thrown in an immense mass
of utter destitution and want and suffering
on the islands and shores of Greece. this
economic commission, under the direction of
the League, raised moneys and within two
years bas put three-quarters of that million
and a quarter inito occupations and upon the
land, in Greece and Asia Minor, and is now
perfecting the work by restoring the rest of
those refugees.
The confidence that is felt in the League
of Nations is shown in this way. The Bank
of England, for instance, is a pretty wise old
concern, and it does not generally distribute
advances without having good sercurity. When
these refugees were being thrown back and
Greece was utterly unable to take care of
them, and no other nation could or would
put its hand to the plough, so to speak, the
League of Nations said: "We will propose a
plan, and we will direct the arrangements,
if the Greek Government will come in with
us." The plan was proposed, and the Greek

MAIRCH 31, 1927
Government came in, but the money was not
there, and it was needed -at once, for men,
women and children were dying in îthousands
or were in absolute want. They went to the
Barnk of England. The Bank of England, on
the mere confidence that it had in the
League's plans, gave it one million pounds,
and when that was used up it gave another
million in advanpe, or two millions in ail.
That loan was availaible untiil tihe proper time
came, when the international markets could
be asked to contribute to a boan. They
bave now done so, and the enterprise is
consequently plaeed upon a strong finencial
basis.
There is the Commission of Transit and
Communications. It bas held two 'conferences
and had several Conventions. The naine
explains the objeot it bas in view, and it hais
dlone most excellent work.
There is the Commission on Opium and
Noxious Drugs, which is an inheritance from
the old Shanghai Convention of,19M,, 1 think,
down through the Hague Conventions, and
which has now heen assumed by the League
of Nations. Suffice it to say, with reference
to that, that fifty nations of the world have
signed a Convention and entered into certain
arrangements and agreements for co-operative
action in every part of the world to stamp
out one of the greatest possible menace to
civilization, the opium and drug traffle. which
cannot he ýfought at all successfully by individual nations, but must be attacked at
its sources fromn every part of the world. The
sources of goods which have been sold icgitimately in Montreal have been traced away

countries, and back again to an Asiatic
country, from which they have been shipped

alone cannot cope with that. It must be
deaît with ýby the iinited effort of the nations
of the world.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: The United
States joins in that work, does it not?
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The ideal of the United States, which is not
opposed to the ideal of Europe, is this, that
you must make this opium business illegal
except for medicinai and scientifie purposes,
and that you must make it illegal. immediately.
Against that there is the practical difficulty.
So, while the United States' theory is the
theory of the European and Asiatic countries,
it demands what the European and Asiatie
countries think is impracticaýble to bring
about ail at once. The conference nmade a
Convention which has been signed by almoat
ail the countries of the world, and by which

they are seeuring a graduai diminution, fro'-year to year, so, that after, say, fifteen years
the cultivation and manufacture of the poppy
for certain purposes shall be outiawed. and
eliminated. 0f course, the disturbed conditions in China have thrown the whole thing
awry, because there is no government there,
and consequently there can 'be no accordant
action in that country, whi-ch is the great
opium growing country of the world. The
United States ie working with the League in
achieving the ultimate 9,im of ail.
Then they have a commission for the protectionl of women and children. They have
had one international conference, and have
agreed on. a convention which has been signed
by 45 or 50 countries of the world, and whsich
is being carried out. Another takes uip obseene
literature, and treats it in a similar manner.
An Anti-4Slavery Convention, which has just
been perfected this last year, is to get rid of
the slavery which stiki exists in this world of
ours, largely in. the way of forced labour
among the natives of backward countries. It
wa8 a revelation to the worl, and to the Assemhly it-self, to learn the extentto which this
traffic still exists. Consequently this convention has heen agreed to and signed. You have
just read in the paýpers, probably, of a sms'l
British force in Inalia which was going to
Burma for the purpose of eliminating slavery,
which stili exista there, and whose ,memhers
lost their lives in the operation., as Britishers
have so often lost their Idves in carrying out
great projeets for the betterment of humanity
and the diminution of its ills and1 sufferings.
Then there is the traffie in arms. In, that
connýection there -have been -two coniferences,
and one convention has been signed. Another
conference i.s due either this month or next
month. The United States Government is
taking part in, these conferences.
Then there are the questions of disarmament, of economie relations, of the rerpatriation, and settiement of refugees and war captives, of intellectual oo5peration, international
disaster relief, and the codification of international Iaw. These make iup altogether fourteen great world activities which are being
earried on under the direction and through
t-he inspiration of the League of Nations. By
working upon the desire cf people for personal benefit, upon the sympathies of nations
to co5perate for the reief of those i'ls which
are commnon to ail, and to hring about a
greater meaoure of comfort amd happiness,
they are exerting a force for the ultimîate
peace of the world and creating a sentiment
against war.
Then you have the administrative work of
the League. Thiere is the Saar District, where

2S6

SENATE

750,000 Germans are being governed by a
Commission of the League, upon which Can
ada has always had a representative who has
taken a very prominent part, and which,
taking into account all the differences and all
the difficulties, has been eminently successful.
Last year the turning point of their success
was reached, probably, when France, which
in contradiction to the Treaty of Versailles
had kept about 6,000 soldiers in the Saar
River District and lent them to the Commission without any charge, doing it on
the two grounds of effectiveness and cheapness, withdrew her forces. For all these years
this grievance has been r,ankling in the hearts
of the German people of that district. Now
that malter hs been finally settled. The soldiers are no longer kept there, but a guard of
800, which is not French, but a imixed body,
looks after the protection of railway property,
while the gendarmerie looks after general
order. In that way the grievance of the people
of the Saar Valley has been removed.
Then you have a like administration in
Danzig, which is a smaller country, but where
the difficulties are quite as great because of
an overflowing German population and an
overmastering Polish influence seeking to
have its wishes carried out. It has been difficult, but the work has been successfully done.
Then you have mandate supervision and the
protection of minorities, both of which are
most important questions, but which are
gradually being solved by Commissions under
the auspices of the League.
Now, J have taken up ail the time that I
ought to take on this branch of my subject,
but there are two or three other things that
I must mention. The high light, so to speak,
of the 1926 Assembly and Council was the
entry of Gernany into the League of Nations.
That entry of Germany into the League of
Nations had been dramatically brouglit before
the League Powers, and before the world, by
what took place in March 1926, when the
application failed because of the veto put
upon it by the representative of Brazil-or
probably I should say by the representative
of League of Nations Assembly from Brazil.
Because things went awry at the March
Assenbly, when everybody was filled up with
the idea that they would not go awry, there
was a lurking feeling that something might
go awry in the September Assembly as well.
Consequently, interest was very keen and
excitement ran high. But in the end, by the
unanimous assent of tihe League Members in
Assembly and Council, Germany entered and
became a part of the League of Nations.
That one sentence shows in a moment what
a great change has taken place in the League
Hon.

Sir GEORGE FOSTER

since 1920. At that time Germany was outside
the League. Then there was active hatredsuspicion between France and Germany, between Belgium and Germany, as well as
between some of the other Powers and
Germany. I remember sitting in the first
Assembly when Mr. Motta argued from the
platform in favour of bringing in Germany,
and when in the middle of his argument M.
Viviani, who was seated away down the hall,
rose with his face aglow and with indignation
pictured on bis countenance thundered out the
words, "I demand to be heard." The demand
was noted down, but the hearing had to follow
in regular course. Before he could be heard,
Mr. Motta had finished and M. Viviani had
had time to think over what he had better
say, and when lie mounted the rostrum shortly
afterwards he made his points vith singular
brilliance and clearness and force, but without uttering a single word that would give
offence to anybody.
That is one of the peculiarities of the League
of Nations. You cannot pop 'up and pitch
into your opponent on the spur of the moment;
you have a chance for second thought; you
have to walk up the long aisle and mount the
platform and face the representatives of the
worl.d and the newspapers of the world. Wien
you are confronted with that you stop to
consider whether you have anything sufficiently important to say to justify you in
making the venture, and meanwhile you have
liad time to cool off and keep a rein upon
what you say so that it shall be in the interest
of the whole.
Here in 1926 were seated near each other
the German delegate, Mr. Stresemann, and
the representative of France, M. Briand, who
liad been antagonists in a bloody and hateful
war, now pledging their faith and their loyal
co-operation in the working out of the aims
of peace, and endeavouring to stamp out the
spirit of war.
That is only one incident. But the meaning of that expands and grows when you
realize that now you have practically all the
anti-allied Powers, with the exception of
Turkey, working for peace and sitting round
the common board and mingling their counsels
together in co-operative effort.
The other point I think I ought to mention
is this: that a vexed question was for the
time being settled. That vexed question was
the constitution of the Council of the League
of Nations. Should the Council consist only
of -the Great Powers? Should it consist of
representatives which were all elected by the
Assembly, or should there be some to represent the Great Powers permanently and some

MARCH 31, 1927
elected ifrom time to time to represent the
the Assembly? That question lias been going
and cominýg every since the League was formed
in 1920. It came ta a climax in March 1926
when, under the constitution of the Coun-cil,
a representative ai the Assembly persisted in
vetoing the entrs.nce of Germany in the face
of unanimous opinion cf the Assembly itself.
There was the whole Assembly saying, «Yes,
Germany should corne in;" yet a representative eiected Iby itseff said, "No, Germany
shall not corne in," and the one was overpowering the many. That sort of thing could
flot 'be allowed ta happen again, so alter a
Committee had done its work, and alter full
examination and long conferences, the Council
was changed, and frorn that time on is ta
consist af anc permanent representative for
each Great Power and mine non-permanent
three-year representatives elâcted by the
Assembly; andi ta prevent a recurren-ce of the
March episode, the Asseinbly reserved ta
its
itself the power ta recali a&i representatives
at any time it choases, and ta re-elect others
in their places. That makes it impossible for
the will af a urnited Assembly ta be contravened by the contumacy or the devotion
ta principle of anc single representative from
that Assembly.
Then again there were the reservatians of
the Senate ai the United States. But as you
have had put on the Table here to-day the
report of the delegates ta the Seventh
Assembly, in which. you will find a complete
representation. af what took place and of the
result af the Conference in that respect, I
need nat take up your time.
Naw, honourable gentlemen, I corne for a
vcry few moments ta touch upon the second
part oi my address ta you this afternoon,' and
that is ta ask the question: why is it that
Canada as a nation and a Meimber af the
League has nat availed itself of its privilege
and bas not performed its fmil obligation ini
adhering ta the Permanent Court af International Justice? Or, ta go a little further,
why has she nat adopted. the 'principle af
arbitration?
This is somewhat important, because we are
all members ai a Legisiature which 'lias within its power the direction ai affairs in the
Dominiaon af Canada. I want -ta make that
a littîr clearer. Here is the Covenant ai
the League of Nations. It says in the preamble:
The high eantracting parties agree ta this
Covenant of the League of Nations in order
to proniote international coi5peration and to
achieve international peace and security.

237

And how? First:
By the acceptance ai obligations not ta, resort
La war.

That is the very first thing that meets the
eye; that is the very first thing that met
the eye ai Canada whcn she signed that
document. As a nation, with national status,
she signed it, and as a natian she teck on
that obligation and as a nation she has nat
carried out that obligatian. The question I
ask this aiternoon is: Why nat? And what
axe the reasons? Are there sufficient reasans?
If there are, we ouglit ta knaw them.
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND: I do not understand upan what argument or fact my right
honaurable friend bases has affirmation that
Canada has not carried out that obligation.
Right Hon. Sir GIEORCE E. POSTER:
Pierbaps my honourable friand will ailow me
ta lay down my prernises; then I will make
my argument a littlc later.
The first premise is tliat that is an obligation whi-ch it lias undertaken, and which la
expressed in the preamble ta the constitution.
The next is in aarticle VIII:
The Members of the League recognize that
the maintenance af peace requires the reduction
oi national armaments ta, the lowest point consistent with national safety and the enforcement by comman action of international obligations.
That is the second premise that I lay dawn.

Fram that I will deduce the argument a littie
later. Then Article XIII:
The Members ai the League agree that whenever any dispute shail arise between them

whicb they recognize ta be suitable for submission ta arbitration, and which cannot be
satisfactorily settled by diplomaey, they will
submit the whole subject inatter to arbitration.
Those are the principal ones:
Then-in order that I may olear this part

ai the ground-there is the Proteoal of Signatures of the permanent Court ai International Justice. That court as constituted
has nat compulsory powers.
Suai powers
were recommended by the Root Committee,

but it wau not considered possible at that
time to, arganize on that basis, which was
thOught ta be tao drastie. Therefore, if Great
Britain bas a dispute with Japan, Great
Britain cannot go before the court and cite
Japan ta that court ta answcr as ta why ahe
lias nat donc sa and so. Bath ai those powers
must agree ta, put the question bei are then
court, and then the court takes the case,
and its decision must be obeyed. But there
is Article XXXVI in the Protacol af Sig-

natureThe Members of the League ai Nations and
the States mentioned in the Annex ta the

238

SENATE

Covenant may, either when signing or ratifying
the protocol to which the present Statute is
adjoined, or at a later moment, declare that
they recognize as compulsory, ipso facto and
vithout special agreement, in relation to any
other Member or State accepting the same
obligation, the jurisdiction of the Court in all
or any of the classes of legal disputes concerning:
(a) The interpretation of a Treaty.
(b) Any question of International Law.
(c) The existence of any fact which, if established, would constitute a breach of an international obligation.
(d) The nature or extent of the reparation
to be made for the breach of an international
obligation.
These are what are technically called justiciable cases, I understand.
Any power may
sign that Protocol subject to Article XXXVI,
and when it does so it acknowledges, ipso
facto, the compulsory jurisdiotion of the court
in respect to any power which has also 'signed
that 36th section.
Up to date, 27 powers have signed that
Article of the Protocol, and are subject to
the compulsory jurisdiction of the court in
justiciable cases.
Canada's name does not
appear in that list. The greait powers fought
shy of that, but last year France came to the
point and signed that Protocol. She does not
propose to ratify it, I think, until it has been
signed by some other of the great powers,
but ber action shows ber adhesion te the
irinciple, and lier willingness to put herself
under that principle if the other great powers
will also do so.
There are men high in authority in the
British political and legal world who say that
there are some questions which no nation
can afford te place before the court for decision. When the United States was going
through ber long arguments as to arbitration,
which resulted in lier making some 30 or 40
distinct treaties of arbitration, there arose
this question of honour, and in some cases
it was kept out. So I have heard people say
that there are these questions of moment
and honour, but I have never yet had a
satisfactory statement of wliat kind of questions would justify a country in refusing the
services of the court, and would prefer te
submit them te the arbitrament of war. For
my own part, I cannot think of any question
of possible dispute that miglit arise between
countries which would be worth taking the
risk of a world war, rather than placing such
disputes before a court of justice constituted
as this one is or before an arbitration. My
honourable friend will probably give me an
answer te the question, and if there is a good
answer I will not be unreasonable, but I would
greatly like te know the reasons why Canada
has put herself in this position before the
Hon.

world. I met this question at Geneva, and
I meet it whenever representatives of the
League of Nations are seen: why is Canada
against having justiciable disputes settled by
the court? Why is Canada opposed ta arbitration?-because it has been stated by the
British authorities that the overseas Dominions, or at least some of them, were not
in favour of adopting the method of arbitration or of sending their disputes te the court
of the League of Nations.
Now, I have laid down these premises; I
have asked my question; my argument seems
to be clear enough, that there is an obligation
upon Canada te justify lier refusal or else to
send those justiciable, and perhaps all questions, either to arbitration or te that court
which has been established by the League of
which Canada forns a part. What are the
alternatives? It seems te me that this is a
sheltered zone in which Canada should immediately place herself.
Here we are on this American continent,
with no one to the north of us except the cold
silence of a northern zone; no present enemy;
and I think no possible enemy; and there is no
other te the southern boundary than the people
of the United States.
Does Canada propose
te put herself on a footing where, if a dispute
arese between herself and the United States,
she would prefer to settle it by war, and could
hope to go te war with a sufficiency of equipment and of men te make the outcome a
possibly favourable one?
That is not to be
thought of for a moment.
Canada is not in
a position of doing that to-day, and she will
not be a hundred years from now.
Then
would not Canada be wise to put herself within the sheltered zone of an arbitration treaty
with the United States-which I think might
easily be made-that hereafter al disputes
between Canadla and the United States shall
be settled by the world, court or by arbitration?
The United States is in favour of arbitration;
that is her record.
With regard te other possible enemies, who
are they? Across the blue waters of the
Pacifie, Japan and China sometimes appeal.
Has Canada the remotest idea that she will
go te war, and go te the ýcost and the trouble
of preparing armaments by air, by land, by
sea, which will enable lier te compel a settlement by Japan or by China? Would she not
be in a better position by having an arbitration treaty with Japan, and thereby both
countries would be under the aegis of the
League of Nations, compelled te take their
differences te arbitration or te that court?
And, with respect te all other nations in
Europe and South America where possible

239

MARCH 31, 1927
differenees may arise, there is only one way
in which Canada cani settie them-by conference, or by force if conference is refused,
uni-ess she chooses the path of arbitration or
the world court. She cannot go to- war with
European nations, nor with South Amrneican
nations, nor would public sentiment allow hier
to do it; nor wouid she ever be in a position,
either on sea or land. or air, to, make a
successful flght against the great powers in any
part of the world.

for the sake -of security, why flot put the

RAILWAY BoELT WATER BILL

The purposes of this bill are as follows:
1. To suspend, subject to the discretion of the
Governor in Council, the existing power of the
Minister of the Interior to modify or render
nuil and void water licenses issued by the province in respect to which protests have been
filed by occupants of Dominion lands or officials
of the Dominion Goverment.
2. To restore the rights of riparian owners
to the use of water for domestie purosest
the position in whieh they stood under th-eRail-o
way Belt Water Act as amended in 1913, substantially in conformity with the rights of
riparian okners as recognized in the provincial
Water Act of 1924.
Section 2. The section to be suspended readai
as fohlows:
Il. The Comptroller of Water 'Rights shah]
supply the Minuster with certified copies of al
permits, certificates,
notices,
applications,
licenses, protests hereinafter mentioned or other
or issued under the prodocuments received

an(l ne water privilege, hicense or right te the

use of water within the Railway Beit granted

posting and filing of the notice of application,
hy any homesteader. lessee or other lawful
occupier of lands of the Crown belonging to
Canada or by any administrative officer of the
Dominion, shall be valid and effective unless,
and until the saine shall have been approved
by the Minister, subject to such ternis and conditions as the Minister may prescribe.
Section 3. The section to be repealed reads
as f ollows:
12. Notwithstanding any provision of anY
of the Water Acts, no privilege, license or
right to the use of water shall be granted where
the proposed use of the water would deprive
any riparian proprietor adjoining the river,
stream, laite or other source of supply of whatever water hie requires for domestic purposes.
With these explanations I will move the
second reading of the Bill. If there are any
questions honourable gentlemen desire to ask
-in regard to the Bill, they may do so now, or
on the Committee stage.
Hon. W. B. BOSS: Should we not send it
to the Committee?
Yes, we will
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
refer it to the Standing Committee on Railways, Telegraphs and Harbours.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the second time.
FOOD AND ]YRUGS BILL

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second

prevent unfair competition in busineoe.
In the course of six years' experience in the
administration of this Act, the officers of the
Department of Health have found it by no
means free from defeets and it is desirabie
that it be so amended that its usefulness may
be increased.
1 will flot go through the various clauses
that are amended. Explanations wiil naturall .y be given at the Committee stage.

CANADIAN NATIONAL STEAMSHIPS
BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DAN»URAND
inoved the
second reading of Bill 142, an Act respecting
the Canadian National Steamships and to
provide for the establishment of West Indies
Service.
Hie said: Honourable gentlemen are aware
of the West Indies Trade Agrcement, whicb
came before us for examination and endorsation last Session and was agreed to by this
Chamber. Honourable members of the Senate
may remember that that agreement provided
for a special service of steamers between a
Canadian port of the St. Lawrence , or on the
Atlantic, and the West Indies. The object
of the present Bill is to croate a ncw corporation such as the Canadian Government
Merchant Marine. The idea is that that corporation should be exclusively devotod to
the administration of this service to the West
Indies. No private, interest is introduccd
into this corporation. It will function by the
side of the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine and wfll be under the guidance of the
Canadian National Railways, and answerable,
naturally, to, Parliament.
Besidos that corporation there may be a
number of companies formed, each for the
purposo of holding one of the steamers of
the fleet, as bas been donc in the case of
the Canadian Govornment Morchant Marine.
The agreement calîs for special types of
sbips, to be operatod quito apart from the
general operation of the Canadian Government Merchant Marine. There is in the Bill
a provision whereby ships may ho transferred
from the Canadian Government Merchant
Marine f0 the service of this proposed corporation. A price will bo fixed and bonds
will be excbanged, but this will ho only for
the purposes of bookkeeping. One of the
principal reasons wby the service sbould be
kept apart from the general operation of the
Canadian Government Marchant Marine is
that the varinus colonies of tbe West Inidies
are contributing by a subsidy f0 the maintenance of this particular steamsbip lino, and
it will ho necessary to bave a system of
hookkeeping which will show the cost of this
servie', ahsolutely separate from the cost of
operation of other steamers by the Canadian
Governmecnt Merchant Marine.
\Ve have in the past paid a suhsidy for this
service, as ail bonourable members are aware.
lion.

Mr. DANDURAND

An effort bas been made to obtain tenders
for the service, but they have been found
unsatisfactory and the Govcrnment lias decided tbat it should bave slips built specially
and operated by this corporation. There is
a question of refrigeration; there are obligations under the Bill with regard to the tonnage capacity of those steamers, and there are
varieus othor conditions wbicb will bave to
ho reckoned with in the building of the new
shipa.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I inquire
of my -honourable friend wbetber or not the
otber parties to the Trade Treaty, tbe Governmonts of the West Indies, which the steamship lino is intended to serve, bave bad any
hand in tbe arrangement for the construction
or purchase of these ships? Or does the
Treaty provide that Canada shaîl furnish the
transportation facilities? I arn not clear on
the termas of the Treaty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I bave not the
exact text of the agreement before me, but
my recollection is clear that it is Canada
that furnisbes the service.
Rigbt Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:Yes, that is rigbt.
-Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And at present
Canada is subsidizing a certain steamship
service with the West Indies. Are we f0 expeot that that will continue f0 run in coinpetition with the sbips owned by the country?
lion. Mr. DANDURAND: Oh, no. The
stipulations of the agreement will he carried
out hy tbese new sbips Vhat will be put in

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And the subsidies

lion. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, tbey will

CUSTOMS INQUIRY COMMISSION
INCOMPEICTE

REPLY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. C. E. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I wish to direct the attention of my
honourable friend the leader of the House
to what appears to me to be a very extraordinary answer made yesterday to some inquiries which I had submitted on a previous
day in regard to the Customs Inquiry Commission. As honourable gentlemen will observe, the questions included inquiries as te
who are the persons constituting the Commission; what salaries, if any, they are receiving in the positions they hold per-

APRIL 1, 1927
manently; whether or not they are to-be
paid, or are being paid, additional remuneration or allowances as Commissioners; and
who are solicitors, and what they are heing
paid. The first two questions are answered
satisfactorily, the replies giving the names of
the three Higli Court Justices who constitute
the Commission, and stating their regular
salaries as Judges; but as to question No. 3-Are they receiving or to be paid any additional allowances or remuneration as Commissioners; and, if so, how much?
-the answer from the Government is: "No
information."
A further question is asked, as to whetlier or
not the Commissioners may decide as to the
places at which hearings shall be held, and
the period during whîch liearings shall le held,
and this also is answered by: "No information."
I can quite understand that the question
last mentioned might be a little difficult to
answer, but I arn totally unable to understand
wliy this Goverument, or any Department of
this Government, is nlot in a position to tell
this House whether or nlot the three eminent
gentlemen, who are Judges of the Superior
Court, are being paid, or are to be paid,
any additional allowances for their work as
inembers of the Royal Commission, and so
far as 1 arn concerned I must regard the
answer of "No information" as being impossible to accept, and as treating t.his House
with disrespect. That is tlie way I look at
it. The answer is given at once as to who
the solicitors are, and how mucli each solicitor
is paid. - I presume that if the Commissioners
themselves are paid, or to be paid, the question was settled wlien they were appointed,
and if they are being paid anything it is
coming out of the same treasury as the remuneration for the solicitors.
I have no complaint against my honourable
friend the leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand), but I think this Huse lias a rea;l
ground of complaint against the Department
or the person who is responsible for sending
down 'to this House sucli a disrespectful reply.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
The answer
which is printed in Hansard does nlot give the
source of the information. I do not know
whether it cornes from the Department of
Justice or from the Privy Council. If the
answer to my honourable friend's question is
as staited. by 'him, I confess I arn as mucli
surprised as lie. I had not read the answer,
but simply transmitted it as received.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I understand, and I
aru attaching no 'blame whiatever to my lionourable friend.

Act, 1920.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, 1 do not know whetlier any honourable members of tlie Senate liave examined
this Bill, whicli contains a number of amendments to the Food and Drug Act. If tliey
have examined it and are content with the
explanations given in the marginal notes
printed witli the Bill, then we may go fearlessly into Committee of the Wliole; but, if
some honourable gentlemen who have interested themselves in this measure feel that
we need further information, I would ratlier
have them meet in a special Committee with
the experts of the Department. I know that
the Bill lias been weIl prepared. The explanations are clear. and tliey satisfy me. I
hope they satisfy the other members of tlie
Senate. Is there any special objection to the
Bill?
Right Hon. Sir GE-ORGE E. POSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I have made a fairly
closee examination of the Bill and it appears
to me -te he reasonable in its requirenients.
It is an enlargement along two lines: It l)rigs

drugs under the same regulations that foods
are under, with the same purpose in view;
and it meets a change in the manner in which
prepared foods are put up. All this is for
the purpose of keeping a check to see that
the consumer gets purity, quality and quantity. It seems to me that this is a matter
of technical examination, and, as the Department has gone into it thoroughly and recommends these amendments, and the Bill has
been carried in the other House, I think we
are on pretty safe ground if we accept it.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
this is one of a class of Bills which, so far
as I am concerned, I nearly always leave to
the doctors in the House, and if they raise
no objection at all, I do not sec any reason
why we should object. I see my honourable

He might give us his opinion.

Honourable gentlemen, I have gone over this Bill, and to my
mind it is one that we might fairly well pass.

By the end of the ycar 1926 the track had

and it is saf e to assume haif of this $5,030,996,

year 1926. Therefore interest would be paid
in 1926 on $10,901,550, which, if taken at 5 per
cent would create a fixed charge of $545,077.
On the above hasis the fixed charges on the

DISSOLUTION AND ORDERS FOR
RETURNS

your departmtent has expressed the opinion that

these orders lapsed upon the dissolution of Parlianent and require to be renewed. whereas
Mr. Speaker Bostock holds the opinio1 that the
orders are still in force and should be satisfied.
With regard to the orders of the House of
Commons, Rule 34 of the Rules and Formts of
that House (1922) provides as follows:
"A prorogation of the flouse shtall not have
the effect of nullifying an order or address of
the House for returns or papers, but all papers
and returns ordered at one session of the House,
if not comiplied with during the session, shall
be brought clown during the following session,
witbont renewal of the order."
While this rule is doubtless effective to save
an order of that House for a return fron losing
force by reason of prorogation of Parliantent,
no similar provision has been made to save such
orders froum the effect of a dissolution of ParHon.

Mr. DANDURAND

You will observe that Bourinot declares that
papers have even been brought down several
years after 'having been ordered.
May says:

Whben Parliament is prorogued before a re-

turn is presented, it is not the modern practice

to rentew the address or order in the following
session, but the order is held to have force from
one session to another until it is comiplied with.
Formterly an order which hlad not been complied witlt was renewed in an ensuing session
as if no order liad previously been given, in
accordance with the view that a prorogation
plits an end to almîost every proceeding peding
in Parliaient. Returns were often presented
however by virtue of addresses in a preceding

session, vithout any renewal of the address, and
oecasionally in compliance with an order of a

APRIL 1, 1927
former session. Returns have been ordered also
"to be prepared in order to be laid before the
house in the next session;" and orders of a
former session have been read, and the papers
ordered to be laid before the house forthwith.
The order for an address made by a former Parliament bas been read, and the houe being informed that certain persons had flot made the
return, they were ordered forthwith to makre
a return to the bouse.
As honourable gentlemen wilI see, it is a
moot question whet>her the Government, or a
Department of the Government, having
received an order for a return, should not
proceed to make that retura after the dissoluPending the settiement

LOAN COMPANIES BILL
F1RST READING

Bill 49, an Act to amend the Loan Companies Act, 1914.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There are three
Bis on similar lines: they are an Act ta
amcnd the Loan Companies Act, an Act ta
amnend the Trust Companies Act, having for
their object to give greater powers to the
Department of Finance in dealing withi the
companies that corne under these laws, and
also an Act ta amend the Winding-up Act.
The three measures could he studied together.
My honourable friend bas suggested to me
that, as variaus interests have asked -for a
hearing, these three Bis shou'ld be sent ta the
Cornmittee on Banking and Commerce. I
have for my part no objection ta that. 1 have
been shown just now a letter from the legal
representative of the Government of Ontario,
asking if be could get a hearing to-morrow on
the constitutiormI issue which arises under
one of these Bils. I am ready ta suggest
that we take the second readings of these
Bis this evening and send themn ta Committee
to-mnorrow, if the Chairman of the Comm ittee
on Banking and Commerce is agreeahie ta

247

that suggestion. If se, it would not necessarily
mean that the Bis would be reported tamorrow, because some other parties, from afar,
may desire ta be heard. The Committee
might adjourn ta a later date during the
course of this week.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: I understand that they
are ta go ta Committee without our voting
on the principle at ail. I would dike ta
suggest ta my honourabie friend that the Bill
as to which it is desired ta discuss the
constitutional issue, can be discussed inthe
House, notwithstaading that it is being sent
ta the Committee. It may not hc a common
practice here, but in the Imperial Parliament
that practice is quite often followed. Those
who desire to raise a constitutional question
might do so, notwithstanding that the Committee on Bankiag and Commerce were dealing
with the details of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. MURPIHY: That is, the constitutional question could be raised in this
House?
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes. ýSending a Bill ta
a Committee does net take away from us the
right ta discuss that.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have always
understood that the merits of a Bill could
be attacked on the third reading, as weil as
on the second.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: But this question goes
further. I have iooked up the point within
the last forty-eight hours, and I find that the
sending of a Bill ta Committee does nlot
deprive the House of the'right of continuing
ta discuss it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: 'I hope that these
Bis will not be sent ta the Committee on
Banking and Commerce to-morrow. We would
like ta have another day ta examine them.
Besides, the Divorce Committee will be engaged ail day, and there are several members
of the Committee on Banking and Commerce who are also members of the Divorce
Committee. I hope that these Bis can 'be
put over until, say, Wednesday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 1 had no opportunity ta discuss the matter with the Chairmaxi of the Committee on Bankîng and Commerce; nevertheless bis answer has just been
sent ta me. I wili nlot move the second
reading of these Bis this evening; but, with
the leave of the Hlouse, I wili move it tamorrow, with the understanding that they may
go to the Committee on Banking and Commcrce on Thursday.

TRADE MARK AND DESIGN BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANT>URAND moved the second
reading of Bill 171, an Act to amend the
l'rade Mark and Design Act.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the Bill
now before the Senate to permit of the registration of trade union labels deals with a subject wbicb was before Parliament repeatedly
in years now long past, frrnn 1895 to 1905.
In reviewing the (lebates which occurred on
those earlier Bis, I find that I myseif was
orne of those w~ho opposed the passage of
legisiation in 1903 respecting labour union
labels which was sponsored by my honourable
friend from Portage la Prairie (Mr. Watson).
Now let me say at once that the Bill of 1903
was different in rnanyv respects from that which
is before us to-day, and I may readily admit
that I only viewvcd that measure from one
angle-the legal aspect. I did not survey the
whole fieldi.
Very many changes have occurred durir.g
the past twenty-five years and many of the
foars which were expressed at that time as
to the dangers of labour organizations abusing
their power, have not been realized. Instead
of labour and capital beîng organized more and
more into hostile camps, the pbilosophy of
trade unionismn in North America bas greatly
cbanged, an that as respects the more inmportant branches of labour unionismn, very many
of tbem are working to-day on'the best of
terms with tlue employers. Occasionally one
stili corne across the utterances of individual
labour men w'ho contend that their intereats
are diametrically opposed to those of the arnployers, and who, in short, preach the socialist
doctrine of class interest. But more and more
labour unions are coming to work witb the
employers rather than again'st them, and
those who preach strife arc only the extremiste.
May I say bere that it is not from the extremist
elements in the labour movement in Canada
that the rcqucst for the present Bill bas corne.
but from the most responsible ani. shall I
say, conservative elements of unionism in the
country.
When the Union La-bel Bill came ibefore
this honourable body twenty-five and thirty
years ago it was contended t.hat it would
bring loss and occasion embarrassment to many
eunployers througb the efforts w'hich the organized workers might make te, force the label
upon them. In the ligbt of the actual resuits
it must be ýadmitted, however, that these distressing anticipations have not been fulfilled.
Truc, the union label has neyer been given
the protection of law in 'Canada which it bas
received elsewhere, but labour unions have

249

continued to seek the granting of such fair
wages and biours conditions in manufacturing
and otber establishments, and in many cases
where these conditions were granted tbey have
permitted employers to place the union label
on their products as an indication te the public
and to other workers of the satisfactory labour
conditions existing in these respective plants.
One frequently sees this mark of approval
which labour bias placed on the product of
individual Canadian shops and factories such
-as boots and ehoes, clothing, printed gonds,
etc., but 1 am assured through the department of tbe Federal Government which bas
to do witb labour unatters that it bas not been
the practice of trade unions to force the use
of the union label on anynne, and, indeed, that
the record which is kept of strikes and lockouts occurring in Canadian industries from.
year to year does not show that the union
label figures at aîl in the liste of strîkes and
lockouts. It md-st therefore be admitted that
the fears which were entertained on this score
years ago have not been realized, and this
fact should influence our judgment in dealing
wvith the measure whîeb is now hefore the
Ilouse.
Ail that this Bill involves is the granting to
organ-ized labour in Canada of tbe right to
register their trade union labels witb the Dominion Goveroment in order to prevent their
unauthorized use, and also to obviate the use
*of forgeries and counterfeits. The Bill is
designed, briefly, te secure for labels the same
measure of protection as is already accorded
A similar protection is
to trade marks.
granted at present to union labels in Great
Britain, in Australia, and in all of the fortyeight States of the United States.
It is provided in the Bill that no union
label shaîl be placed on any gonds without
the consent of the proprietor. and tîjat whi.an agreement bas been reached with an employer for the use of the label on bis goods,
such authorization shaîl be subject to cancellation only on twclve months' notice, unless
otherwise specified by agreement. Gonds bearin- the union label may also be sold at any
time if at the time the labels were applied
to them the person, firm or corporation by
whom the labels were applied, was autborized
to do so. Labels will not be assignable under
the present Bill, and autbority is given to
the Exebequer Court to cancel the registration of labels if such action is justified by the
circumetances of the case.
Penalties are provided *which may be enforced against the unautborized use of the label,
or against forgeries and counterfeits, as in the
case of trade 'marks. The 'last section of the
Bill authorizes the issue of search warruants in

250

SENATE

cases where there is reason to believe that
counterfeit labels, or tools, dies, etc. for making the saie, are concealed. A similar right
of search is authorized under Sections 488 and
629 of the Criminal Code for the protection of
trade marks. Although it is intended by the
present Bill that union labels shalH be registered under the Trade Mark and Design Act,
there wili be no confusion of these labels with
trade marks, as the registration will be entirely
separate.
Instances have been brought to the attention
of the Government repeatedly of the imitation
of union labels, and of their unauthorized use
for the purpose of deceiving purchasers. Petifions in favour of the passage of this legislation have been received fron labour organizations in all parts of Canada, and the present
Bill was adopted in the House of Commons
without any expression of dissent.
Some years ago, in 1919, the question of
granting registration to uniori labels was discussed at a conference in the headquarters
of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association
at which the Dominion Government, eiployers and workers were represented. At this
conference a Bill similar to the present one
nwt with general approval.
A meastre similar to the present Bill was
prepared last winter and introduced in the
House of Commons as a private Bill. I an
given to understand, however, that this Bill
was net submitted to Parliament without the
knowledge of the einploing interests of the
country, and that efforts were made to meet
the wishes of the latter.
Bil'l No. 171 comes before us to-day, however, with the support of the Government and
in the form of a Government measure.
I made allusion to views which were held
twenty-five years ago, in this House, as to the
status of labour unions and the doctrines advocated by unionists in certain directions.
During this interval, organized labour las
made great increases in nembcrslip and in
addition to the funds which were maintained
years ago for aggressive and protective action,
unions in a nunber of cases have since developed important insurance funds for the protection of their own mentbers, have also organized banks and even entered the field of
business.
It is unnecessary tiat I should more than
ment'on tho important part which was taken
bv the workmen of Canada in the mighty
struggle which was waged for four years overseas for the protection of liberty and justice.
As regards organized labour may I say however, that the Trades and Labour Council of
Canada was rcpresented on Government committees and at various conferences which were
Mon.

Mi.

DANDURAND

held during the war looking to its successful
prosecution in various directions. An orderin-council, known as the War Labour Policy
of Canada. was also adopted in 1918 (P.C.
1743) in which certain principles and policies
were declared and their adoption urged upon
both the employers and workmen of Canada,
as follows:
That all employees have the right to organize
in trade unions, and this right shall not be
denied or interefered with in any manner whatsoever, and throngh their chosen representatives
should be permitted and encouraged to negotiate
with employers concerning working conditions,
rates of pay, or other grievances.
That employers shall have the right to organize in associations of groups, and this right shal
not be denied or interfered with by workers in
any manner whatsoever.
That employers shall not discharge or refuse
to enploy workers merely by reason of membership in trade unions or for legitinate trade
union activities outside working hours.
That workers in the exercise of their right
to organize sPall use neither coercion nor
intimidation of any kind to influence any person to join their organization or emîployers to
bargain or deal therewith.
In the year following the close of the war,
a Royal Commission of Enquiry was appointed
by the Dominion Government on the recommendation of the honourable gentleman from
Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) to enquire
into the means of establishing a satisfactory
relationship between employers and workers
in Canada. In the report of this Royal Commission denial of the workers' rigit to organize was set down as one of the chief
causes of existing labour unrest and a frank
acknowledgement of this right by employers
generally was strongly recommended.
At a National Industrial Conference which
was convened in Ottawa in 1919, the sessions
of which were held in the Senate Chamber,
representatives of the employers' organizations and of the workers' organizations joined
with the provincial and federal governments
in an examination of the report of the Royal
Commission on Industrial Relations, and
united in a number of resolutions on the subject matters in quest(îon. The right of employecs to join in lawful organizations was
admitted in a report submitted to the Conference by the employers' representatives. The
report of the employees' representatives on
this same committee favoured also the right
of employees to organize, and defined this
expression as meaning the right of employees
to organize or form themselves into organizations for lawful purposes.
In case objection nay be taken in any
quarter to the provision of the present Bill
which permits labour unions, although unin-

corporated, to register their labels, it may
be pointed out that the Statutes of Canada
in a number of cases recognize the existence
of labour unions.
With these explanations, honourable gentlemen, I beg to move the second reading of the
Bill.

union should be obliged to put up some
securitv for costs. There is no object in the
employer entering suit against something that
is not recognized in law. He cannot collect
anything, but has to pay his own costs, and
the union cannot be held in any sense legally
responsible.
I therefore rprotest, honourable gentlemen,
that this legislation is of such a character that
I do not think this House ought to countenance
it.
I have here an extract from the London
Times of March 7, containing an article
written evidently by a union man visiting the
United States and em.ployed there. He does
not attack the union. He simply describes
an open shop. If honourable members are
interested, I would ask the leave of the House
to put this on the record, so that they might
have .an opportunity of reading his opinion of
what is known as the open shop.

Bohemians, Poles, Russians, Italians and Anstrians, some of whom spoke little or no English,
as well as a f air number of negroes.
The working day is of nine hours, with a
50-hour week. Wages, wherever it is possible,
are paid at piece rates; overtime is fixed at
time and a half. I found no objection to the'
length of the working day among the men. An
exhaustive survey of wages is out of place here.
It is enough to state that, ranging as they do
from $25 (£5) a week to as much as $90 (£18),
with an average of $30 (£6), they are exceptionally high according to British ideas, in
spite of the greater cost of living. The question
of piece work deserves closer consideration.

Good Faith
Good faith is the essence of the contract,
and good faith is observed. Each operation 1s
so timed as to yield a fair wage to those who
perform it with ordinary diligence and skill.

efficiency," whatever that may mean. Once the
rate is fixed, the management is pledged not
to reduce it for a period of one year. In one
particular case a negro foundry worker aroused
much comment and some bitterness by regularly

in a spirit less of boasting than of thankfulness. After making due allowance for a natural

wages, of course, formed the bedrock of their
self-congratulation, but they also had the idea
that the American worker has much greater
opportunities of rising to a responsible position.
One man agreed that even in England men
could reach these positions, but, he added
naïvely, "England is the only Americanized
country in Europe."
Promotion
In this connexion it is well to point out that
the superintendent of the factory himaself was
once an ordinary machine shop hand and to
add that it seens the exception rather than
the rule for men in managerial positions-the
American calls them executives-not to have
served in many, if not all, of the subordinate
departments. Moreover, all other things being
equal, the ambitions young man will do as well,
if not better, by getting work of this kind than
by serving in the clerical departnent. The life
is harder but the prospects are good, and the
pay is higlher. The "white collar" man will
be allotted duties in whiel it is not easy to
show more than the reliability and aceuracy
that are considered necessary even to retain
employment. and a few opportunities for any
kind of leadership or originality are afforded.
The manual worker, once lie lias lifted hiiself
ont of the rut into a foremanship, lias mîany
chances of proving himaself. since the mianagement chiefly focuses its vision on the workshops
in the continual search for fresh executive
talent.
Therc is more of this, honourable gentlemen, but I think that is enough to demonstrate that an Englishman, evidently a
union man, coming to America and going into what is known as an open shop,
finds the conditions, at least so far as the
work is concerned, quite to his liking. That
is a statement w'hich I think cannot be
challenged. I know from my own experience
that the production per man in an open shop,
even though the employees be union men, is
always greater than in a closed shop in which
none but union men are employed That is
largely due 'to the rules which are made by
the union and over which the employer has
no control.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON:
Honourable
gentlemen, I might add a few words that
would perhaps afford sone information on this
subject. Besides, I prefer not to give a silent
vote on an important question of this sort,
especiailly on a Bill that I had something to
do with in years gone by.
My honourable friend from Inkerman (Hon.
Smeaton White) has quite properly and naturally dealt with this question from the standpoint of his associations and position in conHon.

nection with industry. I may say at the
outset, with regard to this legislation and
similar Bills that have been submitted to
Parliament over a period of niearly thirty
years, that the purpose of the promoters in
every case was to encourage and promote industrial pence rather than anything else. As
far back as 1895 -the first Bill was introduced.
In 1903, and again in 1904, the honourablc
member who then represented Nanaimo introduced into the House of Commons a Bill
the purpose of which was much the same as
this.
At that time labour men, c-pciaiiy railway
men, were seeking also legislition to provide
for a semi-monthly pay day. That passed the
House of Commons three times, and was three
times rejected here. Finally, in 1917, the
present President of one of our great railroads came before the Committee of this
House and indiea;ted a willingnes on the part
of the railroad to accept · hat legislation, which
t
over a period of about fifteen years this
louse had been rejecting.
It has never
brought any hardship to the railroad. It has'
been a great boon to the employces. And now
in a great many States of the United States
weekiy payment of wages is required by law.
I mention these things, honourable gentlemen, to indicate that time brings change, and
we must appreciate that as industry becomes
more intensified and modernized there is on
the part of both eiployers of labour and
workmen organized in trade unions for the
purposes of more readily dealing with their
employers, a desire to co-operate. The desire
for co-operation and fair play between those
two interests is the basis of this legislation
that is now before Parliament.
In stating that, I know whereof I speak. In
1919, as my honourable friend the leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and
also my honourable friend froin Inkerman
(Hon. Smeaton White) have mentioned, some
special attention was paid to this question of
promoting co-operation between capital and
labour in industry. In 1918 some steps had
been taken in that di.rection. My honourable
friend from Inkerman was a member of a
Commission of six that travelled throughout
Canada and heard the evidence and opinions of
employers of all types, as well as labour men
of all types. My honourable friend referred
a few minutes ago to evidence given by labour
men to the effect that they desired to cont.rol
industry and come into possession of capital.
No doubt such evidence was submitted by a
certain few witnesses, but I am sure that my
lionourable friend froum Inkerman would not
for a moment contend that that was the

APRIL 4, 1927
general consensus and weight of evidence received from labour -men who appeared before
that commission. There are employers who look
with disapproval and suspicion upon ar.ything
in the namne of orgainized labour; and there are
labour men who look with suspicion, and indeed derision, upon anything bearing thie namne
of capital; and s0 long ns those two elements
stand one here and oue there, and continue to
preach those doctrines and huri defiance at
ecd other, just se long will it be impossible
te realize industrial peace in this or any other
counitry. In 1919 the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada, the legisiative mouthpiece of
organized labour in this country for ncarly
forty years, and the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association representing organized employers,
at the suggestion and instigation of the Department of Labour met in tie city of Toronto,
in the offices of the Canadian Manufacturers'
Association, and together attempted to discuss
calmly, dispassionately, this important subject
of their mutual relations. There were present
at, tiat conference, as I recaîl offiand, sucli
men as Mr. Frank Beer, -a manufacturer, and
Mr. Wills Maclacilan, also a well known manufacturer, and gallant soldier, who did muci
work in the reconstruction days following the
war, without thanks and without compensation, to try to help stabilize the disorganized
industrial situation resulting from the conflict.
There was at that conference aIse a gentleman
named, I think, Douglas, a manufacturer of
boots and shoes. There was a gentleman
named Macdonald, a solicitor of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. There were
men like Mr. Tom Moore, s'epresetnting the
Trades and Labour Cong-ress of Canada. There
was Mr. Hatford, who to-day is one of the
members of the Ontario Workmen's Comnpensation Board; also Mr. Eddie O'Dell, one
of the oldest, most expericnced and sanest
labour men in Canada, representing the boot
and shoe workers; and there were some
others, whose namnes slip me at the moment.
Those were the type of men who sat down
together in 1919 and drafted, if you please,
a Bull almost identical with the one that la
now Meore this House.
Almost immediately after bhat conference,
and before any steps were taken te introduce
the Bill in the Huse, an unîfortunate and
lamentable situation broke eut in Winnipeg,
and the Government of tiat day f elt that
under the tien existing circumistances, witi
turmoil prevailing in the industrial world, and
feeling Tun-ning hiigh between the contending
parties, the time was not opportune te intro>duce legislation of this sort; t.hat it migit flot

of cither party and would only provoke dispute
and discord, ratier tisa accoenplish the purpose intended.
ýSe time slipped by until in 1925 the ques'tion was Tevived and an honourable member
from a large industrial centre, West Hamilton,
introduced this Bill in tie House cf Ceinmens, after it had again, I amn informed, been
reviewed by a representa-tive of the «Canadian
Manufacturers' Association and t1ree slight
amendments had been mnade at the suggestion
of that body of business men. The Bull did
net reacli this bouse last year at aIl, because
of the dissolution of Parliament.
This year the Government, having gone
over aIl these historical facts, investigated
what bas beeýn done, and satisfled itself that
thiýs legislation is fair and just, te aIl parties
concerned, and affords protection te the consuming public, brings this Bill inte the lieuse
as a Government measure. Sureîy a Government, especially one constituted by our friends
opposite, wouîd net de that unless it was
satisfied that the legisiation was in the interests of the people at large.
A word or twe with reference te tie contents of the Bill. 1 think if is a wellestablished principle, definitely
declared,
rightly or wrongly, by the Gevernment of
Canada in 1918, that workmen should have
thc rigit te organize inte associations for
lawful purposes. It was likewise declared that
enmployers had the saine right. iNow, this>
Bll provides that tiose employers and those
workmcn, in the exercise cf their legal rights,
may agree te enter into an arrangement fer
working conditions and rates of *pay, and
where such conditions are satisfactery te both
parties the workmen say: "We weuld like to
co-operate with our employers and ielp them

the * product. whici. we manufacture in their
factories. Such action is perfectly fair to
tiem and te us, as well as te thc public, who
may thus know that the goods tiey are purciasing are made under sanitary and fair
conditions, and by workmen wio are reasonably treated."
I agrcc with my honourable friend from
Inkerman (Hon. Smeaton White) that many
employers in open shops treat their ernployees
quite as generously as as do tiose in saime
union sheps. I am willing te declare that I
believe the honourable gentleman is oe of
tiose who follew tic example of Henry Ford
by paying the best of wages, and working a
plant that is one of the flnest in the country,

bon. Mr. BUREAU: There is one word of
which 1 would like te know the reai meaning;

25r>

255

SENATE
SENATE

that is the word "regulating" in the first section in line 10. The language is:
(c) "Labour union" or "union' means any
organization of eniployees engaged in the manufacture or production of goods formued for the
purpose of regulating the relations between
enl)loyers and employees.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Yes, regulating
those relations. This Bill purports to go to
the very root of the relations :between employers and employees through their organized
representatives.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: But this defines what
a labour union is, and Parliament approves
of this definition by passing this Bill. If it
is only the definition of the labour unionHon. Mr. ROBERSTON:
Yes, that is
merely the definition clause. Now, some exception is taken to the propriety of giving
these two interests a free hand, by affording
liberty of action on the part of both to do
what this Bill enables them to do. Why is
it necessary or desirable that that should be
done? Because these workmen engaged in
various industries, of which there are four
particularly affected-clothing workers, boot
and shoe workers, cigar makers, and printers,
have had past experience that nmakes this
legislation desirable.
The clothing workers, or garment workers,
as they are comonly known, numbcr many
thousands. For the most part they are organized, and they have contracts with many
employers, but there are numerous obher
employers manufacturing clothing who <lo not
engage union labour and have no contracts
with their work people, and therefore impose
upon them conditions that arc unsanitary and
unfair, and goods manufactured under those
unfair and unsanitary conditions are upon
the shelves of stores for you and me to

Hon. SMEATON WHITE: Does not the
Factory Act of a province regulate what the
honourable genýtleman is speaking about?
Those Faetory Acts insist on sanitary conditions, and on a great many things that governments did not interfere with a few years
ago.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: If my honourable
friend refers to factory inspection, that is very

mueh clothing that is not made in factories
at all, and therefore no factory inspectors ever

province may pass a law to prohibit what -is
ordinarlly called a sweat-shop, and I presume
that many provinces have done so. So far as
I know there is nothing in the way of a
sweat-shop in our own province of Saskatehewan. My point is that so far as the regulation of conditions of labour is concerned, that
is a provincial matter. My question is whether
or not this legislation would necessarily cover
that. I ask, if the province, which has power,
should not regulate that matter, raither, than
that such legislation as this shoulýd be passed.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
The provinces
should and do regulate factory inspection, but
where goods are produced in places other than
factories, apparently the province tas not

Hon. Mr. CALDER:

But it has power to

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: But in suchcasces
goods made under unsanitary conditions have
hiad labels placed upon them indicating that
they were made under conditions other than
,those which really existed. Therefore these
trade unions say: "That is not fair to us;
that is a misrepresentation of the facts; and it
is not fair to the employer who manufacturers
such goods under sanitary conditions and pays
roasonable wages."
So the workmen and
employers, finding their interests common,
have got together and approved this legislation.
It may ie asked, "Why not take action
against a manufacturer who abuses the use
of the label, who uses it dishonestly and improperly?" Well, the trouble is tihat there is
no penalty for such conduct. I assume that
it is a legal principle that if there is nothing
'n the law to prevent the doing of a thing, it
is permissible. The manufacturer is protected
by the registration of his trade mark; the
purohaser knows that the goods were made
by that manufacturer, and in the plant indicated; and the demand for those goods will
grow or decline according to their merit or
demerit. If it is proper and right that a
manufacturer should have such protection,
surely the workmen, of vhom there are a
million in Canada, should have a similar right;
and all that they ask is to bo given the same
consideration with reference to the union label
as the manufacturer enjoys in connection with
bis trade mark.
The manufacturers and workmen ome
along and frankly say to Parliament: "We
jointly ask you to do tihis, because it is in
the interests of us both, and for the promotion of industrial business in Canada. More
than itat, it is for the protection of publie

cigars. They are made in a11 sorte of places
in ti

is done ini an'up-to-date factory, well1 lighted

thrown any light upon the effect of this legislation, and that is the one thing that concerns me at the present time. We must vote
on the principle of this Bill, and we should
know what we are doing, but I confess frankly
that I do not knôw.
The honourable leader of the House says
that this proposed legislation has been before
Parliament for twenty or thirty years, and he
tells us that be once voted against the principle of the Bill. My honourable friend who
has just spoken (Hon. G. D. Robertson) was
Minister of Labour for five or six years, and
though he had this Bill before him for that
period, he never thought fit to bring it before
Parliament.
My point is that before we vote on the
second reading of this Bill we should know
what we are doing, and what the possible
effects of this legislation may be. It has been
said to us to-night that representatives
of the Manufacturers' Association and leaders
of labour in this country sat down together
and agreed upon a draft Bill which never
came to Parliament. I would like to see that
draft Bill. It bas also been intimated to me
that during the past few days the manufacturers and the labour representatiives have
agreed; but it is a very curious thing that
within five minutes of the opening of this
House I met in the corridor a representative from the Manufacturers' Association of
Canada who told me that be was opposed
to the Bill. I have those contradictory
statements, and I really do not know where
I stand. I do not know even the name of
the gentleman who spoke to me, but he
represents the Manufacturers' Association, and
lie tells me that they are opposed to this
legislation.
I think that if we referred this Bill te a
Committee we could ascertain what the real
situation is, and I think we might come to a
unanimous conclusion in reference te the Bill.
My suggestion is that we give this Bill, which
is a very important one, its second reading
without endorsing the principle at all, and then
let it go to Committee, where we can have
the interested parties on both sides before
us, and I am quite sure that within a day, we
can determine the merits of the question and
decide what should be ýdone.
We are only
wasting time considering it now. Let us give
the Bill the second reading without committing ourselves to the principle of it, and then
send it to Committee; and when it comes back
we shall be able to vote upon it intelligently.
Hon. C. P. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, before deciding what should be done
with this Bill, we ought to know a little more
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

of the past history of legislation of this kind.
I am sorry that the honourable Leader on the
other side did not take us a little more into
his confidence and tell us what has happened
in this House in regard to this matter. This
very Bill has come before the Senate no less
than five times. At first, 1895, if I am not mistaken, it was in a very crude form, and would
have compelled the proprietors to accept the
union label; later that was changed, and it was
provided that the labour unions should have
the right to register their label and with the
consent of the proprietors to place it on the
goods; next an attempt was made to tack that
provision on the Trade Mark and Design Act;
then it was detached from that and came in
separately; and finally it was to apply only to

incorporated unions.

Every time this House

rejected the Bill.
Now, honourable gentlemen, before giving
my reasons why these numerous precedents
should be followed, I will ask you to bear with
me while I endeavour to show how the action
of the Senate was received by the labour
unions. I quote from the report of the proceedings of the Labour Congress for 1901:
The subject of securing Union Label Legisthe Dominion Parliament
lation through
having, at the Ottawa session of the Congress.
been relegated to the Toronto Trades and
Labor Couneil, that organization, through a
special Comnittee, composed of Mr. Robert
Glockling, Mr. William Henderson and Mr.
D. J. O'Donohue, prepared a Bill (being a
copy of a Bill which that body succeeded in
laving approved by the House of Commons
at two sessions of the previons Parliament,
but which met rejection in the Senate on each
occasion), which was courteously taken charge
of by Hon. Senator Wm. Templeman, of Victoria, B.C., and who introduced it in the Senate
on the 17th of last March. It received a
second reading on April 17th, and was referred
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
That Committee dealt with the Bill on the
norning of April 19th. In accordance with the
direction of your body the Executive, represented by your President and Mr. A. W. Puttee. boti being members of the House of Commons. were present when the Bill in question
was before the Senate Committee and gave
it their warmest and most earnest support.
Nevertheless, the Bill was most unanimously
thrown out. This rejection was not because of
demerit in the Bill itself, but wholly because
of bitter and unjustifiable prejudice, as well as
hostility to organized labor and anything savoring of advantage to the working elements of
Canada governing the members of the Senate
Committee referred to. It is to be hoped that
effort will not cease until the legislation in
question is secured.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Would my honourable friend tell us what he is reading from?
I did not catch it.
From the official
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN:
report of the proceedings of the Trades and

APRIL 4, 1927
Labour Congress of 1901.
My purpose in
reading this report is twofold: I desire to
approach this subject with a judicial mind, and
I do not want the labour people throughout
the country to have any excuse- for thinking
that this House is actuated -by any other senti.
ment than that of perfect ai-rness.
With your permission I will read to you from
Hansard a brief history of the union labelwhat it is, where it came from, what it has
done, and what it is doing now. I commend
this to honourable gentlemen on the other aide
of the House, inasmuch as the Bill' before us
is a Government measure.
I quote from a
speech made by honourable Mr. McMullen
in 1905, which was, I believe the last time
this measure came before the House.
. .. we bad this bill before parliament two
years ago, I think, when we gave it very full
consideration. Every opportunity was afforded
to diseuse the provisions of the Bill, and after
careful consideration and discussion, it was rejected by this chamber. In my humble opinion,
Canada cannot afford to transplant into our soil
vicious measures .of this kind. This legislation
bas its origin in the United States, which was
the first country in which any Act of this
character was ever brought into force. It was
adopted in 1874 for the purpose of enabling
manufacturers of cigare in San Francisco to
distinctly draw the line between cigars that
were manufactured by white labour snd cigars
manufactured by Chinese. They employed the
label to designate the cigare that were manufactured by white labour, and any that were .net
so labelled were thereby known to be the manufacture of Chinese labour and were boycotted.
They commenced with that, and they succeeded
fairly well. The next thing they undertook
was to apply the principle to the hafters of the
United States. There were about 58 or 60 bat
manufacturera in the United States and the
Union of Hat Manufacturers commenced to
unionize every factory. They went so far as
te unionize 46 or 48 factories, and then they
addressed circulars to the remaining hat manufacturers in the United States demanding, virtually, the right to unionize the labour in their
factories. Some of the employers refused, and
were immediately boycotted.
Circulars were
sent out to all wholesale and retail dealers in
bats in the United States, telling them that
these bat manufacturers had refused to come
into the union and to give their artisns reasonable and proper wages, that some of them
were utilizing apprentices who had only been
in their employ for a year, te do skilled men's
work; and they went so far as to boycott
several dealers. The unions in the United
States publish a journal, which has a very large
circulation, the "American Federationist", as
it is called. That journal publishes each week
and each month the names of all manufacturera
who will not censent te bring their factories
under the operation of union labour. Every
manufacturer receives that paper, and of course
carefully reads it, and there lie finds the names
of all the shops which will net consent to
unionize their institutions.
All those who sympathise with union labour
are desired to boycott those shops and to boycott
32655-17J

259

every shop that handles their goods. A firm in
Danbury, D.K. Loy & Co. was successfully boycotted in this way in connection with the manufacture of bats. The firm employed about 230
men and manufactured about 400,000 lats per
year. They were one of the twelve who refused
to unionize their factory, saying that they
wanted the ppportunity o)f lemploying Ifree
labour wherever they could get it. The result
what that the unions made an effort to stop the
sale of goods manufactured by those people, and
they did. The firm was compelled to take action, and they issued a writ, and named in that
writ every member of the union in Danbury.
There was a number of bat manufacturera there
who had become members of the union, and a
committee was appointed to take charge of the
matter. In the writ which was issued they
mentioned 400 or 500 men who were the owners
of property, in order to prevent the transfer of
that property until such time as this question
was settled. The case was fought out in the
law courts most bitterly and determinedly. The
result was that, having the power of the whole
labour union of the United States opposed to
them, that firm was ruined, simply because they
would not consent to have their establishment
brought into the union in the way proposed.
That, honourable gentlemen, will give you
some idea of the object of this Bill. It is
absolutely foreign te the purpose of the Trade
Mark and Design Act. What is the aim of
that Act? Briefly, it is te provide for the
better protection of the proprietary interest
in goods; special goods, for instance, as Gillette razors or all goods produced by a manufacturer, as Sheffield cutlery. The whole purpose of the trade mark is te announce a proprietary interest in the goods nanufactured.
But what is the purpose of this Bill? Quite
the contrary. It provides for the registration
of a label te be used on the gooda belonging
te hundreds of individual manufacturera, and
its effect will be, net in faveur of the goods
marked, but against goods that are not se
marked. In other words, it makes for dis-

crimination.

In the past the labour unions

have argued that goods that did net bear the

union îlabel were the product of sweat shops.
SOIt is quite apparent that the principle of the
Bill is net in accord with, but is opposed te,
the principle of the Act it would amend. As I
have said, the use of the label ie intended
net for the protection of the goods which
bear it, but rathet for the purpose of discriminating against goods which do net bearit.

Even se, is this legislation necessary? The
Bill provides that the label shall net be

placed upon any goods without the consent
of the proprietor or manufacturer. I ask you,
honourable gentlemen, nat only those of you
who are lawyers, but those also who are
business men, is it net obvious that this legislation is quite unnecessary if the proprietor
consente? If a man produces goods that are

SENATE

260

union-made, what is there ta prevent him
from stating that fact? Nobody will dispute
his right to do so. If he is entitled to do so,
what prevents him exercising that right
through the labour he employs?
The only argument I have heard that seems
to have any merit is this. If is said: "This
union label is ours, and we ought to be
protected against the use of it by people who
have no. right to use it." But I ask you,
honourable gentlemen, has there been any
need for such protection up to the present
time? I thought the honourable member froma
Welland (Hon. Mr. Robertson) would refer
to the Jacobs case. Everybody knows that
the need for legislation is usually apparent
for a long time before a measure is introduced. It is indicated by numerous cases
coming before the courts. How many cases
do you think have occurred in this country?
I know of but one. And how was that case
treated? Surely the Government, in presenting this Bill, must have come to the conclusion that the labour unions have been very
unfortunate. Disabuse your minds of any
such ideas. A clothes manufacturer in Montreal by the name of Jabobs decided to apply
to the Department of Agriculture here in
Ottawa for the registration of a trade mark
resembling the union label. He was turned
down-registration was refused him. What
did he do? He submitted his complaint to
the Exchequer Court and asked for an order
from that Court to compel the Department
of Agriculture to register his mark.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: A mark that resembled
the union label?
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Yes; that he
claimed to be his own mark, but which resembled very closely the union label.
The clasped
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
hands.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBlIEN: Yes. Now let me
read to you the judgment in that case, which
is reported in the Dominion Law Reports.
Of course the first objection that came to the
minid of Jacobs, in presenting the case, was
this: "The labour unions? Who are they?
Have they a right to appear before a
tribunal? Are they a 'person'? Have they
a corporate existence"? That is a serious question. As you know, the labour unions in this
country are not like those in England, which
have been forced to become incorpcrated.
Here they are in the most extraordinary and
advantageous position that whenever they are
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN.

attacked they can vanish into thin air. They
have no corporate existence. You cannot
take action against them, any more than you
can against the cloud that rains on you.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Use an umbrella.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: On that point what
did the Exchequer Court say?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman has omitted to state that the union
intervened in the Exchequer Court.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I am sorry. I
thought I had said that.
No. I know
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
of the case, and I mention this for the information of my honourable colleagues.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: I thought I had
made myself clear, but perhaps I have not.
Jacobs took action before the Exchequer
Court ta compel the Department of Agriculture to register his label or trade mark,
which closely resembled that of the union,
with the. two elasped hands. The labour union
intervened in the case and contested Jacobs'
right to have his label registered. Here is the
judgment.
Mark Jacobs, trading in Montreal as a
manufacturer of overalls under the name
of Union Overall Manufacturing Company of
Canada, having been refused registration of a
mark or label consisting of two clasped hands,
filed a petition in the Exchequer Court asking
for an order of the Court directing such registration.
The United Garment Workers of America
f1ied a s4itement of objections to the petition
alleging that in 1891 they had adopted the
clasped hands label as the distinguishing mark
of their Union.
''he petitioner then obtained an order setting
the case down for argument on the points of
law:
(1) Whether Bush, the duly authorized representative of the United Garment Workers,
was a person entitled to appear and file a
statenient of objections;
Honourable gentlemen will notice that this
refers, not ta the trade union, which has no
corporate existence, but to one of its officers.
(2) Whether the use of the label of the said
association is such as entitled it to object to
the registration of the mark in question by the
petitioner; and
(3) Whether the facts set out in the statement of objections constituted any answer to
the prayer of the petitioner.
Held. MacLean J.
It is no answer to the objections of this
volitary association or Trade Union to say
that they have as a body no legal right to
register as a trade mark the label used by them
in. connection with their various activities.

That might well b the case, but it does not
derioat froim tieir right to oppose the registration of the-ir label as a trade mark by the
petitioner.

APRIL 4, 1927
Therefore it lias been, decideri by the court
that if anybody without authority atternpts tu
register the union label, althoughi'the unions
have absolutely no corpoimte entity, they can
protect themnselves. Suppose that, either by
a trade mark of otherwise, a manufacturer
tried ta create ini the public mmind the f aise
impression that hie goode were made by union
labour. Is there a remedy? If there were not,
there might be some semblance of right on
the part of the trade unions txo register t.heir
label. What dce the Criminal Code declare?
It la very plain. It says:
Every one is guilty of an indictable offence
who sells or exposes, or has in hie possession,
for sale, or any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods or things to which any forged
trade mark or f aise trade descriptionPlease note those words-is applied, or to which any trade mark, or
mark so nearly resembling a trade mark as ta
be calculated ta deceive, is falsely applied, as
the case nmay be, unless he proves...
Sa it is an offence ta apply a f aise trade
description. Now what is a false trade description? Another section of the Criminal Code,
section 335 (t), says that a "trade description" means any description, statement or
ot.her indication, direct or indirect. Let me
cite a case that bas been decided under that
section. The defendants sold machine-made
cigarettes in packets labelled, "Guaranteed
hand-made by experienced workmen", their
price being a half-penny per packet less than
cigarettes of the same quality madie by hand.
The quality of tobacco, paper, starch," etc.,
used in the manufacture of these machinemarie cigarettes was the same as in -the case
of hand-made cigarettes, andi their construction
was as proper. It was held that the label was
a false trade description in a material respect,
and that the doctrine of equivalents-that the
article sold under the f aise description was as
good as that asked for by the purchaser-was
inapplicable.
Could there -be a case more ta the point?
There is a man who arivertises his cigarettes
as hand-rnade. Somebody makes a camplaint
and he is brought before the court under this
section of the Criminal Code. He says: "Yes,
it is true, your Honour, that my cigarettes are
machine-made. But iwhat damage has the purchaser suffered? I have established before the
court that my goods are equail ini every respect
to the hand-mtade goods." What does the judge
say? "That is no defence. You have given
a false description. Therefore you muet be
convicted." How can it be asserted, then,
that the section does flot proteet the union
against a false description used by any manufacturer who advertises that hie go-ode are
union-made when they are not?

261

Therefore I contend, in the first place, that
since the praprietor's consent is required before
the label may be used, no legislative intervention is needed; what the Bill asks for can be
done now. Secondly, there ie a remedy
available under the civil law. Recaurse may
be h-ad to the Exchequer Court. If you are
not satisfied you may go bef are the Criminal
Court. What more do you want?
But, honourable gentlemen, let me ask in
conclusion, what is the true meaning of this
legislation? It ie simply thie. As everybody
knows, a confliet has been raging for years
between the open shop and the closed shop.
This legisiation, demanded by the unions, ie ta
be used as a weapon. I have demonstrated, I
think, that it ia not a weapon of defence.
What is it, then? It*is one of -the cruelest anri
ýmuet powerful weapans of aggression. It has
been used as such, and with the sanction of
Parliament it will continue ta be, so used. Are
you going to allow that?
Let us pause a moment bef are giving consent. In years gone by-.but they are very
remote now-it used ta be considered chivalroue ta stand hetween the toilers and their
appressors. Times have changed. Apparently
it takes no sm-all degree of moral courage now
ta stand before the unioniz-ed workers and demand an equal measure of liberty and justice
for ahl the other classes in the land. That le
the truth. Do you think for one moment that
manufacturera, scientiste, professional men, ore
even ordinary workers outside the labour
unions, would be heard if they asked for
legislation like this? Can a trade mark at
present be registered e.xcept by a persan? You
must be able ta offer a guarantee of your own
responsibility, or that of your partner, or a
corporation of which you are a member. Try
to register a trade mark otherwise and you
will sec tha;t it cannot be done. Why?
Because it is only fair that the persan who le
granted a right ahould alea accept responsibility, and responsi'bility ean. be 'borne only by
a persan or a corporation. What is propoeed
in the present Bill? You are going to make
an exception and grant a privilege that no
other class in the land can obtain; you are
going to grant this privilege ta the greatest
organized force i the country. They would
make use of the privilege, but when it came
te meeting their responsibilities they would
vanish into thin air. Is it necesary ta, cite
examples? My own experience in this respect
has been very unfartunate. I have seen labour
unions tear up their contracte. Honoura-ble
gentlemen will remember the discussion that
took place in this House with regard ta the
Miers' Union of Cape Breton repudiating
their coatract, sacrificing the mines, setting

262

SENATE

fire and blowing up stores. What responsibidity can be attached to such men? Who
can be sued for damages?
My honourable friend from Welland says
that a request for legislation of this kind, was
received favoutrably in Great Britain. But are
the trades unions in Great Britain not incorporated?
Were they not obliged to assume
responsibility when they asked for certain
rights?
The question, honourable gentlemen, is
whether or not we are going to create a
privileged class.
That is the real issue. Are
we going to intervene in the warfare between
the open shop and free labour on the one hand,
and on the other the closed shop, controlled by
the iron hand of the trade union, dictating not
only to the proprietor, but'also to the men who
work. The union insists upon the same treatment
for the man who does not deserve his pay as
for the man who does deserves it.
In that
way it destroys ail ambition in the workers.
Are we going to allow the unions to force the
great majority of workers in this country into
their organizations?
That is the question.
Compulsion is the offensive weapon that has
been used most effectively up to the present.
I say that we in this House, at all events,
ought ta be above any influence, even the
powerful influence of organized labour, that
would prevent justice being donc.
Let us
see ta it that a fair measure of protection is
given on both sides.
Manufacturers, .or
capitalists, if you will, have to comply with
certain conditions if they would register their
trade marks, and they must assume certain
responsibilities.
Why should we not require
that the labour unions be treated likewise?
I
have heard no answer to that question, and
until I do I must follow in the footsteps of
my predecessors in this House who have done
theiýr best to mete out justice to both sides.
Their action was interpreted as oppression, I
am sorry ta say, but after reading the discussions that have taken place in this House
in five consecutive years I can come to no
other conclusion than that my predecessors
acted fairly and patriotically.
They had the
courage to stand between unionized labour
and all the other classes of the community.
Hon. J. D. TAYLOR: Honourable gentlemen, I desire to say a few words in favour of
this Bill, based on the knowledge and experience of nearly fifty years.
I would like
to present myself to your imagination as a
sample, on the one hand, of this aggressive
member of a labour union, and on the other
of the patient employer upon whom the
aggressive unions are going to thrust so terrible
a load.
Hon. Mr. BEAUB1EN.

It has been my privilege to be connected
since 1877, for exactly 50 years, with one of
the greatest labour unions in, the world, one
of the strongest in Canada, and I think the
one that is a leading mover for this Bill; I
refer to the International Typographical
Union, including the allied printing trades
throughout the whole continent of America.
It would be bard to convince any intelligent
member of that union that in the Senate of
Canada there existed a wrong conception of
the ambition which has caused them through
more than a quarter of a century to agitate
for a Bill of this kind.
If honourable gentlemen will read the Bill
they will find within its several sections none
of the horrors which have been depicted to
us. They will find there nothing but permissive legislation so far as the use of the
union label is concerned; and on the statement of these honourable gentlemen themselves the label has been in use for considerably more than 25 years, as our records
show. But there has yet to be produced
any evidence of the evil results which were
stated 25 years ago in this Chamber as being
sure to follow from the adoption of the label
under protection of law, though we have had
it in use during that whole period without
legal protection and with no evil results whatever.
Take the case of the International Typagraphical Union as a sample. They do not
take employers by the throat and force them
ta use a label obnoxious to them. They come
in a spirit of negotiation to the proprietors of
newspapers, and offer very substantial guarantees of protection to those proprietors.
They ask, in return, for a mutual arrangement of satisfactory working conditions, and
when the proprietor accepts those he does
so with the assurance from the International
body itself that he will be absolutely protected against any improper use by the local
union of the very great authority which tic
International confers upon them.
So strongly is that union organized that
they are able to compel obedience to their
laws and regulations by any member of the
union, to keep every member at his work
so long as there is any dispute between them
and their employers; provided the employers
have agreed to accept the arbitration of the
International body at their International headquarters. That is a method that is called into
effect by leading publishers in Canada nearly
every year, and there has yet to be a single
instance of any oppression or any ill-feeling
in the long-run result in those organizations.

SENATE

responsible citizens corne petitioning Parliament for something so innocent as this Bill,
as a member of this honourable body I sincerely hope that the Senate wili show that it
has progressed from the stage of fear and
doubt as evidenced in the records of 25 years
ago, and that it will prove to the publie that
it bas marched with the times, and has recognized that something which was thought of
a quarter of a century ago as a menace to
manufacturing prosperity in Canada has turned
out to be greatly for the benefit of this
country.
I have had experience as a working printer,
a member of the Typographical Union, and
also experience as a proprietor making agreements with that union, and protected by them.
My experience is that- there is nothing but
benefit to be secured to the printing trade in
Canada from an organization so strong and
so intelligently directed as that of the printing
and allied trades.
I speak of them particularly, not because they are better than any
other trades, but because I speak of that
which I know. There are other trades of very
high intelligence, as mentioned by the honourable gentleman from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), that are particularly interested in
this Bill. I feel satisfied that if we give them
the protection which they ask, and which is
given to trade marks generally in Canada, in
order to make their union label respected, and
prevent poaching upon it, we shall do a great
deal to raise respect for the Senate in the
minds of a very large body of people in
Canada.
As a Senator, I should value very
highly any increase in the high respect in
which the Senate has been held.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Could the honourable

NORTH WEST TERRITORIES BILL
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate again went into Committee on Bill
123, an Act to amend the North West Territories Act.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien in the Chair.

APRIL 5, 1927
On section 1--export tax on furs:

Hlonourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I crave the attention of honourable gentlemen ta thbis sinall Bill, whieh gave
saime trouble 'last week, and which I amn affn
submitting to the Chamber with further information. The subI ect matter of the Bill is
mainly a departmental matter, and affecte
the revenue of the country. It bears on the
levying of an impost iii the Nor-th West Territories upon furs taken there and exported
to points outside the North West Territories,
mainly ta Europe. The levy wi1l be at exactly the samne rate as in Saskatchewan, Alberta,
that it will
and Manitoba, and it is hoWe
cover a large part of the expense of the administration of the North West Territorioe.

I have a memorandum. ta which I ask honourable gentlemen ta listen very carefully, and
w.hich I think entities -the Bill ta the syrmpathetic consideration of this Chamber.
Communications were received from the Goverument of Alberta and British Columbia to
the effeet that f urs seized by those Provinces,
for non-payment of royalties, were frequently
said to have come fromn the North West Territories, where there is no fur tax. Attached is
a copy of a letter from the Hon. Geo. Hoadley,
Minister of Agriculture, in the Alberta Goverrment, addressed to the Hon. Chas. Stewart,
Minister of the Interior, askiug his co-operation
in the collection of his fur taxes by imposiug a
fur tax in the North West Territories. Mr.
Eoadley states that--"As soon as aIl the Provinces and Territories of Canada provide for a
tax on pelts of wild animals, the collection of
the tax will be very much simplified for ahl concerned".
The Department bas also received a number
of communications from the Chairman of the
Conservation Board of British Columbia. Re
asks that the matter of f ur royalties in the
North West Territories, be drawn to the attention of the Minister, with a view to bringing
the Territories in hune with the adjoining Provinces regardiug fur taxes. He states further
that if the North West Territories have no
scale of royalties it would be only fair that
they should impose one and that the scale of
taxes should be similar to that of the Provinces.
The tax proposed for the North West Territories is similar to that of the western Provvinces. It is estimated that at least 75 per
cent of the f ur caught or taken in the North
West Territories. ig bouglit by the larger comn-

panies or corporations and taken outaide by
them. The Hudson's Bay Co., is the largest
exporter.

Their fur goes direct to London.

Revillýon Freres' fur goes to New York or Paris.
Liebes Company's fur goes to San Francisco.

It is ouly a f ew individual trappers whose fur
finds its way to Canadian markets. The proportion is relatively small. It seems only fair,
therefore, that f ur exported fromn the Territories. and iuuch of it from Canada, should
carry a small export tax.
The Government provides a generous service to the residents of the North West Terri-

265

tories, but receives littie in return. The following are some of the expeuditures:1. Splendid mail service-winter and summer.
2. Four wireless stations.
3. Aids to navigation in rivers and lakes.
4. Health officers throughout the Terrîtories.
5.' Assistance to schools.
6. Assistance to hospitals.
7. Construction and maintenance of roada.
S. Police protection at ail posts in the District.
9. Maintenance of Wood Buffalo Park.
10. A resident staff at Fort Smith to carry
on administrative duties.
On all these services the Government is spending money to encourage and f oster development,
but the return does not meet the expeifditures.
The tax on f ur would approximate $75,000.00,
the first year. This would go a long way to
pay for the administration of the Mackenzie
District. An export tax is imposed by the
Yukon Territory, and every Province but one
imposes a royalty, and it is thought that a tax
applied to the North West Territories, would
bie a just and reasonable one.
At present there is no adequate method by
which a record can be kept of the qnantity of
fur taken and shîpped out of that country. The
levying of an expert tax would, for the first
time, place in the hauds of the Government a
means by which. proper records could be maintained. It would also have a bearing on the
unlawful and illegal. killing of f ur. The export
tax officers Mill be on the lookout for any fur
killed out of season. Offenders would not bie
permitted to export it and would be made to
answer for breaches of the law in this respect.
Wheni the statement is made that nobody
wears f ur iii the North West Territories, it is
made 'without a knowledge of the facts. There
may flot be so imuch f ur worn in the vicinity of
the more settled parts of the North West where
trading .posts arc readily accessible, but in the
more remote parts, f ur is the sole and only
article of ciothing even in the summer time.
There are vast areas in the North West Territories not adjacent to the more settled Mackenzie River District. They include Baffin Island
and the other Islands in the North. Iu these
areas f ur is worn both winter and summer
alike. On this fur there would bie no tax. It is
only f ur exported to other parts of Canada, or
to other countries that the expert tax would
apply.
Criticism of the Bill has been made that the
tax will f aIl on the trapper. This has not been
the experience of the Departmeut. Along the
Mackenzie Valley for instance, where several
companies are represented and where free
traders also operate, the prices paid, quite frequently equal or exceed the market value and
the trader can always depend upon getting quite
as much as lis furs are worth. On the other
baud, in any locality where there is no opposition, the trader will get possibly 20 per cent of
the real value of the fur. To illustrate-at
Fort Good Hope, on the Mackenzie, where there
is plenty or rivalry between buyers, a batch of
30 white foxes brought $990.00 cash, which is
slightly more than they brought later in Montreal. Iu Cumberland Gulf, Baffin Islaud, during
the samne year (1922) white fox pelts purchased for one gallon of molasses and one pound
of tea, or something less than $1.00. During
the past year the Baffin Land posts, which
have no opposition, paid $8.00 in trade for a

260

SENATE

white fox, which is about $3.00 cash, while at
Fort Harrison, on the east coast of Hudson's
Bay, where two companies operate, $40.00 in
trade was being paid for the same skin. The
value of the fur does not determine the price
to be paid. To-day the Eskimo on Baffin
Island secure practically the sane grand total
for their catch whether large or small. 1922-23
was a very good year, while the next year was
a poor one, but the natives were in no way
better off as a result of the big catch. Under
the present condition of trade a tax on fur
would undoubtedly be carried by the companies
rather than the trader. After a careful study
of the situation, extending over a period of
years, this is the conclusion arrived at by
Departmental Officers.
The argument is made that the amount to be
collected-from $75,000.00 to $100,000.00 annually, is too small to warrant putting the tax
into effect. At the present time the North West
Territories, is administered at a loss. If the
Department is empowered to impose an export
tax it will go a long way toward paying for its
administration. The tax itself will cost very
little to administer. Government officers already in that country will be utilized to collect
it. This is the only method by which the revenue can be increased.
I do not kn'ow that I need read the letter
of the Hon. Mr. Hoadley, and the two letters
of MT. Jackson of the Conservaýtion Commission of British Columbia. If any honourable
gentleman desires me to do so, I am quite
willing to accede to his request.

Hon. Chas. Stewart,
Minister of the Interior,
Ottawa, Ont.
Dear Mr. Stewart:
I am taking the liberty of bringing to your
notice a situation which exists in this Province
with respect to the collection of a tax on the
pelts of wild animals. The amendinents to the
Gaine Act of 1920 made provision for the
collection of a tax on the pelts of wild animals
taken in the Province of Alberta. This source
of revenue had not been previously exploited
although it was the only resource over which
the Province had control. This, with other
sources of revenue under the Gane Act, was
for the year 1922 upwards of $84,000. We feel
however, that the Province is not receiving
the tax on all the pelts taken within the
Province. This, to some extent, is due te the
fact that pelts have been brought into Alberta
from Saskatciewan and the North West Territories, exemption from payment of the tax on
such pelts bas been granted. It is believed that
Alberta pelts have been taken into the Province
of Saskatchewan and possibly the Territories.
and returned as pelts from Saskatchewan and
the North West Territories. The Saskatchewan
Governmtent bas now provided for a tax which
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

simplifies the matter very much with respect
to Saskatchewan pelts, but the situation still
remains the same with respect to the pelts being
brought in fron the Territories and more particularly the MacKenzie District.
As the great majority of the fur from the
MacKenzie District passes through Edmonton,
this Department is prepared to coöperate with
your Department in every way to the advantage
of both, if yo are proposing to provide for a
tax on the pelts of wild animals taken in the
North West Territories.
As soon as all the Provinces and Territories
of Canada provide for a tax on the pelts of
wild animals, the collection of the tax will be
very much simplified for all concerned.
Thanking you in anticipation, I ini,

Dear Mr. Harkin:
I an told that the Northwest Territories do
net collect royalties on furs. My impression
was that they did, and that tieir scale of
royalties was iniform with that of British
Columbia and the other Provinces.
You probably know that as a result of interprovincial conferences on gane matters we have
for sone years adopted a uniform scale of
royalties on fur, and I find after consultation
with Alaska that their scale is identical or
approximately so. There is strong reason for
having uniformity of royalties inasmuci as owere
any one to reduce the royalty on any particular
fur, the tenptation inmmediately arises to take
fur illicitly from adjoining territory into the
jurisdiction where the lower royalty obtains and
thus glean the unlawful profit of the difference.
This works an injustice to tihe province of
origin, and encourages lawlessness. The situation is more aggravated of course if no royalty
is collected, and redounds to no benefit in point
of revenue, but defrauds the Province of origin.
I do net quite know who is the proper person
te address in this connection, but perhaps you
will be able to handle the situation for mse,

A.PRIL
and impress the views of our Board and Province that if the Northwest Territories have no
scale of royalties, it would appear ta be only
f air that they should impose one, and that the
samne should be similar to that of the Provinces.
Yours faithf ully,

Now, honourable gentlemen, the Dominion
Government adiministers the North West
Territory. Lt also administers the Yukon,
through a Commissioner. The Yukon already
has a similar tax. The three Western Provinces-in fact, including British Columbia, the
four of thern-have such a tax, and when they
are interested in having this tax extended
beyond their borders to the north, 1 am at a
loss ta, understand why we should not make
this levy. Large corporations have enriched
theniselves immensely by this trade. We have
not heard any protest from them against the
payment of so much per pelt.

duty on furs that go into other Provinces, in
view of the statement which has be-en made
that those furs are exported to other markets of
the world by the tbree large om.panies which
have been mentioned, one of which sends
tbemi ta London, one tu Paria, and one to San
Francisco. I see no objection whatever to
the imposition of some duty on furs exported
out of Canada, but I still see difficulty in
fixing a duty as between two points in our
own country. If those fours are al exported,
wvhy is it necessary to impose a duty as between Provinces?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did flot stress
the point to-day that it is called an export
duty, but it could as well be called a royalty,
just as Alberta and Manitoba and Saskatchiewan levy a royalty. In order to colleet that
royalty in the Northwest and flot tax the fur
that is utilized in those Territories, the Department has felt that it should cail it an
export duty, as it had the right to do under
the constitution, so that a&l animais killed,
the
whose furs became a commercial article for

the Bill has taken the form of an cxport; duty,
although in reality it is a royalty that is
levied on the furs that are gathered in that
territory.

even between the Territories and the Provinces, is something which is altogether niew.
Not Gnly is it new, but it is foreign, and it
's opposed in many respects to the policy
of the past.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The lionourable
gentleman is in error, because it is an export
duty that is levied in the Yukon Territory.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It is flot an export
duty.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, it is called
thut, and it is the same.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: I do flot care what
the label is that lias been used in the Yukon
Territory; it is a royalty. I do flot think
that the statute by calling it an export duty,
makes it anything but what it is in reality,
a royalty.
Hou.

MIr. ROBERTSON.

I have no object to imposing a royalty on
furs shipped from the Nortliwest Territories
to Europe, or even to ot-her parts of Canada,
though I do think that a royalty on goods
shipped from the Territories to other parts
of Canada sliould not be imposed. I arn
willing to accept it, but I want it called a
royalty, and not called an export duty, for
I think it would be creating a very bad
precedent to call it by that name, and it
would leave the people under the impression
that we are violating, when we arc not, one
of tlie cardinal, principles upon which Confederation was based-tliat. there should be
absolute free trade between one part of Canada and another.
I hope my honourable friend is not going
to get very angry with me, thougli he does
flot seem willing to take anything from me
just now, but I arn going to suggest it alI
the same. The levying of a royalty upon
furs consigned from the Territories to any
other part of Canada, or to any forcign
country, is what I would suggest. I ar nfot
going to vote against, this, but I suggcst this
amendment to tlie good judgment of the
honourable leader.
Hon. Mr. 'POPE: Honourable gentlemen,
the honourable
gentleman to say lie is not going to vote
agairst it. If it is wrong lie should vote against
it. I do flot wonder that the honourable leader
of the Government does flot pay rnuch attention to what the honourable gentleman says,
wlien lie asserts that lie is going to vote for
what lie thinks is wrong.
We mnust not forget. that we are the
guardians of those Indians, and thougli if we
are guardians of those who are without any
representation at aIl, we are going to impose
a tax upon tlieir revenue. You may talk
ail -about those big organizations that would
readily psy the $75,000 or $100,000, but that
tax is going to fall back on the children of
those of whomn we are called guardians. There
is not a single principle involved in the application of that royalty, if you like to call it
that, or that export duty, if you prefer to
caîl it sucli, that is not contrary to the
principle, of self-government in this country.

APRIL 5, 1927
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Honourable gentlemen, we have had a very interesting etatement
from the leader of, the Hoee sinee our last
discussion of this Bill, but lie lias said nothing
in that statement that ham caueed. me to.
change sny view, even though I think the
statement has 'been carefully prepared, and
that on the whole it is comparativel'y correct.
I have two or three Objeactions to this Bill,
the chief one being that the imposing of a
tax on people in Canada with.out giving them
the right of representation, or without their
h.aving representation, is, in my judgment,
a very faulty clama of legisiation.
We nmust bear in mind that in the Northwest Territories the pepole are not al
Eskimos, and they are flot ail Indians. We
have people like ourselves there who are
traders. English-speaking people, citizens of
this c'ountry just as we are. I leave it to the
members froni the Northwest to bear me out
in that statement. In the old days I knew
many of those people personally, men who
had gone eut into the wilds and done trapping,
and there are probably a ýgreat many more
of them to-day than there were 25 or 30 years
ago. We must flot be carried away with the
idea that this is a tax on Eskimos and Indiana,
and we shouid consider very carefuily the
principle of imposing a tax on people who
have no representatien.
In the second place, there has been nothing
said to satisfy me that the incidence 'of this
tax will flot fail upon the trader. It is quite
true that there are two or three big camipanies
that get a very large preportion of the fur,
but there are aleo a great rnany independent
déalers in that country. I tried ta give the
House a picture of what took place at the
city of Winnipeg at one of those fur sales,
and I think 1 arn saïfe in saying that there
were hundreds c.f independent fur traders
interested there; so it is not simply a que'stion
of getting this tax frors the Hudson's Bay
Company or Revillon Freres, but froxu al
those traders who are scattered froin Ungava
to Alaska.
I dlaim that if this tax is levied not onl,;y
will the incidence of the tax faîl upon the
trapper, but prebably the amount reaching the
trapper will be double the tax, for that is
usual]y what takes place. If you tax a
coxmpany it will almoet invariab'ly endeavour
tô pass the tax along ta, the people with
whom it is dcdng business, and flot only to
pass it ailong, 'but it is usually arranged ta,
pass along probably double the tax. That is
what is likely to take place. Heure I doubt
the assertion that is made, that this tax will
faîl upon the large companies that make

big money and can afford it. In m.y vieW
the tax will fail upon the trappers, and mostly
on those in the north country.
The amount of mjoney involved, as 1 stated
the other day, is ornai, and we "huldremember that we have a vast territory there, fuil
of all kinds cf resoureeS, with wonderiul POtentialities. The chasnces are tihat in the
course of time the Dominion of Canada wil
make a great deal of money (>ut of that
country. Even though at present the administration of the Northwest Territories costs
us se, murh meney, why should we at this
stage of the deve.lopment 0f the country
endeavour by meane of such a tax to, get
a few do-11ars in order te take care cf the
cost of administration?
One other point. During the last 15 or 20
years we have had ooming to us in Parliarnent
a goox1 many Bis cf this ki!nd, and I arn
inchined te think that one of the main reasons
for this Bill is that we have officials ini ail
Our Departments who are very anxious to
ieach eut and create new branches. Those
officiais are endeavouring year after year in
every possible way te increase the number cf
branches and officers, and thus enhance their
own importance in the service, and ail that
sort of thing. I arn inclined te think that
hack cf this Bill seme person conceived the
idea that here was an oppertunity ta create
another branch, on which would f ollow the
appointment of a number more officiais.
While we hiave had a very intereslting statement, notihing ciontained in it has suggested
any change in the views which 1 expressed the
ether day, and which I arn emphasizing now.

opinion to the contrary, that wouid seem to
me to be a very clear infraction of the prohibition which is imposed by the B. N. A. Act
upon the levying of any sort of duty as

To get over that difficulty, perhaps, but
with the hope at any rate of avoiding any
question of that character, I would submit to

change in the wording of this clause; to st-rike
out altogether the present proposed clause and
substitute these words:
The levying of a tax upon furs taken within

Hlon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, I owe an explanation. to my honourable friend the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) for having shown some
impatience at 'bis statement that this Bill
was unpalata;ble to him. I thought that he
had voted for the Bill laàt week, and that
then was the time when he should -have notified me of any objection on his pait, but I
find that bis displeasure was caused by the
expression "expert tax ". I had not noticed
that my honourable friend had suggestcd a
precise amendment. However, when he offered
that suggestion I had already accepted the
amendment moved by my honourable friend
fromn Toronto.
1 desire now to draw the attention of my
honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon. Mr.
Calder) to the fact that prier te 1887, and
for many years, the people of the Northwest
Territorics were witbout representation, but
taxes wcre collected throughout that région.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: No spécifie tax.
There is now a tax on the people of the
Northwest Territories in the form. of a Cs
toms tax, but, so far as my knowlcdge goes,
the Parliament of Canada neyer imposed a
specific tax on any part of the Northwcst
Territories before they had representation. It
is quite 'true that imports going into the
Northwest Territories in the old days paid
their share of taxation.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It eeemed to
me that we were simply carrying into the
Northwest Territories the practice that prevailcd to the south and as far west as British
Columbia, of levying a royalty upon the fur
gathered in each Province. I am stili at a
loss to understand why, having the responsibility of the government of those Territories,
we should not be able to do likewise there.
However, -as there are two amendments
before the Committec, I shail have to examine
tbemn and sec how tbcy would fit in with the
economv of the Bill and the intentions of the
Departmcnt. I therefore move that the Committee risc, report progress, and ask leave to
sit again.
Progress was reported.
ýCANADA'S RAILWAY PROBLEM
DISCUSSION CONCLUDED

The Senate resumed from March 29 the
debate on the inquiry of Hon. 34r. Robertson:
That he will call the attention of the Government to certain matters affecting Canada's
transportation activities and problema; wil
inquire of the Governinent whether or not it
bas any definite policy in relation thereto, and
if so, will ask that it be publicly declared.

271

Hon. R. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, whcn I read the inquiry which my
honourable friend from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) placed on the Order Paper 1 did
nlot know where he was leading me. The
hon)ourable gentleman desircd to cail the attention of the Government te "certain matters
affecting Canada~s transportation activities and
problems," and gave notice that 'he "would
inquirc of the Government whether or not
it had any definite pohicy in relation thcreto,
and, if so, would ask that it be publicly declared." That was admirab'ly vague, and I
listened, with both cars .to my 'honourable
friend in order to learn what was in 'bis mind.
I conifess I admired his skil hn developing
his thesis, whioh I mîgbt summarize in this
way. The railway wagc rate is too low:- it
is in that position because frcight rates are
too low: the freight ratés arc too low because
of the action of Government and Parliament.
Hav;ng made that statement, fie asked the
Government to déclare a definite policy on
this question of freight rates, since the freight
rates , accordiing to hum, govern the rates of
wages.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Not according
to niy statement, but according to the statement of the railroads.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I arn under
the impression that my honourable friend bas
not established bis premises. Re bas not
demonstrated élearly, to my satisfaction, that
the rail-way wage rate is too Iow. I amn in a
state of mind similar to that. of the honourable leader sitting by 'bis side .(Hon. W. B.
Ross), who said -that he was uninformed on
the matter and wou'ld like very mucb teo know
wbat is the exact situation, in order that he
might forma a judÈment. So I repeat his
words.
Wbat is the impression e~rouÉhoub ithe
couDtry? The impression w.bichb as prevailed
throughout tbe country since the very high
rate wns agrecd to by the railways, after the
McAdoo pronoruncement, is that the railway
employées receive wages far in excess of those
paid in moat similer callings, entailing similar
responsibilitie§, in this country. This impression may now be erroneous, but it still hingers
in the minds of many peophe throughout the
country, and, 1 arn sure, of many fionourable
members in this Chamber. My bonourable
friend tried te establish that tbe railway
wagcs are low because Vhey arc iower than
the rates prevaihing in the United States. I
arn convinccd that tbat will 'not be accepted
by the country at large as a fair comnparison.
My honourable friend desires8 through t'bis

that some classes of railway e'mployees, in the
event of failure to obtain wage increases
through negotiation, may resort to the final
argument of the strike, and in a veied way
the honourable gentleman reminds us of the
responsibility of the Government and Parliament. Though he may think he has made
out a case which would justify suoh action, I
believe that he wll not carry the judgment
of this Chamber. I think that the Senate,
and the public at large, will need clearer and
more convincing evidence.
It is rather curious that we cannot be
shown something tantamount to a pay-roll
when we have an immense staff of employees
moving our trains and working on the maintenance of our railways, from the Atlantic to the
Pacifie, and being paid by the State, through
the Canadian National Railways, or by the
Canadian Pacifie and other companies who

which show that certain classes of railway
employees receive an average of $3,000 a year.
That is quite a large sum. In the event of a

maintained, and is not removed.
I say that through government ownership we
are near enough to the railways to bc able to
satisfy ourselves as to the wages paid to the
various classes.
We cannot do so by examining columns of figures showing the rates
per hour, if to them is added the qualification
that a day represents a certain number of
miles.
It is a complicated method of determining what A or B receives.
It seems to
me that my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), who is at the head of one of those
large organizations, ought to be able to give
this country a statement such as would satisfy
his neighbour and leader, as well the other
honourable members of this House.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May I ask my
honourable friend in what way he thinks it
would bc possible for me, as an individual
citizen of Canada, with no access to the records
of our railway companies, to obtain information of that kind?
The Government can
obtain it, but I cannot.
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: May I suggest to the
honourable gentleman that if he asked his
friends, "How much did you get for 1924, 1925
and 1926, in round figures?" they would tell
him.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
000 of them.

There are 170,-

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There is something in my honourable friend's statement that
lie has not free access to that information,
although I am quite sure that through his
connection with a large organization he could
easily ascertain the amount of the monthly
or bi-weekly pay cheque, which goes to make
up the yearly wage.
Perhaps the information could be obtained through an inquiry
placed on the Order Paper of this House. The
Canadian National Railway must answer our
questions.
My honourable friend as'ks "What is the
policy of the Government in connection with
freight rates?"
He will readily understand
that the question lie puts is perhaps the biggest
that could engross the attention, not only of
the Government, but of Parliament.
He
knows that freight rates are settled by the
Railway CommissionHon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Sometimes.

Hon..Mr. DANDURAND: -that we have
delegated to the Railway Commission the
fixing of freight rates. He knows also that
above the Railway Commission stands the
Parliament of Canada, which is supreme. He
is aware of the fact--and he mentioned itthat Parliament has recently done something
which affects the freight rates of the West.
I am sure that when that piece of legislation
passed this House he did not raise his voice
to condemn it because of the effect it would
have on railway wages. He knows full well
that legislation is on its way to this Chamber
which to a considerable extent affects the
freights of the East. He now asks what is
the policy of the Government. The Governments' policy is embodied in the legislation
of the past and the legislation of the present.
The people of this country are about to
assume a share of responsbility for the cost
of these reductions in the East; but in the
fixing of rates. the Railway Commission, gencrally speaking, is supreme, except that it is
subject to whatever action Parliament may
take. How can this Government declare today what might be its action during the next
Session of Parliament, or within two, three
or five years?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

That is the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Who can say

the problem. of the East. My honourable
friend says that the Railway Board should
recognize that the wage rate ought to be a
fair one. But the first consideration that must
govern the Railway Commission is the question of providing for the cost of operation,
and the first factor it mnust recognize i determining the operating cost is certainly the
question of the wage 'rates to which the railway employees are entitled.
With theïse resnarks, I close zny anewer to
the honourable gentleman. When he aïsks tihe
governm'ent to announce a policy that will
make for the stability of freight rates, he
raises a most inomnltous problem. I understand that utle Railway Commission bas given
93 sittings te, date to the bearing of parties,
from the Atlantic to the Pacifie, who are
interested in the fixing and harmonizing of
freight mites. 1 hope çbhat a fair conclusion
will 'be reached; but ail I can tell the honourable gentleman is that we mnust depend i4pon
the wisdom of Parlisinent and the wisdom of
the Railway Conunison..

CANADA GRAIN BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of Bill 235, an Act to amend the
Canada Grain Act.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I was going to suggest
to the honourable gentleman that he should
treat this Bill in the same way as the three
we have just dealt with. It will expedite
business, I think.
Hon. Iý[r. DANDURAND:
I have no objection to sending this Bill to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce if my honourable
friend thinks that some light can be shed
upon it there. I draw the honourable gentleman's attention ta the fact that this Bill was
before the Committee on Banking and Commerce, I think, last session, and that it received careful study and was returned to this
Chamber after al. the parties interested in it
had been heard.
There are two clauses to this Bill. The first
one is not contentious. Clause 2 secins to be
the contentious one--at least it was last session-and we all know what it purports to do.
The whole trouble comes from the fact that
in 1924 Parliament altered the Canada Grain
Act and took away from the farmer of the
West a right which ha had possessed in virtue
of that Act. Prior to that time the farmer
of the West could route his grain to any
terminal if he so desired. The phrase in the
Act was "if either sa desires." This apparently
put the farmer and the owner of the country
elevator on an equal footing. Of course the
question remained open as to who should have
the first say in the matter. My interpretation
of the Act of 1912 is that the farmer, in
bringing his grain to the elevator, could make
his choice, and state that he was bringing it
in with the intention of having it sent to a
certain elevator. Having done that, he had
made his election, and I beiieve, in common
with many legal luminaries, that that gave
him an absolute right to control the routing
of his grain. It was said, however: "Well,
it is ail a question of who speaks first and
expresses his desire."
The fariner who had
the grain in his possession and who brought
it to the couniry- el evator on the prairie unH1< Ir. DANDURAND.
n.

doubtedly was the one who could speak first
and express his desire, and then hand over the
grain to the elevator on condition that his
wish shoulid be followed. Because ho was deprived oif that privilege in 1924, he appeared
before Parliament last year, and comes before
us again this year. Now, of course, he goes
one step further, and clarifies the position in
his own favour. It may be claiimed that his
right in 1912 was a limited one, but there
is no question that in 1912 he had a right.
of whic h was deprived by the legislation
of 1924. It was his deprivation of that right
in 1924 which'eaused him to say, "We want
that right restored." The advice of the Royal
Commission, w'hich was presided over by Mr.
Justice Turgeon, bas been carried out in this
Bill, as far as my recollection goes. I see
that the honourable gentleman who had
charge of this Bill last year (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) says that I am on orthodox ground
as to facts.
The principle involved in this Bill is based
simply on the question I have now outlined,
and I suggest to my honourable friend that
we discuss the principle and decide here and
now upon it. That is all that there is in it.
If we reopen the discussion in Committee,
I doubt if we can get any more light than
we now have, and if we cannot get more light
we are now ready to express an opinion upon
the principle contained in the Bill, which says:
"(2) Sucli receipt shall also state upon its
face that the grain mentionad therein has been
received into store, and that upon the return
of such receipt. and upon paymient or tender
of pa.nient of all lawful charges for reeiving,
storing, insuring. delivering or otherwise
handling such grain, which moay accrue up to

the timie of the return of the receipt, the grain
is dieliverable to the person on w'hose account

it lias been taken into store, or ta lis order,

fron the country elevator where it was received
for storage, or, if he so desires, in quantities
not less: than earload lots, on track at any
terminal elevator in the Western Inspection
Division or at a proper terminal elevator at or
adjacent to Duluth, so soon as the transportation company delivers the saine at such terminal,
and the certificate of grade and weight is
returni.'
The principal new words are, "if he so desires." The whole discussion therefore hinges
upon the question whether this Chamber bas
made up its mind that it absolutely understands what is the problem. In 1924 the
pendulum swung to the owner of the country
elevator, and he was left to decide as to
the terminal to which the grain should go.
Up ta that time, as I said, the two parties
were on an equal footing. The determination
as to where th grain should go was left,
as it were, to the one who spoke first. In
1924 the country elevator owner was favoured,

APRIL 5, 192but this Bill says that the fariner who raises
the wheat, should say to what terminal it
should go; and I dlaim that this Bill brings
the parties much nearer to what the law was
from 1912 up to 1924 than does the amendment of 1924.
With these explanations, I feel that whatever we may hear, or whatever suggestions
may be made, we shall stili have before us
the question whether we shall clearly restore
to the farmner his right to route his grain
to the terminal elevator, or on the contrary,
allow the first and last word to be said by
the country elevator? That is the point of
division. On that point I amn ready to divide
the Senate at this moment, but if my honourable friend thinks that more ligbt can be
got in Committee I will follow him there.
lon, W. B. ROSS: I will accept the offer.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, last year this was a private Bill,
and it was placed in my hands hy the gentleman who brought it into the flouse of Comnmons. I ýneed hardly repeat-what has been
said more ably than I could pretensi to say
it-that the Bull got the most adequate., full
and complete consideration in. our Banking
Committee last year. Witnesses were brought
from wherever the Committee wished, and
we had the most extensive propaganda against
that Bill that I have ever seen, since I have sat
in the Senate. I think the flouse cannot
obtain any better or fuller evidence on which
to base a conclusion than they now possess.
There was a clause in the Bill of last year
to whieh the honourabIe leader of the flouse
bas not drawn to the Senate's attention. It
was a clause stating that Moose Jaw should be
a car order point. That clause was put into
the Bill durinýg its progress through the other
flouse last year, at the instance of the member for Moose Jaw who sat, in that flouse, and
it came to this flouse after having passed in
that form.
I believe there were many gentlemen in this
flouse who favoured the Bill, but thought that
that clause was objectionable, as it put, as
they thought, extra and unnecessary expense
on the raîlway companies, and 'that what waFi
aimed at by the clause might have been dons
in some other way. Some honourable gentlemen personally expressed that view to me.
I regret that I cannot concur in the view of
the honourable leader on this side of the
flouse (Hon. W. B. Ross), which I would
havebeen deiighted to do; but we cannot get
any more light. The Session of Parliament
is drawing to a close, and there is nothing to
diseups in this conneetion except whst the
3265-18J

275

honourable leader of the flouse bas said, and
that is, the principle of the Bill. Hie bas adhered to the legal view that I expressed iast
year, and I am stili of the samne opinion.
Whether that opitiion be right or wrong, it
surely is the view taken by the very representative men of the Commission that sat and
investigated this question for more than a
year, and made one of the most elaborate and
complete inquiries that we have ever had in
Canada. That Commission was headed by
Mr. Justice Turgeon, a son of -an honourable
gentleman who sits in this flouse, and other
members of the Commission were the Dean
of the Deparbment of Agriculture in the
University of Saskatchewan, a member of the
faeulty of the University of Alberta, and a
representative of the raiiway interests, Mr.
Scott; andi I think there was present most of
the time a representative of the milling interest. lIt was a most representative Commission, composed of the most expert and
independent men who have been. appo-inted
on any Commission in connection with the
grain business.
Hon. J. A. CALDER: flonourable gentlemen, I agree with what the junior member
for Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) bas
said, that we had last year a very full and
complete inquiry in reference to this Bill, and
I doubt very Rmuch if we can, by sending it
to Committee, add a great deal to wbat was
then said and done.
,
As tbe honourable leader of tbe flouse bas
pointesi out, the re-al crux of the Bull is the
question whether or not the farmner always
had the right to send bis grain to any terminal
elevator that hie chose. 1 took the ground,
according to ail the evidence we had before
our Committee, that he neyer had that right.
That is the one point that we must decide.
If the farmner always bad that right, andi if
there is any doubot about his having it now,
it should be restoresi; but ;on the other band,
if hae neyer bad that right, I say we should
be very, careful, remembering that millions of
dollars investesi in constructing country eqevators on the basis that the fariner neyer bad
that rigbt. Terminal elevators bave ialso
been constructed at the head of the Lakes
on that understanding.
My honourable friensi bas referred to the
personnel of the Commission, ansi I agree with
everytbing he has saàd; but according to my
recollection we have bad no evidence from
that Royal Commission that goes so far as
to state that they bold the view that the
fariner always bas that right to send bis grain
to an-y terminal elevator that bie chose; anS

SENATE
I do not remember any evidence given before
our Committee last year that indicated that
the Commission ever held that view.
My honourable friend has just stated the
opposite.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No, no; I do
not want to interrupt the honourable gentleman, but I have given my legal view, for what
it is worth-and it may not be worth anything. I do say, however, that this Bill as
it is brought in is the Commission's Bill, drawn
by the Chairman. As to whether the farmer
had or did not have the right before, I submit
that he had.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: I had the impression
from my honourable friend's statement that
the Commission had indicated that the farmer
had had that right.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That was my
argument, under the Act, right or wrong. It
is the Commission's Bill.
Hon. Mr. WATSON: The farmers had that
riglit, as shown in practice during all those
years.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: They never exercised
it in practice. The farmers did not own any
terminal elevators. All such elevators were
in the hands of private individuals, so there
was never any occasion to exercise what they
now consider was a right, for no means existed
by which it could be done. Until the pools
came into existence the terminal elevators
were owned by private interests and there was
no reason why any such right should be
exercised by the farmers.
But there was one class of evidence that
we did not have last year, which I consider
very important; that is, evidence from
mnembers of that Royal Commission. This
is practically the only evidence that I would
like to see brought before this House. I feel
quite certain that if Judge Turgeon cornes
here and gives his evidence on this Bill, as
to the object his Commission had in changing
the law. he will submit to our Committee a
state o.f facts and conditions very different
from those that have been presented to us.
It was pointed out to us by the Board of
Grain Commissioners last year, that an entirely
new set of conditions had arisen. Two new
ports were opened up on the west coast,
Vancouver and Prince Rupert, and the time
had come when the farmer might want to
route his grain either to the western coast
or to the head of the Lakes. As was stated
by the Board of Grain Commissioners, of
whom we had two members before us, this
Bill comes to us with the object of giving
Hon.

Mr. CALDER.

the farmer the right to route his grain either
to the Pacifie or to the head of the Lakes, and
the right to ship it to any terminal point
that he chooses.
I agree with everything that has been said
with reference to our inquiry of last year,
and, it seems to me that if we go to Committee
any evidence that we could get now would
be very confined; but I would like, if possible,
to have a statement from the Chairman of
the Royal Commission as to his views respecting the object of this legislation, and I think
that could be got by telegram. On the other
hand, I have been informed that since last
Session there have been many discussions
between the Department and the Board, the
grain trade and the pools, with reference to
what should be done. I have been told-I
do not know how true it is-that the Board
of Grain Commissioners, in order to get rid
of this situation, made a proposal to the
Department, which has been considered by
the Department; that certain amendments
to the Bill had been prepared, and that those
amendements were brought down in another
place and tabled. If it is true that since our
last Session the Board of Grain Commissioners
have gone carefully into this matter again,
con-idered it with the Minister in charge of
that Department, and that certain amendments have been suggested that will clear up
the situation, we should know about them.
We should have the members of the Board
here once more, as well as officials from the
Department, and we should understand what
the pro.posed amendments mean. If what has
been told me is true, I take it that this House
should have an opportunity of considering
the whole matter in the light of what has
been proposed.
Hdn. Mr. MURPHY: Those amendments
were suggested to the Department by whom?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: By the Board of Grain
Commissioners. Personally I think the Bill
should go to Conmittee for two purposes:

first, to get an opinion from the Royal Commission as to the object of the change they
have suggested in the law, and, secondly, to
hear members of the Board of Grain Commissioners in order to understand what their
proposals were.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: The Board was
before us last year.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes, but this has
all taken place in the meantime, so far as I
am informed. I have not seen the amendmonts, or those papers which I understand
were brought down in the other House, but

holding this Bill for the sole purpose of obtaining the views of Mr. Justice Turgeon on this
question.
As has been pointed out by the honourable
gentleman from Assiniboia (Hon. Mr. Turriff), the right or privilege in question was
exercised by the farmers for many years, and
if they were deprived of that right in 1924 it
is certainly the duty of this House to restore
it as quickly as we possibly can. After ail,
what is involved in this question? It is the
point whether or net the man who produces
the grain by the sweat of his brow has a right
to say to what terminal that grain should go.
That is the point at issue. We hear a great
deal about what are known as vested rights.
We are told that we are interfering with them.
I think that the holders of those vested rights,
that we hear so much about, are perfectly
capable of looking after themselves in the
matter of grades. They are very careful in
that respect. They are very particular, especially in dealing with pool grain, not to grade
it too high; and they are equally ianxious to
sec to it that the farmer is not credited with
too much weight. Practically every elevator
operating in Western Canada in the past
twenty or thirty years las had a surplus or
ovemge at the end of ecli year. Where did
that overage come from? Did it grow in the
elevator during the period in which the elevator was handling grain? No; it was taken from
the farmers. As to interfering with, or injuring, vested rights, I do not think we need
bother our heads very much about it. The
talk about vested rights is more or less buncombe. It does not amount to anything. The
point at issue is this, that the man who tills
the soil and produces the grain has an absolute right to dispose of that grain as he sees
fit; and as far as I am concerned, I will certainly oppose any reference of tbis Bill to
any Committee except the Committee of the
Whole House.
Hon. H. W. LAIRD: Honourable gentlemen, it is not my intention to make any remarks upon the [principle of the Bill; I prefer
to confine what I have to say to the one question of the advisability or otherwise of having
one of our Standing Committees make further inquiry into the question. Honourable
gentlemen will remember that this matter
was before the Banking and Commerce Committee last year for a number of sittings, and
the inquiry was very long and exhaustive. I
think we were ail well informed upon the
merits and demerits of the contentions of the
conflicting interests. If the situation had remained unchanged, I would be quite prepared
to say that in my opinion there would be no
necessity of referring the matter to the ComHon.

Mr'. GILLIS.

mittee again upon this occasion. However,
since the last Session of Parliament, as has
been stated by one honourable member who
preceded me, this matter has been under discussion by the interested parties, and by the
Government as well. It has been the subject
of an investigation by the Department of
Trade and Commerce, whicb is in charge of
such matters, and I understand that as a result
of that investigation by the Department a report has been brought down in the other
Chamber and certain recommendations have
been made by the Board of Grain Commissioners in regard to it. We know that the
Board of Grain Commissioners is the official
body whicb deals with the movement of grain
and the handling of the grain traffic of this
country, and I think it is safe to say that there
is no body in the country to whose opinion we
should defer more, in respect to any recommendation that is offered, possessed, as it is,
of official and practicail information upon ail
phases of the trade. In view of the f'act that
this information has been brought down specifically for the information of Parliament and
is available to this House, I contend that we
would not be justified in dealing with this
situation upon the information that we obtained last Session, entirely ignoring any further information that may bave developed in
the meantime.
A few moments ago, without any objection
whatever, we referred several Bills to a Committee for investigation and report. We took
the logical course of referring those Bills to
the Banking and Commerce Committee. Those
Bills are immediately followed by this Bill,
of far greater, far more transcendent importance than the Bills we have already referred
to Committee. Although we are advised that
there is further information available to the
Committee, it is now calmly proposed that
we deal with the matter in Committee of
the whole House, without being in possession
of the facts. As I have said, I do not propose
to deal with the merits or otherwise of this
Bill; I simply say that in fairness to this
House we should have ail the information
that is available. As to. hearing the contending parties, I do not think this would involve much time, because in the first place
we have heard their representations before;
in the second place, as I understand, both
parties to this dispute are here-although
I may say that I have not yet been favoured
with the views of either side-and the Grain
Commissioners are here, or at least one of
them is in the city, or was here a day or
two ago. So if we desire to hear these
different parties again, the information they
have to offer is available and the hearing

279

APRIL 5, 1927
would involve no delay. I contend that
honourable members of this chamber should
ha in possesion of the report which was
brought down by the Board of Grain Commissioners, which was placed before Parliament witbin the past week, bef are being called
upon to, deal wîth a measure of such importance as the Bill now undler discussion.

elsewhere, to say that we will not give the
people interested in this Bill an opportunity
of stating their case before a Committee is
not exaetly, in my opinion, the Canadian
style of dealing with legislation.

Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Honourable
gentlemen, I would like to ask my honourable
friend the leader of the Government whether
or not. this Bill was referred to any Standing
Committee in another place.

It has been
Hon. M.r. ROBERTSON:
stated here within the last fifteen minutes
that there are expressions of opinion froin the
Board of Grain. Commissoner itself. Those
were flot before us last year. 1[ suppose they
axe developments that have arisen. since that
time. Surely they ought not to be débarred
from being presented in the House or here.

I am inclined
HFon. Mr. DANDURAND:
to gnswer in the negative, but I simply state
an impression that I gather. As a matter of
fact, I looked at the record to ascertain, the
position, of the Bill, and saw that it had 'been
read the second time, and in the next
column that it had been read the third time.
There was no mýntion of the Committee
stage.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

No opposition.

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: My reason for
asking the question is simply personal curiosity, and it is of some importance now. Last
Tbursday night, on the train going to
Toronto, I happened to ask an honourable
gentleman, who does not sit in this House,
what progress was Ïbeing made ' with this
partieular legisîntion, and I am very sure that
be informed me that hy agreement with the
Minister of Trade and Commerce it had
been deferred until this week. Yesterday it
came to my notice that, in spite of that
understanding, the Bill was railroaded through
the other House on Friday night, when a
large number of members who wanted te be
pre sent when it was deait with were absent,
assum-ing that under the promise made it
would not be disposed of until this week.
If that be true, and if there was no opposition
to the Bill there, and members were absent
who wanted to have witnesses heard and ta
obtain further information, then I dechare
frankly that I am very much in favour of
giving the interested parties an opportunity
ta be heard before the Bill is finally passed
upon. If an opportunity has not been afforded
in the other House for the bringing of thia
evidence before a Standing Cominittee which
is said to exist now, I feel that that OPPortunity ought to ha given. I wilI go further
and say that it ought flot to, ha made an
excuse for delny which would retard this
Bill so that it could not ba conveiently
deait with at this Session of Parliament. But,
in view of what I believe to have happened

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Did we not
give ail that opportunity iast year? It ws
the most adequate 1 have seen..

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Did we flot have the
Grain Commissioners before us last year?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

Yes.

Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Did they not give ll
the evidence they possessed with regard to
this Bill?
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:

At that time.

Hon. Mr. GIJLLIS: Nothing bas oocurred
or been discovered since, that would justify
delaying ths matter.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I understand that there
have been new recommendations with a view
to a settiement. If we referred this Bill sgin
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce
we could sift out the suggested amendments
and perhaps get the parties together. I think
there is a good chance of doing that. That
is what inoves me.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURA:ND:
gentlemen, I do not believe that the statement of my honourable friend from Welland
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) should influence ini the
least the procedure to be followed, at this
stage of the Bill. He has heard through some
person on the train that there was an agree-.
ment not to pass this Bill in the Comnmons
before this week. Well, surely ho does not
think for a m<ment, that we would accept sueh
a statement. I amn not, challenging the fact
that he did hear some such conversation, but
ifthere is anything thst the Hueo
Gominons is very particular about, it is the
carrying out of an agreement made by the
Government writh regard to a date on whieh
a Bilh is to be taken Up.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: May 1 ask my
honourable friend a question? Would he be
good enough to inquire of the honourable

SENATE
Minister of Trade and Commerce whether or
not what I have stated is true? The Minister
of Trade and Commerce, I am informed, was
also absent on Friday, under the same
impression.
Hon. Mr. SHAIRPE: And another member
took up the Bill and put it through.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
It would be
a most extraordinary situation that a House
composed of 245 members would from Friday
evening until to-day allow such an act of
discourtesy to go unchallenged. I cannot
believe that. I cannot for one moment admit
that such a 'body of men, even if they were
unanimous on the Bill, would not protest
against such procedure, and I strongly resent
the idea that this or any other government
would stoop to such a thing. So I sweep
away the impression that may have been
created in the minds of honourable members
to this Chamber, unless I hear some authoritative voice from the other House upon this
matter.
The honourable gentleman from Saltcoats
(Hon. Mr. Calder) bas given two reasons why
this Bill should be returned to the Committee.
The first is that he would like to hear the
Royal Commission. I desire to state to my
hononrable friend that the Royal Commission
is functi officio; there is no Royal Commission; and I venture to say that none of the
gentlemen who were members of that Commission would express an opinion as to what
they meant, beyond what is stated in the
report which was laid on the table of both
Houses of Parliament, unless they were given
an opportunity to confer together before
expressing such an opinion. We have their
work before us; it was before us the whole
of hast session; and I cannot see for one
moment why a Committee of this House
should wire to the three members of that
defunet body to ask them to interpret our
present legislation.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Will the honourable
gentleman allow me? We had a similar case
in connection with pensions. We had the
pension law before us, and it will be remembered that after the Commission had been
disbanded and had ceased to exist, we brought
before the Committee the present Minister,
Mr. Ralston, and that he sat down with us
and gave evidence, and gave it very freely.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I think my
honourable friend is mistaken in making that
assertion. The Royal Commission had made
an interim report, and it was in existence for
over a year after that time before it made its
second report. I am not sure at what date
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON.

Mr. Ralston was called upon, but I am convinced that he was still exercising bis funetions as a Royal Commissioner. My honourable friend surely does not expect Parliament
to await the coming of those three Commissioners. Where they are, I do not know.
It would be some time before we could get
their opinion. This is a matter which we can
judge for ourselves. We received sufficient
light upon this question during the last month
of the last Parliament to enable us to come
to a conclusion.
My honourable friend says he would like
to investigate the rumour that there have been
negotiations. Well, that has not prevented
the Minister of Trade and Commerce from
bringing bis Bill into the House of Commons.
He explained the Bill and proposed it to the
House, and it received its three readings
unanimously, and now it is before us. This
is a matter which engrossed the attention of
members in both branches of Parliament last
session. My honourable friend wants to know
what are the negotiations that are going on.
They have been thrust aside; legislation has
been introduced, because apparently there was
no other solution than the one contained in
this bill. Shall we take it upon ourselves to
go into those negotiations, and to bring any
parties who have any ideas on the matter
before us? They can communicate their ideas
to the members of this Chamber. Surely, honourable gentlemen, we will not go into the
Committee to hear parties who are supposed
to be still here, lingering around the lobby.
We have had all that information, and it is
time for us to act.
My honourable friend from Saltcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) says that the farmers of the West
never had the right to route their grain to a
terminal elevator. I will read clause 159 of
the Act of 1912. and will leave it to every
honourable member of this Chamber to decide for himself what right they had under
that clause. Honourable gentlemen will see
that it is for us to declare whether the farmer
had the right under clause 159, and whether
it shalll be restored by this Bil., or whether
we will stand by the amendment of 1924,
which gave that right exclusively to the
elevator man.
Clause 159 says:
Such receipt shall also state upon its face
thjat the grain mentioned therein has been
received into store. and that upon the return
of sucli receipt and upon payment or tender
of all lawful charges for receiving, storing,
insuring, delivering. or otherwise handling such
grain, which may accrue up to the time of the
return of the receipt, the grain is deliverable

APRIL 5, 1927
to the person on whose account it has been
taken into store, or te bis order, fromn the
country elevator where it was received for
storage,My honourable friend from SaItcoats (Hon.
Mr. Calder) has said that a farmer can transf ormi that country ellevator into a warehousethat hie can bring bis grain there, obtain a
certificate of quantity and quadity, and thereafter, upon paying the charges, receive back
the very same article, both as to quantity
and quality. But something else can take
place under clause 159. This is what follows:
-or, if either party se desires-I draw attention to those words.
-if eîther party se desires, in quantities not
less than carload lots, on track at any terminal
elevator ini the Western Inspection Division,Not at any terminal point.
-at any terminal etevator in the Western
Inspection Division, on the line of railway upon
which the receiving country elevator is situate,
or any line connecting therewith, se soon as the
transportation cempany delivers the samne at
such terminal, and the certificate of grade and
weight is returned.
So the grain is délivered to the person on
wbose account it bas been taken into store,
or upon bis order from the country elevator
where it lias been received inte steorage, or,
"if either party se desires, in quantities net
less than carload lots, on track at any terminal
elevater in the Western Inspection Divisien."
Hon. Mr. MdLEAN: Would the bonourable gentleman answer this question? Dees
the receipt from the elevator in which tihe
fermer puts the grain guarantee the delivery
of that grain at tbe terminal without any
bass?
The receipt
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
states tbe quantity and quality, and that is
what must be delivered. So, in virtue of
clause 159 of the Grain Act of 1912, the farmer
wbo puts bis grain into the county elevator
could receive it back on the spot in order te'
sbip it himseilf if bie pleased, quantity and
quality being the samie.
I recegnize thbat the clause iLanet an easy
one te apply; but delîvery may be ordered,
"if either party se desires, in quantities net
less than carload lots, on track at any terminai elevator in the Western Inspection
Division." Be, as I said in opening, thbe questien is as te the interpretation of the words
"if either party se desires." It has been said
that a fair interpretiatien means that the
first one to express a desire should have the
advantage of bis election.
Hon. Mr. McLEAN: I do net think the
honourable gentleman understands my question exactly. What I mean is this. When
the farmer takes bis grain te the elevatoi

281

and gets a receipt for so many bushels from
the elevator man, that is ail hie can demand.
When hie ships it out-say it is 10,000 bushels
-does that carry him through, or is hie hiable
for any loss that takes place on the way?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There is no
provision in the Act allowing a certain charge
for sbrinkage. But the point that concerns us
Ls the right of 'the farmer to say, when depositing lis grain in a country elevator, to
what terminal elevator hie wants to send it.
I claim, along with the honourable gentleman
from Moose Jatw (Hon. Mr. Willoughby), who
fathered the Bill last year, that the farmer
had a joint right with the country elevater
to direct bis grain. By the words "if either
party so desires," they are both placed on an
equal footing. It is a question as te who bas
the precedence. As I said a moment ago, it
has been suggested that the one w'ho first
expressed a desire had the advantage. That
being se, the fariner or the owner of the
grain, could bring it to the elevator and say,
" I want it to be sent te sucli and such a
terminal elevator," and I challenge any representative of the legal profession in this Chamber to attem.pt to disprove that interpretation. The Bill simply restores to the fariner
the rîght which hie had in 1912-mn common
with the elevator man, if you wîll-a right
of which hie was deprived by the legisiation
of 1924.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: And wbich. he
neyer waived.
HoFn. Mr. DANDURAND: And which hie
neyer waived. He 'waived it ail the less, in
that hie had a riglit to expect that Parliament
would follow the opinion and the direction
of the Royal Commission. If I am not mistaken, the Bill introduced in the Bouse of,
Commons in 1924 contained such a provision,
and I think it was changed by a Committee.
I stand subj ect te correction.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I think that is
correct.
I think that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the Bill as introduced in the Commons f ollowed the direction of the Royal Commislarger extent, if you
sion and retored, to &a
wilI, the right of the fariner to direct his
grain to any terminal elevator.
IJnder the circumstances, I cannot understand why we should be asked to send the
Bill to Committee; but if my honourable
friend opposite insists that it should go to
Committee, I will not divide the Bouse upon
that question.
Trhe motion for the second reading was
agreed te.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE ON
BANKING AND COMMERCE
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Does my honourable friend insist that the Bill go to Committee?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I would like it to go
to Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Will it be understood that we will give only one sitting or
one day to the Bill?
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think one day would
be suflicient; probably less would do.
Hon, Mr. DANDURAND: Well, with that
understanding, I move that the Bill be referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: I object very strongly
to this Bill being referred to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce. I have already
stated the reasons for the position I take.
Those who vote to send the Bill to this Committee want to kill it. I do not think any
good will come of it. Any changes in the
Bill nay destroy it, and I feel very strongly
that instead of referring it to a Standing
Committee, we should deal with it in Committee of the Whole.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The motion before the House is that the Bill be referred to
the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried!

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is not carried.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It has been put,

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I dislike very
much imposing my will on the majority of this
Chamber, and I believe that my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. W. B. Ross) feels as
I do.
I am ready and wlfling to allow the
mem'bers of this Chamber to divide on this
question, if they so desire.
I would not
like it to be said that the two Leaders, by
agreeing, were able to carry out their will in
opposition to the will of the majority of the
Chamber.
Hon. Mr. POPE:

We will not let you.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
divide the House?

Well, shall we

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: I
think the position taken by my honourable
friend opposite (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) is a
very reasonable one.
I have just one point
to urge.
I think that when there is a contentions Bill before the Senate an opportunity
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

should be given to the contanding sides tobe

heard.

Such procedure does not diminish the

strength of the Senate; it eventually adds to
it.
I think that to allow a reasonable time
for the various contentions to be placed before it make.s for the innate strength of the
Senate, and I hope the Senate will hold to that

idea.

Furthermore, such action appeals to

the spirit of fair play of outsiders.
We have
time enough at our disposal to devote a day
to this Bill in Committee.
Why should we
not do so?
I speak with some knowledige of this matter,
having been connected with the Department of
Trade and Commerce for a number of years.
The questions that arise in that western
territory with regard to grain handling are
very complex.
As my honourable friend
knows, when we went into Committee on this
Bill last year a great deal of explanation was
required, and we all discovered that we were
not perfect masters of the situation.
During
my administration of the Department I relied
very largely upon my Commissioners-three
men appointed because of their excellence
and experienca and capacity.
They were in
the North West, and had to do with the grain
business and grain handling and grain producers year after year. It was their business.
They came to know the business thoroughly,
and I relied upon their opinions to a very
great extent.
I understand that in this case
the Commisioners have had the matter before
them again this year, and they have recommended a method that ean be practically
carried out, and one that is eminently fair to
all branches of production.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: How does the
honourable gentleman know of that? I have
never heard of it, and I introduced the Bill
last year.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
But if my honourable friend has not heard of
it, there is information ahead of him, and he
ought not to be opposed to going into the

place where that information can be brought
out. I myself have read it, if my honourable
friend has not; and I am sure that there is a
sentiment that this House would like , to
inform itself as to what those experts, whose
business it is to look into that matter, have
unanimously decided, and have ,recommended
in the way of legislation which they say will
be eminently fair to all sides, and which can
be practically carried out.
I would like that we should come together
where we could talk to each other across a
table, and not in formal debate-in an open
forum where the whole question could be

APRIL 5, 1927
examined, and where we inight rely on the
opinions of experte whose duty it has been for
many long years ta study this whole problean,
and who have had largely in their own hands
the direction of western grain handling. I juet
put these twa points. For myseif I would
like ta see whether that method could nlot be
adopted in reference ta the Bill that bas been
brought up.
There are variaus rumorîs afloat as ta what
occurred i another place. I do not know
whether those rumors are truc or not, but we
are told that the legislation went Vhrough very
rapidly, and I understand it was actually
passed in the absence of the responsible
Minister himself. If that be truc, and if the
House had no intimation of a decision which
had been reaohed by the three Commissioners,
I think there is very good ground for us to go
cautiously, and give themn a chance te be
heard.
There is much said in regard ta this Senate
being autocratic, and ail that. We have removed ta a great extent that outside impression by the very ample liberty we have
given ta people on bath sides of these contentious Bills ta corne bedore us and miake
It will not hurt us ta
their arguments.
do that in this case, and I think it will
strengthen us, and we n'eed all the strength
we can get.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, -as I have suggested that the members of the Senate should be free ta express
their views on the procedure ta be followed,
either ta send the Bill out ta a Committee
or leave it here, I suggest that rny honourable
friend facing me (Hon. W. B. Ross) and myself should abstain fromn vating.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Daandurand ta refer
the Bill ta the Committee on Banking and
Commerce was agreed ta on the following
division: yeas, 34; nays, 20.
GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES COMPENSATION BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANT>URAND moved the second
reading of Bill 227: An Act te amend an
Act ta provide compensation where employes
of Hie Msjesty are killed or suifer injuries
while ,pefarming their duties.
He said: Honourable' gentlemen, the Statutes of 1918, chapter 15, as amended, apply ta
Goverument e>mployees in Provinces where
there are Workmen's Compensation Acts
applying generally, and the Government pays
from time to time ta the Workmen'a Compen-

satian Boards of these Provinces, where Provincial Boarcb exist, moneys from the Consolidated Revenue Fund ta be paid out by
the Boards to meet awards mnade by them
reepecting accidents ta Governiment exnployees.
In the Province of Quebec, where there is
no Warkmen's Com4pensation Bosrd, but
where the Court determines compensation
under the Workmen's Compensation Act of
the Province, the Governmen't directly meets
the judigments of the Court from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
Under the proposed legisiation to provide
for workmen's compensation ta Government
employees in Prince Edward Isl>and, the
Government may either appoint a Judge of
the Court, without remuneration, or a Board,
officers, or other authority, with or without
remuneration as nray be f ound advisable, ta
deteemine the compensation, and will arrange
ta meet the ,payments of compensation out
of moneys f-rora the Consolidated Revenue
Fund direct f rom the Government or through
the determining body, as may be f ound advisable.
The proposed section 4 of the Bill, subsection 4, provides for the moneys ta aneet the
payments of compensation and Vhe remuneratien and expenses, if any, of týhe dejtermining
body, and subsection 5 provides for the ms>kling
of any regulations that may be f ound necessary ta give eifect ta the method of liayments
of compensation, etc., ta carry out the purposes of the Act.
1 think this explanation meets the inguiries
made by the honourable gentleman from
Colchester (Hon. Mr. Stanfield) on some of
thp feqtures of this Bill.
I move the second reading of the Bull.
The motion was agreed ta, and the Bill
was read the second time.

CANADA GRAIN BILL
CONSIDEJIATION IN COMMITTEEL

On the Orders cf the Day:
Hon. A. B. GILLIS:
Honourable gentlemen, before the Orders cf the Day are proceeded with, I weuld like te make a statement. There is a persistent rumer current

that Parliament rnay prorugue by the end cf
the week, probably on Saturday. The Grain
Bill is before the Committee on Banking and

Commerce, and there are a number cf other

important Bills aIse bef ore that Cemmittee. In
the event of prorogation taking place on
Saturday next, there is cornparatively little
time lef t for the Committee te deal withi
those measures, and there is a possibility that
they may faîl by the way. The Grain Bill
is a really important piece cf legislation. It
is a Covernment measitre, and the Governmient is naturally responsible for its fate. If
the henourable leader cf the flouse will rally
his forces and have them on deck at the opportune time, there is ne question that we

on this side cf the flouse have a sufficient
force te enable him te carry the Bill as it

came to this Chamber from the flouse of
Commons. I weuld like, therefore, te have
some assurance fromn the honourahle leader

cf the Heuse that this Bill will be gix en precedence before the Commîttee on Banking
and Commerce when that Committee mpets.

Hýon. Mr. DANI)URAND:

I arn not in a

position te state ihat the Cemmittea would
follow my advice with regard -te the list cf

APRIL 6, 1927
Bis before it, or in what order they would
be taken up. However, I amn authorized to
informn my honotnable friend that the Grain
Bill-and perhaps I may say the same of
other Goverument Bis that have been sent
to the Committee-will be returned ýto this
Chamber and deait with before prorogation
takes place.

Hon. Mr. McMEANS moved the third

He said: Honourable gentlemen, this Bill
is merely to enable one ai the small railway
companies in Manitoba ta take over a spur
oi the Manitoba Great Northcrn. Two or
three spur lines were built into Manitoba.
In one -case I think the rails have been taken
up altogether, or the C.P.R. has taken over
the spur, and the other spur lines are operated
by -two different companies. It is proposed
toallow one af the campanies ta take over the
other spur hine, sa that they ail can he
operated by ana company. I believa the Bill
has passed the House ai Coimmons, and the
seeme ta ha no abjection ta it.
The motion was agraed ta, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER
maved the second reading af Bfi 153, an Act

mittee there. As with most Bills, there were
two sides with reference to the principle of
the Bill, and the two enactrments which it
contains.
Both sides were heard very
thoroughly, and the Committee passed the
Bill unanimously, and sent it to the Commons.
It came up for passage on the regular order,
was debated shortly and was passed without
a dissentient vote. Through that order of
procedure it has come to this House.
There is no demand from either party, for
or against this Bill, to be heard in Committee
of the Senate, and I should think, taking into
consideration the manner in which it has been
dealt with in the other House, that the Senate
might take the Bill upon its merits and pass
it.

THE IMPERIAL CONFERENCE,
INQUIRY

AND

1920

DISCUSSION

Hon. W. A. GRIESBACH rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of the Senate
to the Report of the Imperial Conference, 1926,
and will enquire of the Government in what
directions and to what extent it proposes to
act upon the same.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I had
scarcely foreseen, when I gave my notice last
week, that this very important question would
be disposed of so shortly in another place,
and that the Government of the day would
have turned a political somersault unequalled
in the history of our country.
The Report of the Imperial Conference
which deals with the matter of status is subject
to certain pre-natal influences. They are,
briefly, as follows: The revolt in Ireland,
carried on for the purpose of separation from
the Empire; the agitation of the Nationaliste
in South Africa, with much the same end in
view; and the so-called constitutional question
here in Canada, which the Prime Minister of
this country threw into the political arena,
upon which he conducted hie campaign, and
by which he got a great many votes, and attracted te himself and his party, in the course
of the election, all the separatist influences in
Canada. So well did he conduct hie campaign
that when he arrived in England to attend the
Imperial Conference, the reporters, with one
accord, asked him but one question: whether
or not he was in favour of annexation to the
United Stater
Now, I turn tc the Report of the Committee presided over by Lord Balfour, which
is a subject of great interest. The clause
around which the greater part of the discussion has taken place is that clause which sets
out the statue of the various parts of the
Empire, and which is as follows:
There is, however, one most important element in it which, from a strictly constitutional
point of view, has now, as regards all vital matters, reached its full development-we refer to
the group of self-governing communities composed of Great Britain and the Dominions.
Their position and mutual relation may be
readily defined. They are autonomous Communities within the British Empire, equal in
status, in no way subordinate one to another in

287

any aspect of their domestic or external affairs,
though united by a common allegiance to the
Crown, and freely associated as members of
the British Commonwealth of Nations.
It will be obvious at once, having regard to
what I said a moment ago as to the pre-natal
influences, that this particular part of the
Report is a compromise. It represents, first,
the desire of the British Government to write,
through Lord Balfour, something which would
be pleasing and eatisfactory te the Separatists,
since they, and they alone, were asking for
changes; and on the other hand, the desire
of the British Government te write something which would be acceptable te Australia
and New Zealand.
Now, those who favour separation from the
British Empire are strong for formula, or
formulae. They believe that when they can
secure a formula they have gained ground and
consolidated it.
On the other hand, the
pro-Empire men have little or no regard for
formula. They on their part know that the
real constitution, the real tie which binds this
Empire together, existe in the hearts and minds
of the people of this Empire, and net elsewhere.
Now, when IMr. King returned to this
country-indeed, before he returned-he conveyed to the waiting world, and to this country
in particular, the idea that something tremen,doue had taken place.
He referred to this
Report suggesting that it was equal in importance to the Magna Charta and those other
great documents upon which the freedom of
our people is founded; and he further conveyed to the minds of the people of this
country, and the woxld in general, and particularly to the Americans to the south of us, that
this new charter of liberty had been wrenched
from a tyrannical and unwiling Mother
Country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Where does my
honourable friend find a citation te justify
that statement?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH; I say that is the
inference to be gathered from hie remarksan inference which will be found set out in
plain terme in such a periodical as the
Literary Digest.
And here in Canada the
welkin resoundedHon. Mr. BEIQUE: May I ask the honcurable gentleman if he intends te read to
this House any writing from which he draws
his inference?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I could net take
up the time of the House. If the honourable gentleman will consult the Literary Digest
of the period of November, December, and

SENATE
January, if he wiil read some of the ieadiug
Neif York newspapers, he will satisfy hiqnself,
I think, that, based en the assertions of Mr.
King, some tremendous dhange 'las taken place
and that from now on we are to lie a different
sort of country, with a larger freedom, a wider
horizon, a newer humanity, and so on, and
so f orth-largely expressions gathered from
Mr. King himself.
Now, I say that here in Canada the whole
country resounded with the hosannas of the
separatists and their press; but those of us

who muay describe ourseives as pro-Empire
were in nowise disturbed by wliat we heard,
in fact, we were inclined to be somewhat
happy in the happiness of the separatists
tliemselves.
This Conference commenced on the l9th

of October last and continued until the 23rd.
Then on the lOth of December last year we
had these words, which are to lie found in
tlie Speech fromn the Throne:
'Memabers of my Government have just returned to Canada from attending the meetings
of the Imperial Conference. The Report of the
proccedings of the Conference, together with
its recommendations, will he placed hefore you
for consideration.
Then in the speech made by the right
honourable Prime Minister on the l3tli of
Dccember, page 47 of Ilansard, we find these
words:

J niay say to miy honourable friend that the

Govcrnment intends to put the Report hefore
this House just as it appears, and to recornmend
its adoption.

We 'are now approaching tlie end of thE
session. and there is no doubt in the mind of
anybody that the Government lias flot the
faintest intention of asking this Parliament
to adopt the Report, and that it has no
intention of implementing the Report by
legisiation. So, wc ask ourselves: " What lias
become of this very important subject, involving these important changes? What hai
becorne of tlie resounding deciarations tliat
were made in November and December by
tlie Prime Minister of this Country, and by
tlie press and ail those wlio supported him in
lis efforts?"
Now, I have read a section of the Report,
and I will read again that part whicli is particularly germane to this discussion.
They are autonomous Communities ivithin the
British Empire, equal in status, inn way

I say, of our Federai Government. And the
power to amend that constitution resides in
the Imperial Parliament in London, as it

always lias. My point is this. So long as
Canada, in order to amend its constitution

untrue, and therefore inapplicable. llow can
it be said that we are "equal in statua, in
no way subordinate one to another in any
aspect of domestie or external aif airs," if we
have to go to the Imperial Parliament for
an ameodment to our constitution?
I think it may be asserted that there is no
difficulty at ahl in the way of our necuring
this rigbt to amend our constitution. It lias
been stated again and again that we may have
practically anything we ask for; and it may
be assumed indeed, the terms of this clause
of the report suggest it unmistakeably-that
a simple resolution from the Parliament of
Canada asking for the surrender of this power
on the part of the Imperial Parliament, and
the assumption of the amending power on
the part of the Canadian Parliament, is al
that is necessary, and that then, so to speak,
the trick is done. And wliat the people of
this country expected the Government to do
in presenting this Report for adoption was,
that tliey would follow the adoption of that

Report by the introduction of appropriate
legislation to bring about, in full rneasure,
the independence wbicli would make this
document true and applica;ble.
Why lias that not been done? Well, it lias
not heen done for a comparatively simple
i'eason. It lias not been done because the
Province of Quebec objecta. I shahl support
tliat assertion by reading briefly fromn a statement made by the Prime Minister of Quebec
on the l4th of January, and carried in the
pres,- of that day.

from ail the empires that have preceded it
in history.
There is net te be found in
history any empire such as ours. We are a

and a eernmon sovereign.

We have our

Mr. Mackenzie King said, about two years
ago, that Canada in the future weuld net
participate in an Empire war unless Canada
were interested, and then cnly te the extent
te which we wçre interested. That is Empire
on the basis of limited liahility; limited
liability with respect te Canada, but liability
unlimited with respect te Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand.
Now, that is a wholly impossible situation.
It is impossible militarily, and it is impossible
in international law. It is destructive of empire, and it suggests te hostile diplomacy the
means whereby the several parts of thîs empire may be destroyed piecemeai. It is destructive of mutual confidence, and it is, in

particular, repugnant te the sense of generesity of our people.

and our hopes for success is in exact proportion to the length of the period of world

world peace to this Empire and to ail of

The first Imperial Conference was held in
1887, and the last is the twelfth. Reading
ever the reports of these conferences, one
becomes impressed with the fact that in ail
of them the most important que stion was that
of defence. It has aiways occupied an extremely important position. The a-rmed. forces
of this country have three main tasks before
them: firstly, to maîntain order within our

Imperial Conferences we have agreed again
and again to undertake our own defence, and
we stili remain in. default. Upon the question
of the nîutual defurice cf tht- empire we have
remnained discreetly sulent. I attach ne great
importance te this, because 1 have before my
eyes our record in the late war, when the
people of this country rose up and swept aside
the politicians with their timidity, thýeir deiays
and their opposition, and with a surer instinct
confronted the emergency as t-hey saw it.
Only under two Ministers of the Government of Canada have we made any substantial

Australia on defence. 1 have tbem tabulated

Premier Bruce says, in explanation of those
figures:
1 put those figures in because I think they
are of some interest, but the only point I would
make is that this is a question in which we are
all vitally interested, and I think we are all
under an obligation to make the best efforts we
can to bear our respective shares, particularly
as we have secured for ourselves in the Empire
a position of equality of status. I suggest that
an equality of status carries with it some
responsibility to share the common burden of
defence, as a set-off against the great advantages we have received in recent years from
our connection with the Empire.
Now, running through that report there are

two thoughts to whieh I desire to direct the
attention of the House. The first thought, to be
found in the New Zealand report as well as the
Australian, is that those people have no conception of Empire on the basis of limited

which is more than apparent, is that the
Australian navy, in its present size and
eticiency, occupies a position on the flank of

a potential enemy of this country, and to that
extent the Australian navy now participates
in the defence of Canada.

The Australian army and air force, in its
present state of efficiency and equipment, is a
threat to any potential disturber of world
peace, and to that extent the Australian army
and air force contribute to the defence of
Canada. The navy I have discused. The
Australian navy may exercise pressure for the
defence of Canada without a single Austialian
ship ever entering Canadian waters, and honourable gentlemen will see that the army is

I have for years suggested that we might
well have a joint Committee of the two
Houses who would diseuss and consider the
whola question of defence. Adam Smith said,
Surely
"Defence is greater than opulence."

ncwspapers from which I am gaing ta read
are ta be found in all parts of Canada. First
I will take an editorial from the Edmonton
Bulletin of November 24, 192; I will read
only a part of it:
It also means that the Dominions will have
ta take a more candid attitude on the question
of dafending themselves than thay have hitharto
done. In the past, while we have resented the
suggestion of "colonials" we have lef t it ta the
British tax-payer to stand the cost of proteeting aur coasts and maritime interests, ta maintain the oniy standing army in the Empire, and
ta bear the major part of the cost of developing air defence forces.
Thei e will have ta be a change in that
respect. Britain as the wealthiest partuer in
the enterprise will continue ta bear the heavy
end of the cost, undaubtedly. But the Dominions can no longer pose as colonials when the
question of defence cames up, and the question
of paving for it.
We nîay as well understand at the outset
that Canada, and each of the other self-governing Dominions, will have ta undertake ta
provide its own defences at sea, in the air and
on land, or will have ta contribute ite propartianate share ta a common fond ta maintain
thase defences or such of thea as may not ha
undertaken locally. In either case it amounts
ta the same thing. We shaîl have ta go down
into aur pockets for the price of aur national
security.
Then, on the 22nd December the Bulletin
stated:
The consideration of Imperial defence is the
next logical step in the evolution of the Empire
organization. It will necessarily ha a matter
in which all the îDominions will ha expactad,
and will expect, te take a part. since they have
assumad ahl that goas with equality of political
statue. And toward that common purposa
thara is now no excuse for any Dominion ta
refuse or neglect to contribute its proportionata
share.
The Dominions have not stepped out of the
Empire. They have stepped into fuoh membership, and alh th4t implies.
Here is an editorial from the Calgary
Ai'bertan, W'hich is of special importance. It
discusses resolutions offered hy the Farmers'
Convention deprecating military expenditure,
and in part it says:

terms. The Toronto Globe, in its issue of
November 24th last, devotes an editorial to
the subject, and concludes wit)h these words:
The decisions arrived at by the Conference
have, of course, to receive the sanction of the
various Dominion Parliaments, and when they
are brought up for discussion at Ottawa they
shouldl be the subject of serious debate.
This is with reference to mutual defence.
Now, it is to be observed in reading these
editorials that running through them all there
are two ideas-self-respect and self-interest.
We are a trading nation; the life-blood of
the country flows through the channels of
trade, and as we increase our commercial interests and our trade and commerce, so we
multiply those contacts with the outside
world which so frequently lead to war. Our
people are beginning to understand that we
must play a larger part in the world than we
are playing, and that self-respect demands
that we shall cease to depend on others.
Politicians in Canada have for many years
run away from the question of defence as
though it were a plague. That is creditable
neither to their courage nor their professions
of statesmanship. Defence in all ages has been
the main preoccupation of statesmen.
Hon. Mr.- HUGHES: But the nations are
growing wiser now.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: There is no evidence that we are getting wiser. The nations
of the wîorld were as wise 2,000 years ago as
they are to-day.
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON:

They

Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: They may have
been as foolish. but the finest philosophy,· the
finest poetry, and the greatest thoughts were
given us 2,000 years ago. There is not the
slightest doubt that we do not grow wiser as
we grow older. We are a badly spoiled people.
We occupy a certain geographical position
which appears to give us immunity.
We
have grown up under the shadow of a great
Empire, and we have never really felt insecurity. From the future which I outlined
some time ago, the participation in this
development of the Empire, the tasks that
are to be performed, we cannot escape even
if we would. Our position and our history
force it on us.
The blood of two virile
na-tions courses in our veins, and ensures to
us courage, energy and high purpose.
The
need of the prcsent hour is leadership worthy
of our country and worthy of the future that
is before us.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH.

I believe in the British Empire; I believe
in Canada. I believe that the British Empire
is the best league of nations. I believe in
the lionesty and humanity and wisdom of
the leaders and people of the Empire. I
believe that Canada's highest and best destiny
is to be found within the British Empire, and
that the ties which bind us together should
be strengthened, and not weakened. I believe that the peace and happiness of the
world rest largely in our hands.
'Speaking in South Africa, as reported in the
London Times of the 16th of December last,
that great statesman and gallant soldier,
General Jan Christian Smuts, spoke the
following words:
It may be that the status will be exploited
for party purposes in South Africa, but the
truth is that the status has been won, not by
words of statesmen but by the deeds of their
soldiers, who lie in thousands on the battle
fields of the world. If to-day we in South
Africa are all agreed on the constitutional
question, let us raise our beads in proud gratitude to the men who gave their lives for this
status.
Strange to say, in another part of the world,
and from the lips of quite a different sort of
man, the Hon. Robert Forke, fell the following words, as repôrted in Hansard of the
House of Commons of June 9, 1924, page

2953:
But that is not the reason, I say, why we
have attained our present position. Canada bas
attained the position she occupies to-day througb
the gallantry of lier sons on the field of Belgium
cand
France and througlh the large sacrifiees which Canada has made.
Ten years ago this very day Canada's incomparable army moved up through the communication trenches to the assault at Vimy
Ridge. Ten years ago next Saturday, Canada
stood triumiphant on the eastern slopes of
Vimy Ridge and looked down on the cities
of the plain. Four hundred thousand Canadians fought in France, and there sixty
thousand of them sleep their last sleep. In
one sense it may be said that they fought for
France; in another sense it may be said ·that
they fought for Canada; but who will deny
that in the larger sense they fought for this
conception of Empire?
These men, their
friends and their relatives are a majority in
Canada, if not in quantity, at least in quality.
They are the very cream of the population of
this country. The thought I desire to emphasize-and with it I will conclude-is, that
in this discussion of the constitutional status
of this country there is a point beyond which
tinkering politicians and separatist manoeuvrers may go, only at their periýl.

APRIL 6, 1927
Hon. JOHN *LEWIS: Honourable gentlemen, 1 intend to effer a fe W remarks upon
the Ixnpeiial Conference, baeed in the main
upon the officiai report whiich we have before
US.
To begin wit.h, tihe Im-periel Coniference was
net caled because of any demand f rom the
Government of Canada. Our representatives
attended it in response to -an invitation from.
When it wasthe British *Governmeut.
suggested that iV xnight not be convenient for
Vhemn to attend, public opinion expresed itseif
strongly te the eff ct that iV wus their duty
to go, and their refusai to do so would, have
been interpreted as an act of discourtesy, and
as dispiaying an indifference towards conimon
British aima.
Now, wlvat was the spirit in which our
representaitive undertook the duty lad upon
them. In a apeech made at Quebec, on bis
way to the Coniference, the Primfe Minister
said that the represenitatives of Canada were
going to the Conference in a spirit of goodivill toward Britain and the other Dominions;
that they had not la single grievanice; that
they had no demande to put f orward.,but were
prepared to coôperate with others in tihe spirit
which they believed would be common to ail.
That was the Canjadian view.
What was the view of the Government of
Great Britan? As the Canadian represenîtaives did net raise the question of statue, who
did raise k't? Th>se who have nlOt .read the
Officiai Report, niay be surprised to learn that
it was first raised by the Prime Minieter of
Great Britain. I quote fro'm the speech made
hy Mr. Balwin at the opening of the
Oon-ference on October 19th, 1926. He aaid:
1 have referred to the constîtutional developmente during the past forty years and Vo the
corresponding growth of the importance of the
matters which have corne before successive
conferences. This growth le the outcome of the
very conspicunus and far-reaching change whieh
bas taken place during that time in the
relations between the component parts of the
Empire. Coupled with a continuous process of
extension of self-government and development
of national consciousness there bas been a
continuous necesuity for adapting the relations
to the altered state of affairs. It is in guiding
this growth and in assisting this adaptation
that, above ail, the value of successive and
increasingiy frequent conferences has lain.
Without them it is*hardly conceivabie that the
changes of the past forty Years, se f ar from
weakening the ties which bind the Empire
together, should have contributed that fundamental unîty and strength which displayed itself
te the amazement and admiration of the worid
during the four years of the war-a war of
Nrhose sacrifices we have heen reminded by
the solemn cerernony which we attended te-

295

gether this morning. Without them At is hardly
conceivable even that changes could have been
effected, as from time, to time they become
necessary, with so littie inconvenience.
We have hiere a remarkahle situation. Instead of Canada making demande, and the
British Government resisting, or reluctantly
consenting, you have a diametrically opposite
situation, a very satisfactory situation for ai
who desire friendly relations between the
various constituents of the British commonwealth. You have the Canadian Prime Minister saying, "We have no grievanees, we
make no demands." Then on the other side,
you have the Prime Minister of Great Britain,
on bis own initiative, raising the question of
statue and emphasizing the necessity for adapting the relations between the, Governments
of Great Britain and those of the Dominions
to the altered situation due to the growth of
the Dominions--accepting the consequences
of growth, net reluctantly, but cheerfully.
Bear in mmnd that these remarks were made
at the very opening of the Conference, and,
therefore, could noV have heen due to any
pressure or prompting of the delegates freim
'Canada or any other overseas Dominion. It
was Mr. Baldwin's own original unprompted
utterance. He seems to have struck the keynote of the Report of the Conference, and
hie might almost be regarded as the author
of a passage in the Report, which. has been
quoted as expressing in a f ew words the statue
of the Dominions, and from which 1 may take
a few extracts:
1They are autonomous Communities within the
British Empire, equal in status, in no way
subordinate one to another in any aspect of
their domestic or external affairs, though united
by a common allegiance te the Crown, and
freely associated as members of the British
Commonwealth of Nations.
That seems to me to bie exactly in accord
with what Premier Baldwin said.A foreigner endeavouring to understand the
true character of the British Empire by the aid
of this formula atone wouid bie tempted to think
that it was devised rather to make mutual interference impossible than to make mutual
co6peratien easy.
Such a criticism, however, completely ignores
the historic situation. The rapid evolution of
the Oversea Dominions during the last fifty
Yeats hais involved many complicated adjustmente of nid political machinery to changing
conditions. The tendency towards equality of
statue was both right and inevitable.
Then, to complete the story, 1 read what
Mr. Baldwin said at the conclusion of the
Conference:
This Conference--and I say this with sonie
humiiity in the presence of Lord Balfour,
whose memory goes back so much further than

That was Mr. Baldwin's view of what was

an evidence of our nationality. We have
not appointed an ambassador.
We cannot
do so.
England cannot give us power to
appoint an ambassador in the true and proper
sense of the word, for an ambassador is one
who goes forth to represent an independent
state. Some people say it is to lie for the
good of his country. He makes treaties and
conventions with a foreign nation. Mr.
Massey cannot be an ambassador. He cannot make a treaty, because a treaty is an
agreement or contract made between two independent states, for the benefit of their
respective peoples.
It is not recognized in
international law that an agreement or convention is a treaty unless it is something
which binds the whole nation. Treaties are
confined absolutely to matters of peace and
war and to agreements made between the
heads of states to keep inviolable the property
of one nation when it is within the territorial
limits of another. All other agreements are
mere conventions or contracts. I venture to
say that it is no new doctrine that if we

wished we could borrow $1,00,000 from the
United States.
We could always make an
arrangement of that sort, and have always
done so. Such arrangements are mere commercial or personal agreements between us.
And we can make a contract with any nation
on earth regarding tariffs, or the borrowing
or lending of money, or anything except the
breaking up of the states or the declaration
of war or peace.
How a people can be said to be part of an
empire and at the same time to be an independent nation passes my comprehension.
We are only throwing sand in our eyes when
we talk in that way. We are a people one
and undivided, and may God grant that we
remain an undivided people for all time.
The honourable gentleman from Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) said that the reason
why nothing was to be donc under this convention was because Quebec objects. Well,
I think that I may say, as coming from
Ontario, that Ontario, just as much as Quebec,
appreciates its own rights and its own position, and objects to the Dominion Government or the Dominion Parliament entering
into any agreement to change our Magna
Charta, the British North America Act.
That was a bargain between the British Parliament and the various Provinces which
made up Confederation.
The Dominion of
Canada is the contract, and they are the
contractors, and they alone are able to
change or modify the contract in any way

that it has clarified the situation. I have
read, at least in part, the debate in the House

of Commons. On all hands it ds now admitted
that the Dominion Parliament has no power
or authority to request the English Parliament
to change our constitution; that any suggestion of that kind must emanate from the
parties who made the contraot, that is, the
various Provinces. We have 'heretofore been
in the habit of applying to England with an

Address from the House of Commons and the
Senate to amend the British North America
Act, and apparently the English Paxliament
has acted upon such an Address.

That pro-

cedure was utterly and absolutely improper
on both sides, and because it did not seriously
affect the Provinces they did not protest.

Dominion Parliament will have the impudence
to apply for any change in the Act of
Confederation without the consent of the
various Provinces of this country. To my
mind, we have been brought to an understanding of what is the actual right of the

Parliament of Canada. The Federal Parliament is everlastingly, in my judgment,
t.respassing upon the rights of the Provinces.
Because it is the business of no particular
Province, the Federail Parliament has been
a'llowed, time and time again, to do things
which it has had no authority or right to do.
If there is one right more than another of
which the Provinces should be jealous. it is
the right to make those applications to the
British Parliament. It has been said a
moment ago that by acquiescence they have
not given away their right. I do not know
what might be the result in time. The
Bnitish North America Act says that our
Government is founded on the principles of
the English Constitution, and it has been said,
in resounding phrase, that the British Constitution has broadened slowly down from
precedent to precedent. We are legislating
not meredy for months or years, but, I hope,

for centuries, and with regard to the practice
which we have been fol.lowing in extending
or changing our Constitution, it may be
pointed out in the future that the Provinces
have recognized that in the Dominion resided
the sole and exclusive authority to appiy for
constitutional amendments. I may be wrong,
but I know of no record of the Dominion
Parliament having ever deigned to consult the
Provinces with regard to its applications for

amendment of the British North America Act

my honauraible friend that he try te help me
in elosing this debate this evening.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think my honourafble
friend (Hon. Mr. Dandiurand) will find that
there will not be many speakers. If the
question is continued until to-morrow, we
can dispose of it.
Right Han. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
*There is a little difficulty in my mind about
this thing. My honourable friend who leade
the Government intends ta close the debate.
In reality the debate only commences when
the Gavernment's position la explained ta
this Chamber. When the Prime Minister, in
a speech in the ather House, explained the
policy of the Gavernment, the relation of
the acts of the Conference ta aur affairs, and
aIl about the subject, hie did nat close the
deibate; hie only placed bef are the other House
certain information from an authoritative
source, with lis commenta upon it. and this
made an intelligent debate possible. My
hanourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach) has introduced this inquiry and
made bis statement upon it; but every sentence af his statement ta a certain extent
challenged a reply fram the Goverament as
ta why this and why that. Until the deuired
infarmation is bef are the Hanse, how fa it
passible for us intelligently ta debate the
question? Therefore I think that my hono«L,able friend will have ta take the position
that hie represents the Goverament here. There«
are same things about this question that we
in this House do flot understand, and we
desire explanatians and an authoritative etatement of the idea of the Government with
reference to them. I do not thinlc my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) can close
off all dehate without putting the Goverument right with this Chamber, in that respect,
and then allowing comment.
0f course the discussion is ahl very hurried
and very flurried. The debate in the other
Chamber did not take place until Parliament
was well an tawards prorogation and every
member of either House had been advised

29%

ta pack up his traps and get ready ta go
home, and a date was set on 'whieh we might
go. This Hanse could not have any authoritative explanation of the matter until the
Prime Minister, ini the other House, had presented the Government's case, giving a statement of how they acted, and the reasons why
tbey acted so. Now we have come stili cIoser
ta the time when aur duds are ta be pa-cked
up and we are ta leave. My own mind runs
along in this direction: that the wisest thing
for honourable mernbers of the Senate ta do
is ta take the summer ta think over the wholn
matter, and to comes back at the beginning
cf aur next Session prepared for a thorough
and satisfactory discussion upon. it; for certainly, in ahl respects, aur position is not a
happy, not a proud one.

But I rose for the momnent to say thut I
did net think my honourable friend could
close tliis debate. Points have been put in

suu

SENATE

questions raised, and answers are required;
then there must be comment and discussion
in reference to them.
We have not much
time to do it now, but we may al live to
another year, and perhaps be in a better position to undertake a real and thorough discussion of this matter.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend has not understood that I did not intend to close the debate until every member
who desired ta speak had donc so. I am not
hurrying.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: My
honourable friend misses my point: I want
him to speak. I think 'he should have spoken
immediately after the member for Edmonton
(Hon. Mr. Griesbach) sat down, and should
have given the Government's exposition, and
that then every member who wanted to speak
should do so with this fuiller basis of information.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Well, I have
simply followed the tradition of this Chamber.
An inquiry is put on the Order ,Paper which
calls for some statement from the Government, but al. such inquiries are in a form which
allows the members to participate in the
debate. The representative of the Government has always waited in order to make his
statement, until the discussion was closed.
I did not sec any reason why I should alter
the procedure which has been followed -in this
House.
My right honourable friend says that I
might have made my statement in answer to
the inquiry of my honourable friend from
Edmonton, but he knows very well that the
position of the Government has been stated
elsewhere, for he has referred to that fact.
He knows what is involved in that position,
and 'he can draw bis conclusions from the
statements that have been made. He is
entitled to an officiai statement in this
Chamber, but I intended it to come as a reply
to this inquiry and the various comments
made in reference to it. Of course, I feel
that I must answer in such a fair way as not
to give rise to the complaint that I have
taken advantage of being the last to speak
and ,bave made statements that need to be
ainswered. I will promise not to offer new
matter, except in so far as it may be found
in the official answer cai'led for by this
inquiry.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Honourable gentlemen, I think everybody will admit that the
subject before the House is one of extreme
importance. Besides no one will deny that
Hon. Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

the Prime Minister promised that it would
be submitted to Paliament. But I cannot
understand why Parliament should be consulted through only one of its chambers
concerning a matter of such paramount importance as this, referring directly to the constitution of the country. If, of the two
Houses, one has been specially entrusted with
the safeguarding of our Constitution, surely it
is the Senate. My honourable friend, the
leader of the Govennment, knows perfectly
well that the Senators were entrusted in a
specia manner with the duty of preserving
the rights of Provinces as they exist through
Confederation.
For my part, I cannot understand why the
Government of its own initiative did not
bring this matter before the Senate as it was
submitted in the other House. I cannot understand why the Senate' has been completely
neglected in a matter which specially pertains
to its care. I think the right honourable the
junior member for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster) is quite right in questioning
whether this House can intelligently discuss
this matter otherwise than by dealing with
the avowed interpretation of the Conference
by the Government.
Perhaps i is not yet too late to afford this
House the opportunity of pronouncing upon
a question of such gravity, with al-1 the necessasy time to do so. Perhaps the honourable deader of the House would have no objection to taking the Senate into his full
confidence as ta tihe ministerial interpretation
of the report of the Conference. Such action
would be welcomed by a great many members
af this House, I a.m sure I know it wou'ld bo
very much appreeiated by myself. The interpretation has been so different, judging by the
expressions of various people, that we are
now left in very great 'uncertainty about it.
Perhaps I can give the honourable leader
some food for reflection in connection with
this natter. Time and again we have been
told, as I think it is admitted, that certain
features of our Constitution, although they
still remain in that document, are dead and
buried, and that a British Government or
Parliament would never attempt to resurrect
them. The British government has stated that
such features have been expunged from the
Constitution through disuse, although they
still remain in the written document. We
now know, and nobody can deny, that although the letter of such provisions remains, it
is a dead letter which never shall revive.
Now, if that is true, it arises simply from
the fact that for a certain number of years
the silence of the British Government as to

APRIL 6, 1927
the disuse of such provisions lias been interpreted as an acquiescence, in such dimus
and as an agreement ta the cancellation, of
these provisions. But, dionourable gentlemen,
that is only consent by silence. But what of
a formal consent, given in the face of the
whole Empire, to the recognized represenativee of ahl the cosnponent parts of the
Empire?
To-day we have this acknowiedgment, that
every Dominion is complete in its sovereignty.
The super-sovereignty of Great Britain bias
been folded back upon the Briîtish Isies, and
no more overlaps the boundaries of the
Dominions. Is that true? If that is true, if
the super-soveroignty of Great Britain over
this land is gone, without doudit Canada is
supreme. If that is the case, will the honourable leader of the Government tell mue now
whether Canada, 'being supreme, cannot a>mend
its Constitution?
Now, if Canada thirougli the Federal Pairiiament can amend its Constitution, or if there
is reason to think that it can through the
consent given at the conference by the British
govemment and accepted by the Dominions
and that acceptation would flow from the proceedings in our own House of Commons-are
we in this Chamber, who are specialiy appointed to represeut the Provinces, whose
first duty is to sec that the riglits of the
Provinces bie regpected-are we to sit silent?
It is ail very well to say: "There 18no danger
of Canada being considered as a perfectly
independent sovereignty; look at ail the ties
that otili exist in the very statute that created
Confederation." The Constitution of Great
Britan is an extraordinary instrument. AIthough totaliy unwritten it can, t.hrough
eustom or consent, supersede that which is
written.
I say to my honourable friend that the
position taken lesds to very serious consequences. If whist has been claimed for the
Confereuce is true, then this country is
totaIly, absolutely sovereign and can amend
its Constitution. Then whist does my honourable friend say about his own position as a
represeutative of Quebec in this Senate? Tat
is a serious question. I know how tempting
is the picture of perfect natîonhood painted
rspidly before our eyes when we are asked:
"Why are you such smaii Canadians that you
cannot understand the beauty of belonging to
a full-fledged, full-grown, fuIi-blooded nation?
Are you always to be tied to the spron-strings
of your mother? Is it not time for you to
waik alone? Lift your brow a bit and measfure
your stature. And s0 we almost blush for
the people who have not the vision and the

;U

courage to assume full nationhood. But whatever the temptation may be, I have another
question for my honourabie friend, which
is not perhaps addresscd to his mind, and
certainly flot to his vision, but which is
addressed to bis conscience. He knows that
the Province of Quebec, or 99 per cent of the
people of that Province, do flot want to place
in the hands of this Parliament the right to
amend the Constitution of the country. My
honourable friend knows thiat. He knows that
the Prime Minister of that Province, backed
by the Legisiature has declared in no uncertain
terms his own feelings as a man and the sentiments and desires of the peopie whom he
represents in that Legisiature, and those feelings anid sentiments are such ns I have stjated.
What course will my honourable friend's
conscience, force hlm to choose? Between
that vision that tempts him and the duty
that sternly caîls upon hlm to. represent
fuliy the desires of his people? I humbly
beg le«ve to tell him that he bas no choice;
he must represent the wishes s0 ciearly expressed by the peopie of the Provinces, for
such was the intention when the constitution
was written, and such it is ciearly to-day.
The matter now presented to the House
is perhaps the most grave and far-reaching
ever submitted to it. Therefore why press
this discussion toi~ conclusion, and especially
why press this House to a decision before
the Government has duly placed itself on
record? In my opinion the Government
owes that much to the dignity of thîs House.
Have we not also the right to hear the voice
of the Government on this score, Must we,
stretch a year and listen to the echo that
f ollows the long corridor uniting the two
Huses?
I submit that the dignity of this House
requires that in a matter of this importance
we should have clearly stated the interpretation of the Government, and then that we
should be aliowed to express our opinions
freely; and if I may nuike a suggestion,
why should not the leader of the House
speak now on this matter, reserving to himself
the right to answer at the end of the debate,
if he should require to do so?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Honourable gentlemen, I ri&-e not te speak on the question
proper, but merely to refer to the suggestions
made by the honourable gentleman who has
just spoken, and also by the right honourable the junior member for Ottawa. I share
the opinion that this question is of prime
importance. I do not disagree with the Report of the Conférence, but I think ît would
be unbecoming if this Chamber were to fail

SENATE
to put itself on record, either as criticizing
or appreciating such an important Report.
Therefore I agree with the suggestion that we
should take the time necessary to consider
this question. If it is now too late in the
session to do so, I would suggest that it be
postponed to next session. If it is not postponed to next session, we should take all the
time necessary to express our ful'l views on
the question now.
I was expecting that the honourable Leader
of the Government would follow the bonourable gentleman from Edmonton (Hon. Mr.
Griesbach), although, in my judgment, he is
quite within bis rights in not doing so. As
he bas said, he bas followed the ordinary
practice; but I was under the impression that
the ordinary practice would be departed from
in this case, and that the honourable gentleman would speak. It would be open to the
honourable gentleman to say that the Government had laid this Report on the Table
of Parliament, and that the Report itself i§
an expression of opinion of the Government
-of Canada, as well as of the representatives
of other Governments. As to that, however, I
think the honourable Leader of the Government should be perfectly free. What I would
like to get is a decision as to whether we
have time to fully consider this question now,
or whether it would be better to postpone it
until next session.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I have a suggestion to make. I do not know
whether it will meet with the view of the
honourable gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr.
Dandurand). My suggestion is that he make
a statement now, with the understanding that
the question is to be postponed till next session. We certainly are not going to have
time for the discussion that I am inclined
to think will follow the statement of the
honourable gentleman. If be makes a statement now, and the discussion is postponed to
the early part of next session, when we generally have some spare time, everyone who
wants to speak will have a chance to prepare
Hon. Mr. LYNCH-STAUNTON: It seems
to me that this matter is not before us in
such a way that the Senate can go formally
on record, and I do not see how a mere statement on tie part of the honourable gentleman would improve the position. I think
that when it is the desire of the House to go
on record the matter should be put before
us in such a way that we can do so and an
amendment can be moved if anyone so desires.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
May I be alowed to say another word? I
-

Hon.

Mr. BEIQUE.

must confess that I have not examined very
carefully the rules and practice of the Senate
in these matters. I found, almost at once,
when I came to this House, that the practice
was different from the practice in the other
House. That is why I made my remarks.
Practically speaking, I do not know what my
rights are.
Suppose, when my honourable
friend lays the matter before this Chamber
from the Government's standpoint, I should
get up to speak, am I to be called down?
If that were so, I should say from the very
first that I do not intend to speak. It is
very nuch like beating the air. The mild
and shrewd, but somewhat guileful suggestion
of my honourable friend that we should get
our information through the medium of someone who spoke in another place is not, it
seems to me, respectful to this Chamber. We
will not take warmed-up tea or warmed-up
porridge fromo another place; we want our
food freshly cooked, and the honourable gentleman opposite is to do the cooking.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: For the benefit
of honourable gentlemen who do not know
the rules very well, I may read RuIe 40,
which says:
When it is intended to make a statement or
raise a discussion on asking a question, the
Senator having such intention, as part of the
notice under Rule 21, gives notice that he will
call attention to the matter inquired into.
I think when that rule was drawn up it
was the intention that the whole question
should be dealt with in a single day. As a
matter of custon we have adopted the practice of adjourning the debate from one day
to another, but it bas always been recognized
that when the Leader of the Government bas
answered the question and made bis statement, the debate is closed. If honourable
gentlemen want to continue the discussion,
why should not some other honourable gentieman present a motion?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There seems to
be a misapprehension as to the effect of the
inquiry which is before the House. It simply
calls for a statement from the Government,
and an answer to the remarks that may fall
from the lips of the honourable gentleman
inquiring. There is no rule by which this
chamber is bound to one or two or ten
speeches, and the answer by the Government;
it is simply a statement of policy which is
asked. When that statement is made that
ends the matter for the time being. A notice
of motion may be given expressing an opinion
or asking this Chamber to express an opinion
upon that statement; then, naturally, the
Senate is bound to give its opinion upon the
motion.

SENATE

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: Before the motion is carried, may I express the
hope that my honourable friend has not committed himself, or will not commit himself, to
a hectic attempt to get through the business
of Parliament by Saturday. There is a full
week ahead of us, comprising six working days,
and I do not think any of us will die before
his time because the Senate attends in a decently leisurely way to the important measures
which are before it. The whole world will not
be jeopardized, whether we get through Saturday night or some time next week. Anybody
who looks over the Bills before us will see that
they are very important, and that they ought
not to be slurred over with the mere idea' of
getting through on Saturday.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is exactly
the opinion I hold. As I stated yesterday, there
can be no question of prorogation until this
Chamber has had time to dispose of the public
Bills that are before us, and I think the same
idea prevails in the other Chamber. Therefore
we will proceed to our work seriously, as if
there were no prorogation date in our minds.
Nevertheless, I believe that by exercising fair
diligence we can finish our work by Wednesday or Thursday of next week, and, if we can
do that, it will enable members to reach their
homes for Easter, which will be a happy consummation of their labours.
The Senate adjourned until to-morrow at
11 a.m.
THE SENATE

He said: Honourable gentlemen, there appear to be quite a number of amendments,
but really there are only three. One is simply
a clerical amendment, substituting the words
"union label" for the single word "label."
While there are apparently ten or fifteen
amendments, they all bear on ýnat word.
One of the other amendments makes it clear
that a union may not grant the use of its
label to one manufacturer or employer in
preference to others; the conditions being
equal, all employers wil be entitled to the
same treatment.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: All who qualify.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
That amendment, I believe, was useless, because that is
the very principle which underlies the Bill;
but it is there, and while it is harmless it
makes the Bill clear. No union would give
a preference or a monopoly of its label to one
manufacturer or employer and refuse it to
another under the same conditions.
The
third amendment has sim.ply the effect
of putting the trade unions on the same
footing as all other people who apply for a
trade mark, by paying the same fee. The
Department had forgotten about its interest
in this matter.
I think that all those who were in the
Committee will testify that I have covered
fairly and completely the amendments, and I
will move their adoption.
The motion for concurrence was agreed to

READING POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of the Bill.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not think it is quite
fair to people who are interested in this Bill
to move the third reading now. There are
people interested who were not present at
the Committee, and they should have a
chance to read these amendments. I would
suggest to my honourable friend that the
third reading be put down for to-morrow. I
do not expect a long debate. All I am saying
is that I think, in fairness, the people interested should have a chance to read this.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course, I
have drawn the atention of my honourable
friend and of the Senate to the fact that there
are practically no amendments. The word
"union" qualifies the word "label." That does
not touch the principle of the Bill in the
least. Then, there is an amendment declaring
that there shall be equality of treatment of

APRIL 8, 1l2

Departinent to coileet the fee.
If my honourabie frîend thought there was
the least, variation in the prlnôipie of the
Bill, I would acquiesce; but if hé tbinkg the
Senate is seized of the Bill I would suggest
giving it the third reading.
Hon, W. B. ROSS: In the case of the

side to the matter. Ail we have te do ia te

have risen at all but for the expressions that
have fallen from my leader, who seems to
think that the rest of us are tremendously
pleased and enthusiastie about this break in
the provisions and disposition of the British
North America Act.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I did not pretend to express the degree of enthusiasm of
my honourable friend: I only mentioned the
spirit of amity and friendliness that we all
felt for all parts of the Dominion.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But my honourable
friend admits that if his statement had gone
on record without challenge from anybody,
it would have been my statement as well as
his. That is the reason I have risen-not to
object, but to warn the people of Canada
against a danger which may some day arise
from what we are now doing.
I repeat that, for my part, I do not want
the B. N. A. Act changed; I do not want
any power to amend that Act; I am one of
those who think that the Fathers of Confederation built probably better than they
thought. To me there seems to be no occasion why we s.hould stretch the B. N. A. Act
in any respect. Those who listen to me may
think that in expressing these views I am
noved to a considerable extent because the
rigts of minorities are affected. I have given
a good deal of attention in my life to that
question, but entirely outside of minority
rights, on general prilnciples, I do not think
that the B. N. A. Act could be in any respect
improved if it had to be made over again
to-day. I rose simply to say that I canoot
bring to this matter the enthusiasm which
seemos to be so general.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Although we are
taking tihese Bills together, I wish to refer
to some provisions in Bill 233, respecting the
production of domestic fuel by the establishment of coking plants.
The contract provided for requires the use
of 70 per cent of coal mined in Canada. That
is perfectly satisfactory, but in section 4
there is a provision that if that proportion
should fall below 70 per cent which one can
conceive would be quite possible through
strikes, for example, or other interruptions
there is to be a reduction in the amount to
be paid. If I have figured correctly, that reduction is sufficient under certain circumstances to permit the use of foreign coal
without penalty.
There is also a clause stating that agreements may be cancelled, in case of contracts
being entered into, and another that the
Governor in Council may make regulations
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

deemed necessary to carry out the purposes
of the Act.
I would draw the attention of the leader
of the Government to the fact that it should
be made quite clear that those safeguarding
clauses will be observed when the time comes
for a contract, which I hope will be very soon,
ýnd that there will be no loophole through
which the intention of the Government to
utilize Canadian coal, so handsomely implemented in this legislation, can be neutralized.
Hon. Mr. DANDJRAND: My honourable
friend is undoubtedly expressing the sentiments of all the members of the present
Government. I may get greater details as to
the administration of that part of the Bill,
which I will bring to my honourable friend's
attention when we take the third reading.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, I rise merely to make a suggestion. I
take the same view as the honourable leader
of the Government, that these Bills will
receive unanimous support in this House, and
for my part I would like to see them expedited somewhat.
I understand there are
four Bills, and I suggest that we take the
several stages of three of them, that is, the
second and third rea4ings, and also take the
second reading of a fourth Bill, but let that
one stand over for third reading until Monday,
with the understanding that any member who
wishes to speak will be at liberty to refer to
them all to-morrow.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What is the Bill
which my honourable friend would retain for
discussion?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Bill 224-the Railway
Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If it is the wish
of the House to retain one Bill for third
reading, I am ready to suggest that we pass
the third reading of the other three.
Hon. J. G. TURRIFF: Before the second
readings are given, I wish to say a word, and
ask a question. I am not opposed to the
Railway Bill, and do not criticize it, but I
would point out that the reduction of 20 per
cent on freight rates for the lower Provinces
is being rushed through.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Oh, no.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: What I want to point
out is that two years ago, in June coming, the
House of Commons and the Senate passed a
Bill, which received the asent of the Governor
General, providing for a reduction of freight
rates in the West, but that reduction has

APRIL 8, 1927
neyer been, carried out. The Board of Railway Comrnissioners uiotified the different railways interested, the C-anadian Pacifie and the
Cana.dian National, that certain rates were to
ha applied forthwith. Those rates affect al
the farmers in the western Provinces, but the
railway companies have simply ignored the
instructions which were given practically by
the Government througb the Railway Commissioners, and they have not applied those
rates. The resuit is that the farmers, particularly in the two prairie Provinces, have been
paying what is estimated at about 32,500l,000
a year out of the last two crops, and the
Goverament bas taken no action to have those
rates enforced. But we find that the Government is giving special rates to the eastern end
of the country, and while I arn not objecting,
I would ]ike to know why the Governrnent
bas not taken action to implernent their own
legisiation, and force the railways to give the
rates that were provided.

Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: That was on a question that was submitted by the Board of
Railway Commissioners after the legisiation
providing for the reduction of freight rates-the Crowsnest freight rates--bad been put
through Parliament; but thera has been no
effort made tea implamenit that decision of
Parliarnent, and ta make the railways conform to it. There has been no action; but
now we see by this Bull that a decision is

criticizing it, butlIdonfot see why there sbould

honourable gentleman said that this was a
departure, and that he wanted adherence to
the principle of the British iNorth America

restoration of a right that was guaranteed to
us at Confederation by the Treaty that was
agreed on by men who went to England representing these Provinces and our Provinces,
as the basis on which Confederation was to
be effected.
I may say to the honouraible leader that I

Provinces are pleased, with the legislation

wished to have the present Mace Bearer receive some recognition for the additional
duties whiclh he performs in assisting the
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod at the

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Has the Coinmittee examined into the attitude of the Coinnons on this matter?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I can quite readily
grasp the significance of the statement made
by the Leader of the Government here. I
have no doubt that if our action is favourable
it will have the effect of creating dissatisfaction on the other side of this building, unless the saine procedure is followed there.
Whather that should debar us from taking
the action proposed, if we think it is right,
is a inatter for us to consider. To counterbalance that, wa miglit recall the fact that
soma of the poitions in the Senate are not as
highly paid as similar positions in the House
of Commons.
Riglit Hon. Sir ýGEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, it seems to me t>hat
the Leader of the C-overmifient lias raisad a
point which makes careful consideration necessary. If it were in order, 1 should like to
propose three cheers for the page boys for
thair moderate stand, or Iack of a stand. It
strikes me that unless there is some unanimity
of action in botli Branches of Parliament, it
would be unwise for us to do anything thiat
would miake so, wide a difference between the
employecs of two branches that are undar
the samie roof. I think, therefore, that the
matter requires further considaration befora
we vote upon it.
It is rather startling to know that we have
a staff of more than 22 to attend to the wants
of the moderata number of sanators in attendance on the average, during the Session.
I think it would be advisable for us to set
an example of moderation in our expenses.
I thi-nk also it would ha the riglit thing in
employing amanuenses and Inessengers to
have it understood when they are amployed
that they are to receive half pay during the
long vacations, whicb I think is generous
anougli. Then there will be no feeling that
they have been engaged under a certain scale
of remuneration, and have been deprivad of
it because the Senate did not sit. It is really
a pretty difficult thing for us to pass this
through, in face of the objection that has
bean raised and the conditions that it would
excite in the other brancb of our Parliament.

for the staff, and for our finances, that, after
allowing for the pact that our staff is mucli
smaller, I have ýalways been agreeably surprised at the expanditure of the Senate as
compared with ýthat of the Comm ons. I have
had occasion to congratulate the Cornmittee
on Internai Econoîny upon Ats very prudent
Hon.

Mr. DANItEL.

actions in the past. As a matter of fact,
whan estimates from various Departments
have coma bafore Council1 and the Prime
Minister lias prassed for reductions, I have
ohsarved that the Sanate, without urging, lias
rasponded with figures which were craditable
to thie House.
I would suggest to 'my honourable friand
(Hon. Mr. Daniel) thait hae suspend until
Tues-day the motion for the adoption of this
report, in ordar that we may see what affect
it ýmight 'have on the general relations hetwaen
the two branches.
Hon. G. D. ROBERTSON: Just before that
is d.one, honourahie gentlemen, I desire not to
delay the House, but simply to express the hope
that, in thinking over this matter from now
until Tuesday, honourabla gentlemen wil
keep in mind a faw facts that ara worth
remembaring. Whan a staff are employed for the
spaciflo purpose of giving service during the
Session of Parliamant, they must necessarily
provide themselves with quartars and ha
avaihable for service evaýry day of the next
six months, if that is the anticipated lengtli
of the Session. We have had Sessions extending bayond that period. It seems to me it is
wholIy prepostarous te, expeet tha~t employecs
will coma into the publie service for the sake
of a faw days' work, and then, after an
adjournment of a few weeks, coma back again
to work a few days mnore. Wa cannot axpect
paq;ple to accept employment under those conditiono. We raquire reasonable service liera,

and wa get it.

Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: We have many
applications.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: We gat reaisonable service, and I do not think we should
be at al penurious in this matter. If you
compare other legislatures, especially that of
the United States, witli this Parliament, you
will find ýthat their expenditure, par capita,
for the convenience of members, is probably
four times what the expendiýture is liera. This
Housa certainly cannot ha said to, have bean
extravagant in the administration of its internal affairs. Bmecause it was convenient or
advisable from the Government's stand-point
to cali Parliamant befo-re Christmas, let us flot
dacide that these Sessional employeas, wlio
gat only a few rnontlis' work at the best, slial
lie the suffarers. Let the State bear whatever
expensa may be involved by reason of Parliament liaving been called in Decemiber instaad
of January.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I quite agree witli tlie
remarks of the honourable gentleman wlio lias

313

APRIL 8, 192
just sat down. The argument that appealed
to me during the discussion and consideration
of this matter is the fact that these persons,
maie and female, who are, 1 presume, flot very
largely endowed with wealth, but have to
make their living by. their dagily wage, have
a right to expect, when they accept a position
in the Senate, that it will be continuous and
they wiIl be paid for the whole time. Otherwise, it appears ta me, we shall be obliged,
in the matter of stenographers, tg take the
very warst that are appearing on the market,
instead of getting good and efficient stenographers, such as I think we have now. That
appears to me ta be the chief argument; for
there is no doubt that if these young women
are deprived of a large amaunt of what they
expect to be their remuneration they wi.ll
seek employment somewhere cisc and we shall
not be able ta obtain their services, but must
accept the inferior kind that would be offering
under such circumstances.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: Honourable gentlemen, 1 have just a remark or two. 1 quite appreciate the ground that was taken by the
honourable leader of the House, -but my
answer wouJd be that it is quite open ta the
House of Commons ta came up level with
the Senate in this regard. They have ample
time. If we think we are right we should go
along and leave themn ta catch up with us. It
is always interesting ta me ta observe how
strongly the idea of economy strikes us when
we get down ta some of these smail items,
but when we have millions ta spend, or hundreds of millions, why, we are perfectly freehanded. Befare Parliament closes, in a day
or two, I think we shall be asked to vote haif
a million dollars ta provide a house for the
MUgh Commissioner at Washington, and I
asuppose we shall aU hold up aur hands joyously in favaur of spending $M0,000 for that
purpose. But here.-here we are shrinking
because the poor fellows who work for a fcw
weeks around this building are asking for full
pay.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I would point
out ta my honourable friend that I said the
amount was flot what cancerned me.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: I know.
Hon. Mr. DANDURANfl: It was the unhinging of the situation.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: But I think that if
we were acquainted with the innermost recesses of the performances on the other side
af this building we would find that they are
not so very econiomical, and that, as my houa-

ourable friend (Hou. Mr. Dandurand) has
said, this Chamber really mets a flie example
in that respect. I do not think we "hIl
destroy that example, or affect it in the lecet,
by giving the employece of the Senate full
pay. I believe that the Cominitise bas fully
considered this matter in ail its bearings, and
I arn prepared ta vote for the report.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Question.
Right Hani. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
There is anc thing I will say. The service, so
far as nmy experience goes, bas been excellent.
There is evidently something li the point
that my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Daniel)
bas made, that if we require good serviceand any that we have ought ta be of the best
sort-lt mnay be diffieult ta obtain it under
conditions ini which employinent is temporarily taken away.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I do nat want
ta go counter ta the view of the Senate i
this matter. The figure is of small cousequence, but I thought that if we postponed
the niatter until Monday or Tuesday I would
have an opportunity ta see the authorities of
the Commons and try ta adjust matters.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: I think that is fair. I
do not think there is axxy reason why we
should jam this thing through to-day.
Hon. Mr. CASGRAIN: Tuesday.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Yes.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think that suggestion was quite reasonable, under the circumstances.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dandurand, consideration. of the report was postponed until
Tuesday next.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: May I point out
ta honourable gentlemen that they mnight
examine into what was dane li the year 1918,
when a similar adjournent occurred.

SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, tjhis is a
fairly compact Bill, creating a Federal District
Commission in lieu -of the Commission which
'has been in existence for a certain number of
years. We -could perhaps now give it the
second reading, and put if dewn for the Comrmitfee of rÉhe Wlhole fo-morrow. I do nof
know thaf it is essentially a money Bill. At
aIl events, we will have time to see it.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
Hon ourable
gentlemen, this Bill is o-1 particular importance, I presumne, fo the city of Ottawa
and the members drom. Ottawa, ail of whom
are not present. I have no particular objection f0 the Bill going fto a second
but I think if ouglif net to proceed reading,
furfher
to-day.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Of course, if
no honourable gentleman desires to speak
now on the creation of this Federal District
Commission, we can take the second reading,
and honourable gentlemen can speak when
the Bill is in Commiffee, or on the third
readingý.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: Can my honourable friend give us an outline, of the Bill,
so that we will know something of if?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, may I say a few words. The Ottawa
Improvement Commission was created with
power to applv the funds voted by Parliament
each year for the beaufification of the Capital.
The areýa f0 be administered was confined fo
Ottawa and the immediate vicinity. Since
t hen fthe Government bas suggested to the
Improveinent Commission having charge of
that measure, and having the expenditure of
flic meney, that some of the funds be expended outside of the immediate limits of
the city of Ottawa. I cannot remember the
figures, but something was done i Hull, and
in some portion of the district around Ottawa.
I had the honour of representing the city
of Ottawa in thec Commons, when that Improvement Commission was created, and the
idea was suggested then, and bas been often
discussed since, thaf the seheme should be
v-ery much enlarged, s0 as f0 inclucde part of
the Province of Quebec, for flic purpose of
forming what is called a Federal District,
somewhat on the same lines as the District of
Columbia in which is situafcd flic Capital of
the United St ates. That idea bas groivn and
grown, until now flic Government is evidently

APRIL 8, 1927
prepared to carry it out; and this is the first
step towards the creation of a Federal District.
Ail that this Bill does is to increase the
amount of the original grant, 8150,000 yearly.
By this Bill the Ottawa Improvement Commission is stili going to administer, but instead
of $150M00 they will have 8250,000 to expend
yearly, with power to capitalize these annual
payments for the next ten years, and thus
get the money at once for the purpose of
oarrying out such general schemes as may be
decided upon.
Hon. Mr. MURPHIY: Sixteen years.
Hon. Mr. BELCOUTRT: Sixteen years. I
think the Ottawa Improvement Commission
has added one or two members recently. The
Federal District itself is flot being created by
this Act, though. I imagine that this Bill reý
presents the acceptance of the idea, and that
bel ore long we shahl have a Bill to govern the
Federal District.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, I woulq4 like to ask for some information
;ýs to the fate of the report of a Commission
which was -appointed some years ago on the
beautification of Ottawa. Their report l'ooked
towards the groupîng of our Government
buildings along the clf, and suggested
various other changes which should be made.
According to the report, which -I saw flot very
long ago, the recommendation of that Commission, if adopted, would have made Ottawa
one of the most beautiful capital cities, for its
size to be found anywhere.
Since that report was macle *a good many
Government buildings have gone up, scattered
through the cîty, and some of them do flot
add to its beauty. It seems to me that it is
very important that these matters should be
reconsidered, and that that Commission's plan,
which I think commended itself to everybody,
should be carried out gradually, as money is
available. As far as possible, also, theý
characteristics of the town as they have existed
should be preserved; for example, along
Sussex Street local lîmestone has been used in
several very typical and beautiful private
houses and other buildings. 1 know that the
late Mr. Frank Darling, who was on that Commission, and also Sir Wilfrid Laurier, had the
idea, that it would be desirable to make the
whole of Sussex Street of that character, which
would have made it very picturesque and
delightful to ail of uks and to 'visitors who
would see and appreciate it. As to buildings
that are now being or are about to be put up,
it wouhd be welh that a general scheme of
permanent convenience and beauty should be
carefully observed.

315

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I thoroughly agree
with my honourable friend. I have given the
matter very careful considieration ail along.
1 think it is a wrong policy for the Government to pursue, to, put up buildings ini certain
sections when they really should go somewhere else. I think it was a mistake to, spend
so mucli ioney on the Hunter building. That
building, or a building to, answer the purposes of that building, should have been
built afong the cliff, where the Government
bas expropriated property. I do hope that
whon the Government starts constructing
buildings for administration they wihi build
them in the valuable territory which Vhey
havc acquired for that very purposeHon. Mr. DANDUIRAND: 'In agreement
with the Commission.
Hon Mr. BELCOURT: -and not buy
pieces of land here and there, to put up
buildings for which there is no reason. They
ought to be built where the Government lias
already acquired property, and where thcy
would help to beautify the city more than
if tbey were situated ainywhere else.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: My honourable
friend is a bit sketchy as to the distance out
from Ottawa that this area is going to extend.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As I understand
it. the area is not changed at ail. It is the
city of Ottawa. 1 have spoken of the area
in connection with the scheme. That would
take in the country around about Ottawa
within a certain radius-whether ten or twelve
or fil teen mil-es, I cannot say. Nobody has
laid down a definite plan. The plans we have
had so far are for the beautifying of the
capital.
Does not my
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
honourable friend think it would be better
to propound a federal seheme and make a
federal district similar to that at Washington bel ore embarking on a large expenditure?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have thought so
and have urged it for twenty-five years.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: To put it another
way: are we welh advised to vote any money
at ail for a large scheme like this until we
have first of all secured our investment by
the creation of a federal district wherein we
know the scheme wihl be carried out?
I do not think
BELCOURT:
Hon. Mr. b
there can be any doubt that the moneys that
are going to be expended under the provisions
of this Act will be expended with a view to
the federal sohe ne. AUl that wihl be dons
will fit into that scheme.

316

SENATE

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
0f course, lionouraible gentlemen, I know nothing o'f the
enlarged scheme of which my henourable
friend speaks, but I arn under the impression
that there lias been nothing so far which
would give even a faint outline of what that
sdheme wiIl be; nor bias it been submitted
to Council to deliberate upon.
I wiII content myseif with moving the second
reading- of this Bill, and sending it to Coinmittee at the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. BEAUBIEN: If the purpose
of the Bill is only to increase the annual
appropriation to $250,000, why is the Bill so
hulky?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It provides for
the 'creation of a new body, which will take
the place of the oid ane. I ar n ot ready to
say to wihat extent it alters the powers of
that body. I will get that information for
the Committee stage.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honouraible gentlemen, before undertaking an expenditure of
$4,000,000 to beautify the city of Ottawa , I
think the Government ought to make arrangements with the civie authoriýties to see that
a supply of decent water is provided. At the
present time the water su.pply is very unsatisfactory. To rnany peophe it is so irrita.ting
that it is no use for taking a bath.
Anotther thing that I should lie to call
attention to is the suiphite fumes, whieh are
very bad when the wind is in a certain
quarter. I arn sure soine arrangement could
be made t0 overcoýme that. If not, oomething
should be done to prohibit it.
These are miatters as týo which something
should be donc before we undertake to spend
$4,000,000. Remember, this is flot our money,
not Ottawa money; it belongs to the people
of Canada; and thcy are intcrcsted in the
matter. In my opinion some ste'ps should be
taken tû remedy the conditions ta which I
have referrcd.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I sec that my
honoura-ble friend frim Edmonton (Hon. Mr~.
Griesbach) is right in saying that the Ottawa
Improvement Commission is gone. It is to
be callcd the Federal District Commission.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Without a federal
district.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I arn only calling
attention to thýat to say that the federal
district is stili in the air, so to speak.
lon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: I want to endorse the
rcmarks made by the Leader of the Progressive Party in t.his House (Hon. Mr.
Turriff>. Ot'tawa will1 neyer be a beautiful
icity until the air is purîfied. About three
days a wcck the air here is not fit ta breathe
and the city will never be fit ýto live in until
you have water fit to bathe in. Not onhy is
the water dirty, but it has an cdor that is
ahmost as bad as the odor that cornes from
the rnills across the river.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I may say that
about ten years ago the Corporation of the
City of Ottawa undertook to get a supply of
water frorn the Gatineau lakcs-31-milc Lake,
which is quite a big lake, 25 or 26 miles long,
and 22 or 23 miles wide. That lake is as fine
a body of water as is to be found on this
Continent. The Corporation carried matters
to the extent of getting the Government of
Quebec to pass an Act authorizing expropriation, and the other steps necessary to secure
this water supply, and I do not remember
exactly why the schemc was not cventualhy
carried out, unless it was for financial rcasong.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Was it a gravity
system?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. No doubt
that scheme wouhd have furnished Ottawa
with as fine a supply of water as could be got.
Lately there bas been a revival of intcrcst in
that seheme, and I think if the Government
were disposed ta lend its assistance a perfect
system of water supphy could be establishcd
in a very short time.
I think the honourable gentleman from. St.
John (Hon. Mr. Black) is quite right with
regard to the fumes of which hie speaks. I do
not sec why stops should not be taken ta
prevent our getting the benefit of the fumes
from the sulphurous acid whenever the wind
is blowing frorn the north. It seems to me,
the attention of the Government having been
called Io this, that something shouhd be donc.
1 arn tohd that there are means hy which this
escaping gas can be consumed right in the
chimney, or just as it cornes out of the chimncy. The trouble is that evcryhody's business
is nobody's business, and those who shouhd
do not choose to act.
As far as Ottawa is concerned, I amn sure
honourable gentlemen will agrec that natural]y thore is no more beautiful spot in the
world, and that, to use common language, it
is up ta the citizens and Parliament to make
it the most beautiful city on thîs continent.
Ahi that is necessary is that the people inter-

APRIL 9, 1927
ested i the city'-and I assume that every
Canadian is interested i the capital-should
be willig to spend the money required, and
see that the work of beautifyig the City is
done in a proper way. There is no reaoon
why we should flot have the finest capital i
the world.
Hon. Mr. POPE: After the recent legislation in the Province of Ontario, which is to
corne into effeet about the lst of June, I do
flot sec why we, who are here only during the
Parliamentary Session, should worry about
the water supply of Ottawa.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: While the maximum penalty may seem somewhat severe,
I desire to draw the attention of my honourable friend and the House to the fact that
there ha considerable leeway between the
maximum and the minimum. I think it is
the minimum penalty t-hat should be considered. If it should happen that two Justices
of the Peace, or a Judge were to take a serious
view of an offence, and for the purpose of
influencing public opinion against the work
of the bootlegger along the 'coasts of the
Maritime Provinces or of the Lakes, for
instance, were to impose a very stiff sentence,
it would have a very considerable influence on
public opinion. But one must not forget

SENATE
EXCISE BILL

REPORT

OF COMMITTEE ON BANKING
COMMERCE

ANI)

Hon. Mr. BLACK moved concurrence in
the Report of the Committee on Banking and
Commerce, on the message from the House of
Commons disagreeing with Senate amendments to Bill 119, an Act to amend the Excise
Act.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
How does that leave the legislation?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We have restored the penalty clause to the form in
which it came to this Chamber, and have
a'bandoned the amendment in that regard
that we made here. This is in accord with
the amendment to the Customs Act. We do
not insist upon that amendment, but we
insist upon the amendment which provides
that the certificate of the analyst is to be
taken as prima facie evidence.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Do I understand
that the amendment moved by the honourable
gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt),
and which went to the House of Commons
and was there rejected, is now.concurred in?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
I moved two
amendments. The Bill as it came to us from
the House of Commons provided that the
certificate of the analyst should be evidence.
I moved to change that to provide that it
would be prima facie evidence. If the Bill
had remained as it came to us the accused
would not have had the right to dispute what
was shown by the certificate. I thought that
was going too far, and suggested that we
should make it prima facie evidence, which
leaves it open to the accused to rebut that
evidence in any way he can. The House of
Commons refused to accept that amendment,
and we insist upon it.
The other amendment was that the onus
of proof should rest on the accused in the
case of his having liquor in his possession.
I moved in the Committee that that be
stricken out. Honourable gentlemen may remember that on another Bill during this
present Session I took the ground that to put
upon the accused the onus of proving his
innocence is a violation of a fundamental
principle of criminal law in the Empire, that
a person is looked upon as being innocent,
and is treated as innocent, until he is proven
guilty. That amendment the House of Commons refused to adopt, and in Committee
yesterday we came to the conclusion that it
was better not to insist upon it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

So the only amendment that we are insisting upon is the first one of which I spoke,
namely, that the "evidence" in that section
should be prima facie and not conclusive.
That amendment we insist upon. The other
is abandoned.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved:
That a message be sent to the House of Com-

mons to inforni that honourable House that the
Senate doth insist on its first amendment to
Bill 119, intituled an Act to amend the Excise
Act, to which the House of Commons has disagreed, but do not insist upon its second amendment.
The motion was agreed to.

DEPARTMENT OF NATIONAL REVENUE ACT AMENDMENT BILL
FIRST READING

Bill 281, an Act to amend an Act of the
present Session intituled "An Act respecting
the Department of National Revenue."-Hon.
Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, during the
present Session we passed a Bill establishing
the Department of National Revenue. It
bas not yet been sanctioned, and we are now
asked to amend it.
The purpose of the
present Bill is to make the amendment desired. It bas been found that certain chapters concerning the Department of Customs
and Excise, affected by our amendment constituting a new Department, under a new
name, and merging together three former departments, were annulled in toto, whereas
a certain number of clauses are still needed
for the administration of the Department of
National Revenue. So the present Bill declares:
The Department of National Revenue Act is

amended by repealing section seven thereof; and
such provisions of The Department of Customs

and Excise Act, chapter twenty-six of the
statutes of 1921 as amended by chapter eighteen
of the statutes of 1922 and chapter thirty-seven
of the statutes of 1924, as are not inconsistent
with The Department of National Revenue Act
as so amended, are hereby revived and shall be
construed and take effect as though the section
seven aforesaid had not been enacted.

APRIL 9, 1927
in other words, the Bill which we passd
went a littie too f ar, covering more clauses
than should have been covered, and now we
are reviving those parts of the Act that are
not in conflict with the Bfi which we have
passed.
If I have made myseif sufficiently clear, I
will move the second reading of this Bill.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is, we were misled.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Dcpartmental officers had a summary of the Acts
with which they could dispense, but after
the Bill had passed and they came te examine the situation they found they had gone
further than they intended.
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: They found the Act
was abolished.
Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: They repealed
the whole Act?
Hon. Mr. BUREAU: There was no Customs and Excise Act after the amendment

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, there is more information given
in the marginal note than in -the Bill itself.
The Bill says:
Section forty-one of The Immigration Aet,
chapter twenty-seven of the etatutes of 1910, s
enacted by chapter twenty-six of the statutes of
1919, is repealed.
I see in the marginal note that it concerns
the depontation of undesinable classes. It is
an old friend that we have had with us two
or thnee times. I thought I had made a convincing argument in favour of the Bill last
year, but apparently I was flot eloquent
enough to get it passed.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: How would iL do to
send iL to the Committee on Agriculture, to
be used for fertilizer?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I am in a happy
mood just now, but we shaîl have to treat iL
seriously. The people nepresented in the
Commons are apparently insisting upon this
Bill. I do not know whether or flot it was
adopted unanii.mously in the other Chamber.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: There was a great deal
of discussion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If you do not
allow of the third reading without discussion,
I will ask that iL be deferned until Monday.

Eighty
thousand Frenchi soldiers were killed in

first time united, attached, with the assistance
of a British Division and somne Britishi

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third

Trede Mark and Design Act, as amended.
Hon. Mr. DANDTTRAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, this Bill went to the Committee
on Banking and Commerce, where it was
thoroughly examined, representations for and
against it being heaTd. The inquiry which
took place dissipated to a considerable extent
the prejudices wbich have hovered around
this legislation, which bas been souglit by the
labour elernents of this country for the past
thirty years. The angles lied heon considerably rounded by the application of the
principlo contained in the Bill, and it bas been
shown that it is fairly innocuous and tends
to bring capital and labour nearor together
in joint and haippy co-operation. With these
few remarks, I movo the third reading of
this Bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bihl

CANADA GRAIN BILL
TIID

READING

Hon. Mr. DAINDURAND rnoved the third
reading of Bill 235, an Act to amend the
Canada Grain Act.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Has the honourable gentleman no remarks
to make witbh reference to this Bill?
Hon. Mr. DAINDURAND:
I confess that
my attention was directed to another matter
foi' the moment.
Honourable gentlemen will rememýber that
I did not feel thet there wvas any special
reeson why this Bill should go to Committee
-that inasmucli as we bed the Bill before
us in the Banking and 'Commerce Committee
for a couple of weeks lest year, and lied
mede an exhaustive inquiry into it, wo were
as enlightened upon it as we could be.
I now readily admit that I arn very glad
we did refeýr the Bill to the Benking and
Commerce Committee. There we focussed
our attention upon the main question, and
within an hour or an bour and a half reacbed
the crux of the question, which wes thîis: lied

APRIL 9, 1927
the f armers of the West an absolute right
f rom 1912 ta 1925, to route their grain to a.ny
elevator they chose at the terminal point?
The discussion of this question brought the
admission from Mr. Snow, the Grain Coinmissioner, that hé had always feit that under
clause 150 of the Aet of 1912 the farmer of
lAie West had that right.
The Bill now before us is simply for the purpose of restoning that right to the Western
farmer. It is nothing new. The situation was
somewhat blurred, I believe, by the work of
the bouse of Commons Committer on Agriculture, which last year, upon receiving the Bill
drafted by the Chairman of the Royal Commission, the Hon. Mr. Justice Turgeon,
amended it in an endeavour to clarify it. I
arn now convinced that it did not need any
clarifying. Mr. Justice Turgeon, in his draft
of the Bill, made it clear that under clause
150 of the Act the farmer had the right. to
route his grain to whatever terminal elevator
he miglit choose.
The Act of 1912 said that grain could be
routed, not to any terminal point, but to any
terminal, "if elither party so desires,"1 and it
was my opinion that the party who would
first express the desire, would be the farmer.
The words "if either party so desireË' seem
to indicate the possibility of a clash; but
whien one looks at the Act it is clear that
those words meant that the farmer could
express his desire and make his election, and
it was law. If he dîid not express a desire,
then the elevator man could follow his own
inclination and send the grain to whatever
public elevator le wished. Mr. Snow, an old
manipulator of grain, a man who has bren
-on the Board for many years and knows the
traditions of the trade, interpreted that clause
as I did.
Mr. Justice Turgeon wanted to clarify those
words, but when the Bill went into the Commýittee on Agriculture of the House, of
Commons there was, from what I have heard,
a formiidable lobby, and the clarifying process
took place in favour of the elevators, and
thr Bill was passed in that way. Last, year
a private member moved to restore the right
of the farmer to direct his grain to whatever
,elevator he migît chose, but dissolution preventrd action by this Parliament. Now we
bring forward a Bill to give the farmer the
right, whicl le possesed up to 1925, to route
his gratin where he pleases. The Grain Commiissioners being asked by the Minister of
Trade and Commerce to try to find some way
of bringing the parties nearer together, ýuggested that the farmer should have the right

to route his grain to wlatever elevator le
chose, leaving the responsibility upon the
owner of the country elevator to give him. the
grade whicl lie had recognizedltat the
country elevator owner should remain responsible for the grade, but that he should not
be, responsible for the weight.
The farmers of the West said that from
1912 to 1925 the country elevator owner was
responsible for grade and the weight, and
thry insisted that thr right which they had
enjoyrd up to 1925 shouild be restored in its
entirrty. Thr present Bill restores that rigît
in its entirety. That situation was discussed
in the Committer, and it was decided that
thr Bill should be passed without any amendment. There was discussion pro and con, a
diversity of opinion. and a sharp line of
cleavage, and an amendmrnt was moved as
a compromise, that the suggestion of the Grain
Board be substituted. That amendment was
rejected, and there we are wit a Billto amend
the Canada 'Grain Act, and to restore, as I
believe, the right which thr farmer had.
Now, sorne question lias bren raised as to
the effect of that amendment upon trade in
general, conditions being different from what.
they were prior to 1925, and the argument
lias bren advanced that thr owners of the
public elevators in Fort William and Port
Arthur, who have invested considerable capital, would possibly be injured if thr farmer
had the rigît to send his grain to a Pool
elevator, and not to one of thr publie elevators. I believe thr conditions are suoI that
the owners of those terminal elevators will
continue to do business, at ail events with
that part of tIr farming comrnunity that dors
flot brlong to the Pool; and they will have to
conform, to tIr changing conditions of trade
as they take place from year to year and
from decade to decade.
In 1919 there was an inquiry by a Committee of thr Huse of Commons into the profits
made by the elevator cornpany at thr expense
of the farming cornmunity.
Gradually the
farming comrnunity of tIr West had corne
to the conclusion that tîey were paying 200
times too much for thr services that they
were receiving, and it was this realization
which promptrd them to organize for their
own defence. I will read but one question
whirh was asked Mr. John I. McFarland, a
dirertor of one of these large elevator rompanies Iaving elevators in the West as wel
as a terminal elevator. I quote froin page
993 of the Journals of tIr bouse of Commons, a question put by *Mr. Davis:

that has come to our notice. How do you account for this? Roughly, you have made 99
per cent in dividends on common stock in the
last six years; that is a calculation ffrom your
statements, and your accumulations in investments and the increase in value in your properties and reserve amount to nearly $5,000,000
in excess of your original assets. So that means
nearly 300 per cent earnings in six years on a
capitalization of two and a half million dollars. These are certainly large profits. Have
you been margining your grain; have you been
hedging?
The answer to that was:
No, sir, very seldom.
From this statement it is apparent that
tremendous profits are made in that trade,
and the farmers of the West said that it was

a measure of sympathy, and should extend to
them the rights that they enjoyed under the
Act of 1912.
Now, I find a resolution passed, I believe
unanimously, by the Legislative Assembly of
the Province of Saskatchewan on the 22nd
It says:
of February, 1927.
That, whereas in the revision of The Canada
Grain Act in 1925 the Dominion Parliament
did not establish the right of the producer to
consign his grain from the country elevators
to his own choice of terminal elevator, with
full protection as to grade and weight; and
Whereas the Dominion Government has intimated its intention to introduce at this Session a Bill amending The Canada Grain Act;
and
Whereas the establishment of the aforesaid
right by statute is of vital importance to the
welfare of the producer of grain and to the
continuance and extension of the co-operative
system of marketing grain;
Therefore, be it Resolved, That this Assembly
declares itself in faveur of the aforesaid rights
being established in their entirety, and requests
the Government to urge the Dominion Government to introduce the necessary amendments
embodying this principle and guaranteeing the
aforesaid right by statute.
Here is the Province of Saskatchewan speaking unanimously in favour of the right of the
farmer, and I should be very muoh surprised
if a representative of that community, which

is exclusively or almost exclusively a farming
ceommunity engaged in the raising of wheat,
should in this Chamber put any obstacle in
the way of restoring to the farmers of the
West the right which they enjoyed under the
Act of 1912, and of which they were deprived
by the amen&nent of 1925.
I move the third reading of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Just one word. It is

members of this House who were not present
in the Committee room I would like to ask
the honourable gentleman whether he is able
to supply any information as to the proportion of grain that is pooled. He referred to
the question of trade and to the pooled
grain. What proportion of the grain of the
West is pooled? Also, what proportion of
the elevator space at the terminal points is
Pool space?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We had information last year as to the proportion of the
farmers who were in the Pools. My memory
does not carry me back to that. My honourable friend from Moose Jaw (Hon. Mr.
Willoughby) may be able to give us the
figures. I have been told that the number of
farmers in the Pools has increased since then,
but I could not state the proportion.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: It is 60 per cent,
I am instructed.
What about the
Hon. Mr. BELAND:
elevator space at the terminal points?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I have not the
data of last year; but in another connection
I have some information to give the House.
There has been a change in conditions since
last year, owing to the fact that the Saskatchewan Co-operative Elevator Company, who
had a large system of elevators at the head
of the Lakes, has been taken over by the Pool.
My information is that the Pool has 650
country elevators in the three Provinces,
largely in consequence of that absorption of
the Saskatchewan Co-operative. At the head
of the Lakes it has six terminal elevators,
with a storage capacity of about 18,000,000
bushels. My recollection is that 55, 56, or 57
million bushels is the total storage capacity
at the head of the Lakes.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: Thank you.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, my honourable friend
(Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has in part laid before
us the results of the meeting of the Banking
and Commerce Committee, and in a somewhat

APRIL 9, 1927
larger part hie has made a very fervid appeal
ini favour of the Bill as it cornes from that
Committee. There are, however, seile considerations which have been presented, hoth
last year and this year, to the Comnmittees
whieh in each case have had this subject biefore them. These considerations are probably
flot altogether known by members of the
Senate who were flot members of the Coinmittee, or who did flot attend that Coinmittee.
My honourable friend ha sa.id that the
Commifitee decided in faveur of -. Bill as
the
it was presented to the Comijtee, and
against the amendment whicli waë proposed.
That is true, but 'the force of that remark
is considerably diminished, I think, if it is
fol¶owed by the sta.tment, with respect te,
tihat decision, that those in favour of the
present Bill had 14 votes and those against
it had 13.
Hlon. Mr. I)ANDURAND.
Those are flot
exactly the figures.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
What are the figures?
Hon. Mr. SHIARPE: That is what I understood.
Hon. Mr. DANDURA'ND: It looked like
that, but when the figures were examined it
was found bhat an honourable member of the
Senate had voted who was flot on the Coinittee.
Hon. Mr. ROBE.RTSON: Which way?
Hon. Mr. BELAND : Was hie among the
13?
Hon. Mr. DANDURANq): Hie was arneng
the 13. It was lucky that his naine could
be taken from the 13, for 13 is supposed to
be an unflucky number.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
That was the decision made by the Chairman, as I heard it, and I give it se it carne
te me. The fact that is brought eut by
that statement is that the jurors were pretty
nearly evenIy divided on the question
whether or net the farmer had that right
in 1912 and it was taken aws.y from him in
1923 or 1924Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
In 1925.

thorough. Adde1d tc, the investigation of
the preceding Commnitte-, it broueht out

able. Yet we have this condition of things.
My honourable friend who leads the Government was very positive, both here and in
Committee, that this right existed, and those
who took the samne view held that opinion
strongly. On the other hand, it was held
as etrongly that the fariner had flot that
right in 1912. Se it may flot be amisa to
have the Senate understand that at least
there is a difference of opinion, and Lt is a
difference founded upon the conclusions of
very eminent counsel.
Mr. Isaac Pitblado, an eminent counsel
from Winnipeg, gave a reasoned opinion last
year before the Committee, and it wuss uhstantiated at the meeting of the Committee
yesterday. The concluding sentence of Mr.
Pithlado's statement. is this:
It is therefore submitted that the producer
did flot under the 1912 Act have the legal
right te select the particular terminal elevator
te which hie wiahed the grain consigned.
That is a plain English sentence.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f the solicitor.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is the conchuding sentence cf the statement which was given te the Committee.
There are eminent counsel ini other cities
than Winnipeg; one, particularly ini the city
of Toronto, and another particularly in the
city of Montreal. Mr. Lafleur, whose nanme
is recognized as thst of a very eminent counsel from. the city cf -Montreal, after having
gene over the presentation and the conclusion
by Mr. Pithiado, says:

is naine is known
and his status thoroughly established. Mr.
W. N. TilIey says:
1 have carefully considered the above, and I
entirely cencur with the opinion expressed.
I have great respect for the hegal opinion
cf my honourable friend who leads the Goverfiment in this flouse (Hon. Mr. Dandurand),
but when eminent lawyers like Mr. Pitblado,
Mr. Tilley and Mr. Lafieur hold an opinion
which is absolutely opposite te .the opinion of
my honourable frîend, I am flot lacking in
ceurtesy te my honourable friend if I take
leave te say that I have a certain degree cf
confidence in relying upen the opinion cf these
three eminent counsel in this particular case.
It is. something foT honourable members of
the Senate te understand that legal opinions
differ with reference te this question, and that
it is open te anyone te, confide bis judgment
according te his belief in the efficiency and

SENATE

324

capability of these counsel. It is at least a
disputed question. Nobody can cavil at a
statemenit of that kind.
The appeal which was made in the Committee, and has been made here, would be
a strong appeal if it were absolutely uncontradicted. It is to the effect that the farmer
had a certain right before, that it was taken
away from him practically by a decision or
recommendation of a Committee of the other
House, and that it is our duty to restore it
to him. We are left in this position, with
reference to that argument, that it is a disputed point, and most eminent counsel are
on the negative on the question whether or
not the farmer did have a certain right in
1912, which was taken away from him in
1925, and which it is our duty to restore to
him in 1927.
Another statement which was made by my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) may
not be quite so strong as it was when it came to
the Senate, if other circumstances are taken into
account. A Royal Commission went through
the three Prairie Provinces from end to end
and took twelve months or more in making a
thorough investigation into the workings of
the Grain Act. That Commision held meetings in every important section of the three

to come, state his grievances, and have them
investigated. During the course of that whole
investigation by Mr. Justice Turgeon and his
confreres, who met in all parts of the Prairie
Provinces, there was complete freedom for
the submission of grievances and the giving of
evidence, either for or against. After the
twelve months had passed that Commission
made its report. The statement stands uncontested, I think, that between the covers
of that report you cannot find that there was
taken before that Commision at any place in
any one of the three Prairie Provinces, any
grievance to the effect that the farmer had
in 1912 a right which was taken from him in
1925, and that this grievance ought to be
remedied.
I would draw
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the attention of my right honourable friend to
the fact that the farmer had no grievance at
that time. His right had not been taken
away from him or challenged.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
The year 1925 is not very far removed from
1926, and in 1926 the question was dominant
in Ottawa and in the three Prairie Provinces.

Because of the

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Well, it seems to me that if from 1912 to 1925,
a period of thirteen years, there had not transpired a single event which was big enough
to constitute a grievance to be taken before
that Commission, there is something a little
weak in the assertion-not to call it an argument-of my honourable friend.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
grievance then.

There was no

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Now, take into account the uncontested fact
that during the whole investigation no
grievance was urged, and that in the report
of the Conmissioners this subject wes net
alluded to at all.
Commissioner Turgeon's name has perhaps
greater weight, when mentioned as that of
a Commissioner appointed to carry out such
and such a work, than would have the more
democratic names of the members of the
Board of Grain Commissioners. So my honourable friend takes all the advantage which
is justly his in mentioning Commisioner
Turgeon in reference to the next phase of the
transaction.
What was the next phase of the transaction? The grievance, such as it was, came
to the front. There was a certain transaction
in which a grain elevator received a request
from a farmer that his grain should be routed
through to Vancouver instead of to the head
of the Lakes. The grain elevator man, reading the Act, and reilying upon the authority
which he thought he had, told this farmer
that he had no right to route his grain through
to Vancouver; that he must route it through
to the terminal point at the head of the
Lakes. So that question arose-before whom?
It arose before the members of the Grain
Commission, and the members of the Grain
Commission very quickly told this elevator
man that he was wrong, and that the farmer
had the right to send his grain to the terminal
point at Vancouver, just as he had a right
to send it to a terminal point at the head
of the Lakes. Well, the Grain Commissioners,
the three men, having that practical question put to them, and that difculty, which
they solved in that particular case, came to
the conclusion that it would be a wise thing
to solve it generally, and eliminate it as a
point of contradiction or of prohibition. So
they themselves suggested that there should
be an amendment to the Act by which that
doubt should be solved!, and the question
should be made clear whether or not the
farmer had the right to say to what terminal
point-which is different from the terminal

upon the question and put his decision -in the page 48, was substantiaily identical with those

SENATE

a position at that time, nor did they wish,
to provide efficient machinery for carrying
grain from the different parts of the western
prairies to the head of the lakes, and so on
towards its market. Who came to the front
at that tim.e? Private individuals, animated
by two motives, one being the human motive
which saw a business out of which something
could be made, and the other the idea of service to vital interests in the country by providing efficient methods of moving those products
to the world markets. Those individuals put
their money into the construction of rural
elevators, and also in connection with them,
terminal elevators at the point where storage
was demanded and must be had, else the whole
business would be lame at one end, and the
two had to be carried on together to make
a perfect machine. The investors had the
profits which came from both classes of elevators, and this was perhaps an attraction
to capital to go into that business at all.
It is stated, I think without contradiction,
that up to 'the present time, some $85,000,000
has been invested in that business, and the
farmers grain is taken from his hands and
placed in a direct channel of communication to the markets of the world. For that
service the farmer pays certain fees and dues,
both to the country elevator and to the terminal elevator; and those dues were under
the direct control of Parliament which formulated enactments. If the charges were too
great, Parliament had the right to bring them
down. Those rates were reduced by degrees,
and they have always been subject to examination and review and rearrangement if
found to be too high.
At that time there were no pools; but
within the last few years the farmer, exercising
his absolute right, concluded that he must
do more than raise grain-that he must also
take hold of the handling of it. It is perfectly
within his right to do that, and to make out
of it all the profits 'which are possible in
handling the produce of his own hands; no
one controverts that right; I think everybody
congratulates the farmer on rising to that
point of view. If lie can increase his profits
by handling the grain which formerly went
to another party, it is his right and privilege,
and in a way it is his duty to do that, and
make the most lie can for himself.
In the course of that provision of machinery,
money was invested, and money rights are
involved; therefore, while the farmer has a
perfect right to engage in the grain-handling
business, he ought not, as Mr. Robinson very
truly says, to commit an injustice to business
concerns with which lie is competing. Competition is fair, but it never pays for one party
Hon. Sir GEORGE POSTER.

in competition to do injustice to another
party, and thereby seek to make his gains
greater. Such conduct reacts on himself; it
is against the idea of human justice, and
economy, and good working business.
Now we come to this year, 1927, and the
Minister of Trade and Commerce, seeing that
this question is to come up, and that his
Department is the one involved, naturally
looks to the three men who for 20 years in
the West have been immersed in and
thoroughly conversant with all the ins and
outs of grain production and grain handling.
The Minister naturally says to himself: "There
has to be legislation; I think I had better
get the view of my three Commissioners, who
not only have their own personal experience
for the time they have been on that Board,
but who inherit the accumlated experience and
wisdom of the Board for 20 years, and of
those who have preceded them." The Minister therefore asks for that opinion, and
gets it, and along with it he gets a draft of
amendments on which these three Commissioners unîite, based on their personal observation and experience during 20 years. They
recommend to their Minister to take those
amendments in place of the second and third
sections of the Bill as introduced. Their
view is that that was a compromise which
would be fair to both sides, would not parttcularly injure anybody, and would solve the
problem. The Minister may have considered
those amendments, or not; I am not going
to seek to inquire into the secrets of a Department; but this much is sure, that when that
Bill was brought up for second reading in
the House of Commons-not by the Minister
himself but in his absence by a Minister who
had nothing to do with his Departmentand was passed through in three minutes'
time, no intimation was given to the 245
members of the House of Commons that the
opinion of those experts had been obtained,
and that it was crystallized in the amendment
which they recommended the Minister and
the Government to accept.

tbat the memnbers of the Senete sbauld have
this proposition before tbem, so that they can
exercise their judgment upon it also. TheÎefore I propose ta move that the Bill be not
now reed the third time, but tbat it be
amended by striking out subsections 2 and 3,
and substîtuting therefor the amendaient refcrred, ta.
Tbis emendment gives absolute right ta the
fermer ta have bis own grain delivered, at bis
option and will, either at the rural elevetor,
in wbich he places it for storage, or at eny
terminal elevator or terminal paint in Canada that ýhe chooses. It iis eibsolutely bis right
ta control it. Suppose he puts 2,000 bushels
of grain in the country elevator, and gets bis
ticket sbowing the weight and grade of that
grain, and the semple is taken and kept
mutually. That is bis grain in storage. At
any marnent tbereafter hie can corne back ta
that rural elevator man and say: "I want
you ta weigh out 2,000 bushdls of grain of
the grade that is on tlhis ticket, wihich -I
delivered ta you," and it is the duty of the
elevetor man ta do so when asked. Or the
farmer can sey ta the elevator man: "I don't
want ta teke this grain out ta ship it myself;
it is deposited witb you; I want you ta, send
it to such aud such a terminal point, and ta
such and sucbh a public elevatar at that terminai point;" and bis commrand must be
obeyed. the elevator man lias ta deliver et

327

that point the grain -in grade which was put
ini the rural elevator by the farmer himnself.
That gives the farner absolutely hie right.
But when the farmer cornes ta the rural
e-levator man and eays: "You. have my grain;
you have stored it; I have your ticets; I
want you nhow to, weigh this out; 1Iam going
to ts.ke that grain and ship it myself;"l then
this amendment says-anid it seems to be a
fair thing: "Very well, if you take your
grain out of the elevator, and get wlhat you put
in, in weight and grade, and then, undertake to
ship, it yourself by whatever route you please,
and to wbatever elevator, you mnuet take the
responsibiity of getting the grain there. When
it gets there you will get the grade, but
yau mut take the responsibility for the
But
weigbts." Is that not sibsoiutely fair?
if the grain remains, and is sent by the
elevator man himself, then the elevator man
bas t'a deliver it, as per usual, at the terminal
elevator.
Those are the two principal points in the
matter. First, if this amendment is passed,
the man who produces the grain, or gives it ta
the elevator, holds the disposition of it absolutely in bis own hands, but bie is not in a
position to say: "If I interfere with the
business that you bave been carrying on, and
in wbich you have invested your money, and
take away from you a part of the earnings
and profits whîch otherwise would be yours,
tben I muet release you from the responsibility of carryîlg tbe grain ta the terminal
point as far as weights are concerned." That
ls al].
Now, it seems ta me that an amendment of
that kind, backed by the authority of the
Grain Commissioners, with their stetement
tbat this wiil bie eminently fair and just ta
bath parties--wbich I believe bas been acceded ta by the grain-handling people, but
not by the grain producers--will commend itself ta the fair-mindedness of the members of
this House. This is the amendment:
2. Such receipt shall also state upon its face
that the grain mentioned therein bas been received into store, and upon payment or tender
of payment of ail lawful charges for receiving,
storing, insuring, delivering or otherwise handling sucb grain 'which mey accrue up ta the time
of the return of the receipt, the grain is deliverable to the person on whose account it has been
teken into store, or ta bie order, either (a)
from the country elevator where it was received
for storege, or (b) in quantities not lees than
cerload lots on track at a terminal elevator
at such terminal point in the western inspection
division as the owner may specify (or an track
at such proper terminal elevator at or adjacent

the transportation company delivers the grain
at such elevatar and the certificates of grade
and weight are returned.

SENATE

Where delivery is made into cars on track at
the country elevator, the country elevator operator shall weigh the grain into the car or cars
provided therefor, and keep a correct record of
the weights, and the bill of lading (if issued)
and a true copy of the drafts of the grain as
weighed shall be delivered by the country
elevator operator to the owner, or mailed forthwith to him at his last known post office
address, and also, if requested, an affidavit of
weight made by the elevator operator shall be
furnished to the owner. Upon complying with
these provisions the country elevator shall be
relieved from further liability for grades and
weights except in so far as the subject to grade
and dockage ticket otherwise provides, and subject to such regulations as the board may determine.
Where delivery is to be made at a Terminal
point, the person delivering the grain to the
country elevator may at the time of such delivery select in writing the particular terminal
elevator to which lie wishes the grain consigned.
If such selection is made as aforesaid, the
country elevator shall weigh the grain into the
car or cars provided therefor, and keep a correct record of the weights, and a true copy of
the drafts of the grain as weighed shall be
delivered by the country elevator operator to
the owner, or mailed forthwith to him at bis
last known postoffice address, and also, if requested, an affidavit of weight made by the
elevator operator shall be furnished to the
owner. Upon complying with these provisions
the country elevator shall be relieved from
further liability for weightà (notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in section
158 of this act) but shall not be relieved from
responsibility for grade or for the preservation
of the identity of the grain if the grain is
special binned.
Where delivery is to bo made at a terminal
point and the person who delivered the grain
to the country elevator did not select as aforesaid any particular terminal elevator, the country elevator may consign the grain to and
deliver it on track at any public terminal
elevator selected by the country elevator, unless
otherwise mutually agreed upon in accordance
with the provisions of section 140 of the Canada grain act, and in such case the country
elevator shall be responsible for weights and
grade at the terminal point.

Hon. N. A. BELCOURT:
Honourable
gentlemen, I promise to be very brief. This
Bill is wholly predicated on the right of the
farmer to control bis grain. In opposition
to that right there bas been set up in some
Hon.

Sir GEORGE FOSTER.

mysterious way the claim that at some time
or other lie has lost bis right, or has waived
it.
Now, what is tihe legal relation between the
farmer and the grain handler? It is simply
that the grain handler undertakes to store,
conserve, ship and deliver the grain. I have
failed to find anything more or anything else
in the agreement between the owner and the
grain handler. There is nothing in that agreement which, for instance, in any way indicates where, when or how the grain handler,
the warehouseman, shall discharge his duty
to deliver the grain. There is no indication
of any particular terminal point at which it
is to be delivered, nor any indication of any
elevator at the terminal point in which it is
to be stored pending shipment.
The owner bas not parted with bis absolute
right to control the delivery of bis grain-a
right which, after all, is just as strong as his
right of ownership in the property itself.
He remains the owner of it all through. The
grain handler has acquired absolutely no right
of nny kind in that grain. He has not even
a lien for bis services, for the simple reason
that he is paid at the outset. Every service
which lie is to render is paid for. Honourable
gentlemen will remember that in addition to
the remuneration for bis actual services lie is
allowed a deduction of one-half cent per
bushel, which is made in order to cover loss
that may be incurred between delivery in
the warehouse and delivery on board ihip at
the terminal point.
The grain handler bas acquired no right
whatever to control or direct the grain in any
way. The day after the agreement is made
the owner may go to the grain handler and
tell him: "I do not want my grain shipped;
I want my grain back. I want to use it on
my own farm-I want it for my personal
needs." Or lie may say: "I do not want this
grain shipped abroad; I want it kept on this
side. I want to send it to a particular mill,
in order that it may be turned into flour."
The grain is bis property, subject to bis
control every minute of the time it is in the
elevator in which it bas been deposited.
It has been argued that the farmer lost
this right, but nobody bas shown when, how or
by what means he lost it. It has not been
affected in any way. Between the time the
grain is delivered to the warehouse, under the
conditions which I have described, and the
time it is shipped out, no event or circumstance occurs which can in any way affect
bis control of or title to the grain.
The right honourable gentleman who moved
the amendment (Right Hon. Sir George E.

APRIL 9, 1927
Foster) quoted three learned members of the
legal profession, for whom I have very great
respect, but honourable membere will have
noticed that the right honourable gentleman
merely referred to, a conclusion. Re only repeated the statement made by these gentlemen, that in their opinion the fermer did net
have the riglit te centrol. hie grain. We do
net know on what that statement je based.
No reason bas been given for it. One would
think that the riglit bonourable gentlemen
had in mind that we should accept that view
as if it were the decree of a court, or as if
it were the opinion of independent legal
gentlemen. It was not. Those gentlemen
were retained by the grain handlers and tbey
were acting merely as counsel on their bebaîf
in expreesing that view.
We bad, on the other band, the very opposite view expressed by counsel who are
probably just as leamned and have just s higli
a reputatien. We cen take neither one nor
the other. We must exercise our ewn judgment in the matter. Our function in this
case, it seeme te me, pertakes more of a
judicial eharacter than meet measures whieh
this House lias from time te titne te consider
and decide. We are judges in this instance,
and we have te judge eccording te the rights
of ithe parties aa we understend thein.
We have ne rîght te de what the riglit
honourable gentleman wants us te do, that is
te make a bargein between these people.
That ie whet 'bis ameadment amounte te.
The grain handlers aesume-why, I do net
know-tbat by the agreement they have made
with the producers they have acquired the
riglit te control the grain. As I sey, there ie
nething te support' that assuffptien, and it
je beceuse of it that the whole of this trouble
lias arisen. If in deeling witb the farmere
they lied provided that tbey sbould have
control of the grain and might direct it te eny
elevater of their own choice, I could understand their position; but tbey have not
done that, and it je because the fermers now
refuse te allow tbem te exercise contrel, and
because the farmers and the grain bandîcrs
have net been able to come te terme, that
tbis amendment je proposed. In other werds,
if we accepted the amendment we sbould be
making e bargain between persens wbo cannot
agree, and we sbould at the saine turne be
jeopardising the riglit of one of these parties,
putting bim under a very serieus handicap
in dealing with the other party. We have ne
rigbt te do that. We muet decide on thie
Bill in accordance with the riglite ef the
parties. We ýcannot afferd to intervene in
faveur ef the one as against the other, as we

329

should be doing if this amendment were
carried.
1 have only one word to add, and it je thie.
The right honourable gentlemen spoke of
moral duty, or some sort of mora1 justice
whieh the Senate muet consider. 1 do not
think that that argument bas any eerioue
foundation whatever, because the record shows
that the grain handiers have made enormous
profits in the past. The honourable gentleman who leads the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) gave an idea of what theee profite
were. Surely that fact would remove any
occasion or necesity for considering thie question in the ilight of moral justice or upon
grounds od equity.
I am strongly against -the proposed amendment, heceuse, as 1 say, it would take away
from the fariner a right wbhich is hie--a right
which ie inherent to, hie right of propertya right whîch I think je just as strong and
unquestionable as his right to the ownership
of the grain; we should be putting bis rival
in a position to exercise a right which is
purelly and exohisively hie own.
Hon. J. S. McLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, 1 hope it will not be unacceptable to,
the House for me to create something of a
diversion in the course of the discussion on
this very important subjeot. Both in the
Committee and here, this discussion 'bas dealt
very largely, almost exclusively, with the aegal
aspects of thie case. Reference bas been made
to thie Act, that Act and the other Act, and
we have been told how thie amendment, that
amendment and the other amendment came
about. 1 would like the House te, give some
attention to this question in its relation to
the many agencies that have built up the
whole grain trade of Canada, and to remember how important that grain trade is, not
only -to the fearmer, but to the whole economy
of the country, and how extreordinery bas
been its develo'pment.
Within the memory of the youngeet member of this House no vessel drawing twenty
feet cou-Id proceed up the St. Lawrence ai
fer as Montreal. There was no export of
grain frein tihe Northwest. What grain wae
grown there wae grown about the little settiemente, mostly along the Red River and in
isolated places on the prairies. Wben grain
growing wes begun people saidi, yes, the soi1
was good, but the climate was se bed that
the crops would f ail at iest one year out
of four. We have developed the varions
egencies whicb finally bave put Canada, witb
only 9 millions of people, into a predominant
position in the grain trade of the world. The
best wheat in the world, it bas been proved

330

SENATE

over and, over agein, through the prizes won
in international competitions, 'bas been grown
in districts which bad been considered unsuitable. Yf any white man, other than an
officiai of the lludson's Bay Company, went
to any of those districts, he came back and
wrote a book, here or in England, about his
wonderful feat. What a great development
bas taken place in f orty yearsl! Montreal
is now the largest grain port in the world.
We have a systemn wbich, for celerity and for
cheapness in collecting grain and forwarding
it for shipment, or utilizing it in other ways,
bas no rival.
Various agencies have developed this interlocking system whicb brings a flow of wealth
to the Dominion of Canada, and the importance of wbicb bas not yet been fully estimated, and will go on increasing and increesing. It is a joint contribution, an interlocking effort. No. one can fail to give the palm
to the faî'mer, and bis colleagues, se to speak,
wbo went eut on tbe Prairies and developed
tbem; but credit ougbt to be given also to
tbe people wbo built the elevators and tbe
railroads, and to aiýl who contributed in onc
way or anotber to tbe splendid resuit achieved,
in wbich we are ai interested and cao ail take
pride.
Now, witb regard to tbis particular question,
certain people built up egencies by wbicb tbe
grain of the fermer could be collected and
shipped. I notice tbat the discussion has ahl
revolved around the farmer, as being tbe one
interested in tbe grain. Tbe farmer is interested as long as be retains bis warehouse
receipt, bis ticket for tbe grain; but tbe carload of grain, witb wbich we are now dealing,
may belong to anybody. It may belong to
a grain exporting bouse in New York; it
may belong to people in Enýglend; and I
cennot sec how tbe question of tbe terminal
elevator is of intcrest to the farmer or tbe
producer as a sbipper of grain. I am speaking now of tbe days before the change, before this question arose as a practical one,
end wben any clevator at the terminal point
was equalily advantageous to tbe farmer. In
other words, he could get as good a price for
bis grain, and could get as good care taken of
it, and tbe seme rate of insurence and equally
good facilities for shipmnent at eny elevator.
But when the fermer became interested in
the pool, tbe situation cbanged. Being interested in tbe profits of the pool, he tbcn
became interested in having the grain go to
the elevator from wbich sucb profits migbt be
drewn, rather tban to anotber elevator in tbe
cperetion of which lie bad no direct finenciel
interest. Tberefore tbjs question bas become a
live one.
Hon.

Mr. MeLENNAN.

We are aIl familiar with whet happened
before the Committee lest year. We were
essured that the meesure now before us would
handicap, by legal1 enectmaent, one of the two
egencies which were competing for the handling of the grain of the Prairie Provinces.
On the one hand we have the pioneers in the
building of elevators; on the other hend are
the people who by co5peretion. are endeavouring, and apparently witb greet success--and
beaven knows, I and ail others in Canada wish
tbem well-to hendle the grain for themselves, nnd tbereby reep wbatcver benefit may
be derived from thet process, which is subsidiary to the growing of the grain. It seemns
to me tbat the Bill in is present forma would
work an injustice on the pioneers in this trede.
In other words, tbey are somewbat bandicapped in their dealings with the grain producers and in their competition witb the pool
elevators, to wbicb tbe fermer who is a
member of the pool would naturally sbip bis
grain. Therefore I will support the amendment.
My first love in a business way w.es the
grain trade, and I have always been interested
in it, but I am not familier witb aIl the intricacies of the trade as et, present constituted.
I do not know enough about it, and few people
do, I believe, to give a definite opinion.
In
tbe position which I am taking I rely upon
the Grain Commissioners, who are tborougbly
famil-ier witb the bus-iness, and wlio suggested
tbe amendmenýt ne a solution to a Minister
wbo obviously felt that there would be somre
eýdvantagc in having this question settled
amica'bly.
SomneLhing bas been said about the enormous
profits of those engaged in the grain brade.
I know that the trade bas not chenged in this
respect sinýce I knew ît personally.
It is a
trade whicb is peouliarly bezerdous on account
of tbe great fluctuations which take place from
time to time-sometimes very rapidly-in
tbe general ýprice of wheet, and I am inclined
to suspect that the profits of the gentleman
who wes referred to this morning by the honouî'able Leader of the House were closely releted to an increase in the velue of bis wheat.
I bave kn.own of sucb cases. For exemple,
years ego, wben the grain trade -of 'Montreel
wes trifiing as compared with to-day, one exporter whose stock of grain et the time was
no greater than be usuelly carried, found that
it ha-d increesed in velue about $1,000,000
witbin a couple of montbs.
I believe thet n'ot only in the grain trede,
but in many other lines, pools and co-operation
are economically adva.ntegeous to the primary
producer, on whom the burden of overhead

has 'been, so eu-cSsful in Eùrope and in Great
Britain, and why the ratios of exupense dO
net correspond more closely. The beat reason
1 have been able to find for that situation is
the fact that the great co-opetrative institutions
Of Europe and Great Enitain have grown up
very slowly and the American co-operative
efforts have grown very rapidly. Take for
example the Rochdale Society, and similar
groups of co-opcrstive institutions, which were
s0 solid financially that during the war .Vihey
were able to subsenibe millions of pounds to
war loans. -They started with the distribution
of a dhest of tea, and, the slicing up -of a f ew
sides of bacon, whieh they divided am.ong
their memnbers, and Vhey went on until they
owned ships and milîs and were enormously
wealthy.
I think the poois have started off with great
initial succss and I believe it will be a basis
of permanent success if their management is
sound and not over enthusiastie. But I think
that in the long run it may be better for
them and for their ultimate development,
as well as to the ultimate interest of the
farmer of the North West in getting the
maximum possible return for bis product,
that they should grow up in fair competition
with other agencies.
Hon, W. B. WILLOUGHBY: Honourable
gentlemen, I desire to say a very few words
on this question. When it came up in this
House first, I referred to the fact that last
year I had introdueed the Campbell Bill, as
it was called, and that at that time I had to
the best of my abilîty gone into the whole
question. Since that time -this has become a
Government mensure.
I am sympathetie, as you know, towards the
passing of the measure, and wiil do what I
can to effect its passage, but I do not feel
called upon to be its particular protagonist.
Unfortunately, those of ns who are members
of the Divorce ýCommittee were engaged al
day yesterday and ail this forenoon in that
Committee, and therefore had not the pleasure of hearing the address of the honourable
Leader of the House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand)
and the early part of the addiress of the right
honourable the junior member for Ottawa
(Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster).
I am going to discuss this matter in the
brief est fashion. I shahl assume that the
honourable Leader of the House has laid the

331

matter before you to-day with his usual adequacy and force of reasoning, and I hope that
in my short statement 1 may not be unnecessarily repeating what he has already said.
There hias been in this House, a departure,
nlot an unknown, but a novel departure.
Members on this side of the House who
favoured the Bill, as well as the honourable
Leader of the Government, did not sc any
object in sending it to the Committee on
Banking and Commerce, for the reason that
there was nothing to indicate that anything
new would be forthcoming there. During the
course of the debate, however, it was suggested
by some honourable gentleman that something
startling in the way of new evidence would
be placed before the Committee. That proved
to be a barren. hope. There was nothing new
adduced bef ore that Comittee, except a
recommendation or suggestion made by the
Board of Grain Commissioners, with which
1 shall deal in a moment. It has been the
almost uniform practice of this House, so far
as I know it, when matters of this character,
upon which evidence can be taken, have been
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to accept the finding of
that body when it makes ats report. After
their hearing of evidence hast year, and again
this year to a more limited extent, have we
not sufficient confidence in the Committee
to accept their finding on a more or less
technical matter?
What did we have before that Committee?
When we reached it we f ound it was simply
a recommendation of the Board of Grain
Commissioners. The honourable member for
Kings (Hon. Mr. Hughes) got to what I
referred to in the Committee a,% the crux of
the matter when hie asked Mr. Snow of the
Board of Grain Commiasioners, if the Turgeon
Bihl wa.s nlot the child of the Grain Commission. The answer was in the affirmative. Mr.
Snow was equally explicit in stating, in
answer te a question of mine, that the
Turgeon Bill, which wss ail that this Bill is,
represented the views and opinions of the
Grain Commissioners at that time. -Now, I
ask, what has induced them .to change their
views? Is it the inordinate pressure-I will
not say improper pressure-ocf- the grain
interests at Winnipeg? Those interests,-as is
their right, have taken more than one *man
who worked for the Grain Commission. They
took Mr. Magill, who, bas written, a memorandu-m for this House, which I have before
me, but which I have not completely read;
they also took Mr. Jones, one of the most
competent members of the Grain Commission. They can pay salaries that the Govern-

332

SENATE

ment will not attempt to pay. I 'will not
say that the grain interests have attempted
to steal any of the present members of the
Board, because that would be making a
reflection, but they have taken certain members of the Commission and enrolled them
under the banner of the Grain Exchange in
Winnipeg. I do not intend to throw stones
at the grain dealers at Winnipeg. I am not
a member of the pool, and I have never
earned a dollar out of it in my life; I come
as a detached person to give in an independent
way the view of the people of my section of
the country.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
I read this
morning the resolution of the Legislature of
Saskatchewan in support of this Bill.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
I am very
happy to hear that. I did not know of that.
I had not the pleasure of hearing the honourable gentleman's speech to-day.
What has induced the Grain Commissioners
of Canada to change the Bill that Mr. Snow
admitted was previously approved by them,
and drawn up at their instance? I am not
going to suggest any improper motives at ail.
But these gentlemen live in the Winnipeg
atmosphere, and, after ail, they are human.
In my opinion they should not live in
Winnipeg or Fort William; they should live
partly, or in any event should be represented in the western district; and they
should be friendly to the farmers as well
as to the dealers. I have no quarrel with
any of these people, but I have a primary
interest in the producer. He is the man that
produces this wealth.
Now, the grain tende contend that if the
Turgeon Act goes into force they are going to
be ruined. And why? Let us examine that
question for a moment.
The Grain Commissioners are the people who, under the
Grain Act fixed the charge for the handling of
grain at 21 cents. I remember that last year
the pools were willing and I think I should
be warranted in saying that they are still
willing-that the Board of Grain Commissioners, should raise the price for the handling of grain if it is proved that the present
figure is not adequate.
Statements to that
effect were published in the West at one time,
and I believe I can state that to be the case
to-day. The Grain Commissioners fixed the
present price because they thought it was
adequate. If it is not, then it is within their
power to increase it. The only answer to that
is that the loading platform, forsooth, would
take the grain. Honourable gentlemen ought
to know that there was a stage in the developHon.

Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

ment when the loading platform was comparatively desirable. The loading platform is the
place out on the country siding where the
farmer takes his grain when, as a rule, there is
no elevator, though we find theim sometimes in
places where there are elevators. The primary
purpose of the loading platform was to shorten
the distance and make it more convenient
for the farmers to deliver grain, but I do not
think that the possibility of the growth of
the loading platform is to be contemplated,
because of the enormous increase within the
last 10 or 15 years in railway facilities.
At
one time the farmers had to draw their grain
for very long distances; railway stations were
not as close as they are to-day, and there
were not elevators at ail the stations; so it
became of public service to the farmer to give
him a point nearer his home than the town
in which the elevator was situated. But conditions have materially changed by the generous system of building branch lines on both
C.N.R. and C.P.R., so I do not look for any
increase in loading platforms.
Why is not 2j cents a sufficient amount at
the present time? What additional risk is
the grain company going to take? The risk of
loss of grain lin transit from the primary
elevator to the terminal. The evidence given
by Mr. Snow before us, as well as the finding
of the Turgeon Commission, was that the
allowance of half a cent was sufficient to protect the grain dealer against loss. I remember
that the finding of the Turgeon Commission
was that the grain dealers sometimes lost on
the grade owing to keen competition between
buyers for different elevators, but that they
made up by excess in weight more than they
had lost in grades. This is a bugaboo. The
grain dealers are in no way afraid of losing
money, in consequence of the loss of grain
in transit, to such an extent that it would
affect their reasonable profit. What they
do want is the right of handling the grain
after it reaches the terminals-their own
private terminais or public terminals with
which they are in treaty; also the right of
mixing.
Before 1912, when mixing came into force,
there would not be so much in it, but to-day
the lucrative end of the business is the
handling of the grain after it reaches its
terminal, and the promoting of grades, putting
No. 2 with No. 1, and so on down the line.
That is what they want-to mix these grades.
The Pool want an equal right to mix their
grades; they are absolutely alive to the situation which affects them as well as the grain
companies; so they want to mix their own
grain. Surely there can be no objection to

-

APRIL 9, 1927
that, for as a co-operative company they
should get every cent they can out of their
awn grain, and it is in mixing that the
enormous profits are made.
I say there is a reasonabla profit to-day ta
the grain handiers dn the tariff fixed by the
Grain Commission. If it is nlot sufficient,
it can be raised by the gentlemen who have
made these recommendations for a certain
compromise on the part of the farmers in the
interest of the grain dealers ini Winnipeg and
elsewhera.
This Bill was passed by tha Gommons Agricultural Committea last year by a very large
majority, I believa. 'It passed without a
division in the other House. I remember Mr.
Kennedy, of South Central Winnipeg, speaking against it, for I watched it that year;
and W. Rogers, of Winnipeg, aiso spoke
against it. I do flot know whether thair
speaking against it has anything to do with
the fact that neither gentlemen are in the
House at the present time. I venture to say
that on no platform in the prairie Provinces,
or perhaps even in Winnipeg, of whikh I
cannot speak positively, has a candidate of
any party taken any other attitude than that
of supporting the Campbell Bill. If anyone
challenges that statamnent I want him to bring
proof af it. They did not discuss it. You
do not discuss the virtue of your wife. The
Camapbell Bill, or what it stood for, was s0
much taken for granted as giving fair play to
the farmer that I believe fia public man in
the prairie Provinces during the last election
ven'tured ta oppose it; therafore it passed
the House last year, and passed the House of
Commons again this year without a vote.
Surely in a House in which the prairie Provinces, while they have, I think, only ana
representative on the Conservative aide, are
represented 'by a large number of LiberalProgressives and members of the U. F. A.
of Alberta-suraly there would have been
someone to challenge the Government Bill
if it were not in the right direction. Yet it
slipped through without any objection whatever. The on'ly inference to be drawn from
that is that there was no reasonable objection
to it on their part, and that it corresponded
with their view.
Speaking of the genarai prînciple, while in
this flouse I shalil always be very reluetant
ta favour any action which would seriously
modify-in this case it wou'ld nullify-Government legislation after it has paased twicc
in the ather flouse, and after it has been
referred ta the people of this country. I do
nat say that under certain circumstances I
might not be disposed, ta depart from that

333

position, but I thin-k it is a good working
rule ta follow in this flouse, in the case of
a Bill which does not represent absolute
spoliation) of rights, or an aibsolute injustice
that is patent ta everybody, and which cames
ta us ai ter a general election, and aiter two
unanimous decisions of anatfler Cha-mber that
we should nat venture ta reverse it.
I appeal ta aur Emt.ern friends ta be a bit
generous ta us in the West. Tha position
of the farmer thare has been better in the
last two or three yaars; the morale of the
farmer has been enormously improved, and
I balieve that the institution of thesa pools
has done more than any one single factor ta
encourage the feeling af the farmar that he
is gaing ta ba Vhe master of his own fate,
that he is gaing ta handle his own great
staple commodity in a way that suits himseif.
The pool mnay or may nlot be the wisest
system, but I believe that some f orm of
pooling and some form of ca-operatian of
that kind is the best way ta handie a primary
product like wheat. I trust Vhat the honourable gentlemen of tha East will feel that we
af the West are te, ha considared in these
matters. I ballieve that ail the people of
Canada are ready ta consider the griavances
af the Maritime Provinces, and provide in a
generous way for them, as has -been dane i
this flousa and i Parliament. I ask honaurable mambers from the East not ta makc
this a grievance in the West.
The Dominion Parliament hms passed infinitely more drastia legisiatian than the provisions af this Bill, and tha present Gaverament has placed on the etatute book a Bill
which would have been mudh more drastie
than this, s0 far as the grain aperatars are
cancerned. Sa it is nathing new. Wa follow
that 'legisatian now by the most workable
provisions that could be enacted, doing the
leasgt injustice ta anybody.
I know the elbquence of the honourable
leader of the Government, whom we ail feol
a bit timorous af tackling, and 1 presumne
that everything in favour af the Bill has
been put farward. I do net know that I am
contributing anything new ta the disoussian.
Had I been able ta hear the whola of lis
presentation, and had I been disengaged in
the last day or twa, I might have dealt with
same phases of this question that may net
have been dealt with by anyona else.
In conclusion I venture ta point eut ta
honourable gentlemen in this flouse, and
particularly those on my sida ai tha flouse,
who voted ta îlet this Bill go bef are aur
Banking and Commerce Committea, that we
now have the finding af that Cammittea. It

33J4

SENATE

is truc that it is flot a large majority, but
it is a rnajority of more than one; on the
real vote it was 14 ta 12. 1 ask honourable gentlemen to repose confidence in tihe
action of ýthat Commjttee, and, support this
Bill.
lion. J. A. CADER: ilonourable gentlemen, 1 trust that 1 shall be able to make
my remarks brief, because I arn sure that
practically every member of this bouse wishes
to dispose of this measure as soon as possible. My first words must, be words of
apology ta the Banking and Commerce Coinmittee and to the Ho-use. The honourable
leader of the Govcrnment referred t0 the fact
that we had in Committee a vote that stood
14 ta 13, but that if should, have staod 14
ta 12. When lie made that statement I saw
him gqance towards meHon. Mr. DANT>URAND: No, noa.
lion. Mr. CALDER: -as mucli as ta say:
"The crirninal sits there." I admit the fact,
and I wish ta state briefly ta the Huse the
reason why it occurred. Last year 1 was
appointed a member af tlic Banking and
Commerce Committee, and I took part at
most af its sessions. 1 was absent during the
early part af the present Session ai the bouse,
and did nlot corne licre tilt early in Mardi.
Short]y after 1 came I had occasion ta speak
ta rny leader on several subjeets, and hie asked
me ta take interest in certain Bis that were
caming beîore that Comnmittee, and I assumed that 1 was an the Cornmittee again.
It was not unti] I liad been at a good rnany
meetings af the Comrnittee, and after the
vote had been taken, that 1 was aware that I
was nat on the Cornmittee at ail. 1 have a
complaint ta make that other gentlemen wlio
were on the Cornrittee and knew ifs mernbers allowed me ta sit fromn day ta day and
take part in the vote. 0f course I arn ta
blarne for not having looked at the record
and ascertained for myseif that I was not a
member.
Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
I arn quite
sure that no anc doubts fie gaod faith of
ary
honourable friend.
lion. Mr. CALDER: I arn quife sure my
lionourable friend does nat fhink that I did
it intentionally.
In bis cancluding rernarks this rnorning the
honourable leader af the Governinent expressed surprise that any miember from fthc
Pravince of Saskatchewan shauld appose this
Bill after reading fie resolufion af the Saskatcbewan Legislafure. Well, 1 arn gaing ta
oppase if, and I trust I shahl be able ta make
clear rny position in opposîng this Bill. Tbe
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

mere fact that the Saskatchiewan Legisiature
passcd a resolution ai that character does flot
in any sense compel me ta take the sarne
view fliat tbey did. As long as I sit in this
Ilouse, wben legislation cornes before me I
shahl perform my duties in accordance with
My responsibilities as a member af this Chamber, regardless af any resolution of that kind.
If we are considering any Bill that in my
judgrnent is unsound in principle I conceive it
ta be my dufy ta oppose if, and fiat is the
course I infend ta pursue so long as I rernain
a member af the Senate, and any afternpt ta
bring pressure ta bear upon me in regard ta
Bills af a public character will have no effeet
at aIl.
Reference bas been made ta the meeting of
flic Banking and Commerce Cornrnittee. The
bonourable leader of the Government expressed pleasure tbat that meeting was he'ld,
rnerely because hie took tbe view that flie.
evidence given by Mr. Snaw with reference
ta the righfs af farmers corroborated his own
position. Hie stated that in bis judgment the
main purpase of this Bill was ta restore ta
tbe farmer the rigbt that cxisted under the
law af 1912; fliat that right was taken away
in 1925; and that now by this measure we
are giving back that right whicli was taken
away. If I understood the lionourable gentleman, hie stated this rnarning that Mr. Snow
behd that very saine view.
Now, I rnust say that I did not take that
vicw af fbe evidence submitfed by Mr. Snow
When that statement was made a.Q a fact
tbis rnorning, I endeavoured ta recaîl what had
acfuahlytaken place, and s0 far as my rnerory
goes tbe position is tha;t wbat Mr. Snow
stated, or wliat I think hie stated, is that
the farmer always had the right ta send bis
grain ta a terminal elevator, but not fa, any
particular terminal elevator that lie chose.
Hion. Mr. DANDURAND: I tbink my my
bonourablo, friend is in errer, because I put
the question ta Mr. Snow myself, and hie
sfopped ta reflect a moment, and then said:
"Well, I bave always beld thie opinion, which
may flot be shared by every country elevator
awner, that under tbe 1912 enactinent the
,'armer biad the righit ta send bis grain ta any
elevaftor lie chose, at any terminal point."

That is wliat

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Since this rnornîng's
session I bave taken the opportundty of sec-ing Mr. Snow, and I have questioned bim
about if. Mr. Snow at firsf did nlot care ta
express any further opinion af aIl. It is

APRIL 9, 1927
very unfortunate that we have noV had this
evidence taken down, se that we could have
befora us the exact stataments. At any rate,
I have sean Mr. Snow, and hie has told meIs it just, that
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
my honourable should say that hae crossexaminad Mr. Snow otherwisa than in the
prasene cf other members cf the Committee?
Hon. Mr. CALDE~R: I darasay the statement should net ba used. At any rata, let
me say this, that my impression cf the avidenca given by Mr. Snow was te the affect
that the farmer always had tha right Vo sand
hie grain te a terminal alavaVor, but net te
tha effect that hae had the right te send hie
grain te a partîcular terminal alevator.
But that was
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the very question I put Vo him. That wae
precisaly the question that wa were discussing.
ion. Mr. CALDER: Yes. The membars
cf the Cemmittea wera present and heard the
evidance, and they will have Vo form thair
own judgment as Vo tha exact evidence given
by Mr. Snow.
This Bill has now baen bafere us for twe

oe hand many thousands cf farmers, whe hold
a certain contention as Vo what wera thair

money in tha direction cf providing grain
handling facilitias. Thasa twe intareets hold
diametrically opposite views as te the etate
cf the law, and this Parli«mant is called upon
te judge between these twe interaste.
I would lika te preface my ramarks by
stating, as has already been stated by my
bonourabla friand here (Hon. Mr. McLennan)
and by othere, that in dealing with this question I desîre it should ha claarly undarstood
tha-t I have no opposition at ail to the Wheat
Pool. I am a firm, believer in the principla
cf ce-oparatien. I weuld lilce te sea our
farmers throughout the length and braadth
cf thie country ce-oparate in se far as the.ir
marketing is concerned. No person will go
farthar than I will in that direction. I stata,
further, that the farmer is entitled to get
the very hast cent hae can get for hie labour,
and that, as far as posible, avery persan in
the position cf a middleman should be eliminatad in order that the preducer may obta4in
the very last cent hae can.

te what may bave happened znany yaars ago
in conniection with the grain handling trada.
In order to understand this Bill it je necessary to dwall, nlot at langth, 'but briefly, on a

and ilf any honourable mamber thinks I arn
nlot doing so, I shall wekoome any interruption,
on his part.
In the firet place, with the exception aif the
loading platform and the erection of certain
terminal elevater facilities at the head of the
Lakes, ail the grain handling facili ies in
Western Canada, until a few years ago, wera
provided by private capital. They cost sortewhera in the neighbourhood of 885,000,000.
Those

facilities include, in the first place, the country
elevators; in the second place, the commission
houses, that is, the liouses whera the organizations exist Vo handle the business; and, they
include the terminal elevatore at the head of
the Lakes.
Now let us examine, just for a moment, the
extent to which tihosa facilities have been

elavators throughout the Prairie Provinces
0f that numbar 3,000
number abouit 4,000.
Vo-day belong Vo what je ordinarily called, the
grain trade. Those elevators have a capacity
runiing, we will eay, frein 25,000 to 50,000
bushels, and they cst on an evêrage from

te
$8,WOe $12,000.

The privata interests, be-

SENATE
fore the Pools carne into being, constructe-d and
operated at least 3,000 of these country
elevators.
The country elevator, as I have atated, ia
only the first ljnk in the chain of these
facilities. The grain must be got to the
market. It has to be weighed, graded,
insured, taken to the terminal elevator; and
that. requirea the creation of an organization,
which is situated in the ýcity of Winnipeg.
It has onu of the largest 'buildings, I suppose,
in Canada, erected at a very high cost, aod
in that building are employed about 5,000
people. That is the organization neces.sary
to handle the business that is conducted for
the investors of $85,000,000 of capital.
At the head of the Lakes there are, we find,
terminal elevators with a eapacity of 62,000,000
bushels, and ýf that 62,000,00 bushels capacity there are 44,000,000 bushels that still
belon-, to ýprivate interests, and about
18,000.000 that belong to the Pool.
In other words, private interests to-day own
and operate three-quarters of ail the country
elevators, and they own and operate twotbirds of aIl the terminal uluvator space at
the head of the Lakes. As I see it, the situation was, briefly, this. Before the farmers
created their Pool the laws of Canada weru
such as to invite private capital to undertake
the provision of aIl thesu facilities. The
Goveroment would flot do it; the farmers
themnselves would not do it; the raiiway
companies would not do it, except wîth respect
to certain terminais. The result was that
under the laws of Canada, private capital
was invited and induced to go into tbat field
and make those expenditures to provide
facilities for the farmers. If that bad not
been done, what would have 'been the result?
We know wbat would have happened. Those
facilities simply had to be provided, and, as
I have stated, the on'ly persons who could be
induced to undertaku the work were private
individuals, in this country and out.side this
country. In any event there stands out the
faeet that under ouýr laws, whatever they were
-and I will shortly deal with the legal point
invoived-under our laws, whatever tbey
were,we allowed private capital to, go into
the three Prairie Provinces and maku an
expenditure of W8,000,000 in order to provide
the necessary facilities for handfling grain. I
say again, that ia a fact, and it is not
disputed.
Hon. Mr. GILLIS: Will the honourable
gentleman allow me to ask him a question?
It is generally conceded that prior to 1925
there were no restrictions in the matter of

aliowing farmera to designate where their grain
should go. The investment to whicb the honourable gentleman refera was made, practicaily
85 or 90 per *cent of it, during that period
when there were no restrictions. Thu investors
knew exactly the condition that confrontud
them when they made that investmaent.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Naturally I intund to
deal with that phase of the problemn. If I
fait to do so, a little latur, I hope my bonourabie friend wiil cali my attention to it. I
have it in my notes, and will deal with it
in due course.
Now let us sue for a moment wbat provision
wvas made for the remuneration to which the
trade was ent4 iled in return, for the investments made. It was not expucted that they
would maku these investments for nothing.
There must have been in the law some provision wheruby they would receive profit on
their investments. Lut us sue what was the
provision of the law with regard to the rumuneration to which the investors of $85,000i000 were entitled. In this connection I intund
omnitting- ail questions of grades, weights,
dockage and so on, because I consider siich
matters oniy incidentai to the main point at
issue.
In the first place, in so far as the country
elevator is concerned, the amount allowed is
141 cents a bushel.

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Doua that inInude sturage for any time?

Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Thuru is a puriod

Hon. Mr. CALDER: Yes. So the country elevator gets 1,1 cents. For selling the
grain the trade get onu cent a bushel; and
for storing the grain at the Lake head, in the

terminals, they get

1-4

cents pur bushel.

I say that the great buik of the wbeat in
Western Canada had been handled on that
basis, and those are the charges that are made

APRIL 9, 1927
-the amounts t.bat are allowed. So far as
I know, the only compiaint, made about those
allowances is in connection with what is peid
to the country elevator operator. That was
dealt with by the Turgeon Royal Commission, and I will read a brief steatement of
what they find. This is from page 13 of the
report:
The evidence shows that eccording to the
tariff of charges now in force the elevatorThat is, the country elevator-is compelled to render certain services at
For instance, the
less than actuel cost.
Managing-Director of the Saskatchewan Cooperative Elevator Company told us et Regina
that in his opinion the handling charge of 11
cents per hushel, allowed the country elevetor
on stored grain is inadequate, the service rendered under this head entailing a cost of from
2ý cents to 4 cents per hushel. His evidence
is corroborated on ail sides, and there seems
to be no doubt thet the present maximum
charge fixed by the tariff is inadequate.
My honourable friend from Moose Jaw
(Hon. Mr. Willoughby) cornes back with the
statement: "Well, if the charge is inadequate,
why not increase it?" He lias pooh-poohed
the idea that if it were increased. the grain
would be driven to the loading pletforms,
and hie bas intimeted that, so far as hie knows,
the loading p!atform exista only or mostly at
places where there are merely sidings and
no elevators. I arn inclined to think that he
is not quite correct in bis facts. So fer as
my knowledge goes, I doubt if there is in
Western Canada a single point of any consequence wbere there is not a loading platform.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Are they used?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: That is not the point.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: That is surely
the real point.
Hon. Mr. CALDER: My honoureble friend
endeavoured to lead us to believe that tbe
loading platformn was flot placed generally
throughout the country. You cen go to towns
Iike Qu'Appelle, Indien Head, Saskatoon-in
fact every town that lias the loading platform,
and you will find that if the loading platforni
is not used to-day it is 'because the elevator
charges bave been placed at the present figure.
Once you reise that to 3, 4, 5 or 6 cents a
bushel, the fermer is not going to pay it;
hie will take bis grain to the loading platform
and will loed bis own car and send it down
to the head of the Lakes, and save bis 3, 4,
or 5 cents a bushel. So when my honourable
friend seys that it will be a very easy matter
to -change this tariff-when lie says, "If the
country elevator is losing, for goodness sake

let it raise the tariff," I answer that jii5t s0
soon a8 you attempt to raise that tariff you
drive the farmer back to the loading platform
and millions of bushels will go over the loading platforms -in Western Canada.
Coming to the Bill itself, we find that it
is founded on the assumption that under the
Act of 1912 the farmers had, and always
exercised, the right of selecting the particular
terminal elevators to rwhich theiýr grain should.
be sent. The honourable 'leader of the House
bas said that that is the crux of the whole
question. He bas intimated time and again
that -this Bill would flot lie here et ail if
that were not true, because, theire wouqd be
no necessity for it; that the definite purpose
of this Bill is to restore to the farmer a right
that hie 'was assumedi to have under the 1912
law, and that was taken away from him by
the amendments of 1925. On the otiher hend,
those who have invested their money in thei-.
facilities- these 3,000 country elevetors and
44,000,000 bushels of terminal'space et the
head of the Lakes-they cont.end thet the
farmer neyer had thet right, and they have
al'ways held that view. They contend that
they made thieir investment on the understanding that the fermer had the right only
to designate the terminal point to which hie
should. send bis grain; that neyer ini the,
history of the grain trade in Western Canada
did hie have -the right to designate the particu-lar eleva»or to which. bis grain sbould
be sent.
Thei argument on behaif of the trade was
submitted to us last yeer by Mr. Pithiado,
and it agein comes to us in printed form.
It is very definite, very clear, and very visible. Everybody can see it and judge for
himseflf whether or not it is a proper one.
The argument conclud-es with a very definite
statement. Iýt was read this morning by one
of the members for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir
George E. Foster):
It is therefore submitted that the producer
did flot under the Act of 1912 have the legal
right to select the perticular terminal elevator
to which hie wished bis grain consigned.
My honourable friend fram Moose Jaw

Would my hionourahie friend permit me te asic him if that

We see most eminent counsel appearing on
both sides of every question that cornes before

Hon. Mr. CALDER: I quite agree with

Pitbiado does flot stand alone in his view.

are pre-eminent at the bar of Canada, and
they have joined with him in expressing the
opinion that under the law of 1912 the farmer
did flot bave the right te route his grain

Hen. Mr. BELCOURT: Weuld my henoiîrable friend tell us upon what that proposition is pre-dicated. What is the basis of

Hon. Mr. CALDER:
The argument is
b-ased upon a construction of the wbo'ie law.
That is ail set forth in Mr. Pitblade's argument. This argument was placed before those
legal gentlemen, they considered it from that
standipoint, and they bave ceme te the conclusion that Mr. Pitblado's view is correct.
We may give that whatever weight we cheose.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I ask mv honourable friend if hoe can point te anytbing in the
law which deprives tbe ewner of bis riglit of
control. Leaving aside Mr. Lafleur and Mr.
Tilley, can my bonourable friend point te
something definite upen which that opinion
rests?
Hon. Mr. CALDER: Ail I need te state
is this. 1 held the view that the iaw neyer
gave the farmer that right; that he nover bad
the right. There was nothing te give away.
The farmer's rights are explained in the
statute, and you have te read ahl of the statute.
Hon. Mr. CALDER.

There are baîf a dozen or more sections tbat
have te ho construed together. The honourable gentleman bas assumed that the farmer
aiways had that right, but bore we have a
statutec governing the whole matter, and we
must aseertain frem that what were the
rights of the farmers, and what the rights
of the companies. My honourable friend is
entitled te the view he liolds, that the farmer
alwavs had the right of full contrel over the
grain at any stage but 1 beld the opposite
view. Iloder the law of 1912 the farmer was
limited in bis rights; ho neyer had that right;
and consequentiy there was nover anything
te tako away from him in that respect. We
are entitled te differ on a peint of that kind.
At any rate, we have before us the situation
that there are two sets of opinions, and, as the

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The Committee
of Agriculture in the Bouse defined it so that
we are now returned to the Act of 1912. I
mention it at this point because it is claimed
that injustice is being donc ta the Grain
Exchange and owners of elevators throughout
the w'est -and at terminal points.
It has been said that owners af elevatars
have been losing money an the prairies. Perhaps at tirnes they lost rnoney an the storage
of grain alone, but people who have something
ta do with the trade know that the elevator
owners were traders and were purchasing grain
which they were sending over ta their terminal
elevators, and making maney an their turnover, an the purchase and re-sale, besides
having the advantage af transforming or
mixing- or grading up that grain in their
elevator.
Now, what does this ameodment aim ta do?
It allows the farmer the right ta indicate the
terminal elevator, but bis responsibility stops
there. It leaves the grading ta the country
elevator. It leaves the responsibility for the
wcight on the farrner. In what position wauld
yau put the farmer of the West if this amendment passed? Hlere are tens of thousands ai
farmers gaing ta a country elevator which has
a terminal elevatar, :and asking the awncr oi
that rural elevatar ta take their grain and
then scnd it aver ta an elevatar which is nat
that of bis campany. We are told that the
farmer will have ta be satisfied with the grade
that is guaranteed, but ha will be responsible

The proposed amendment which is before
us leavvs upon the country elevator the responsibility for the grade. Why nat leave
upon it also the reslan.sibility as to the weight?
The country clevator is paid -all the casts
incidentaI ta the carniage ai the grain clown

allowed for shrinkage ýin weight. The elevator
owners will send 45 or 50 per cent ai the grain
ta increase thýeir profits at the terrninal paint,
and they will treat in the same manner the
grain that cornes froni any farmer who asks
t'hem ta send it ta their terminal elevatar.

consideration of the Senate that the previous

That is the report that is before the
Senate.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
gentlemen, what I desîred to bring to the
attention of the House is this. Is it quite
in order to adopt tihis report without any
reference to Standing Committee on Internai
Economy? If it involves an increase in expenditure it ought, I ,think, to be made the
subject of a reference to that Committee.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Yes.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: And 1 desire to
suggest that that be done. I think there is
time to do it before Wednesday next.

SENATE REPORTING STAFF
REPORT 0F

COMMITTEE CONCURRED

IN

On the Order:
Consideration of the fourth report of the
Standing Committee on Debates and Reporting.
-Hon. Mr. Poirier.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: What does that
cover?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: That covers the
appointment of an additional reporter.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I was at the meeting of
the Committee during which this question was
discussed. Honourable gentlemen are aware
that at the end of last Session it was suggested by the able Chairman of the Divorce
Committee (Hon. Mr. Willoughby) that the
Committee should have leave to sit i two
sections. That naturally requires more reporters than when there is only one Divorce
Committee. At present we have a staff of
three reporters in all; I mean, for the reporting of the Debates *of this House andl the
Teporting of wh4t takes plaoe ini the Cominittees. With the division of the Divorce
Committee into two sections, it is fouad that
a staff of three reporters in ail is not sufficient
These matters have been brought to the at
tention of the Committee on Debates and
Reporting, and we have unanimously reoommended in our report that a fourth reportes
be added to the staff.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If neeeSsary.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: 0f course, if necessary.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Suppose that the Bill
which has been sent down to the Hlouse of
Commons, inaugurating a Divorce Court for
the Province of Ontario, becomes law. Will
the necessity for this extra reporter exist
then?
Hon. Mr. BELAND: I should think he
would hardly be necessary.
Hon. Mr. SHARPE: Has the head of the
branch recommended the addition of another
reporter?
Hlon. Mr. POIRIER: We aoted upon theý
request, cf the reporters, who stated, 'what we
founal to be true, that they were Sierworked.
You know tihere are only three to report the
Debates of the Senate and the proceedinge of

344

SENATE

Committees. The Divorce Committees themselves, as you are aware, take the time of
two or three reporters, and we thought we
should give these gentlemen some relief if
we could. That is the purport of the recommendation to the House.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: There cannot be
very much risk in adopting the report, because
the recommendation is conditioned upon the
appointment being necessary. Se for the present we may adopt the report without incurring any liability.
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Honouirable gentilemen, I think that before we take any action
at all on this question it shouId be referred to
some Committee, so that we may ascertain
definitely whether another translator is required or not. ýIt is stated here that the reporters bave asked for another official, because
they are overworked. That may be the case,
or it may not, and I think we ought to know.
This matter should be refered to some Committee who can take it up and bring in a report, in order that honourable members of the
Senate may know definitely what they are
talking about.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: If the Divorce Committee is a'lowed to sit while this House is
in session, and two reporters are required for
the twb sections of that Committee, it occurs

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The words, "if
and when necessary." If he will add those
words to the report, I suggest that we adopt
it.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER: I beßieve that is the
m-eaning of the report. It may not have been
couched as clearly as my honourable friend
desires, but I think that was the intention of
the Committee, and I have no objection at
a!l to inserting those words.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Is my honourable friend willing to make a similar qualification in his report No. 3, with reference
to the employment of another Debates Translator?
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: That matter has been
deferred.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then I move the
adoption of the report with the additional
words, "if and when necessary."
The Hon. the SPEAKER: I understand
that the Chairman (Hon. Mr. Poirier) moves
the adoption of the report, and my honour-

able friend (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) moves in
amendment the addition of those words to
the report.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Belcourt was
agreed to, and the report as amended was
concurred in.

to me that we must have two other reporters
for this Rouse. If I am correctly informed,
the Divorce Committee have sat during the
sitting of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
Honourable
gentlemen, I must say I led the House into
error. The qualification or condition to which
I have just relferred, I do not find in the
report. The report reade as follows:
Your committee have had under consideration a report frome the Editor of Debates and
Chief of the Reporting Branch recommending
the employment of an additional Parliamentary
Reporter.
In view of the increase in the amount of reporting work in the Senate and in the Committees, your Committee recommend to the favourable consideration of the Senate that the organization of the Senate be enlarged to include an
additional reporter (Parlianentary).
AIl whieh is respectfully submitted.

So the condition which I said was in the
report is net there. I was misinformed. But
may I suggest to the Chairman off the Committee that be insert in his report a limitation
of that kind? Then we can adopt it.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: "If necessary."

INSURANCE

Right Hon. Mr. GRAHAM:
Honourable
gentlemen, this Bili looks formidable, but it is
not. It is merely to piovide for some amendments reconimended by the Inspector of Insurance. For example. in the charters of most
of the Canadian in.surance companies there
is no provision for sooue of the newer forma
of insurance, sueh as the payment of double
liability in case of death by accident. One
or two companies have such a provision in
their charters, and this is to establish uniform.
ity in that respect.
Another very important item is the one
providing that iusurauce cuuîpaies ini muaking,
up their annual statements shahl include as a
liability the amount set aside for reserve.
Heretofore, apparently that bas nlot been done.
When that amount is added to the liabilities,
the statements will show more correctly and
thoroughly the standing of the companies.
Another amendment increases fromn $50,000
to $100.000 the deposit to be paid by British
or foreigo life or fire insurance companies
hefore thiey can carry on business in Canada.
The deposit for Canadian companies. will
remain as it was. Stock of no par value is
now is-ued by many companies, and in order
that these companies may mneet the requirements of the Insurance Act, a payment of a
lump sumn in dividends is provided for in lieu
of a* per cent dividend.
These arc the principal amendments contained in the Bill.

COMMISSION

IN COMMITTE

On motion of Hon.. Mr. Dandurand, the
Senate went into Committee on Bill 280,
an Act respecting- the Federal District Commissi on.

Hou. Mr. Robinson ini the Chair.
Sections 1 and 2 were agreed to.

APRIL 9, 1927
On section 3--Federal District Commission:
Bef are this is
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
carried I wouid like ta put on record my
views with regard ta this whole proposai. I
tbink a great mistake is being made in proceeding in this way. If there is ta be a
Federal District here on the lines of the
Washington Federal EDistrict, it is My vieV
i bat bef are the Commission is created the
district should be estabhished in order that
tlic investment may lie secured, and in order
that the interference of intervenoing authoritics, munýcipaî, provincial, and, se forth may
lie eliminited. By proceeding in the way
proposed in this Bill the Government are
committed ta the expenditure of a large sum
of money with fia assurance that tbey will
bie free from interference by the Province
and the municipality, ta say nothing of political interference.
Whule I am on my feet, I iniglit go a bit
furùher and say that the establishment of a
Federal District bere in Ottawa would eliminate wbat is the corse of Ottawa, and that is
petty politics. I do nat think it is incorrect
ta say that Ottawa is the political plague
spot of Canada, and that hundreds of thousands of dollars yearly are wasted here biecause of tlie intervention of petty politics.
It is a matter af common gossip that thec
members who represent the city of Ottawa
keep themselves hidden in order ta avoid
those who are pursuing them for political
favours. There are stories of dummy telephones and dummy offieces-telephones that
are not answcred and doors that do nat
open.
Hon. Mr. BELCOTJRT: Those are modern
inventions. They did nat exist in my time.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I am speaking
of the present, but I imagine my hanourable
friend could speak feelingly on this subI ect
himsel!f. Some xnembers bave even been said
ta go in disguîse.
When the snow was on the ground I happened ta notice something that lirouglit this
home te me. I passed some men who, were
apparently shovelling snow for themselves,
and the snow was flying at a rapid rate; further down the street I faund some municipal
employees at work, and the speed at which
they were working was very mucli îess than
that of the private individuals; finally I came
up oni the Hill and found some men shovelling
snow aut in front of this building, and fram
the rate at which. they were proceeding there
seemed ta be every prospect that the sun
would do thec job before they did.
Now, 1 repeat that throughout, this country
it is known that this condition prevails in

347

Ottawa, and it is believed that hundreds of
thousands of dollars are wasted by petty
Napaleon said that every
politics here.
French soldier had a marshal's 'baton in his
knapsack. I might paraphrase that by saymig this, that every littie baby that is born
in Ottawa has in its littie napkin somewhere
a. prescriptive riglit to a Government job;
and if the individual belongs to a class that
i., not out for Government jobs, belongs to
the upper classes, the wealthier fellows, then
that little baiby has in its littie napkin the
right to a fat Government contract, or the
righ.t to lease a building ta the Government
at a fairly substantial rental.
If you inaugurate a Federal Government
District here, and disfranchise this whole
community municipally, provincialiy and federally, you wiIl be following the exampie of
the Washington District, and you will be
relieving the Federal Government officiais
who have ta do business here from. the terrible
stress of pursuit by local people, supported
by the local press. It is nlot only a joke; it
is a public scandai. I venture ta assert that
if the Deputy Ministers and men of that
type w.ouid be induced to tell the truth, and
speak without fear of the consequences-a
tbing I do nlot expect t'hey will ever dothey would tell a stary of interference and
the imposition of utterly worthless people
upon them at the expense of the country.
The Government now have an opportunity,
by the declaration of a Federal District, of
curing that sort of thing, and I submit that
it should be done now. I disapprove of this
Bill for the reason that it necessitates the
expenditure of a large sum of money without
any security for the investmnent. It puts the
cauntry ta an expense every year, by statute.
The honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Beleaurt) said yesterday that the Commission might capitalize, and -borrow money
upan it. There is fia security that their policy
will be carried out without the interference*
of constituted autharities such as the municipal and provincial Governments; and there
ina assurance ta the electors who live elsewhere that those men will net be pitifully
hounded from morning until night by this
enormous class of people who have assembled
heme, who believe they have a prescriptive
right ta a job. It is mare than a joke; it is
a menace; and any man who bas had any
administrative and executive experience in
appalled by the number of people who are
standing around, wasting their time and the
maney of this country.
When I say that, let me make myseif elear.
I know that the Civil Service here in Ottawa

lion. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend think they ail corne fromn Ottawa?
Hon. Mr. GRIE8BACH: They ail live bere;
thev are attraýcted here. Wheresoýever the
carcase is, there shall the vultures be. Here
is the carcase, and I want to imprave the
carcase. I believe a mistake would be made
in passing this Bill now.
Let the Governinent take their courage in
both bands and do something worth wbile.
Let them create a proper Federa:l District, and
then those of us who live at a distance from
the Government and everybody else will be
interested in endeavouring to make this a
beautifuil city-if that is 'the idea-but a beautiful city based on the idea of efficiency in
administration.
Our first effort, our first
tbought, is not to beautify Ottawa; you carinot ask us to agree to that, but first ta make
the lay-out of this community efficient for the
purposes of Government, and incidentally ta
make it heautiful,
In order that that may be donc properly
there must be full power, aind there must be
security against the interference of intervening- authorities and the local paliticians.
For the reasons I have given I intend to
vote against this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman has said many tbfings with which
quite a numnber of members of this Chamber
are disposed ta agree, wholly or in part.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACII:

In principle.

Han. Mr. DANDURAND:
But I would
draw bis attention ta the fact that we are
in Committee, where the prineiple shouid flot
be cha'llenged. The second reading bas been
passed, and when we go out of Committee I
will put the Bill down for the third reading
an Monday. My honaurable friend may then
taik against the principle of the Bill, because
be wili bave it aIl before bini.
I tbinik I sbauld add that the Commission
wbicb is about ta 'be abolished, or ta ha
absorbed by the new creation, bas, I tbink,
won the general cammendation of the public
for the way in whicb it bas administered its
mandate. 1 think we awe it ta the Commission ta make that statement. I bave flot
followed its work personally, because I do not
live very niucb in Ottawa, and the time 1
spend here is passed in this building; but from
Hon.

MNr. GRIESBACH.

what I have hieard I know of fia criticisma as ta
the manner in which. the Commission bas
perfarmed its task or expended the sumis that
were put at its disposaI.
Han. Mr. BELCOUIRT: In regard ta the
expenditure there can be no risk, because the
Commission is nat going ta camplete or undertake any work withaut getting tbe consent
of the people wbo may bave the power or
right of contrai. For instance, if work is
attempted outside of tbe immediate territorial
l-imits of the city the Commission wiil bave
ta get the consent of the adjoining municipalities whicb might be interested. Tbey
wouid first get tbe cansent of the munýcipality of Ottawa, and then the consent of
other municipalities around.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I know; but that
is the difficulty.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But tbey cannot
and xviii not undertake any work unless they
have such consent.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH:
But does flot
the honourabie gentleman sec at once bow
they are circumscrxbed?
The Commission
must flrst ask themselves, wbat are we trying ta do here? Having settled that question in their awn minds, they sbauld then
engage proper engineers, landscape architects,
and that sort of assistance, and then they
should have power ta work ta that scheme
rogardless of what other people think.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: They bave expropriation powcrs.
Han. Mr. GRIESBACH:
I know; but
they are going ta be hampered ail alang tbe
line. It is piteaus ta me. Why, we have
abjections from Hull already. Now, Hullisl
a manufacturing tawn, and Hull bas its distinct problems, because if you undertake ta
beautify Hull you may spoil their business
sites, and ail their arrangements for the
tranisaction of tbeir business.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But nothing can
be donc there, or will be done, uniess tbey
agree.
Han. Mr. GRIESBACH: Then ]et that
questionr be settled first. If Hull is going
ta be put ta any hass, or if Hull is goîng ta
ba out, let yaur Federai District stretch the
other way. But I submit that you are anly
borrowing trouble and wasting money, and
rendering it impossible for the Commission
ta lay down and work out a large scheme
which will absorb a great sumn of money over
a long period of years. You are going ta
encourage a great scbeme, and spend a lot of

APRIL 9, 1927
money, and you have not the proper foundation to do it on. That is why I am objecting.
In answer to the honourable gentleman

late Commission that is being absorbed. That
Commission seems to have done the best it
could. I did not criticize it, and do not in-

Hon. W. B. ROSS: Honourable gentlemen,
I looked over this Bill, and thought some
what on the points to which the honourable
gentleman on this side bas just referred, but
we have no way of getting a Federal District
without changing the Constitution, so far as
I can sce. I doubt very much if we could
get the power to form such a district. In any
case, we have not got it now; so it is a question whether to go on with this new Commission or stop altogether. I can see advantages in a Federal District if we had the
authority to go on with it, but you have not
got such authority.
Hon. Mr. BEICOOURT: The Federal District need not take in the city of Hull, or
any portion of Quebec.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: How can it take in
anything?

INTERPARLIAMENTARY UNION CONFERENGE, 1925
STATEMENT AND

DISCUSSION

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will call the attention of and submit
to the Senate the Resolutions adopted by the
Interparliamentary Union at its conference
held partly in Washington and partly in Ottawa
in 1925.

He said: Honoûrable gentlemen, as President of the Canadian Group of the Interparliamentary Union it is my duty and my
privilege to call attention to the work performed by the Intenparliamentary Union at
its Conference held in 1925, partly in Washington and partly in Ottawa. I may be permitted to make certain observations with regard to the Interparliamentary Union itself,
before I proceed to lay on the table the resolutions which I desire to submit to Parliament.
The Union was founded in 1888, with nine
representatives from England and twenty-five
from France, its object being the study and
promotion of international co-operation and
solidarity. It held its first meeting in Paris
in 1889, and there were present representatives
from France, Great Britain, Belgium, Denmark,
Spain, the United States of America, Hungary
and Liberia.
Prior to 1914, eighteen Conferences bad been 'held in different countries
of Europe, and one in the United States, at St.
Louis, Missouri, in 1904. Since its very in,
ception, the Union bas each year edlarged the

At the out break of the war it comiprised twentysix national grouips and 25,000 members.

duty, its constant purpose, has been the firm
establishment of world peace.
In 1921 the conferences were resumed, when
191 parliamentarians met at Stockholm in that
Conferences were held in 1922 at
year.
Vienna, with 304 representatives, belonging to
twenty-six different States, and in 1923 at
Copenhagen, with 432 parliamentarians from
twenty-six different States.
At its meeting in Berne in 1892 the object of
the Union was specifically defined as follows:
The Interparliamentary Conference for international Arbitration is the organ of the
groups of the different members of parliament
which have been or will be constituted, for the
purpose of causing to be known in their states,
eitier by iieans of general legislation or by
means of special treaties. the principle that
differences between states shall be subnitted to
ain arbitration tribunal for settlemuent, as well
as to treat of other international questions, of
general interest coming within the idea of ar
bitration.

The Union, ever anxious to present practical
solutions. has insisted upon constant investigation and inquiry by its permanent commissions
of inquiry. There are five of those commissions, to whom have been assigned, respectively, ethnical and colonial questions,
economic and financial questions, questions of
disarmament and juridical questions, and the
study of social questions.
The International Labour Bureau has given
its active co-operation.
It is to be remembered always that the
Union has no official status or executive
jurisdiction for the enforcement of its decisions.
It has no power or other means to secure the
adoption of and submission to its decisions on
questions of international importance, except
that which is derived frem the moral influence
and action of the different national groups
composing it. Its work is merely educational.
It aims to promote the principle of arbitration
for the settlement of disputes between nations.
The Conference in 1925 was held partly in
Washington, on the invitation of President
Coolidge and the American group, and partly
in Ottawa, on the invitation of the Canadian
group. In order to defray the expenses of the
Ottawa meeting, Parliament voted the sum
of $10,000, to be implemented later if this
sum were found to be insufficient.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

and bis place muet be filled by a member belonging to another Group.
The conference was omnposed of over 440
delegatei fron 41 different nations, ineluding
Germany, which sent a large delegation, to
the number o! 28 members, il my mernory
.serves me correctly. Among these was Dr.
Josef Karl Wirth, the Ex-Chancellor of Germany, and also leader of the Centre party.
From Grent Britain, under 'the leadership of
Sir Rober't Homne, Ex--Chanceulor o! the Exchequer, there carne -a -large representation, to

Vice-President of the Conference at Washington.
The Conference at Ottawa was presided
over by niyself, with the late Senator McKinley as Vice-President, and Right Hon. -Sir
iRobert Borden, and Hon. Senator Beaubien
acted temporarily as Chairmen. As President
of the Canadian group I delivered the address
o! welcome.
I may perhaps be permitted ta read one or
two extracts fromn the first report issued by
the Union after its meeting at Ottawa:
The debate at Washington and Ottawa was
a very great success. One is convinced of this
on perusing the volume in which have been
treated the subjects discussed and the resolutions adopted. The discussions on International
iLaw, to name only one subject, covered a very
wide field, fromn the juridical as well as the
political point of view. RareIy has an international assembly given such proof of talent and
experience in a doînain so high and vast. Moreover, the purpose m-hich the organizers had set
for themselves vas fully attained. The representatives elected by the nations of many parts
of the world met and indulged in mutual explanation and discussion o! the grave problemas
enegaging their attention. They were enabled
to realize the factors which separated them
and the points o! contact at which they could
be united. The Conference at Washington and
at Ottawa was a bold undertaking, or. rather,
an act o! great courage and goodwill, which
will certainly benefit those who accomplished
it.
Then, passing on, let me read the moet important resolutions adopted by the Congress.
It is to these resolutions partieularly that I
desire to cail attention, because they show the

work done and the plans in prospect.

and invites the Comrnittee for the Study of

this purpose to a forthcoming Conference of
the Union.
These proposais would ventualiy be submitted to an international conference of nations

SENATE

I 'might mention here, in parenthesis, that
the honourable leader of the Government in
this House (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) and myself
had the honour to write the preface to this
report of Professor Pella's.
Then comes a resolution on the subject of
a "European Customs Understanding."
Seeing,
that it would be of the greatest importance
for good relations between European States
and thus contribute to guarantee the peace of
the world, if the economie barriers at present
dividing these States, wereas far as possible
-abolished,
considering further
that such measures probably, in any case
in the long run, would contribute to create a
steady and more extensive market for the
products of European agriculture and industry and therefore also to decrease the cost
of production and the unemployment in Europe,
considering on the other hand
that the question if and how such measures
could be realized, ought to be subjected to a
very close study with due regard to the
different economic conditions in different countries.
the Conference requests the Committee for
Economie and Financial Questions to appoint
a special sub-coimittee whose duty it will be,
after hearing of the National Groups, to study
the question as to what could be done to
abolish or diminish the economic barriers existing between European States, and to present
a report on this matter to a subsequent Conference.
Then follows the resolution on
Minorities:

National Minorities
"Seeing that there exist in inost European
States mixed populations conprising majorities
and

ininorities of race, langîuage or religion:

seeing

that these conlitions are liable

times to create difficult and intricate problems

by direct agreenient between the majority and

seeing that the resolution of the XXIst Conference recommending the institution of Parit-

ufile Commissions for the solution of ninority
probleins lias not received the desired consideration,
the XXIJIrd Inter-Parliarnentary Conference,
in the interest of European peace and of good
understanding between majorities and minorities
in States having a mixed population,
again calls the attention of the Groups to the
services which might be rendered in countries

with minority problems by Paritative commissions composed of an equal number of representatives of the majority and of one or other
o' the minorities and adapted to the conditions
and to the various needs of the country, with
the task of sugggesting just solutions of the
questions under dispute with a view to appeasing conflicts.
In the opinion of- the Conference paritative
commissions might with advantage pursue their
vork either within local divisions, or in conjunction with the central institutions of the
State, according to the nature of the question

to be treated.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

Seeing that the International Court of Justice
at The Hague, founded in 1921, enjoys general
confidence and esteem,
seeing that the Council of the League of
Nations has already applied te that Court for
the solution of contestations relating to the
situation of minorities, by soliciting its advice
on disputed points; seeing that the treaties
now in force provide for the reference of contested questions relating te the interpretation
or the application of existing minority treaties
to the International Court of Justice, at the
request of one of the States represented on the

Council of the League of Nations.
the XXIIIrd Inter-Parliamnentary Conference
expresses its desire that all contested questions
suitable for such reference, and particularly
those relating to the interpretation and the
application of minority treaties, should be referred by the Council to the International Court
of Justice, whether for its advice on litigious
points or for a definite solution.
The Rapporteur who presented the report
on National Minorities was Dr. Paul Usteri,
formerly a member of the State Council of
Switzerland. I regret that Dr. Paul Usteri,
who was one of the most distinguished members of the Council, has since left this world.
There was no resolution, as honourable gentlemen may remember, in regard to Noxious
Drugs. It was the last subject on the Agenda,
but for want of time it was not gone into.
The following was the finding on the question of the reduction of armaments:

which the creation of demilitarised zones on exposed frontiers, under the auspices of the League
of Nations, would have,
and recommends for the consideration of the
Groups of the Union the declaration and statement of principles annexed to the present
resolution, which might serve as a basis for the
drafting of special conventions providing for
the establishment of particular zones.

APRIL 11, 1927
The Inter-Parliamentary Bureau is requested
to transmit the present resolution with its annexes to the Groups and the Governments of
the countries represented within the Union.
B
The Inter-Parliamentary Committee for the
Reduction of Armaments is empowered tu place
itself at the disposal of Groups, desirous of
entering upon reciprocal negotiations, with a
view tu the conclusion of treaties providing for
the establishment of demilitarised zones along
their frontiers.
Plans and Method for the Reduction of
Armaments
The XXIIIrd Inter-Parliamentary Conference,
recalling the resolutions of preceding Conferences and insisting strongly upon the urgency
of a reduction of armaments for all nations;
noticing with the greatest regret that of late
years the military expenditure of most countries
shows a serious increase;
realizing, on the other hand, the necessity of
giving to the nations a feeling of security,
asks the Groups of the Union to consider
every practical means of creating such a mutual
feeling of security between the nations.
The Conference believes that one of those
nieans,-and one of the most important,-would
be a general reduction of armaments. It therefore insists on the urgency of a thorough examination of methods for the reduction of
armaments and begs the Permanent Committee
for the study of these questions to appoint a
sub-committee among its members to draft a
technical scheme for a general reduction of
armaments.
This sub-committee shall examine the two
schemes presented to the preceding Conference,
and any other suggestions brought forward in
the course of the present Conference. It may
call in experts.
Documents annexed to Resolution II on Demilitarised Zones
1
Declaration
The Inter-Parliamentary Union calls the attention of the Governments to the institution
of demilitarised zones. It also recommends to
the careful study of its Groups the report presented by its Committee for this question.
The conclusions of that report are:
that the vital problem now facing Europe
is that of security;

that so long as that problem has not been
solved, disarmament cannot be obtained.
Europe will not disarm su long as distrust of
neighbours and fear of the future subsist, for
those feelings inevitably drive the nations,
desirous though they be of peace, to remain
armed. The crushing burden of armaments
forms an obstacle not only to economic recovery, but also-and this is more serious-carries
the nations imperceptibly but with certainty
towards new conflicts and fresh disasters.
The Inter-Parliamentary Union sees in the
institution of Demilitarised Zones the possibility of creating in many cases that sense of
security essential to the peace of nations. The
creation of such zones is compatible with any
individual plan for peace and for security, and
can also, in the absence of such arrangements,
constitute a basis for more extensive agreements.

The existence of the League of Nations makes
possible conceptions hitherto unattainable; it
would be culpable not to seek to explore all the
possibilities of peace created by that new and
great outcome of human thought.
Thus, a new conception of the frontier can be
entertained. In the past certain frontiers were
a source of constant danger; frontier incidents
were always to be feared, and the origin of an
act of provocation or even of aggression was
difficult to ascertain.
The League of Nations can intervene between
the peoples and can declare that whosoever
violates a zone established between them commits an international crime to whiêh the entire
world may be witness.
In no country does the common law allow the
individual to take his own vengeance, no matter
what may be his provocation. Similarly, no
provocation should justify a nation in taking
the law into its own hand and violating an international agreement, as for instance a convention establishing a demilitarised zone. That
nation must appeal to arbitration as the individual appeals to the judge.
It is unavoidable that the creation of a zone
should entail mutual concessions, but these concessions will be limited by the fact that every
zone will be freely agreed upon and that no
zone will be established entirely at the cost of
one country. The countries concerned must not
forget that they gain the greatest of all benefits
-that of peace.
The Inter-Parliamentary Union has examined
the most difficult cases and bas arrived at the
conclusion that if the parties concerned show
good-will and are firmly resolved to succeed,
there is no case impossible of solution.
It is not proposed to thrust any measure on
any party. Suggestions have been made; agreement must rest with those concerned.
We wish, however, to utter a solemn warning
to those who may neglect this great possibility
for peace. War is now a disaster which affects
the whole of mankind. He who, by neglecting
any means proffered to him, allowed mankind
once again to be overtaken by that catastrophe,
would run the risk of finding himself the object
of the world's censure.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT.

15.--In urgent cases, if a zone state finds
that the police forces at its disposal within
the demilitarised zone of its territory are insufficient to maintain pubic order, and considers it necessary to call in supplementary
police forces, it shall be obliged to lodge a
formal notification of this measure with the
General Commission, in the exceptional event
of its not having been able to do so in advance. The supplementary force is not, however, to exceed a maximum number equal to
one-third of the regular police force, without
the preliminary consent of the General Commission.

Should the General Commission not approve
of the use of the supplementary police forces

be entitled to submit the matter to the Permanent Court of International Justice at the
Hague, which Court may, by means of a provisional injunction, request a restriction of
the forces concerned, or the withdrawal of
the measures adopted.
16.-Should a zone state believe itself unable
to maintain order with police forces and consider it necessary to send troops into the
demilitarised zone of its territory, it must
obtain the previous consent of the General
Commission.
For this purpose it shall accurately indicate the number, composition and
equipment of the troops to be employed. The
Commission may approve the measure, if necessary after certain modifications, or it nay
refuse its consent.
Tu the event of modifications being asked

the states concerned may subimit the matter
to the Permanent Court of International
Justice at the Hague.
17.-Tlie procedure provided for in the foregoing paragraphs shall not prevent the zone

provisions may be made with regard to particular zones, on the basis of an agreement
between the zone states.
19.-If the Government of a zone state raises
objections to an order or a decision of the
General Commission in cases other than those
covered by Articles 15-17, it may appeal to the
verdict of a court of arbitration. This court
shall be composed of four members. two of
wbom shall be appointed by the plaintiff government and two by the General Commission,
and of a chairman appointed by the President
of the Permanent Court of International
Justice.
20.-The zone states shall consult together
as to supplementary measures to be taken by

XXIIIrd

Inter-Pariiamentary

Con-

ference,
having examined the report of M. Horace
Micheli, Conseiller national (Switzeriand);
considering the crisis through which the
parliamentary system is now passing in almost
every country, the critîcismn and even the attacks to which it is subjected fromn the most
diverse quarters,

considering, on the other hand, that the InterPariiamentary Union is the international in-

stitution best quaiified to discuss that criticism and, in s0 f ar as it may prove justified, to

find remedies, and also to refute the attacks
directed against the very existence of the pariiamentary system. as the protector of public
liberty,
requeste the Committee for the Study of
Politicai and Organization questions, after
having instituted an înquiry among the national
Groups, to study the pariiamentary systemn in
the different countries and to present a report
to a subsequent Conference.

Acting under that resolution, I prepared
and sent to the seat of the ýInterpariiamentary
Union in Geneva a rather iengthy report with
regard to our method of government, deaiing
more particularly with the pariiamentary
system.
I may be permitted to make reference f0,

or to quote certain statements in the report
with regard to tlie social side of the Conference, and the events which took place.

The next morning at breakfast cloquent and
moving words were pronounced by Americans
and Canadians.

The delegates were received and entertained

The beautiful banquet offered at Ottawa by

by a brilliant bail, was but one of the numerous
receptions where the delegates and their families
had the opportunity of meeting the distinguished
personages of the Canadian worid.
We may mention aiso, the dinner tendered at

the great opportunity offered to visit Paris
and at the same time attend and take part in
this worldwide international conference.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I desire to take this
opportunity of saying a word on the Interparliamentary Union, without attempting to
add anything as to what it has accomplished.
The honourable gentleman from Ottawa has
already very fully covered that subject. I
wish to state that in the opinion of the
Canadian delegates the success of the Conference, especially here in Canada, was due
in a very large measure to the bonourable
gentleman who has just taken his seat. He
had in charge some 400 delegates-a rather
difficult undertaking-and lie managed so
well and everything was done so thoroughly
that everybody was more than satisfied. I
heard many expressions of appreciation among
those who came from other countries of the
treatment accorded them from the time they
arrived at Niagara until they left Canada. I
believe that more good was accomplished on
behalf of Canada among the 41 nations represented than could be accomplished by any
other method that might be followed. The
delegates all went back to their countries loud
in their praises of Canada, and in that respect
the Conference did more than all the immigration propaganda we could have devised would
have donc.
I desire to repeat that the congratulations
of this House should be tendered to the
honourable the senior member for Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt) for the very efficient
manner in which lie conducted this whole affair.

at that time, the President doubtless had very
great diffieulty in securing proper representation from Canada.
The duty therefore fell
upon the Senate, as it does in many cases,
to provide the necessary relief, for, as we all
know, we are not politicians.
I was happy to
be able te attend the Conference in Washington, and to accompany the delegates as far as
Toronto.
I echo what has been so well said
by the honourable gentleman from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. McMeans) of our distinguished
Canadian President, who contributed of his
personality and organizing ability to such a
great extent in making the Canadian end of
the Conference a complete success.

was bilingual and consequentdy was able to
communicate more readily with many of the
foreign delegates than some others would have
been.
The honourale gentleman from Montarville (Hon. Mr. Beaubien) was also there
as vice-president, and he deserves his meed of
praise for the work which lie did.
I speak
with knowledge, for aIl the Canadian delegates
were quartered in the same hotel. The president had a secretariat of his own, and there
was an infinite amount of arrangement and
planning necessary for properly carrying on
while the delegates were within our borders,
and I may say that the honourable gentleman
from Winnipeg is not the only one who has
uttered words of praise of our president on that
occasion.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

information which be has given us to-night.
I sat in the Council of the Union in March of
last year, among the representatives of several
European countries, and they were loud in
their praises of the treatment which had been
accorded them in Canada.
I felit that that
praise was due directly to the efforts of the
leader of the Canadian group, Senator Belcourt.

SENATE

I have said that there has been and is a
lack of appreciation, due, I have no doubt, to
a lack of knowledge. The people of the
Maritime Provinces are not lazy. Nobody
who has been there and has seen them believes it for a moment. They are energetic
and progressive; yet they have not progressed.
Let me revert to the time prior to Confederation. Before Confederation there was no
other part of Canada so prosperous as the
three Maritime Provinces. Our trade was in
the very best of condition. It has never been
as good since. That is a matter of history.
I do not need to go into that; because any of
you who have read the history of Nova
Sceotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward
Island, and the history of Canada as it was
before 'Confederation, will know that. If there
are any who do not know it, I will not take
the time now to argue it, but will ask you to
read the history of this country between 1850
and 1867.
Will my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend allow me to ask him a
question? What was the trend of trade? Was
it mostly with the United States, or what
proportion of it was with that country?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: It consisted of lumbering, agriculture, ship-building, fishing. They
had a market in Europe, and a market in the
United States, but naturally not very much
market in Western Canada. Almost every industry that we have ever had up to the present time had its inception between 1850
snd 1867. Much of it dried up because of
Confederation.
I will go further and call
your attention to another fact, which does not
need to be implemented by me, with regard
to the condition of trade in Upper and Lower
Canada. It is a historie fact, and I need do
no more than refer to it. At the time of
Confederation the Maritimes were exceedingly
prosperous, but Quebec and Ontario were the
reverse.
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince
Edward Island never desired to come into
Confederation. The suggestion of it and the
first, second and third requests for it, came
from the Canadas. The leading men of the
Maritimes prior to Confederation were Howe,
Tilley, Tupper and some others. All those
men were at the first opposed to Confederatien. When the matter was put before the
people of the Province of New Brunswick
and a vote was taken, the people of that Province voted almost unanimously against it.
The people of Nova Scotia never had an
opportunity to vote on Confederation until
after it was an accomplished fact. By contion. Mr. BLACK.

siderable jockeying at the London conference,
and by skilful manipulation on the part of one
or two politicians who were in favour of the
proposal, the people were deprived of the
privilege of expressing their will until after
the union had been brought about. The first
opportunity that the people of Nova Scotia
had to express their feelings occurred, I think,
a year afterwards, when it was a live issue,
and the result was that from the whole Province only one representative was returned
who favoured Confederation.
That Prince
Edward Island was not in favour of it is
clearly emphasized by the fact that Prince
Edward Island did not enter at the time the
other Provinces came in.
I mention these facts only because they all
lead up to those things which I want particularly to place before you. There was at the
time of Confederation a very strong feeling
of distrust. The Maritimes had their trade
relations established. They had at that time
their natural market to the south and had
many ships plying to all ports in Europe,
wherever they could develop their trade. They
were naturally suspicious of any union with
the Provinces up here, because they felt that
they were likely to lose the southern markets,
to be dominated by the much larger population in the Upper Provinces, and to be deprived of the control of their own customs,
and that they would not be able to make their
own trade treaties. Prior to 1867, subject to
the assent of the Imperial Parliament, the
Maritime Provinces did make their own
treaties.
I want to call attention to another fact
which demonstrates'very clearly the prosperity
of the Maritime Provinces previous to 1867.
I will take New Brunswick, because what I
say about that Province applies to the others.
The population of New Brunswick for the 37
years preceding Confederation, that is, from
1867 back, increased 300 per cent,-a very
rapid increase in population. From 1867 down
to the ipresent time, that is 60 years, it has
increased only 80 per cent. The increase preceding Confederation was six times what it
bas been since. While I cannot give you the
figures for Nova Sceotia I know they wifl tell
the same story. That there bas been a feeling
of distress in the Maritime Provinces is clearly
set forth in the report of this Royal Commissin.
I have in my hand a very interesting letter
written by the first member from Westmoreland County who sat in the Canadian Parliament in 1867. I think it was prophetic. I

âÔ<

APRIL 11, 1927
have the document as written in the honourable gentleman's handwriting. The letter was
as follows:
House of Commons,
Ottawa, Dec. 7th, 1867.
Amos Ogden, Esq.
Dear Sir,-The correspondents of the newspapers froin our Province, keep you posted up

as to our doings here.

It is lamentable to see how time and money
are wasted. The daily expense must be upwards of $4,000, and yet the Government go
on day after day doing little or nothing.
I am sorry to say that my convictions in
relation to Confederation are confirmed from
what I have seen and heard.
We are entirely overshadowed; everything is

Canadian.

You have seen the resolutions

penditure of millions of dollars.
What will the Confederates think now when
this is the first measure of the Government,
producing heavy taxation upon them without
any benefit. We warned our country of this
and other things, and it is surprising to see
how rapidly our predictions are being verified.
The Government told us that as we had the
Railways expenditure they should have some-

thing in the West. I replied that the Railway
was as much for their benefit as ours, and
further the R.ailway was the price paid for
Confederation

and

should

against us, and that we began with a clean

sheet, but all this is of no avail. The whole
of Upper Canada unite together, whatever
their difference in politics may be, to obtain

grants of money. I knew this would be the
case, and told the people so.
Kind regards to all friends, In haste.

Yours truly,

A. J. Smith.

I am not reading that in a critical manner,
but I want to say that Mr. Smith was the first
member who served from that section, and his
letter shows just the feeling of dread that
existed that the conditions under which they
came into Confederation would not be carried
out. He stresses two things there: the railway,

which was built for the benefit of the rest of
Canada, as it was for ours, and the tendency
of Ontario and Quebec to override the smaller
Provinces. That illustrates pretty clearly that
after we came into Confederation there was a
strong feeling of doubt that the conditions of
Confederation would

not be

had before Confederation.

was against it.

The first vote

I do not know whether the

rest of Canada knows the reason why New
Brunswick voted for Confederation. I fancy
most of the people do not know: but had it
not been -for the Fenian Raid I doubt if Confederation would ever have been completed.
It was that Raid that made it possible for

Leonard Tilley-who later became Sir Leonard
Tilley-to bring New Brunswick into Conifederation. He had been defeated in a general
election three years before, but we were
scattered. The people up here had considered
the Intercolonial Railway very largely as a
troop-carrying road in case of war. The
people down east at that time were afraid of
the results of the Fenian Raid. The Fenians
were on the border of Maine, between Maine
and New Brunswick. Threats were made that
they were coming over, and going to capture
New Brunswick, and make that Province part
of the American Union. Bo strong was the
appeal made in the election, and so strong
was the hold it had on the people, particularly
on the St. John River and St. Croix River
section, that they thought that by Confederation we would be a united people, and have
the help of the people of the Upper Provinces
in case of invasion or war. That was the
reason which caused the vote in favour of
Confederation - in the Province of New
Brunswick. It is interesting to know those
things,« because they all bring more clearly
to our mind the adverse feeling that existed
in all those Maritime Provinces previous to
1867 and later.
Now, the next subject on which I wish
to speak is the railway situation. I want
to say that this is one of the instances in
which I think the Government might possibly
go further than it has done in the 20 per cent
reduction in freight rates. Every other part
of Canada has had reductions when we have
not had them. They have had compensation
which we did not get, and this 20 per cent
will only put us partly back to the condition
we were in previous to 1912.
It is unfortunate that up to the present
time the Government has not been able to
make that 20 per cent reduction apply to products going into foreign countries. I hold in
my hand a telegram which was sent to the
Minister a few days ago from the New BrunsIt is as

360

SENATE

As a matter of fact, about 80 or 90 per cent
of the lumber products of the Maritime Provinces went into foreign countries last year;
so that at least 80 per cent of the lumber
produets would nlot receive the benefit unless
that 20 per cent applied to international
shipments. That means a good deal, because
last year alone-and 1926 was a very short
season in the lumbering operations-the eut
in the Province was less than it had been for
a number of years, and yet it amounted to
$24,000,000. Eighty per cent of that would
be $20,000,000.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: To what country does
the lumber chiefly go?
Hon. Mr. BLACR: About 80 per cent went
to the United States. The long-lumber industry is almost dead. A x-ery large number
of people had made prosperous communities
and made money out of the production of
long-lumber, but they had to close their milis,
or were only able to carry on by the use of
loan's frorn the banks.
If the honourable
leader of this House can make some recommendations to the Government providing for
that 20 per cent to apply to international
shiprnents over the Canadian National Railways, he will certainly do great good for the
Maritimes, and belp to revive an industry
which for years has been losing- money, and
is almost extinet.
1 arn aware that there are freight rate agreements between the various roads which inake
it impossible in a direct way to have this
reduction apply to United States points, but
there are other ways of doing it. I arn satislied that the Railway Commission, if their
ingenuity is exercised along that bine, can flnd
means for doing this, and I would be very
glad, when the opportunity offers, to make
some suggestions which I believe would be
practicable in carrying out this idea.
.Referring te, a statement made to me a
few days ago that we were being given something unearned in the way of railway rates, I
want to go back and tell briefly what happened
to our Maritime raibway rates. The Intercolonial Railway was not built by the
Dominion. Part of it was built by the Province of Nova Scotia, part by the Province
of New Brunswick, and most of the rest by
a grant direct from the Imperial Government.
New Brunswick and Nova Scotia handed to
'Canada the roads that they had, but there
were certain debts in the way of debentures.
The Provinces assumed liability for those
outstanding bonds and debentures for the
roads built in those Provinces.

sîîpplied by the people of the rest of Canada.
Is there any rea.son why the out.standing liabilities that existed in 1867 on those two roads
partby built by New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia should flot be assumed by the rest of
Canada? There is none that I know of. Is
there any reason why the Valley Railway,
built by the Province of New Brunswick,
should not be a.ssxîmed by the rest of Canada?
Only in this Session of Parliament 320,000,000
and more have been voted for new roads in
the W/est, and since I have come into this
Parliament about $180,000,000 have been voted
for branch roads and the development of railways in Western Canada; yet Up to the
pr'esent the Government lias decliýned to take
over the Valley Railway in New Brunswick,
which, iînder more than an implied agreement,
the Dominion shoubd have taken ux er aulne
years ago

I am making these arguments not by way of
complaint, but in order that honourable gentle'men may sec the justice of the case that
bas been put up by the Maritime Provinces,
the justification of which is s0 clearly set
forth and exemplified in this report.
I want to cali attention to another fact that
isýwell known. The Intercolonial Railway was
built as a communicatiýng road which would be
safe at ail times; it could not be easily attacked either by band or water by a foreign
country. It wa bîîibt as far as possible from
the Amnerican border on the one side, and
Luiît inland on the other, so that it could not
be raided by land or sea. Because of those
conditions the British Government made a
vcry large contribution to it, and for the same
r-ason we buibt 250 miles more of road than
should have been built had tbe most direct
.oute been chosen.
That 250 miles would
b ave been eut off if the road had gone from
Hialifax through Moncton, Edmundston and
Rivière-du-Loup, and so on.
Consequently
tbe road which was carrying freight 250 miles
further every time it went up and down between the Provinces would lose money, whereas
if those 250 miles had been eut off it would
have made money. Nevertheless up to the
time that the Intercolonial avas anaalgamnated
with the other railxvays of Canada the total
loss on the operation of those roads was only
$6.000,000. flot a very large amount.
The first increase in frcighit rates, 10 per
cent, came in 1913. That Ivas when they
began to absorb our railway system iýnto the
general Canadian National Railway System.
In July. 1915, there was a 5 per cent increase
on the Intercolonial, xvhich did not apply to
agny other part of Canada, and iii November,
1915, an additional 5 per cent. Therefore between 1913 and 1915 there was4 a 20 per cent

increase on the Intercolonial, whereas there
was no increase on any other railway controlled by the Government of Canada in any
other part of the Dominion. In 1916 the
Railway Commission made an increase of 5
per cent east of Port Arthur, but there was
no increase made west of Port Arthur. In
March, 1918, there was a 15 per cent increase; and again in August, 1918, there was a
25 per cent increase in the Canadian National
rates, including the Intercolonial, but when it
got west of Ontario the increase was cut
down to 15 per cent. In September, 1920, there
was a 40 per cent increaae, but of that, 5 per
cent was higher in the East than in the West.
Altogether there was a total increase of 105
per cent over the Intercolonial part of the
road, and about 85 per cent on the roadas in
Western Canada.

SE-NATE

Because of the conditions of Confederation
our industries have been absorbed by the
larger Provinces, and the Provinces by the
sea have suffered. I do flot, say that is flot
the naturai course of trade. The present financiai system has resulted in combinations and
developments of that kind the world over. 1
ami not finding any fault with that. But if is
lamentable.
I ivouid like t0 bring to the attention of
this House, and I hope to the attention of
others as well, another reason wby the
Maritimes are in a very depressed condition;
a reason why tbey are entitled to justice in
so far as freight rates and subsidies are concerned. Justice is ail that we have been
asking; justice is ail that is recommended in
the Duncan Report. From Confederation up
to 1912 the Intercoloniai Railway was mun ns
it ought to have been run, from the Maritime
standpoint, and for the first seven years after
Confederation the canal systema was run as if
ought to have been run. The cost of the
Intercolonial wvas about tho same as the cost
of the canal systeni at that date; and just as
the canais wvere the means by wbich Quebea
-,nd Ontario could communicate with each
other and with the sea, so was the Intercolonial to be the means whereby the Maritime
Provinces could communicate with Quebec and
Ontario. Seven years after Confederation
some member of the House of Commons
mioved that the tolls on the canais should be
abolisbed. I think that at that time the menmbers from the Maritime Provinces, who consented to the abolition of the tolls on the
canais. should have said: "We are quite willing
to do anything which will help your trade
or the development of the natural resources
of the country, but at the same time you
should be wiiiing to do the same for us." They
had an absolute right at that time to say
to the rest of Canada that in compensation
for the abolition of tolîs on the canals, for
the uipkeep of which we were helping to pay,
a corresponding reduction should be made in
freigbt rates on the Intercolonial, or, failing
that, that a yearly subsidy should be paid
wvhich would be sufficient to make up the loss
whicb the Maritimes would naturally sustain.
Tînt is a fair proposition. I do not think
anybody couid find any fault with it. Yet the
opportunity was allowed to go by, and the
upper Provinces got the benefit of free canais,
but nothing was given to the 'Maritimes to
ofNýet thit concession.
In order to show tbe ab'solute justice of the
increased subsidy to tbe Maritime Provinces.
I wish f0 draw attention to another toatter.
When Confederation n'as consummated, the
Ilon. Mr. BLACK.

limits of the Provinces were designated. The
great North West belonged to the Crown, and
there were the vast areas of Northern Ontario
and Northern Quebec in whicha we, as participants in Confederation, had exactiy the same
right to share as any other part of Canada.
WVe could not avail ourseives of Northern
Ontario or Northern Quebec, because we wcre
not adjacent to those areas; therefore, naturally, when it was decided to bring tbema in
as part of the Provinces they were added, part
to the Province of Ontario and part to the
Province of Quebec.
Two years ago that portion of Nortbern
Ontario which was added after Confederation
was estimated to be worth $80,000,000. Tînt
amount was practically taken out of the common purse of the Dominion of Canada and
given to the Province of Ontario. Eighty
million dollars at 5 per cent would amount
to $4,000,000 a year. Could any man from tbe
Province of Ontario objeet to paying the
Province of Nova Scotia 8875,000 a year in
tbree subsidies, when by an Act of generosity
such as I have mentioned Ontario was to
receive an increased subsidy of 84,000,000 or
more a year? That portion of the public
(lomain which was added f0 the Province of
Quebec is one of the most valuabie mineraI
beits in the world. Two years ago its estimated value was 870,000,000, which at 5 per
cent amounts to $3,500,000 a year of a direct
subsidy by Canada to that Province. Do you
think that any honourable member from.
that Province, in view of the circumstances,
can objeet now to giving to the Province of
New' Brunswick 8600,000 a year?
These
things, honourable gentlemen, separate and
apart altogether froma the basis of population,
bring to your attention the absolute, justice of
grealer subsidies f0 the Maritime Provinces.
That is the keynote of the recommendations
in the Duncan Report.
But there is an additional justification
n'hich I want the people of Ontario and Quebec and the West f0 keep, ciearly in mmnd, if
it should occur to them. for one moment that
tbe rest of the Provinces are giving the
Maritime Provinces anything to wbich they
are not honestly and justly entitled. Some
people from. the %N'est may say: "Well,
Ontario may have got a lot, and Quebec may
have got a lot; but we have not got anytbing."
I do not think tînt is the spirit of the West
at alI. The West is a growing country, and
tbe people are optimistie and, as has been
demonstrated in this Huse during the last
three or four years, they n'ant to get aIl theY
can. Nevertheless7 I believe they are reasonable n'ben they know tbe facts of the case.

page 16, which relates to subsides, se that
the West may net think that we are getting
a subsidy to which we are flot entitled.
1The burden of the case made le the Maritime
Provinces, in respect of public debt allowances,
fines itself down to, a. very defleite point. The
greater part of their public debt of the time
of Confederation represented railway construction costs, and although the Dominion took over
as their property "railways, and railway stocks,
moritgages and other debts due by railway coinpunies", they charged against the Provincial
debt allowance the bonds of the Provinces
issued for railway purposes then outstanding.
That, I think should neyer have been done.
The Maritime Provinces were, in this regard,
deaît with no differently fromn other Provinces,
until the Western Provinces were constituted.
Ie the case of the Western Provinces a debt
allowance was fixed on the samne basis of
amounit as for the other Provinces, but net,
in their case, on the basis of assets which were
te be transferred to the Dominion, for they
bad ne assets. Se that, ie fact, a new principle
was imported into the conception of public debt
allowances. The Maritime Provinces argue that
they are, as from the date of that change in
principle, entitled to have that portion of their
public debt, which attached to assets taken over
by the Dominion, elimieated in determieieg the
extent to which the debt allowance originally
given to them should bear a reduction.

The Report of the Commissioners goes on
te Say that t.hey find the contention of the
Maritime Provinces te be substantiated.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: May I ask the
honourable gentleman a question? I arn
entircly in sympathy with the Report, but
there is a statement in the Report, and it
has been made elsewhere, that the Western
Provinces got large land grants. The ýcreation
of those Provinces carried with it, by implicatien, under the law and the constitution the
grant of lands and natural reseurces.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: That dees net affect the
argument in any way. -I have net said that
you had any grant te which you were net
entitled. You got enly the land set eut at
the time the Provinces were established.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: They got Rnoney.
Tbey should have had the lands.
Hon. Mr. BLAÉK: Neither cf those arguments at aLl affects my argument that in
getting a subsidy the Maritime Provinces are
now getting what the otber Provinces got.
The Report does flot say a word about the
land grant. It speaks of the cash payment.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: A cash payment
in lieu of the lands. That is the difficuIty.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: As I understand it,
we got a cash allowance for carrying; on the
government; but we got no natural resources
at ail. Nova Scotia got its natural resources.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I am sorry, but I do
not think the argument of the honourable
gentleman is germane to the question at ail.
I have not referred to that. When the
Western Provinces were created they had no
assets, and for that reason they did get very
large grants.
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: Oh, no.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: They had a debt,
alaowance, but ne assets te show for it.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Wheii the Western
Provinces, were created they were surely
entitled to ail the natural resources within
their territorial boundaries; but the people
of the East, including the Maritime Provinces,
claimed that they owned the natural resources
that we say should have gone to Alberta,
Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. I am net unsyfapathetie towards the -argument of my
honourable friend, but I want to point out
that not one of the Maritime Provinces was
deprived of its natural resources.
Hon. Mr. HIUGHES: Is it not a fact that
when the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created they wcre offered
subsidies or natural resources, whichever they
preferred, and that they took the subsidies ini
lieu of land?
Hon. Mr. BLACK: If the honourable gentleman will allow me, I would like to go on
with the argument.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: 1 beg your pardon.

Hon. Mr. BLACE: These arguments do net
touch what I say, and really do not refer te
any of my -remarks, and I think honourable
gentlemen sbould allow mee te complete my
argument.
I want to see the West get ail that is
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: We did net get the *coming to it, within reason; at the samne time

got before, and that it is no more than we
are justly, lcgally and constitutionally entitled to get. In addition to the advantages
1 have already mcntionred, the Western Provinces got a concession in freight rates in the
Crows Nest Pass agreement, and that is the
greatest concession by way of a rate reduction that 1 koow of on the North American
continent. It is always welI to bear that in
mind.
Then, since the West is before us there are
other things that 1 might mention. The West
is constantly getting subsidies, elthough thcy
are flot called by that namre, and in considering Maritime dlaims Westerners should renieraber that votes are con.stantly being made in
favour of the West, and they should be cailled
what thev really are--subsidies. Only this session we hiave had before us a Bill with regard
to payments for seed grain and fodder. Are not
those things subsidies? Clearly they are, and
very substantial ones. There is some $7,000,000 outstanding which, according to the
evidence given before a Committee of the
Ilouse, will neyer corne back to us. Subsidies
of that kind have been granited flot once or
twice, but at Ieast five times in tire last 22
years. I amn glad the West lias got that assistance, beeause it bias needed it; and I amn glad
that tbe people wha were suffering from the
loss of their crops and seed were helped. becaus~e they deserved it. 'Ne ini the East want
the people of the West to take the saie attitude towards us, and to say that we are now
getting only a portion of what we have deserved for a long time. We base aur dlaim
simply and solely on the justice and riglit of
the cause of the Maritimes.
I may say to you, honourable gentleman,
that there bias alwaYs been a very strong
feeling in the Maritime Provinces against Confederation. Thiat feeling bias been minimized,
but it bias neyer been allayed. 'Ne ail try ta
mînimize it, but there is ýnot an bonourable
gentleman who hias been a, memhpr of this
Huse for five years wbo does not know that
this feeling is alive yet, and that it is seetbing
ini one Province at lest. But we do flot want
to see that feeling dcvelop, and you do not
want to sec it. As good Canadians, as loyal
British subjects, we want, to do ev erythîag in
Our power to unite the Provinces froin the
Atlantic to the Pacifie. and to make tbem one
barmonious wbole, so that they will go forward
in increasing prosperity. You will bring it
abouýt only by giving due consideration ta the
rights of the Maritime Provinces and ta the
recommendations of this Duncan Report, and
by sayîng to yourselves and your constituents,
fromn one end of this cotmrtry ta tlîe other,

are entitled, and if right had been done it

I have a great deal more I would like ta
say, but time is passing and I will nlot proceed furthcr. That, in brief, is my pîca for
fair consideration of the rights embodied in
this report on behaîf of the Maritimes.
I
cangratulate the Goverament and the honourable leader in this bouse in sa far as thcy have
gane. I do implore the honourable leader of
the Governrnent ta place before his colleagues
tire absolute neccssity of implemcnting the 20
per cent reduction in the freight rate, by
making it applicable ta international freiglit.
That can be donc, natwithstanding what bias
been said up ta the present. I further ask
that the Saint John Valley Railway, for whicha
ta a large extent the Government of Canada
is obligated, be taken over. The Provinces
by the sca obtain in that agreement only the
saie measure of justice as bas been meted
out,' day by day, this Session, last Session, and
the Sessian before, ta all the otlier parts of
Canada.
bon. J. S. MeLENNAN:
Hanaurable
gentlemen, although in the main I agree witha
iny hanaurable friend who lias just taken bis
seat, there is a sufficient difference betwcen
aur views on this question, or saine phases of
it, ta justify me in calling attention ta certain features and interpreting certain events
which bave bappened in the last fifty or
sixty ycars. I do nat intcnd ta speak at great
length. and 1 hope that you will feel, when I
have finished, that I arn justified in these
rcmarks.
The misfortune about ail discussion on suchi
matters is that we talk of ecanamie laws, and
there is an idea more or lcss fixed in the minds
of the layman, anyway, that these so-called
laws can be changcd by saine body or other.
The fact is that what are referrcd ta as canamnie laws are Ieally ecanamie and social
forces whichi produce results and whieh cannat
be stopped, but may be deflected by the
impinging on thein of other ecanamic forces,
strong enough ta alter the result. It cannat
be'altered by anrything tînt any body of nien
can do.
First of aIl, 1 think that a truc understanding or interpretatian of this whale matter
ought ta rest upon the realization by the
People af the rest of Canada. aind by the people
of the Maritimes theinselvesý, that no part of
Canada. and perhaps no other part of the
world, lias suffered sa manv vicissitudes in

APRIL 11, 1927
regard to the factors that affect materiai prosperity as have the Maritime Provinces of
Canada. What was their condition when they
entered Confederation? They were possîbiy
a littie over-weighted by too many legisIatures and too much expense in carrying on
business, but they were compact communities,
with an economic and social system, which
was quite adequate. Unfortunately, the whoie
trend of their trade, almost fromn the time
that their trade began, was with the United
States, or rather with New England, and not
with Canada.
Confederation diverted ail that. The
building of the raiiway aitered the whole
syatem. The greatest feature of the condition
of the people of the Maritimes wae that they
were among the moet remarkable ship-owning,
ship-buîiding and ship-sailing people that
have been known, possibly "ice the Phoenicians. At the time of Confederation, and for
many generations, perhaps centuries, previousiy, Great Britain had been the great
ship-owning and ocean-transport country of
the worid; yet for every seven tons -of shipping
that Great Britain owned, the Maritime Provinces of Canada owned one ton. In the
sixties, when the Reciprocity Treaty with the
United States was in effect, there was, I
understand, something like 60 per cent of the
shipping at New England ports carried in
bottoms belonging to the citizens of the
From Yarmouth to
Maritime Provinces.
Sydney there were ships, and good shipe, being
built. Incidentally I may say that if any
honourable member wants an interesting 'book
on one phase of the development of Canada,
let him take the volume. "Wooden Ships and
Iron Men," and he will see ail the splendeur
sand the. fine achievement of the people of
the Maritime Provinces of that time. That
shipping, through economic causes, through
the change from wood to steel, froim sail to
eteam, gradualiy, in the course of about tan
years, faded, away. Shipping was a great
industry, the predominant industry, at that
time. If there was lumbering, a great deal
of the lumber went int-o ships to provide
cargoes for shipping. If there was fishing it
provided cargoes for 'the Nova Scotian schooner
to take to the West Indies, or to Spain,
Portugal or soine Mediterranean port. Practicalily ail that shipping, in the course of ten
years, disappeared, or, at al events became
unprofitable.
It was not because of any
deficiency in the ehip-owners or ship-builders
in Nova Scotia or the Maritimes. The shipbuilding of New England went through exactly
the same proceFe. When the people of New
England wanted to build a ship that would
surpass ail others as a clipper, they sent to

365

Pictou County and brought Donald MacKay
to Boston to buiid the Sovereign; and when
they wanted to build a f ast yacht they came
to Cape Breton and brought the Lawiey family
to Boston. The graduaI deerease in shipping
was net the fault of the Maritimes. It was
a universal. trend.
You can realize what would be the condition
in the West if, through some remarkable
cause-so remarkable that it strains the
imagination-the demand for hard wheat
graduaily faded away. Nova Scotia went
through that almost immediately after Con-~
federation. That Province had been carrying
on a remarkabiy prosperous trade on account
of New England being engaged in war, Nova
Scotia was selling food, or doing the carrying.
That stopped after the abrogation of the
Reciprocity Treaty. Moreover, a great part
of New Engiand was suppiied with coal from
Nova Scotia through those same years. One
knows how important a coal industry is in a
coal district; it is the main part of everything
that goes on there; ail other industries are
subsidiary and incidentai to it. That was
suddeniy cut off by a duty of $1.25 a tonan absoluteiy prohibitive duty. Those who
comne from Quebec, from the Eastern Townships, realize what a tremendous handicap that
is, and how it 'disarranges economics ail over
the district, as shown by the embargo put on
the export of cream to the United States.
Hon. Mn. WILLOUGHBY: The recent
embargo?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Yes; the valuable
trade on which the whole community depended
was suddenly stopped. That wili give somne
idea of what happened in 1868. It took a year
or two, but graduaiiy the coai trade faded
away to nothing. That was another difficulty
that the Maritime Provinces had to put up
with: it was a biow in the solar plexus, and
they had two of them, one after the other.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The coal export fell
off?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Enormousiy, particulariy during the American Civil War, and
also, coneurrently with that, there came the
development of the West Virginia and Cumberland coal fidids about that time, and they
got rail communication to the seaboard, which
miade lit very easy for themn to displace our
coai in the New Engiand market.
As a proof of what went on then, remember
that the firat Atlantic Steamship line was
estabyished by* a citizen of Haifax, which was
on the regular route to Liverpool before New
York was. Perhaps that demande further explanjation. It was Samuel Cunard, who wns

SENATE
a Halifax trader and merchant, who founded
the Cunard Line of steamers. The first terminus was Boston, and it was only afterwards
that they moved to New York and made that
the principal port.
Yet through all this time the Maritimes
were doing important things. New Brunswi.ck laims, I think with justice, that one of
lier residents was the inventor of the compound steam engine, and that the first one was
made in Flemming's works in St. John.
Our coal trade finally succeeded, with no
excessive amount of encouragement from the
Dominion. Little by little we grew from two
or three hundred thousand tons sent to the
St. Lawrence market, to 2,000,000 tons. Halifax had a dream of making sugar, which was
finally realized, and that industry has
succeeded. There were failures in oil, and
again in gold mining, but still business went
on, and there were firms whose names and
goods are known all over the continent. The
Maritime Provinces are naturally at less disadvantage in the western markets in goods
those firms produce, of high value in proportion to their bulk. Thus we have confeotionary, chocolates, wearing apparel and
stoves going from the Maritimes and competing successfully with the rest of the country.
Occasionally the Maritimes have suffered by
their own success. Two persons, Mr. Rhodes
and Mr. Gurry-the latter our colleaguestarted a good many years ago in a very
small way in Amherst, building houses; they
finally established a great car-building business, which finally came into the Canada Car
& Foundry Company. That was inevitable,
and it went farther west to Montreal, nearer
the source of demand. But that was hard
on Amherst, as it would be hard on any place
to have industries leave. More than that,
two of the principal banks originated in Nova
Seotia, showing that there was ability there,
and resources for which there was not a large
enough field, and little by little they achieved
a position which was to the utmost credit of
Nova Scotia, and a benefit to Canada.
With all these changes in shipping, in
markets, in the conditions of New England,
and so on, it might fairly be asked, "If
people have donc so well in those various
ways, why could they not do better?" But
our industries were small, and everybody
knows that overhead is the tremendous bugbear of small businesses. For example, in
figuring on steel products for the South
American market it would be necessary to
make close examination and trial shipments
which, if donc properly, would cost a formidable sum to a small Canadian company, whereHon. Mr. McLENTÇAN.

as to a large competitor like the United
States Steel Company such trial shipment and
examination would mean only a decimal of
one per cent. So it goes on down, and there
is less and less chance for the small company to get capital, or even to take risks
which the larger company could do with
impunity, and make profit for themselves.
That is one thing that has kept back the
development of the Maritimes.
Another thing to be mentioned is that the
glittering successes have been outside the
Maritimes--in the West, in Montreal and
elsewhere, and though people in the East have
been enterprising, their ventures have often
been failures, or very modest successes. Let
us hope that the new conditions that are
developing through freighit frates and the
other features of this report will make for
early success, which will mean a great deal.
Many of us remember the general feeling
of discouragement throughout Canada in the
later eighties.
We found, when we went
abroad, a feeling that Canada was a doubtful
country in which to invest money. The Grand
Trunk and other investments had not been
conspicuously successful, but when the Canadian Pacific Railway demonstrated that it was
a great success financially the outside world
changed its opinion of Canada, and it became infinitely casier to get money for any
reasonable enterprise that was started here.
Indeed, while the money held out in Europe,
we were possibly able to borrow almost too
easily, until the war. Then the relations between the Dominion and the Provinces have
had a great deal to do with creating these
feelings of disappointment or irritation that
existed, and the political situation rather than
the economic one was the beast with the
broadest back which might be beaten with
the cudgels, for various phases of disappointment for which nobody was to blame, and
certainly not the energy or intelligence or industry of the people of the Maritimes.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I have been very much
interested in the account given by the honourable gentleman of some of the industries, and
the effect that Confederation may have had
on them. I would like him to speak as to
mining and fishing and agriculture. Did Confederation interfere with the progress in any
of those industries?
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
Well, in agriculture, nobody ever thought very seriously of
the Maritime Provinces. To-day I ran over
the kind of grain that would be expected in
the Maritimes; the coarser grains.

great rewards. We have not had that spur in
the Maritime Provinces.
I hope it will
come. I think that what has been done
will help towards it, and that as a result
the people of the Maritime Provinces will
work together and will think a little less
about political divisions. I feel that our
people are too keen about politics. I hope
that we shall get help from outside, from
banking agencies and others, to strengthen the
impulse to go on which I think the Maritimes
should now have. There is a great deal more
money in the Maritime Provinces than people
ordinarily think. A great deal of it bas been
fnvested in the United States and in other
places; and I am told that, as I suppose will
always be the case, many millions have gon2
on margins, which will never come back.
I would call the attention of the honourable
leader of the Government to what he said
about looking into the domestic fuel problem,
and also to the memorandum referred to in
the Duncan Report, which the Prime Minister
said the other day was being printed, and
which I presume will be distributed.
Hon. J. J. HUGHES: Honourable gentlemen, I deem it to be my duty to say a few
words on this question while it is before the
House. First and foremost I wish to call the
attention of the honourable the senior member for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt) to a few
remarks that were made when this question
was spoken to, I think on Friday last. The
honourable gentlemen said that he intended
to vote for the Bill, that he approved of the
legislation; then he went on to say that he
disapproved very strongly of any change in
the British North America Act or any infringement or weakening of the provisions
of that Act. I cannot for the life of me see
how the implementing of the recommendations of the Duncan Commission can interfere in any way with 'the British North
America Act. The honourable member for
Ottawa is an intenlligent man, a very logical
man, and an able lawyer, and it may be that
I am not able to follow his reasoning. He
may see something in this that I cannot comprehend; but what I have stated gives my
view of the matter.
I agree with much that has been said by
the honourable member for Sackville (Hon.
Mr. Black). I agree with him that it would
be very unfortunate if the people of the
Central and Western Provinces were to get
the impression that the implementation of
the recommendations of the Duncan Commission would be extending to the Maritime
Provinces a special privilege, and that in return they should receive a quid pro quo. I
agree with the honourable gentdeman in sayHon. Mr. McLENNAN.

ing that what bas been recommended by the
Duncan Commission is long overdue, and I
will try to prove the truth of that statement. But I go further. I say that while
the implementation of those recommendations
will help the Maritime Provinces very considerably it will not by any means cure the
ills or remove the disadvantages under which
we labour. No matter what reductions may
be made in the freight rates, they will not
provide a market for the Maritime Provinces
in the Central Provinces.
When the Maritime Provinces entered confederation the people of those provinces who
were prominent in the negotiations believed
that a market could be found for much of our
products in the Central Provinces. That
might have been a natural belief at that time;
but facts have since demonstrated that it was
entirely fallacious. There bas never been a
market in the Central Provinces for the Provinces by the sea, and in all human probability
there never will be. The natural market for
the Maritime Provinces is in the New England States and in Old England, and the
grievances and the disadvantages of those
Provinces arise from the fact that according
ta Parliamentary law we are pledged to buy
what we need, or a large proportion of what
we need, in a protected market; and by a
natural law, to sell our products in the markets of the world.
There is the situation. There is nothing
that we produce in the Maritime Provinces,
except coal and fish, that is not abundantly
produced in the Central Provinces, and it is
an economic question whether that coal can
be sold at a profit in the Central Provinces.
It cannot be sold, I understand, in competition with American coal and pay the cost of
hauling it. Whether it would be wise for the
whole of Canada to bear the cost is another
question.
There is no market in the Central Provinces
for any large quantity of fish. About two
years ago I went into that question pretty
thoroughly, and I discovered that we sold
to the Central Provinces only about 4ï per
cent of our fish, and that that was sufficient
to supply the market. I was informed by the
wholesale fish bouses in Montreal that they
imported a good deal less than 1 per cent of
their fish from the Boston market. In other
words, we caught enough fish in the Maritime
Provinces in two weeks to supply the Central
Canada market for 52 weeks, and consequently had to sell the fish that we caught during
the other 50 weeks wherever we could find a
market; and there being no other market, we
sold them in the United States.

APRIL 11, 1927
There is no other market for our lumber,
our sheep and lambs, our potaitoes, our poultry, and, to a large extent, our poultry products, than the United States. We seil our
hogs and hog products in Old England. We
scîl our cheese and butter there. These are
our products; these are the things we have
to ssii.
I do not want Vo raise an argument on the
principîs of protection, but I want to state
facts. When the principle of protection was
introduced into Canada in 1879, the first
handicap, was placsd upon the people of the
Maritime Provinces. Protection was no advantage Vo the Maritimes; it could he no advantage Vo the Maritimes. That was a most
important factor in the transference of our
industries Vo the Central Provinces. As a
natural resiilt the banks and financial institutions followed.
But the grea test blow of all was struck
when reciprocity was turned down in 1911.
That is my answer Vo my honourabis friend
from De Salabsrry (Hon. Mr. Beique),' who
asksd a question somewhat like this: "-What
disadvantage was Confederation to Vhe Maritime Provinces or Vo the industries of the
Maritime Provinces?" If the principle of
reciprocity had been carried into effect, it
would have been of no disadvantage whatever
to ths manufacturers of Vhs Central Provinces.
They migbt have f eared that laVer on it would
be. As a resuit of their action our natural market, Vhe only market we ever had or ever will
have for many of our products, was denied Vo
us. That is Vhs disadvantage that was placed
upon us. Our own people were led astray.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
voting wrong.

And they are stili

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: And they are stili voting wrong. That is the strange part of it. But
there it is. There is no man living who can
deny these statements. Why, even my good
friend from Sackville (Hon. Mr. Black) admitted Vhe statement in part when hie said that
80 or 90 per cent of our lumber was sold in the
United States. I happen to be connected with
a company that deals in fish. The year before
last we caught in Prince Edward Island just
about two and a haif million pounds of fish,
every pound of which was sold in the United
States. And do> you know, honourable gent-le-

men, that the duty on fish is

1-4 cents

a pound,

*and that about a cent a pound is paid to the
fishermen? The fish lose about one-third in
weight in curing, so the duty is nearly 100 per
cent. When fishing is good, a cent a pound or
a cent and a quarter a pound will give the
fishermen remuneration enough to indue

369

thein to continue in the business; in fact, in
a good year they will put by a littie money;
but in ordinary years or poor years they canflot get enough to keep them alive, and last
year they had to give up the business.
The saine is true of almost everything else.
In Prince Edward Island we are producing
potatoes to a very large extent. That is the
best and most profitable crop we can produce.
We think this will continue to be the case,
because we are producing for seed purposes,
and because the -record of the United States
goes to show that they do not put duties upon
seed animals or seed vegetables or seed grain
or anything that they really want to produce
themnsel'ves. But if they should change their
mmnd and put a very heavy duty on potatoes,
it would kili our trade, and practically we
would not know what to do. W'e are now
making good money. Soine of our young men
are ýcoming back from the United States to
take up land that they had abandoned, and
are goîng into potato growing, because it ie
profitable, and because there is available Vo
themn an almost unlimited market in that immense country to the south of us.
While the carrying out of the recommendations of the Duncan report wiil help the
Maritime Provinces much, it will not remove
the fundamental disadvantages under which
we labour. We may carry on. The United
States may noV increase their duty; they may
noV drive us out of their market, and if they
do noV, we can live. If they do increase the
duties, we cannot live. There is no use blinking facts. We shall have to worry along under
tremendous difficulty.
Now, that is the situation. I dislike very
mucli to introduce a discussion on -the tariff,
or to introduce any contentious eubject, but
in my opinion there is no coun'try in the
civilized world where the p-inoiple of protection ean do such niuch harm as in the
Dominion of Canada, beca.u9e of its geographicai position, because of the sameness
of its production, -and becauee of the immense
difficulties of transportation. There is no
country in the civ'ilized world where the principle of protection can do Iess harmn th-an in
the United States, because -of its homogeneity,
because of its great variety of soil and dimate,
and be-cajuse of the immense variety of ite
production; yet protection is diriving the fairmer of the Western States to despertation.
That is its effect even in that country, where
they have an immense home market. 1 know
honourlbile gentlemen will not agree with me
in ali .these matters, but I amn stating the f acte
in regard Vo the Maritime Provinces, and I
know the situation. well.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: It is a good gospel to

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Before the honourable gentleman sits down, may I be permitted

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: He is verr strongly
denouneing the principle of protection, although he does not desire to introduce it.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Well, I cannot help

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: I am afraid not. I
quite agree with the honourable gentleman.
Now let us take these products of which he
speaks.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Wha't products?

items, because I am not in a position to knaw

Americans have placed on Canadian potatoes
going into the United States a duty of about
35 cents a bushel.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: No; it is 30 cents.
The honourable gentleman is pretty near the
figure.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: Say 30 cents. I was
not very sure of my ground. Now, if we buy
any potatoes from the Americans and they
are shipped to our side of the line, while I
do not know the exact amount of the duty,
I know it is not very heavy.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I think it is about
half.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: About half. Then
take eggs, for instance. If we ship any eggs
to the United States we are charged a duty of
8 cents a dozen. If we buy any eggs from the
United States-I mu-t put it the other way:
any eggs going from Canada into the United
States pay only 3 cents a dozenRight Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Their duty is
8 cents, and ours is 3.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: What I want to
ask the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr.

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I thought the honourable gentleman was going to ask me a question.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: I will finish it out.
Any wheat that goes into the American market
pays 35 -cents a bushel. But what do the
Americans do? They want the wheat; they
must have it. They rebate the duty if the
wheat is ground into flour and shipped out
of the country. The consequence is that our
millers are competed with, and the Americans
get the entire advantage. Where my honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Hughes) is wrong, on
his principle of protection, if I may be permitted to say so, is that he does not recognize
that if we raised the level of the tariff in
Canada to that of the American tariff, on
natural products, we 'hould have a market of
our own and should not be sacrificing ourselves to the United States.

Hon. Mr. ROBINSON: What was the question?
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: The question was

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: The question was lost

Hon. Mr. McMEANS: If you put the same
duties on articles coming from the United
States as are put on similar articles going from
Canada to the United States, you would protect your home market.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I say that there is no
home market in Canada for the products of
the Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: All over the Dominion of Canada there is a home market.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Let .my honourable

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I may make a few
remarks that refer general-ly to the whole of
Canada, but I arn speaking now particularly
of conditions in the Maritime Provinces, and
I repeat this statement-the facts will bear
me out, and I think it will be approved by
the people of the Maritime Provinces--that
there is no home rnarket in the Dominion of
Canada for any appreciable quantity of the
products of the Maritime Provinces.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS:

I do flot wonder

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: That does not change
the situation at ail. Now, I have stated that
the only two articles of production in the
Maritime Provinces for whieh there might be
a mnarket in central Canada are coal and fish,
and 1 have told you how much of our fish
the market of central Canada will absorb4ý per cent. When we have shipped that
proportion we have supplied that market. As
to every other commodity that we produce,
there is an abundance of the sarne articles
produced hy the farmers or the lumbermen of
the central Provinces. They compete with
us. They corne down into the small markets
of the Maritime Provinces and are our succee.sful competitors, in meat, in lumber, ini

Hon. Mr. HUGHES: If they do flot get

do away with it. I state in a general way
-and if tim.e and circurnstances permitted,
I think 1 could prove it-that there is no
country in the world where the principle of
protection will do so much harm as in the
Dominion of Canada, because of our extent,
because of the sameness of our production,
and because of the tremendous difficulties of
transportation; and there is no country in the
world wherc protection will do less harmit does harm everywhere, but there is no
country where it will do less harm than in

the United States of America, because of the
compactness of that country and the immense variety of its soil, colimate andl production.
Hon. Mr. MeMEANS: The honourable
gentleman rnight add one more reason, and
that is, because Canada bas thrown open her
doors and gives them another market.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Very well. I have
pointed out the conditions in the Maritime
Provinces, and, wbile the îrnplementing of
these recommendations, I repeat, will help
conditions there considterably, it will supply
but a small portion of what bas been taken
away from those Provinces during the fortyseven years in which the principle of protection bas been in operation. If there bas been
any advantage in that principle it bas been
given to the Central Provinces of CanadaWestern Quebec and nearly ahl Ontario. That
is the situation. So far as I can prevent it,
I do not wish the people of the Maritime Provinces to, imagine that the millennîum is going
to follow, because the Government is carrying
out the recommendations of the Duncan Commission-not by any means. The Maritime
Provinces have many natural advantages. One
of these is the Annapolis Valley in Nova
Scotia, in rny judgrnent the best apple-producing section of North Arnerica. The apples
produced there did not look as well as those
from British Columbia and Oregon, but they
arc of rnuch better flavour; yet the people
of that valley allowed the British market to
slip away frorn them. That was their own
fault; they did not take care of their orchards; they did not pack their apples in the
way that the people of Great Britain wanted
themn packed; they sirnply thought they could
do as they liked and stili hold that market.
Well, they waked up to find that they could
not, for the growers of British Columbia and
Oregon met the demands of the British market, which is now lost to Nova Scotia, as a
resuit.
In some other things the Maritime Pro.vinces have donc ail tbey could.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Mention sorne
of them.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: I rnentioned one; I
will mention another. In rny opinion there
is no good reason why the neople in the
Maritime Provinces, particularlýy the people
of Nova Scotia and part of New Brunswick,
should not have a large trade with Great
Britain in cattle. We are 2,000 miles nearer
the British market than are the people of
Western Canada. There is an immense quan-

SENATE
tity of land there very suitable for grazing
purposes, and great quantities of hay and fodder can be produced in those Provinces. The
cattle that would go on board a ship there
must necessarily be in better condition than
those that travel from the western Provinces,
and yet we do not attempt to get into that
market with cattle. We are to blame for that,
and there is no use in saying that we are doing
everything we can or should do: but all the
same, we are handicapped by the disadvantages under which we live.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Not with respect to apples and cattle.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Well, I think we could
have held the British market in apples if we
had done our duty, and I think we could have
a fair share of the Engîish market for cattle
if we did our duty. In my judgment our
people are not doing all they could, and it is
just as well to point out these things; there
may be other things. I think we are doing
well in the fishing business.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But you are not
supplying Canada.
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: My honourable friend
could not have listened to my statements.
He says we are not supplying Canada. I say
we are. The wholesale fish men of Montreal
have told me that we supply 99 per cent and
a fraction of all the fish that are consumed in
Montrea: and neighbourhood.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Does my honourable friend know that the fish market of
Ottawa is always wanting fresh fish-that there
is no commodity that is so hard to get in
Ottawa as fresh fish?
Hon. Mr. HUGHES: Well, I have stated
the facts as given me by the fih dealers in
Montreal. I have not consulted the wholesale
fish men in Ottawa, but the Montreal men
tell me they buy froin the Maritimes al the
fish they can sell, with the exception of a
few special varieties of very high-class fish
that they buy in the Boston market-less than
one per cent of what they sell.
I wish to put myself on record that we are
not receiving the attention we should, but I
want to compliment and thank the Government for what it has done in appointing the
Duncan Commission and in carrying out the
recommendations of the Report, and giving
that measure of relief to the Provinces. It
will do much good, though long overdue.
I would try to remove, if I could, the idea
that may be in the minds of honourable
gentlemen from western Provinces that this is
Hon. Mr. HUGHES.

some special favour that is being done to us.
It 'is nothing of the kind. No matter what
adjustments take place later, we are entitled
to what we are now receiving, and more, if
the scales could be held even, and if all the
accounts could be taken into consideration.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I hope I have
not wearied you, and I thank you.
Hon. A. B. COPP: Honourable gentlemen,
in rising to add a few words to this discussion,
I feel somewhat like a lawyer who addresses
the jury after they have brought in their
verdict. I feel that a verdict has practically
been given already in this House and the
other, and thrcugh the country, on this very
important question.
I quite agree with my honourable friend
(Hon.. Mr. Bliack) in his statement of the
situation in regard to freight rates. He referred to the situation from the year 1912
until 1921 on what was known as the old Intercolonial Railway. I remerber the dissatisfaction that existed in the Maritimes for the
three or four vears folilowing 1921, and I, along
with my friends, made representations in regard to freiglt rates and other matters in
those provinces.
I listened te mv honourable friend from
Westmoreland (Hon. Mr. Black) and also the
honourable gentleman from Syd(ney (Hon.
Mr. McLennan) as to the situation bef-ore
Confedcration. They did net teill us why the
trade of tie New England States, wvhich was
our natural murket, was diverted, but we can
draw our owen conclusions.
Viethe.r my honourable friend who has just
spoken is correct or otherwise in regard to
the cause of the difficulty in the Maritime
Provinces, is not the question beefore us tonight. It was realized that the only safe,
sane and proper way to bring our difficulties
before the people of Canada as a whole would
b to have an independent, unbiased and nonpolitical Commission to investigate all these
muatters and bring their report before Parliament. This has been donc. I am not here to
take and particular credit for one party or
the other in the Dominion or the Maritime
Provinces in regard to it, but I do feel that
tlat was the right and only sane way to deal
witl the situation. I always felt that had any
political party introduced the legislation that
has been brouglut in now through the Duncan
Report it would not have been accepted by
Parliament or the people of Canada. But
now, barring a fkw hostile criticisms in anotier

place

in

connection

with this Parlia-

ment, and in some newspapers throughout the
Dominion, this Report has been accepted al-

APRIL 11, 1927
most unanimously as the proper action to take
in regard to the Maritimes.
As a Maritime Province man I feel deeply
grateful .that this course has been taken. I
appreciate the very favourable consideration
the people of middle and western Canada have
given to the Duncan Report. I realize, as
well as others, that all that has been done will
not of i.tself bring prosperity and riches,but I
do believe that when this legislation becomes
effective the Maritime people will realize that
the hand of the Canadian people is not against
them,, as some of them have been led to beheve, but that those frugal, industrious, virile
people wilil take up the burdens a little more
firmly and with more enthusiasm. I believe
that what has been done so unanimously by
the people of Canada as a whole, through their
representatives in Parliament, will be a great
boon to the Maritime Provinces. I appreciate
and feel thankful for the sympathetic way in
which this legislation has been received, and
I believe that the eastern Provinces wilil receive great benefit from it, and that the people
there will do their part in carrying on the
great Canadian Confederation.
Hon. Sir EDWARD KEMP: Honourable
gentlemen, I do not think this debate should
close without some one from the central Provinces speaking. I assure our friends from
the Maritime Provinces that these measures
that have been brought in have received on
all sides the most sympathetic consideration.
During the war the railroads did not fail
to take advantage of what was sometimes
called war hysteria, and they repeatedly
went before the Railway Commission and got
railway rates advanced to a very high point
indeed. Those rates went up something like
105 per cent, as has been pointed out, and
when they got up there it was found that the
Railway Commission did not act with the
ýdegree of freedom in bringing them down
that they exercised in putting them up.
I understand the discussion is now on the
Bill with respect to reducing freight rates in
the Maritime Provinces by 20 per cent. I
understand that by this Bill the Railway Commission are ordered to reduce those freight
rates in the Maritime Provinces and as far
west as the Intercolonial Railway extends,
by 20 per cent. For some time past I have
anticipated that Parliament would have to go
very much further than that, and I think
that if this Bill had made a reduction greater
than 20 per cent for the Maritime Provinces
I would have supported it. I have been
anticipating that the Government would be
obliged to order the Railway Commission to
take some steps with respect to the very
high rates that now exist.

We have a long, narrow, thin country, which
some people quietly tell us is liable to come

apart in the middle, it is so thin. We have
a country many thousands of miles from end
to end. Just to the extent that we have
increased freight rates we have made that
distance greater. If we increase freight rates
50 per cent we make the mileage 50 per cent
greater, and so on, because the cost of transportation controls the movement of merchandise. If the cost is 'low, the transportation
is made that much easier, whereas if freight
cost is high there is much more difficulty in
the Provinces trading with each other. Trade
is the thing that will bind the Provinces
together. The basic principle of Confederation was interprovincial trade throughout the
Dominion of Canada.
I would not want to repeat some of the
things that have been talked about outside: it
would not be a good advertisement for this
country. But I will go so far as to mention
that I have heard it said that Confederation
is still in an experimental stage. In this
country .we need a national spirit and a national sentiment by which one Province will
stand up for every other Province in the
country, and all the Provinces will pull together. Just now we have too much sectionalism in this country. This is not a question
of the Maritime Provinces or the western
Provinces. I want to arrive at a point in
Canada where we shall nrt have as many
grievances, and I approach all these questions,
not only relating to the Maritimes, but to the
western Provinces, with the greatest amount
of sympathy.
Honourable -gentlemen, I believe we have today to face as serious a task as the Fathers
of Confederaition had to deal with. They did
not contemplate the exact conditions thaît
would exist when the great West was populated, and when there would be seats in Parliament representing the country west of the
Great Lakes. We have come upon a new
condition of affairs. We have a great republic to the south, and those who are intimately associated in certain kinds of business have some idea of what is going on in
the United States to-day.
In the year 1920 we had what was called a
boom year in business in Canada, and at the
end of that year that boom stopped very
suddenly. The United States had that boom
in the year 1920, but it has continued with
them every year since 1920 up to the present
moment. The United States have gone crazy
on what is called mass production. There is
no nation in the world that is able to approach
the United States to-day in manufacturing.
Canada lies alongside this country, and just as

SENATE
soon as this boom in the United ýStates stopsand it may stop somne time-we shall have
ail over Canada a condition somewhat resemýbling -that whiceh my honoura;ble friend toni.ght referred to as existing in the Maritime
Provinces.
We are facing some very serjous problems
to-day, and 'in my opinion they can be solved
only hy treating themn in a more sympathetie
way than that in xvhich some of my fellewcountrymen approach these questions. I sincerely hope that this is flot the flrst step in
the direction of doing sometýhing to hring
the West and the East nearer together. So
far as through freight rates are concerned,
they should be reduced. If the Railway Commission cannot sc its way clear to reduce
them, Parliament will take hold of that question and shorten the distance hetween the
East and the West, that tihousand miles of
barren territory north of the Lakes, and in
somne way help to overcome that barrier, and
get a through ýfreight rate so that the Western
prodiiets will go east and the Eastern products
go west at rates someWhere nearer what Vhey
were ýbcfore the war.
Now, I do not want to take up any more
time at this late hour, but I thought perhaps there was an imipression that we were
complaining about these concessions being
made to the Maritime Provinces. I have net
heard a word of complaint in that regard in
Central Canada or anywhere else. I wish
the reduction in freight rates had been greater
than 20 per cent. If it had been I should have
heen very pleased to support it.

Respectfully submitted,
A. H. Hinds,
Chief Clerk of Committees.
Clerk of the Divorce Committee.
lHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY.

In this connection I desire to refer to the
fact that 48 Bills which had been recommended by the Comnittee and passed by this
House fell by the wayside last year, in consequence of the dissolution of Parliament. I
came all the way down from the West in
order that those Bills might be passed again
at the sittings we held in December. It was
not a very pleasant or convenient trip to be
obliged to take, in order to be present here
for four day. Other members of the Committee, who were nearby, were kind enough
to attend and constitute the Committee.
Being, as Chairman of the Committee,
more in evidence than other members, may I
express in the presence of the House my very
grateful appreciation of the kindly aid and
assistance of other members of the Committee, several of whom have attended here during adjournments of the House, as well as at
other times, often at considerable inconvenience
to themselves, and have devoted themselves
to the work. No Chairman could do his work
as satisfactorily as we have endeavoured to do
it, and as we hope it has been done, unless he
had the aid of other members competent to
deal with the cases presented. So much for
that aspect of the work.
It is due to the Senate to state what has
become of the Divorce Bill for Ontario that
we passed at this Session. I presumed it was
left to me to sec that the Bill was introduced
in the other House and put through if possible. In this respect I have acted in concurrence with an honourable member on the
other side of the House, a very influential
member from Ontario, and it has been our
joint opinion, reached after conference with
members of the other House, that owing to
the lateness of the Bill and the shortness of
the Session we might imperil its passage if
we pressed it unduly at the present time. At
best, it is only a private Bill. I do not know
that any Government, however willing it
might be to sec it passed, would be particularly desirous of accepting the responsibility
of fathering it. Such has been the experience
of the past, in any event. However, it is my
intention,. immediately after the opening of
the next Session of Parliament to submit to
this House the same Bill that has been passed
unanirnously by this Chamber, in order that
the other House may deal with it early in
the session.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: Has the Bill fallen by
the wayside?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: No, it has not.
It has never actually been introduced.

FEDERAL DISTRICT COMMISSION
BILL
THIRD READING

On the Order:
Third reading of Bill 280, An Act respecting
the Federal District Commission.-Hon. Mr.
Dandurand.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, when we were in Committee of
the Whole on this Bill, I moved an amendment, which was adopted, and which read as
fohlows:
Subi ect to the provisions of this Act the
Commission shall possess and be vested with
the assets, rights, credits, effects and property,
real, personal and mixed of whatsoever kind
and wheresoever situated, belonging to the Ottawa Improvement Commission, and shall pay,
diseharge, carry ont and perform ail the debts,
liabilities, obligations and duties thereof.
Since that time the Minister of Justice and
our Law Clerk have examined into the situation that will be ýcreated by the transformation
of the old Commission into the new Commission, in order to make sure that the new
Commission will bc seized of aIl that appertained f0 the old Commission, and they have
suggested the addition of a clause which
reads:
The Act constituting the Ottawa Improvement Commission, Chapter 10 of the Statutes
of 1899, the Act continuing the said Commission, Chapter 62 of the Statutes of 1919, and al
amendments to the said Acts are hereby repealed, and the provisions of this Act are substituted for those of the said Acts and amendments.
The purpose of this is to make applicable
the saving clauses of the Interpretation Act
of 1906, the repeal clause as now worded
being too wîdc. This amendment is of a
technical nature, and I take it for granted,
the Minister of Justice and the Law Clerk
having concurred in it, that the Senate wîll
accept it.

dream seemed to be one of his great desires.
Now, honourable gentlemen, I 'believe that
the people of Canada from ocean to ocean
would be sympathetic, in fact enthusiastie,
towards the idea of establishing a real
Federal District, but in my opinion, the titIe
of the Bill before us, "An Act respecting the
Federal District Commissioni," is a misnomer.
It appears to me that the city of Ottawa
wants to est its cake and still have it. I have
no obi oction to our spending money to
improve the appearance of the city. 1 admit
that Nature bas done a great deal to beautify
it but, withont desiring to be too csritical, it
seems to me rthat îor about three or four
months each year Nature has still a great deai

Now, if we are going to spend! millions of
dollars for the establishment of a Federal
District, we should have a Federal District.
If we are flot to have a Federal District, why
should weceaql it thwt? The establishment of
a Faderai District at Washington took away
from. that area the right to representation in

lion. Mr. STAN'FIELD:

You are righb.

Hon. Mr. .SOHAI'FNER: I believe the
people of Canada want a FediraiJ District,
and I believe they are willing to spend large
sums of inoney upon it; but personally I
objeet to a matter of this kind being camouflaged; and, without any desire to be offensive,
m'ay I say that to me this Bill seems nothing
short of camouflage. As I said in my opening remaWks, the late Sir Wilfrid Laurier, 'when
in another place, gave his blessing Vo the ides
of a Federal District, but I amn exoeedingly
doubtful w'hether he woulld give his blesing to
this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I arn under the
impression that my honourable friend, in~ his
condemnation of the title of this BOIt, is ini-

378

fluenced -by the fact thst when we speak of a
Faderai District we naturally thin< of Washington. I was flot in Council when the matter
was discussed and, I oonfess that when this
suliject was first men.tioned, I hastened to
look into the Bill to sep what it meant. There
are such things as pious wishes, and, as the
honour-able gentleman lias said, Sir Wilfrid
Laurier did express a desire for the estalihisliment of sucli a district. I would, suggest
to my honourable friend that early next session
lie should take Up thiS idjea and move a
resolution stating that this Clianber believes
the time bas corne to transform Ottawa and
the surrounding country into a FaderaI District. If lie does so, I will vote for bis motion,
and if the Senate of Canada votes for it, it
may have some affect upon the other Crbam'ber.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Then do I understand tliat this Bill is flot for the purposa of
establishing a Faderai District?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: No, and yes.
It is for the purpose of continuing the operations of the old Commission, but it increases
the amount of money wlich may be axpended.
So mudli work bas bean done in the past that
a considerable sum will be neceasary for
maintenance. Ottawa lias ýdeveloped; the surroundings have developed; the walks and
roads have been increased.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: And the smells.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The woark bas
been well done. As lias 'been said in anothar
place, 'the beautifying will go on not only in
Ottawa proper, but also, in the surrounding
area. including the otlher sida of the river.' Sa
honourable gentlemen wil sea, tliat the sphere
of operation of tlie Commission will ha extended. I have always advocated a FaderaI
District sucli as that of the capital of the
United States, and I will not alter my views

Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
I hava ýbeen struck by the same tibouglit that
'ias been expressed by the honoura-bla gentleman sitting bahind me (Hon. Mr. Soliaffnar).
The title of the ýpresent Conmmi.ssion is "tii
Ottawa Improvement Commission." Wýhy is
that changed? The moment the naw title is
confirmed tilera wiil ha a confusion of fact
witli idea. The impression conveyad 'ta the
public mind is tliat we hava progressed from

Really it onýly amounts ta au extension of thea

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: May I point out
ta my riglit honourabla friand (Riglit Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) that the reason seams
ta mie ta be this. Wlien, in 1898, the Ottawa
Improvemant Commission, as it was called,
was created, it had a jurisdlictian lîmited ta
Ottawa. Siýnce then the operations of the
Commission have been extended beyond
Ottawa. For instance, it lia but a bridge,
which now terminates at the interprovincial
boundary, but whicli it is intended ta carry
across the river ta the Quebec sida in order ta
connect witli higliways there. I think also that
some money has been spent in thie city of Hull.
Just what more is in'tended I do not know,
but it is evidentýly thouglit thlat something
more will ha donc in Hull, or an thie other sida
of the interprovincial boundary.

Could wýe
create a District extcnding on bath sides of

their riglits, and that sort of thing, witliout
amending tlie constitution or witliout agreement on the part of the provinces?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
My opinion is
that you could not do that witliout the consent of the authorities on the other sida of
the river-the Provincial Governments and the
municipal authorities.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
mients-Ontario and Quebec.

Bath Govern-

APRIL 12, 1927
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Both the'legislative authorities and the municipal authorities. My idea afl along has been that if a
Federal District were created it would be
wholly predicated upon the consent of the
different bodies exercising jurisdiction within
the limita fixed. Otherwise there would be
a violation of provincial rights. 0f course
the Government might decla.re the work to
be for the general advantage of Canada and
exercise powers of expropriation; but it would
have to bé in strict accordance with provincial
and municipal rights, whatever they may be.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: But I would point out
that neither the Province of Quebec nor the
Province of Ontario could, by mere consent,
give away any part of thcir territorial jurisdiction. The whole matter would have te go to
the Imperial Parliament for an amcndment to
the Constitution, as mentioned by the 'honourable gentleman. on this aide.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But if there were
consent aIl around there would be no occasion
too go to the Imperial Parliament.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: How can the Province
of Ontaria consent to give up jurisdiction over
one of the counties of Ontario? They cannot
do it. The jurisdiction over the county, in
Provincial mattera, lies with the Provincial
government.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:' I do not think this
Bull would involve the giving up of jurisdiction by Ontario a/t aîl. It would operate merely
to the extent of doiag the work necessary for
the purpose of the District-the completing of
highways, or parka, or things of that kind,
which would not, or at all events need noit,
be done in contravention o! Provincial rights.
The whole project is prcdicated on the general
consent of all concerned, and there would be
no necessity fer any amendment of the Constitution if the parties agreed to develop the
scheme.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: No; if you -are talking
about the expenditure of money on roads,
gardens, and that sort o! thing, 1 quite agree;
but if you are talking of a Federal District
over which you are to have jurisdiction, that
is another thing.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: I would suggest to
the Government tha.t they should. make it a
condition of any further expenditure on the
beautification of Ottawa that the cîty should
put in a decent water supply, and also
eliminate the odors from the suîphide works.
The water supply of this city la a standing
disgrace to a centre of its size and importance,
situated as Ottawa is, in the midst of almost

31

the mont magnificent water country in the
world. To think that people have to drink
and bathe in doped water year in and year
out is ridiculous. As -far as the other nuisance
ia concerned, my friends in Ottawa say that
they get accustomed to that smeli, and like it.
To those of us who are accustomed to living
in a place where we get the breezes that blow
across* from the cherry tresa of Japan, and
where the air is frcah, this stench is very disagreeable.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I think I arn called
upon to make some observations in regard to
that, because I have been a member for
and have resided in Ottawa for a long time.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: And the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Barnard) has made
an attack.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, and I think
he has a precedent for it, too. As I mentioned the other day, a very serious effort
was made some years ago to aff ord Ottawa
a systemn of pure water. Ottawa was not
altogether remiss or negligent about that
matter, because the city actually secured from
the Legisiature of the Province of Quebec a
special Act which authorized it, as a city,
to go to the Thirty-one Mile Lake and another lake, generally ealled the Pemichango
Lake, to secure what would have been a
perfect water supply. The city of Ottawa
apent quite a bit of money for surveys and
plans, and prepared to expropriate for the
1 do not
purposes of getting that water.
remember exactly, but my impression is that
it waa largely the war which prevented the
financing of the undertaking, but the scheme

have a rather vivid recollection of the matter,
because a member of my family was unf ortuna,tely a victim of a typhoid epidemnic
which prevailed here at that time.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That was before.

Hon. Mr. BARNARD:
that water by-law was defeated by the ratepayera of the city of Ottawa. That is why
I say that until the property owners of this
city are preparcd to spend some money to

the Government should not spend so much

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not disagree
entirely with that, but I arn only pointing
out that Ottawa did make an effort.
Hon. Mr. BARNARD: Not very much.

SENATE

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: The Council did
make an effort, but the plan was not carried
out, because the ratepayers would not ratify
the scheme.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
It might be
well to take an example from Australia, where
they have established a Federal District called
Canberra. I know that neither Victoria nor
New South Wales wanted the Parliament to
do that; they wanted Melbourne or Sydney
to be chosen; but Parliament took a neutral
attitude and made the new Federal District
in New South Wales. Whether it corresponds
exactly to that at Washington I do not know,
but it is under the jurisdiction of the Government.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I want to offer
a few words in addition to what I said the
other day. I think this a bad Bill. I do not
think it would stand the serions consideration
of members of this House for an hour. It is
proposed to spend 34,000,000 running over a
period of 16 years. It is proposed to let these
Commissioners capitalize their income for the
purpose of borrowing a large amount of
money. It does not limit the Commission
in any direction, and the whole of this investment is unsecured.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: But the Commission cannot (o anything without submitting
its plans to the Government and getting the
Government's approval.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I quite understand that, but I discussed the other day the
difficulty under which the Government deals
with this matter. The expenditure is unsecured. No business man would undertake
to put so large a sum of money into an investment without security. Because of the
difficulty in dealing with municipal and Provincial Governments the investment cannot
be secured; sound plans cannot be made; and
the fact that the Bill comes to us camouflaged
with the name of Federal District Commission only adds to future difficulties.
The Bill might well stand over for another
year. It passed in the other House without
criticism or discussion, and it bids fair to go
through this House without criticism or discussion. I submit it is a bad Bill, and it
should be voted down. As I said the other
day, let the Government take its courage in
both hands and do something worth while in
the inauguration of a real Federal District
under a plan by which the money appropriated may be soundly and safely invested
and a definite programme carried out.

THE IMPERIAL CONFERENCE, 1926
DISCUSSION

CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from April 6 the debate
on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Griesbach:
That le will call the attention of the Senate
to the Report of the Imperial Conference,
1926, and will enquire of the Governmîeit in
what directions and to what extent it proposes
to act upon the same.-(Honourable Mr. Dandurand.)
Hon.
R.
DANDURAND:
Honourable
gentlemen, when I was asked last week to
"speak now" on this inquiry in order to make
known the views of the Government, and to
allow honourable members of this Chamber
to discuss them intelligently, I suggested that

I might well continue the tradition of speaking last, inasmuch as the members of this
Chamber were aware of the official statement
that lad been made in another place. My
right honourable friend the junior member
for Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster) said that he wanted information direct,
and that he should not be obliged to go next
door for it.
There was a reason for my suggestion. W
had two official delegates at that Conference,
the Prime Minister and the Minister of
Justice. They made their official statement
from their seats in the House of Commons. I
take it for granted that those pronouncements
carry far more authority than my explanations
could, and that their statements should belong
to both Houses of Parliament. I could well
abstain from projecting my own personality
into the debate, and simply read those two
statements, for they would be absolutely complete. That is my reason for suggesting that
the honouraible members of this Chamber were
well aware of the views of the Government

APRIL 12, 1927
on the report of the Conference, since the
official delegates had been heard in the other
Chamber.
1 listened with pleasure, as I always do, to
the remarks cf my honourable friend from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach), and there
is a considerable part of bis statement which I
thorough-ly enjoyed. But I confess to an
impression that he had marred to a certain
extent his statement by showing too strong
a tincture of partisanship in his opening remarks. The subject seemed to me to call for
more independent and more lofty views.
*My honourable friend said that the report
of the Conference, as explained by the
delegates from Canada, had been acclaimed
by the separatists throughout the land, and
also 'by the American press, which had seemed
to see somewhat of a revolutionary act in the
decision of the Conference. Well, I may tell
my honourable friend that neither the Prime
Minister nor the Minister of Justice was
responsible for whatever comments were made
in the American press on the result of the
Conference. That press represents thousands
of newspapers and editors who have their own
views, and who see things from their own
angle. But though the Prime Minister and
the Minister of Justice are not responsible
for aIl the sayings of the press of the United
States, including the Yellow Press, I believe
that my honourable friend is responsible for
hie statements.
What is the meaning of bis statement that
the separatists in Canada acclaimed the report
of the Conference as given by the Prime
Minister? Surely it means that the majority
of the people of Canada endorsed the idea of
isolation, and that the majority in the House
of Commons did likewise, else it would never
appear to the American press that there was
a majority in Canada for separation. I think
the statement is somewhat extravagant, but
they might welýl draw from my honourable
friend's assertion the inference that the report
of the Conference was acolaimed by all the
separatists in Canada, when in reality it was
received with considerable enthusiasm, and I
would say with practical unanimity, by public
opinion in Canada.
May I add that it must have been received
with considerable satisfaction by the honourable gentleman's own leaders? I think I
shall be able to show that as I proceed. I will
name Sir Robert Borden; I wilI name Mr.
Meighen; I will name the members of their
Cabinets who affirmed the same principles as
those that are to be found in the report of the
Conference, and who surely must have been

381

quite satisfied to see that their views had
been eambodied in the Conference.
My honourable friend spoke of the
American press and cited one review, the
Literary Digest. He could have have cited
very many important papers in the United
States of higher standing than the Literary
Digest, which I think would have given us
the sober views cf the thinking men of the
United States. Here is what the Washington
Post, a most influential Américan Newspaper
said of the Conference:
It may be observed that if the government
of George III had possessed the wisdom of the
government of George V, there would have
been no declaration of independence, and the
United States would now be part of the British
commonwealth. The evolution from an empire
to a commonwealth is accomplished by mutual
consent, and no written constitution will follow to bind the bargain.
That is the statement of a paper that treats
the question seriously, and that finds that if
there had been men as wise under George III
they would have saved the American States to
the Commonwealth of Great Britain.
My honourable friend was somewhat more
in his element when he spoke of military
matters. He dilated particularly upon the
fact that Canada showed an absolute lack of
preparedness for defence, and he cited the
respective contributions of the members of
the British Empire. He stressed more especially the contribution of Australia for defence, in comparison with our contribution.
He went the length of affirming that Canada
to-day, in the Pacifie, was dependent upon
Australia.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: No; I went the
length of affirming that the organization of
Australia contributed in some measure to the
defence of Canada. I did -not say that Canada was dependent upon Australia, because
that would be too sweeping and wholesale a
statement. I made it very clear that the defensive organization of Australia-their army,
their air force, and their navy in the Pacifie
-contributed in some measure to the defence
of Canada. I did not say in what measure,
because no one can say that. I do not want
to be understood as saying that Canada is
dependent upon Australia.
That would be
going too far.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: My honourable
friend simply echoed a statement made, somewhat more bluntly, by Mr. Bruce when he
was here. He asserted that the navy of
Australia could come to the protection of
our coasts. I took it for granted that my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. 'Griesbach) was
practically joining in that statement of the

SENATE
Prime Minister .of Australia.
Mr. Bruce's
statement and the more limited and more
prudent statement of my honourable friend
amused me considerably. I have been following the trend of opinion in Australia. I
know what is the Australian program, and
what it stands for. It was said at one time
that Australia would remain white, even if
it did not remain British. As was shown by
the fact that it seized a potential enemy, it
has been constantly thinking of its own defence.
It has expressed a desire, and it is a laudable
desire, to do as much as possible in that
direction.
My honourable friend is likely aware of
the view held in Great Britain with regard to
the respective situations of Australia and Canada in the matter of Empire defence. Professor Zimmern, of Oxford University, said
some time ago that Canada was a producer
of security, while Australia was a consumer.
I resent-.I have always resented-the accusation that Canada was sponging on others
for its protection or defence, and I know that
a number of Canadian leaders have resented
that imputation. Going back some years, I
may cite the opinion of a leader of my honourable friend's party, Sir Charles Tupper,
who, in his speech in Winnipeg in 1893, said:
I deny tlat we are a burden to the empire. I
say that if to-miorrow Canada was dissevered
from the crown of England. if to-norrow Canada becane a portion of tliat great republie
which lies to the south of us, England could
not reduce lier arny by a man, nîor lier navy by
a slip. She wouîld want more soldiers and
sailors and ironclads than slie lias to-day in
order to maintain lier prestige. I say, if this
great continent was closed, as closed it Would

being streiigtliened, sle would be enoriously
weakened.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: That was thirty
years ago.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: There was organized in 1905 or 1906 what was known as
the Round Table. The leading spirit in that
movement was Mr. Lionel Curtis who organ-

ized Round Table

groups

throughout

the

British Empire. I belonged to the Montreal
group, as did the late Captain Talbot Papineau, and Mr. Curtis used to say that we represented the Opposition in that group. He
published a book with a white page alternating after each printed page, and he sent copies
of the book to all the groups, for annotation.
It was a splendid work, enabling him to ascertain the opinion or the trend of thought
throughout the Empire. Those groups were
composed of university men and other men
Hon.

Mr. DANDURAND.

of weight in the community. When Mr. Curtis had received all the reports he proceeded
to make a compendium of that work, and
when he came to Canada he declared, as one
of his first statements, holding in his hands
the report of those Round Table groups:
"Canada is the only part of the Empire which
does not need the Empire."
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) is a soldier. I have been told by people
who have seen him grow up in his community that lie has always been essentially a
soldier. It is no surprise to me that he thinks

in terms of force; but I would like to point
out to him that the majority of the Canadian
people think in terms of peace. They are

preoccupied in clearing up the aftermath of
war and in developing this country. The
people of Canada do not forget that their
military budget up to 1919 was $12,000,000,
and that as a consequence of the war the
budget including pensions and interest on

war debts, jumped to $140,000,000.
The honourable gentleman's leaders were
at Paris and Versailles, and I admired the
work they had accomplished when, with the
representatives of the Allies, they signed at
Versailles the Treaty of Peace, containing as
its first chapter the Covenant of the League

of Nations and bound themselves to the following enactment:
The Meibers of the League recogiize tliat
the maintenance of peace requires the reduction of national armaments to the lowest point
consistent witlh national safety and the enforcement by commnon action of international obligations.

The Couîncil, taking account of the geographical situation and circunstances of eaci State,
shall formîulate plans for sucli reduction for
the consideration and action of the several Govermnents.
My honourable friend looks at our present
budget and expenditure and alludes to all
that Canada did during the war. It would
seem to show that Canada did its part and
can well afford to stand by that

obligation

which it signed at Versailles, looking to a
general reduction of armaments, and not an
increase, as lie suggests.
Let us revert now to the subject-matter of
this discussion, the report of the Conference.
It was stated in the Speech from the Throne
that the report of the proceedings of the Conference, together with its recommendations,
would be placed before Parliament for consideration. The report was tabled in each
House. My honourable friend complains that
the Prime Minister did not move its adoption
in the House of Commons. The Prime Min-

ister did as was done in the British Parliament.

of the Dominion in March 1919-and many
members of his Cabinet are in this Chamber:
All the treaties and conventions resulting
from the Peace conference should te so drafted
as to enable the dominions to become parties
and signatories thereto. This procedure will
give suitable recognition to the part played at
the peace table by the British commonwealth
as a whole, and will, at the same time, record
the status attained there by the dominions.
The procedure is in consonance with the principles of constitutional government that obtain
throughout the empire. The crown is the
supreme executive in the United Kingdom and
in all the dominions, but it acts on the advice
of different ministries within different constitutional units; and urader resolution IX of the
Imperial War conference, 1917 the organization
of the empire is to be based upon equality of
nationhood.
An Order in Council was passed in 1920
concerning the extra-territorial jurisdiction of
Canada. It affirms that with respect to all
matters appertaining to the self-government
of Canada, we must have sovereign legislative
authority. It adds:
In the growth of the constitution the United

and good government of Canada within its constitutional range of aithority as it is for the
United Kingdon within its own domain, or
for the empire as a whole in relation to imaperial affairs.
Then I find recorded in Sir Robert Borden's
book, Canadian Constitutional Studies, the
opinion of Mr. Meighen:
Inl May 1921. the Canadian Prime Minister
declared that the relations between the constituent parts of the empire must be based
ipon a conception of complete freedom and
equality in national status. Further te observed that the practical need would te n-et

Individual declarations were made by Lord
Balfour, by the Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd
George, by Mr. Bonar Law, as Prime Minister,
by Mr. Amery, and by all the Ministers of
Great Britain and Canada during the past
fifteen years; yet they created no commotion.
How extraordinary it is that no excitement
was created when, with the concurrence of
the Leaders on the other side of the Atlantic,
men representing their country, and speaking
in England, or on the floor of Parliament here,
declared that we were sister nations, not subservient one to the other. Yet there seems to
be some commotion,-to what extent, I do
nat know, or whether it is artificial-when

of the Empire.
They were the words of Sir Robert Borden, of
Mr. Meighen, and of his Minister of Justice.
Here they are:
They are autonomous comnnunities wvithin the
British Empire, equal in status, in no way subordinate one to another in any aspect of their
donestie or external affairs, thougli united by
a connion allegiance to the Crowin, and freely

associated as niembers of the British Commonwealtlh of Nations.
To judge by the form of my honourable
friend's question, and by the interruption
which he made a moment ago, he surely
thought that that document needed legislation to give it effect. I repeat that document proclaims only the general principle of
equality. The legislation to adopt this vital
principle of equality of status to the various
activities of the Dominion will come in due
tine.
The honourable gentleman from Montarville (lion. Mr. Beaubien) did not protest
against the general principle, but seemed to
be somewhat disturbed by the consequences.
Perhaps my honourable friend from Edmonton (Hon. Mr. Griesbach) is in the same
frame of mind. The honourable gentleman

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: When the Internai Eeonomy Committee failed to obtain

Hon. Mr. DANIEL: I think this was the

nlot know whether the resolution of the Internial Economy Coanmittee which was passed
last year cauld be utilized to cover the three
cases, but at ail events if this is merely
reaffirming a decision of that Committee to

that it wiil have to be included in the estimates of next year, because no money bas been

Hon. Mr. GRAHAM: Your first choice was

afraid that the movement in Russia would

that we needed such exceptional and harsh

Hon. Mr. BUREAU: Honourabie gentlemen, I desire to move that the Bill he flot

in the fot-lowing manner:
That ail the words after the word "Nicoiet,"
in the 22nd lina thereof, be stricken out and
the following substituted therefor
"The eastern boundary shall ba : the prolongation of the eastern boundary of the city of
Threa Rivers across the St. Lawrence river te
the south shore of the said river."
I may say that 1 have had an interview
wjth the Ministar of Marine, who accepta *Vhe
proposed a.mendment. The obi ect of the
clause as it la in the Bill was to take from
the Harbour of Týhree Rivera certain territory
lying in the County of 'Champlain. In se domn the Bill went further and cut off a part of
the City of Three Rivers fromn the harheur
limits. The purpose of this amnendmant is
to prevent that, and so that there may be no
mistaka wa make the easterly boundary of
the city of Three Rivars the aasterly beundary of the harbour.
The proposed amendmant was agreed to.

APPROPRIATIONS

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Mr. BEIýQUE: Bafora the Ordars of

refer to a suggestion whieh was made yasterday by tlha right honourable member from
Cttawa (Right Hon. Sir George E. Foster)
in connaction with the amandmant which waa
made to the Report of the Committee on
Internat Economy and Contingent Accounts.
1 have no fault to flnd with what was donc
yesterday; it involvad only a amail amount,
and I do flot intend to criticize it at ail;
but I ask whether it would not he propar to
amend our rutas to this effeet: that no ap-

propriation shahl be made

on monays at

the

disposai of the Senata excapt upon and in
virtue of the adoption of a Report of the
Standing Committea on Internal Economy
and Contingent Accounts and previeus full
consicieration by that Comfmittea. I think
that both leaders of the House might conaider
whether at the opening of next Session the
rulas should flot ha amended in that direction.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND
Honourable
gentlemen, I amn fairiy in accord with that
suggestio n of my honourabie friend. Somne
fifteen or twenty years ago a decision te that
affect was arrived at by the Senate. Up te
a certain tima thera had heen occasional
motions made in this Chamber varying the
report of the Internai Economy Committea,
and the door was openad te solicitations that
were absolutaiy unseemiy. Then, af.ter a
declaration of the wiit of the Sanate, the
question was settlad, net by a rule, but by
a ganeral understanding.
If this suggestion meets with the views of
honourable membars of the Senata, I would
ask the Clark of the Senate to kindly take
note and to ramind us of it at the opaning
0f next Session, se that wa may pass upon it.
THE IMPERJAL CONFERENCE, 1926
DISCUSSION CONTINUED

The Sanata rasumed from yastarday the
Datbate on the inquiry of Hon. Mr. Griasbacli:
That lie witi cati the attention of the Senate

and itil anquire of the Government in what
directions and te what axtent it proposes to act
upon the same.

SENATE
Hon. F. L. BE1QUE: Honourable gentlemen, I purpose to take but a short time of
this honourable House to analyze the result
of the work of the last Imperial Conference.
It will enable us, I believe, to realize better
the extent and importance of the field covered by the report of the Inter-Imperial Reand the remarkable,
lations Committee
statesmanlike manner in which the whole
matter was dealt with.
The report of the Inter-Imperial Relations
Cornmittee, prepared and signed by Lord
Balfour as Chairman, is too important not
to be the object of consideration and debate
in this House as well as in the House of
Commons. I should have expected, however,
that it would have been examined in both
Houses on its merit only, and without any
party preoccupation whatsoever.
As agreed by all who have taken part in
the debates, in this House as well as in the
House of Commons, the report is merely the
expression of the opinion of the distinguished
members of the Conference, and is advisory
only. We have it both from the Prime
Minister and the .Minister of Justice that at
the opening of the Conference they made it
clear that they were there as representatives
of the Dominion of Canada to confer with
representatives of other Governments of the
Empire to reach such conclusions as it might
be possible to reach, and then to report them
to this Parliament, but with no authority
whatever to bind the latter.
I agree with the suggestion that if the report were simply laid on the table without
being followed by any discussion, we might
be held in the future to have acquiesced in
the opinion, or pronouncements, contained
therein. Hence. the propriety of giving the
report all the attention it deserves.
The House heard yesterday-I am sure, with
saisfaction-the clear statement which was
made by the honourable leader. It was in the
proper tone in every respect.
Th Prime Minister wa.s criticized for having
made his statenient on the Report on the
motion of the Minister of Finance that the
House go into Committee of Supply, instead
of making a motion expressing the approval
by the House of the proceedings of the Conference, as he had previously stated he would
do. I do not think it matters much in what
form the report was brought to the attention
of Parliament, and the course followed seems
to have been the best. If I am not mistaken,
it was the course followed in England, and
while affording opportunity to all members to
criticize and express freely their opinion on
the report, it left to any of them who night
Hon.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

choose to present a motion of disapproval
the full responsibility of doing so.
The report may be divided into two parts.
The main and first part deals with and defines
the present constitutional position and mutual
relations of the group of sel-f-governing cominunities, composed of Great Britain and the
Dominions. According to the Report,
They are autononous coimunities within the
British Empire, equal in status, in no way
subordinate one to the other in any respect of
their domestic or external affairs, though united
by a common allegiance to the Crown, and
freely associated as members of the British
Commiionvealth of Nations.
That is followed by this qualification:
Free institutions are the life blood of the
British Empire. Peace, Security, and Progress
are among its objects. And though every Dominion is now, and must always remain, the sole
judge of the nature and extent of its co-operation, no common cause will, in the opinion of
the members of the Committee, be thereby imperilled.
It would have been difficult to use more
or more comprehensive
precise, elearer,
language.
The second part of the Report deals with
"existing
administrative,
legislative
and
judicial forms, dating back to a time well
antecedent to the present stage of constitutional development, and which are not wholly
in accord with the position as described
above." As to some of those forms-such
as the title of His Majesty the King, the
position of Governors General, Treaties,
procedure in relation to and form of
Treaties with foreign nations, the abolition
at the will of any of the Dominions of the
right of appeal to the Judicial Committee
of the Privy Councili-the Committee felt
prepared to pass upon them. As to the other
of
reservation
the
as
questions-such
Dominion legislation for the signification of
His Majesty's pleasure, and the exercise of
His power of disallowance; the difference
between the legislative competence of the
Parliament at Westminster and of the
Dominion Parliament, in that Acts passed by
the latter operate, as a general rule, only
within the territorial area of the Dominion
concerned; the operation of legislation passed
by the Parliament at Westminster in relation
to the Dominion, such as the Colonial Laws
Validity Act-the Committee came to the
conclusion that the issues involved were so
complex that there would be great danger
in attempting any immediate pronouncement
other than a statement of certain prin'iples,
which in its opinion underlie the whole
question of Dominion legislation. The Com-

APRIL 13, 1927
mittee further expressed the opinion that in
the future, un-iformity of legislation, as
between' Great Britain and the Dominion,
could best be secured by the enactment of
reciprocal statutes, based upon consultation
and agreement; that with regard to disallowance and reservation of Dominion legisl.ation,
it should be placed on record that apart from
provisions embodied in constitutions, or in
specific statutes, expressly providing for
reservation, it is recognized that it is the
right of the Government of each Dominion
to advise the Crown in all matters relating
to its affairs; that the appropriate procedure
with regard to projected legislation in one
of the self-governing parts of the Empire,
which may affect the interests of other
self-governing parts, is previous consultation
between His Majesty's Ministers in the
several ,parts concerned; that with regard
to legislation having extra-territorial effect it
should similarly be placed on record that the
Constitutional practice is that legislation by
the Parliament at Westminster applying to
Dominions would only be passed with the
consent of the Dominion concerned. It was
felt that, for the rest, it would be necessary
to obtain expert guidance as a preliminary
to further consideration by His Majesty's
in Great Britain and the
Government
Dominions, and that steps should be taken
by them to set up a Committee with terms
of reference on the lines mentioned in the
Report.
As to Merchant Shipping legislation, it is
suggested that it be likewise referred to a
special sub-committee, invited "to consider
and report on the principles which should
govern, in the general interest, the practice
and legislation relating to merchant shipping
in the various parts of the Empire, having
regard to the change in constitutional status
and general relations which has occurred since
existing laws were enacted."
On reading the report, one can easily see
that it was prepared by a statesman of great
ability, which is still more apparent if we refer
to a discussion between Lord Parmoor and
Lord Balfour in the House of Lords. I will
refer to only a small part of the debate, which
deserves to be read again. I will give, not
the full reference, but only the main part.
Lord Parmoor said:
No one can say that the dominions, for
instance, are in no way subordinate to the
British parliament in any aspect of their
domestic or external affairs. They are subordinate, not only in theory but in practice, in
constitutional practice, in many directions both
as regards their domestie and their external
affairs.

393

And a little further on:
It has been authoritatively laid down that
the obvious purpose and meaning of the
Colonial Laws Validity Act are to reserve the
right of the imperial legislature to legislate
for the colonies to which a local legislature has
been given, and to make it impossible for
the colonial legislatures to enact anything
repugnant to the imperial legislature, but not
otherwise to derogate from its general legislative authority. As a matter of fact, under
the Colonial Laws Validity Act and what is
known as the principle of reservation, a series
of matters bas been reserved or kept under
the jurisdiction of the British parliament at
Westminster. For this reason: although you
may lay down a principle of this kind in very
wvide language, yet when you come to its
operation you will find that in a considerable
number of cases what may appear to be a mere
act of a local legislature of a dominion is of
a character that may substantially-I use that
word purposely because it is a word that has
been applied in legal language-affect the
interests of the mother country.
To this Lord Balfour answered in part as
follows:
I must honestly say that to this part of the
speech I have the most fundamental objection.
He seems to me to have approached the subject
entirely in the wrong spirit. He does not deny
that lie sympathizes with those declarations;
lie does not deny that that is the sort
of idea that he himself cherishes; but lie
says: "What folly to lay down the general principles on which this empire is now constructed.
I think you should first settle all the preliminary details, and smooth away all the technical
difficulties whieh have their origin in the long
history of our overseas dominions."
Lord Balfour continues:
I cannot imagine any policy from which I
more profoundly differ. You are to set yourself every kind of problem, every sort of difficulty whieh May conceivably arise in the course
of applying the broad principles of equality
of status before you dare to announce that
equality of status exists.
Can anything be more legal or less statesmanlike? I cannot even put myself in the
frame of mind of the noble Lord on that subject. He asks, for instance, if the Dominions
want to separate from us what exactly would
happen then, what sort of notice ought to be
given, by what procedure would it lie done?
You might as well consider all the causes of
divorce before you decide upon the problems
of matrimony.
Does not the noble Lord see that it would be
impracticable for the conference of the Dominions and the Mother Country to meet at Westminster to say: "Well, on the whole we are
inclined to think the idea of empire is one to
which we may all look forward and which will
embody equality of status, but just think of how
many questions we must decide before we get to
that point. Here is this difficulty and there is
another difficulty arising out of the act of 1865.
There are all these problems with regard to the
Merchant Shipping Act. We must settle all
those before we decide on what principle this
collection of self-governing states is to work
together." I boldly say to your Lordships'

394

SENATE

House that that is from beginning to end the
wrong way of going to work. We have gonre on
exactly the opposite way.
I said in reference to the relations between
the mother country and the dominions-in a previous speech he had made"My own personal view is that the relations
are those necessary of equality. None of us
conceive that of this conglomeration of free
states one is above the other. One may have
more responsibility than another, one may be
in more dangers than another, one may be
closer to the centre of international complications than another, but ail are on an equality.
That is the very essence, as I understand it,
of the British Empire. As to exactly what that
equality involves, as to exactly what degree of
responsibility each bas for the other, on that
I personally think very little is gained by refining, discussing or deflning."

with on any important point-stands. that no
control is exercised by any single one of the
self-governing parts of the empire over any
other part of the empire.
I wish I could find appropriate words to
express my admiration of the manner in which
constitutional questions are thus dealt with
by British statesmen.
It is tire duty of the Senate. in examining
the report, to ascertain wiether there is any
ground for dissent from any of the pronouncements contained in it; whether the program, as- laid out by the Committee referred to. is proper; or whether there is room
for other suggestions, and w-bat the suggestions
are., For my part, after having given the
report iy best attention, I have no criticism
whatever to make of any of its pronounce-

Then he concludes:
Remember exactly what the position is. In
this country we are ail familiar with the idea
of equality between the self-governing portions
of the empire. I will not give the quotations,
but it has been stated by various high authoritics for the last quarter of a century and bas
never, J think, been formally contradicted
within these shores. But that is not the position in ail the Dominions.
In many of the
Dominions there is a minority-in most cases,
I daresay, a very small minority-who are
always following tie train of thougbt which
recommends itself so much to the noble Lord.
They are always looking at these survivals of
an earlier past and saying: "how ean you consider that w-e in this or that Dominion are
on an equality with the mother country whben
we find still unrepealed this or that statute?
If yon are to ailow that kind of statement to
go uneontradicted. unqualified by the broad
considerations of equality witi whici you ought
to begin, of course you can get in an audience
mixed up in local controversy a certain anount
of opinion in favour of the assertion that,
whatever talk may go on in England, in this
or that Dominion things are far otherwise and
the boasted equality between tire varions selfgovernreg parts of our empire does not, in
fact, exist. It does, in fact, exist.
What is contrary to the fact are these survivais of a previous condition of things. survivais which have no practical effect, which have
no practical interference with tbat quality
which each part of thle self-governing parts
of the empire may justly claim for itself, but

fier the British Dominions appear in this list.
I cannot speak aubheritatively as te why
Great Britain did 'net accept the clause, which
would bind it to submit ail questions of a
juridi-cal nature te the International 'Court;

was in September, 1924, that, for the first time
in the history of the world, two great powers,
Great Britain and France, were ready te sign
a Protocol which would bri-ng Ithem down te
the level of the weakest nations in the world
in the arbitration of any difference they
might have with any outsider. But in the

declaration te that effeet was made by Sir
Austen Chamberlain on the '14tn o-f March,
1925, at a Council meeting at Ceneva. Net
only did Sir Austen Chamberlain, 8peaking
for the Baldwin 'Government, declare that hie
was abselutely opposed te the Protocol, but,
te my surprise, he declared in ne uncertain
terus against the very principle of compulsory arbitratien.
The right honourable gentleman from
Ottawa explained why the Protorol was rejec'ted, and said t.hat the world. was expectin.that there would be an alternative proposition.
That alternative proposition came in regional
agreements, in whieh are te be found the
very principles underlying the Protocol. The
main reason, I believe, which actuated the
Baldwin Goversiment, is te be found. in the
fact that the Protocol, with its compuisory

397

arbitration clause, would throw upon Great
Britain, with her fleet, the obligation to act
as the policeman of the nations in the maintenance of peace throughout the world, *and
that the ratepayers of Great Britain would
have to bear the cost of the general surveillance or superintendence of the administration of the Protocol -and of baýcking up and
sup.porting the decisions of the Council at
Geneva. Great Britain feit that this involved
a tremendous risk and an enormous responsibility. I am flot ready to dissent-from the
decision which was made, because the responsibility would flot be upon my shoulders,
but upon the shoulders of the taxpayer of
Great Britain. There was another reason, 1
believe, which actuatcd the British Government i~n refusing to sign the Protocol. It
is to, be found, I think, in the fact. that the
United States would net 'be a party to the
Protocol, and that under special circumstances
there migbt arise a clash or conflict *ith the
United States in the application of the
economnic sanctions of the Coun-cil at Geneva.
I think these were the principal reasons whi.ch
actuated Great Britain, and w.hich would
justify the rejection of the Protocol. I confesa that 1 was 'less able to, agree with the
advi.sability of going to t:he extent of rejecting
even. the principle of .compu]sory arbitration;
but that is a matter for Great Britain to
decide for herself.
Now, what va;s Canada's attitude on this
question? 'Canada's attitude was somewhat
different from that of Great Britain. On thc
9th of March, 1925, a dispatch signed by the
Prime Minister, as Secretary of State for
External Affairs, was addressed. to Sir Eric
Drummnond, the 8ecretary General of the
League of Nations, ini which. this paragraph
appears:
That as Canada believes flrmly in the sub,
mission of international disputes to joint inquiry or arbitration, and has shared in certain
notable undertakings in this field, we would
be prepared to consider acceptance of the
compulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court
in justiciable disputes with certain i eservatiens, and to consider methods of supplementing the provisions of the Covenant for settienient of non-justiciable issXies, including method*
forý joint investigation, reserving ultimate de-*
cision in domestic issues and without undertaking further obligations to enforce decisions
in case of other states.
As honourable gentlemen will see, Canada
was net rej ecting the principle of compulsory
arbitration. On the contrary sh-e was ready
to adbere to it, and with certain reservations,
expre.ssed lier willingneas to join in submitting
ahl justiciable questions te the International
Court of Justice.

398

SENATE

I may say at this point that the reservations
mentioned in this dispatch from the Canadian Government were intended to be adjusted to the same plane as the reservations
which Sir Cecil Hurst, had declared as those
to which the British Government would adhere
in the matter of submitting justiciable questions to the International Court of Justice.
Sir Cecil Hurst, as the representative of the
Foreign Office was speaking for the Ramsay
MacDonald Government, which was then in
power. I mention this in order to explain
that the reservations which were contained in
our dispatch were intended to harmonize with
those formulated by the British Government.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER: My
honourable friend will excuse an interruption
for the sake of accuracy. He has spoken of
reservations which were named in that
iispatch. Perhaps it would be more accurate
f be were to say reservations which were
iinted at, but which were not named.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will read the
phrase again:
We would be permitted to consider acceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the
Pernaneit Court in justiciable disputes with
certain reservations.
Tley were not explicitly mentioned.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Thev were hinted at.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
They were
hinted at, because the Canadian Government
felt that those reservations would need to
be examined jointly with the British Government. so that they should be in harmony with
the decision arrived at in London.
It may interest honourable members of the
Senate to know that one of those reservations
mentioned explicitly by the representative of
the Foreign Office, Sir Cecil Hurst, was the
doctrine of the British Government as to
rights of search and of blockade on the seas.
That was to be fully reserved so that when,
under the Protocol, Great Britain would take
action to execute the will of the Lcague of
Nations it should not be hauled before the
Court of International Justic for its exercise
of the mandate that was given it. Ail members of the Senate know that as to the rights
of sea powers there are two doctrines; one
is called the Continental doctrine, and the
other the British doctrine. Sir Cecil Hurst
said: "If we are to become supporters of
the Leagie of Nations and to take action in
order to give sanction to the decisions of that
court, we do not want to be hamp-red in
such action, and we would like to reserve
our right of interpretaticn with regard t) our
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

action on the seas."
I remember that the
representative of France rose and said: "Well,
I am not disposed to contest any of the reservations which are now mentioned by the
representative of Great Britain. Great Britain
was such a good tyrant during the late war
that I have no objection to its continuing
on the same line."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Would my honourable friend allow me to ask him, what decision was reached on that point?
As my
honourable friend has just explained, Great
Britain said: "Very well, we shall endeavour
to compel the sanction of the decisions according to our own policy and practice." Was
that agreed to by all the rest? What became
of the question ultimately?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
There was a
study of the extent of the reservations that
might be made under clause 36, and it was
decided that such reservations could be made
with regard to entry into the International
Court and acceptance of the obligation to
submit such cases. Nothing has come of that
preliminary work, because the Protocol has
not come into effect; it did net receive the
necessary number of signatures of the great
powers. It was signed by a sufficient number
of the speondary powexrs, but not of the firstclass powers, or the great powers, as we call
them. It could come into effect only if three
great powers signed. France affixed its signature on the spot. I do not now reiember
the details, although I stated thern whcn discussing the Protocol a year or two ago. The
Baldwin Government in Great Britain refused to sign. Japan did not sign, nor did
Italy. So the necessary signatures were not
attached to the Protocol and the Covenant
remains as it is.
I may say that Canada's situation is a
peculiar one when it comes to deciding whether
or net it will accept the compulsory submission of all differences to the International
Court of Justice. I surmise that nine-tenths,
if not all, of the questions of difference that
might arise between this country and the outside world would be questions concerning the
neighbouring Republic, and our southern neighbour has not yet adhered to the International
Court of Justice. So there is no pressing need
for Canada te join when it knows that it could
not suggest to the United States even a reference to the International Court, so long as the
United States had not joined the Court.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: We assume the
responsibility without getting the benefit.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:

Well, yes.

APRIL 13, 1927
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
would be.

That is what it

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Yes, that is wha(
would bie.
My right honourable friend (Rigbt Hon.
Sir George E. Foster) bas said that there was
an impression abroad that the Dominions influenced Great Britain in its decision not to
agree to, that compulsory clause. I will admit
that such an impression did exist. It existed
to, such a degree that the permanent delegate
of Canada at Geneva, Dr. Riddell, called our
attention to that matter in 1925, and it brought
to the rostrum the bonourable the Speaker of
the Senate, who was one of the official
delegates.
How was the impression created among the
nations that the Dominions had stayed the
hand of Great Britain? The explanation is
to be found in the fact that Sir Austen Chanmberlain, on the l4th of March, 1925, in making
his statement, which contained a clear refusal
to adhere to the Protocol and accept coinpulsory reference to the International Court,
addcd that the Dominions were of the saine
mmnd. Hie did not emphasize the fact that
Great Britain had reached a decision before
Canada. I mentioned that fact when I explained what had taken place with regard to
making of the Protocol and its rejection. The
Government of Canada was informed of Great
Britain's action before it drafted. the dispatcb
of the 9th of March. Sir. Austen Chamberlain
was simply making a statement, which was
true, of the fact that the Dominions were
rejecting the Protocol, but he did not stress
the fact that our despatch was not on the
saine hues as the pronouncement of tbe Britisb
Government.
I have read our dispatch, which declared
that we were ready to join the International
Court, but with reservations. In the previous
year we happened to be ready, as was the
British Government under Ramsay MacDonald. On the 9th of March tbe policy of
the British Government bad been altered by
the elections; yet our situation was as defined
by that resolution.
Hon. M-r. WILLOUGHBY: What attitude
did the other self-governing Dominions take?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: For reasons wbicb
they stated in despatches or documents sent,
they were unable to sign the Protocol. Each
one viewed the matter from bis own angle. I
do not know wbether they have appeared
publicly in pr.inted f ormn, but we have here
ini our External Affaira Department ail the
answers of the various Governments, and I
saw them at the tume.

it

399

Honi. Mr. BELCOURT: As a matter of
fact, it cannot be said that Canada or any of
the Dominions refused to accept the Protocol.
Wýe did accept conditionally.
'Hon. Mr, DANDURAND: Wel], no. We
did flot sigo the Protocol. That la the situation. That was the refusai. And in the
dispatch. we stated, why we could flot:
The Governent of Canada desires to state
that after careful examination of the subject
it bas corne to conclusions which may bc summarized as follows.
It gîves its answer, from whi'ch the conclusion may clearly be drawn that we are
incapable, for the reasons given, of signing or
adhering to the Protocol.
Hon. Mr. BELGOURT: What I mean to
say is that it can just as well be interpreted
as an aceeptance of the Protocol, subject to,
certain reservations, which were not stated.
To xny ýmid itr is an acceptance of the principle, aubject to certain reservations. And
s0 it is was, I understand, with the other
Dominions.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: As my honourable friend bas put the question, I will read
from the dispatch:
First-that Canada should continue to give
whole-hearted support to the League of Nations
and particularly to its work of conciliation,
co-operation and publicity.
Second-that we do not consider At in the
interests of Canada, of the British Empire or
of the League itself to recomrnend to Parliament adherence to the Protocol and particularly to its rigid provisions for application of
economie and military sanctions in practically
every future war. Arnong the grounds for this
conclusion is the consideration of the cffect of
the non-participation of the United States upon
attempts to enforce the sanctions and particularly so in the case of a contiguous country
like Canada.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: That is one of the
reservations.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, the
doors still remnain open. We have not bluntly
rejected the Protocol.
I have admitted that the impression prevailed that the Dominions had in.fluenced
4Great Britain. In answer to my right bonourable friend (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster), 1 stated that we found that impression existing at Geneva, and that our permanent delegate had drawn our attention to
it. At the suggestion of Dr. Riddell, who,
is in constant contact with the representatives
of the foreign States, the honouiahie the
Speaker of the Senate mounted the rostrum
to mýake clear the position of Oanada, and

40u

SENATE

read to the Assembly the despatch of which
I have just spoken, as containing fh- views
of the Dominion of Canada.
In connection with this matter therc was
enacted a littie scene which had its amusing
side. The brilliant representative of Switzerland, Mr. Motta, asked the Assembly in 1925
to express the wish that the twenty-five
States that had accepted compulsory submission of all differences to the International
Court of Justice for a certain time should
renew their obligation. Here was a resolution
submitted to the thirty other States , those
that had not signed that volunzary clause.
They were asked to be good enough to give
their support to an urgent request that the
twenty-five States that had signed it should
renew and continue their obligation.
This
is what the Assembly voted:
The Assembly, noting with satisfaction the
faet that up to the present fifteen States have
accepted the optional clause of the Statute of
the Permanent Court of International Justice
concerning the compulsory jurisdiction of the
Court;
Honourable gentlemen will notice that at
moment there were but fifteen such States:
there are now twenty-five.
Noting also that some of those States have
assuîmed this obligation for a period which will
shortly terminate;
Requests the Secrctary-General of the League
of Nations to draw the attention of such States
to the measures to be taken, if they consider
it proper, in order to renew in due course their
undertakings.
That resolution was preceded by a speech
showing the advantage of all States joining
in that obligation to submit all justiciable
questions to the Court. The Assembiy voted
unanimously to urge the fifteen States that
Lad signed for a certain time ta renew their
undertaking. Thus the virtue of that optional
clause regarding the compulsory jurisdiction
of the Court was recognized by certain States
who abstained for the time being from assuming the obligation.
In closing these remarks I will read that
part of the report of the Imperial Conference which deals with this very matter.
At page 23 of the Summary of proeeedings,
copies of which have been distributed to all
members of the Senate, will be found, in a
chapter headed, "Particular Aspects of iloreign
Relations Discussed by Committee", tle following statement:
It was found convenient that certain aspects
of foreign relations on inatters outstanding at
the time of the Conference should be referred
to us, since they could be considered iu greater
detail, and more informally, than at meetings
of the full Conference.
(a) Compulsory Arbitration in International
Disputes
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND.

One question awvhich we studied aras that of
arbitration in international disputes, with
special reference to the question of acceptance
of Article 36 of the Statute of the Permanent
Court of International Justice, providing for
the compulsory submission of certain classes
of cases to the Court. On this inatter we decided to submit no Resolution to the Conference, but, whilst the nemibers of the Committee
were unanînious in favouring the widest possible

extension of the method of arbitration for the
settlemuent of international disputes. the feeling
was that it was at present prenature to accept
the obligations under the Article in auestion.
A general understanding was reacied that noue
of the Governments represented at the Imperial
Conference would take any action in tle direction of the acceptance of the conipulsory jurisdiction of the Permanent Court, without bringing utp the matter for further discussion.
My right honourable friend (Rt. Hon. Sir
Geo. E. Foster) Lad oft perhaps read that
oart of the report, which is a complete answer
to lis question. He may express surprise at
Canada having tied its hands for the next
three or four years, but in view of the action
of the United States respecting that tribunal,
there is no pressing need for Canada to sign
the Protocol. The Conference meets every
four years. We can well afford to wait until
the next Conference and see what will happen
in the meantinie. But I am quite sure that
if the United States decided to join that
Court and accel that compuisory jurisdiction
clause-it is somewhat doubtful that it will,
but if it did-I have the very strong conviction the Canada, through its Parliament,
would hasten to declare to our neigbbour that
we were ready and anxious to follow the
United States to that tribunal and submit
there any differen-ce that might arise between
us.
I hope that all differences between Canada
and the United States will be settled amicably,
but if ever there arose the least difficulty
which would need to be ironed out before
any tribunal, I am sure Canada would be
unanimous in its decision to propose to the
United States to submit the difference to an
arbitral court, either ho Hague Tribunal or
any other that might be agreed on between
us.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, under the rules I have
no right of reply, and I do not intend to ask
the courtesy of the Chamber even to allow
me to make any extended remarks, but I
take it that I shall be permitted to make two
observations. One is that in the latter part
of the remarks of my honourable friend he
joined the discussion of my question with the
discu-sion of the report of the Imperial Conference.

401

APRIL 13, 1927
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Which bore on
A.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER.
As one bore upon the other. So in taking
up the discussion upon the previous matter
I shal bie able to follow somewhat along
that line.
The other remark that I wished to make
was that wbile the reply of my honourable
friend was informative, and while I arn glad
that it bas been placed upon Hansard, the
discussion as to the acceptance or nonacceptance of the Protocol was flot necessarily
a part of the question, and did not bear
directly upon it. Honourable gentlemen will
please keep that in mind when they are reading
what bas taken place.
I tbank my bonourable friend for bis treatment of the question. I agree with almost
everything hie has said; but lie bas not
produýced tbe documents tbat I asked for.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I arn not going
to make any remark, but I would. like to
ask the honourable gentleman as to tbe
attitude of tbe United States and the
reservations that tbey put in. Did the
Congress of tbe United States agree to accept
tbe Court of Permanent Arbitration, subject
to tbe reservations that they suggested?
My right
Hon. Mr. ])ANDURAND:
honourable friend was an active participant
mn the debate in Geneva in September, and I
will leave bim to answer the question.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
It vêill be for the better information of my
honourable friend, and to save tbe time of
the flouse, if I refer bim to the report of the
Assembly of 1926, in which he will find the
matter delegated to the League. If bie is not
satisfied witb what lie flnds there, lie will see
an interpolated note which will direct him to
the Department of External Affairs, where lie
will get everythîng that was said on both
sides.
Our own
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
Department of External Affairs?
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:
Yes. I bave no doubt rny honourable friend
will lie interested in following that out. I
may say, just as an answer to bis question,
that the reservations, five in number, made
by the Senate of -the United States, were ail
practically agraed to by the signatory powers
at tbeir conference in Geneva last September.
With reference to the fifth one, three-quarters
of it was agreed to, but there was a disagreement on that part of the reservation which put
the United States in the position of prohibiting
the court from giving an advisory opinion upon

any question submitted to it by either the
Council or the Assembly if the United States
bad, or claimed to bave, any interest in the
matter. I amn very greatly in bope that when
the United States get over their next presidential pirmefion they will take tbat matter up and
agree to the principle that was laid down by
tbe signatory powers, wbich. was, that in every
respect the United States, though flot belonging to the League of Nations, should be
placed on an absolute equality with every
nation that belonged to the League, having
just the samne powers, but net having any
pewers, either discriminatory or probibitory,
that a member of the League of Nations did
not pessess.

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER:

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: 0f course, the
right honourable gentleman has realized that
I was obliged to speak on the Protocol, because in 1924 the matter of joining the court
came up at the saine time as the question
of tbe ratification of the Protecol.
Riglit Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Yes. I was not criticising my honourable
friend on the point.

NORTHWEST TERRITORIES BILL
CONSIDERATION IN

On the Order:
The House again in Committee of the
Whole on Bill 123, intituled: "An Act to
amend the Northwest Territories Act."(Honourable .Mr. Dandurand.)
I would ask
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the House to go into Committee on this Bill
as I think we might finish it in a few minutes.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I was going to
suggest to the honourable gentleman that he
might consent to an amendment, to bring the
Bili into effect a year after the date
mentioned in the Bill. It is now 1928. Make
it 1929. That would have two effects. It
would allow information as to the tax to
penetrate into that country, which would take
a long time; it would afford opportunity to
people in that Territory to make arrangements based on this tax; and it would also
enable the government to make their plans
for the collection of the tax, and would give
time for the people of that country to make
a protest against the Act when it comes into
operation.
The honourHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
able gentleman desires that this Act should
come into force on the lst day of January,
1929, instead of 1928?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: Yes. The outfits for northern trade are probably starting
forth now. They are probably assembled now
at Fort McMurray for that trade, and others
are going from the south and from Vancouver
into the Aretie. There will be no time for
the information to spread over the country
so that people can make their arrangements.
These outfits that are going up now will not
make their returns till the freeze-up in the fall.
Would not my
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable friend think that the news would
have plenty of time to spread between now
and the 1st of January next through the
wireless stations tihat dot that country?
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: They do not it;
that is the trouble. There are only two of
them in the north, -one at Fitzgerald and the
other at Aklavik. They exist in the imagination of the Government.

The motion was agreed to, and the Bill was

THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. MeMEANS moved the third
reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, the purpose of this Bill, respecting the Midland Railway Company of Manitoba, is only to bring
the railway under the jurisdiction of the
Railway Commission by declaring the works
of the company to be for the general advantage of Canada. The Midland Railway is a
short line of only about six miles. The stock
of the company is owned by the Great Northern and the Northern Pacific, and the company
bas running rights between Winnipeg and
Emerson over the Canadian National, which
is under the jurisdiction of the Railway Commission. There bas been some doubt whether
the Railway Commissiorers of Canada could
exercise jurisdiction over the Midland Railvay, because it had a Provincial charter. The
purpose of the Bill is merely to declare that
the six miles of railway are for the general
advantage of Canada.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: There should be no
objection to that.

Hon. W. B. ROSS: I do not think there is
any objection.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: We need not
take our present procedure as a precedent and
treat ail Bills likewise.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: Oh, no: we will take each
one by itself.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Each one on its
merits. We can arrange for the Railway Committee and the Committee on Banking and
Commerce to meet either at the close of the

when they would have an opportunity, if
they desired, to examine any Bills referred
to them. However, I have no objection to
the present Bill.
Right Hon. Mr. 'GRAHAM: Honourable
gentlemen. the only question that might
reasonably be asked is, does the Province
object to this railway being taken out of its
jurisdiction and placed under the Federal
authority?
Hon. Mr. MoMEANS: There is apparently
no objection. The Bill came before the House
of Commons and was dealt with there. There
was no objection at all, that I know of.

was carefully considered in the Miscellaneous
Private Bills Committee of the Commons, at
which Mr. Finlayson, Superintendent of Insurance, attended on behalf of the Government. Mr. Finlayson pronounced it absolutely unobjectionable, and it passed unamended.
It is almost word for word a copy of the "Act
to incorporate Knights of North America,"
passed by Parliament in 1925. The objects
are entirely benevolent. The incorporators
are Italians, who desire an organization similar to those of many other nationalities in
Canada.
Hon. Mr. MACDONELL: May I ask the
honourable gentleman has it, by any chance,
any relation to the Ku Klux EMan?
Hon. Mr. STANFIELD: The Ku Klux
KMan, I believe, are English-speaking people,
and these are Italians. I do not think this
has anything to do with the Klan.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill

32655--26J

Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Yes. They come under
the general Act. The Bill merely creates a
corporation and declares the amount of its
capital.
Hon. Mr. MeLENNAN: Honourable gentlemen, I think this House which has established a very sound reputation for the care
that it takes in the examination of all legislation, ought to go slowly in passing Bills-for
example, in this case-without any definite
assurance to us regarding their provisions. I
am quite certain that what the honourable gentleman (Hon. Mr. Beique) has just said would
be brought out by an examination of theBill; but any Bill which comes before us in
the closing days of the Session, and to which
there might be objection, ought to be referred
to Committee. As we have time, would it not
be better to submit this Bill for examination
to the Committee on Banking and Commerce,
which the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Dandurand) has said will meet again?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: The honourable gentleman will permit me to repeat this. The first
clause contains the names of the parties who
are incorporated. There cannot be any objection to that. The second clause declares:
The persons named in section one of this
Act shall be the provisional directors of the
company.
The third clause reads:
The capital stock of the company shall be one
million dollars.
The fourth clause:
The head office of the company shall be in
the city of Montreal in the province of Quebec.

The fifth clause:
The company shall have all the powers,

be subject to all the limitations, liabilities and
provisions of The Trust Companies Act, 1914.
Those are all the provisions of the Bill.
there cannot be any objection to it.

So

Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Certainly. if it
came before the Committee, I would not
object to any of those clauses. But I had not

of the Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
gentleman might state why we are giving it
the third reading without any further comment. Both he and I heard the Clerk's remark, but perhaps it was not heard by the
Senate.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: It had better go on record.
Honourable gentlemen, I am moving, with
the leave of the House, for the third reading
of this Bill, because it is one of those Bills
that were examined in this House last year
and passed all their readings. It simply missed
getting the Royal Assent. So there is no necessity to go over what was well done last
year.
The motion was agreed to, and the Bill
was read the third time and passed.

SECOND READING

Hon Mr. BEIQUE: I move the second
reading, and wili move that the Bill be referred to Committee.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Is it the intention of the House to send these Bills to Committee this afternon, or to-night?
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Perhaps this afternoon,
at the rising of the House. We shall sec when
the House adjourns.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The reason is
that Rule 119 says:
No Committee on any Private Bill originating
in the Senate (of which notice is required to
be given), is to consider the same until after
one week's notice of the sitting of such Cornmittee bas been posted up in the lobby; nor, in
the case of any such Bill originating in the
House of Commons, until after twenty-four
hours' like notice.
So we should suspend that rule in regard

ta this Bill.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I will move that
we suspend this rule and all the other rules
pertiaining to the moving of Bills from one
stage to another, until the end of the Session.
The motion was agreed to.
The motion for the second reading of the
Bill was agreed to, and the Bill was read the

Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. POSTER: Did
they abject to religion? Is that the idea?
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I believe there
were certain declarations of faith that were
offensive to other people. The Bill is to incorporate the Free Methodist Church in Canada. Apparently there are two Conferences
in Ontario, one in the eastern and the other
in the western part of the province; one in
Saskatchewan, and one in Alberta. At present, I believe, there is no incorporation of
these bodies at all. They are incorporated in
the United States and the Canadian churches
have been functioning under the jurisdietion of
the authority in the United States.
This Bill is to create them a corporation, and
vest in the new corporation created by this
Bill all the property now -owned by the various
churches, for the use and benefit of the individual churches.
I think that is perhaps all the explanation
that is needed, and while I have no objection
to the Bill going to a Committee, I would
ask to have it read the third time, because I
believe there is absolutely no objection to
the Bill from any quarter now.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: This matter concerns only the Methodist Church?

On section 1-export tax on furs:
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Honourable gentlemen, I have had one or two interviews
with the officials in the Department who have
charge of this Bill. They came to me to
discuss the amendment which I suggested the
other day, and after going over the matter
we agreed upon the following amendment,
which I wish now to move.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
the two amendments?

Yeu discussed

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes; we discussed
both the amendment proposed by my honourable friend from Toronto (Hon. Sir Allen
Aylesworth) and the one I proposed, and we
agreed on the following as a substitute for
subsection (r):
The levying of a tax upon furs to be shipped
or carried fron

the Territories to any other

part of Canada, or to any other country.
Hon. W. B. ROSS: What is the meaning
of that?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: It is to strike
out the objectionable expression "export duty"
or "expert tax." Honourable gentlemen will
remember that there were two amendments
suggested; one from the honourable gentleman from Toronto (Hon Sir Allen Aylesworth), and the other from the senior member
for Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Belcourt). As my
honourable friend from Ottawa has said, the
Department has agreed upon the new form
of amendment which he has just moe d. It
means that this is done with the consent of
the Minister of the Department.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Belcourt was
agreed to.
On section 2-coming into force:
lon. Mr. DANDURAND:
I may say that
I am disposed to accept the postponing of
the date when the Bill will come into force
until the lst of January, 1929, but the loss
of $75,000 or $100,000 will be upon the
conscience of the honourable gentleman from
Edmonton (Hon. Mr. 'Griesbach).
Right Hon. Sir ;GEORGE E. FOSTER:
What is the reason for the postponement?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
My right
honourable friend was net here when the
honourable gentleman from Edmonton suggested that traders are leaving now for the
north and they would not be able to
disseminate the news of the new policy.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: I pointed out that
the outfits which were leaving now would not
reture until next year, and that people like

the trappers and traders in that north
country should be given ample notice as to
when the Act begins to operate, so as to
arrange their business in accordance with it.
They are trading now for next year.
I move, in amendment, that the date for
the coming into force of the Bill be changed
from January 1928 to January 1929.

DEBATES

OF REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. POIRIER moved concurrence in
the third report of the Standing Comnnittee
on Debates and Reporting.
He said:

Honourable gentlemen, lest some

of vou fil to remPrmber thPe contents of this
report, or failed to take cognizance of it, I
will read it:
The Standing Comnmittee on Debates and Reporting beg leave to make their third Report,
as follows:Your Committee find that the present arrangement for the translation and publication
of the French version of the Senate Debates
is not satisfactory, and beg to recomtmend to
the consideration of the Senate that the
previous arrangement of employing two debates
translators be restored.

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:
old arrangement?

What was the

Hon. Mr. POIRIER: I am going to explain
it. The purport of this recommendation is
simply to revert to the old order of things.
We had. pretty nearly since Confederation,
two French translators of the Debates. I will
admit they did not give full satisfaction. Two
years ago, for most excellent' reasons, I have
no doubt, it was proposed, not by the Cornmittee, but some other authority, to change
what had existed since the beginning and to
have one translator only, with the privilege
of employing help in periods of rush.
Now, honourable gentlemen, what my honourable friend from St. John (Hon. Mr.
Daniel) has said about the stenographers is
true in this case. He contended, quite properly, I think, that we should have permanency
in the staff; otherwise the work done is apt
te b of an inferior character. As I say, the
same principle applies, and with greater

APRIL 13, 1927
force, to the translation of the debates. Last
year, with oniy one translator, we had an excellent translation as far as it went, but the
temporary heip which had Vo be engaged at
random, did not prove sati.sfactory. Their
translation was inferior.
The French speaking inembers of this House
have as mucli riglt Vo geV their reports in
good Frenchi as the English members have to
get theirs ïn good Engiish. As I say, there
is no fsult to be found with the Editor of
Frenchi Debates, as I think he is officialiy
caiied. He is a good transistor, but -the assistance lie lias had to empioy lias not proved
equal to the task. It is efficiency that we are
after. Since we apparentiy have Vo be surbservient; Vo the House of Comnsons in matters
of internai economy, just as it appears that
we have Vo foiiow the United States in the
matter of the International Court of Justice,
I may say that in the other flouse they have
thirteon permanent transiators of Hansard. I
therefore do not think this request on liohaif
of the French-speaking members is extravagant.
Now. the main question is the cost. I lielieve that wo are entitied Vo two transistors, even thougli it shouid cost more. But
that wiii not lie the case, honourabie gentlemen. A saving, and a pretty considerabie
saving, wili bie effected. I need not go beyond
the Report of the Internai Economy Committee Vo show it. In the Report presented
on Wednesday, the Gth of Vhs montli, whicb
is Vo lie found at page 340 -of the Minutes of
the Senate, I read:
Transiating Debates, $3,825.
That is in addition Vo what is paid Vo Mr.
Potvin. Transistors in the other flouse are
paid from $2,800 Vo $3,600 per annýum. The
remuneration of the new appointee wili be a
matter for fis Honour the Speaker and the
Cierk te, decide upon. Assuming, however,
that the transistor is paid the maximum
figure, there woulid stiii be s saving of over
$200 a year.
This year Mr. Potvin, I believe, was sick
for some ime, and we had not one transistor at our disposai. Any of us who wished
Vo enj oy a privilege similar Vo that of the
English-speaking members of the flouse had
io means of doing so, even liy paying for it,
as we have Vo do Vo a certain extent, because
thu, one transistor we had was sick. That
situation, which may occur again, should nothe
made permanent. We shouid have Vwo transistors who wiil put in tweive or fourteen hours a
day, if necessary, in order Vo secure the efficient translation of the debates of Vhs flouse.
The Vwo transistors wouid have more ieisure
during the recess. and wouid lie able Vo catch

up with the work. This is what the Committee on Debates and Reporting wants. It is
oniy reasonabie, I think, and only fair to
expeet that there shouid be no serious objection to the adoption of this Report.
Hon. -Mr. TUB RIFF: Honourable gentlemen, I arn not at ail satisfied that this Report
snouid be adopted. I admit that I do not
understand the question very thoroughly, but
I have tried to flnd out something about it.
I went Vo the Clerk of the Senate and ýasked
him about the matter. and he telis me that.
thero has been no compiaint whatever on the
score of the transiator having too mucli work
to do. If that is the case, why should we
appoint more translators? IV is ail very weil
for my honourabie friend Vo say that it would
cost less. I have been in this flouse long
enough to know that when you appoint more
officiails the cost is more-is bound to, be more.
I wouid like to find out more about Vhis
matter, -and in order to do so, I would move
that this debate be adjourned.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: With what end
in view? Does the honourabie gentlemnan
propose the adjournment of the debate Viii
inext Session?
Hon. Mr. TURRIFF: Yes, that would ho
a very good solution.
Or tiil toHon. Mr. DANDURAND:
morrow?
Hon. Mr. TURRLFF: I am agreeabie to
that.
Hon. Mr. DANIEL: Honourable gentlemen, I did noV hear exactly the motion of
my honourabie friend from Assiniboia (Hon.
Mr. Turriff), but as Chairman of the Internai
Economy Committee 1 think perhaps I may
be permitted to say a word or two. The
Internail Economy 'Committee, as you al
know, is one of the large Standing Committees
of thîs House. It consists of 25 members,
and is representative of all the different shades
of thouglit in this Chamber. I must say that
the Report lirouglit in by my honourable
friend from iNew Brunswick (Hlon. Mr.
Poirier) was a great surprise to me, because
I thouglit that anything reiating to the internai economy of this Chamber wouid first
be introduced into the Committee on Internai
Economy, whioh lias been specially appointýed
to look after such matters.
It lias also been a surprise Vo me Vo learn
from the Report -presented that there lis houa
any dissatisfaction whartever with the manner
in which the translation of the debates in this
Cham.ber, and s-Don, is performed. You wiii
remember t(hat last year we appointed as -,

SENATE
member of 'the staff, at $4,000 a year, a gentleman who had been translating the debates of
this Chamber under contracts. He was to do
the work which previously had been done by
two men, and, I understand, not very satisfactorily done, at a cost of $5,000 a year. By
putting that gentleman on the staff we were
really saving a sum of 81,000 a year. It seems
rather unusual for another Committee to
bring in a Report now upon entirely different
ines, and apparenitly without communicating
with the Clerk of the Senate to find out
whether he had received any complaint. It
goes without saying that if the work in any
branch of the Senate is unsatisfactory the
Clerk of the Senate should be aware of it.
He is the deputy minister of the department,
and all these varions branches are under him,
and complaints should first reach him, so that
he would be able to make some investigation
of the matter before it is presented to this
Chamber.
Under these circumstances, as Chairman of
the Internai Econorny Committee, I think it
would be inadvisable to adopt this Report. I
think it would be much better to refer the
Report, if you wish, to the Internal Economv
Conunittee, so that they could confer with
the Clerk of the Senate and then take such
action as in their wisdom seemed best. I am
very sorry indeed that I cannot vote for the
recommendation w'hieh my honourable friend
bas brougrht in. The Committee which he
represents consists f. nine members, of whom
six are French Canadians, and they would
nemessarily have more knowledge of tra:nslation than I. As I say, it would give me more
pleasure to vote for the recommendation of
the Committee, but I think this matter is
forced on the Senate a little too suddenly,
without giving the Clerk of tie Senate, or
the Internal Economy Committee, any opportunity of looking into it. For these reasons,
I think it is better that the adoption of the
Report should be postponed so that the
matter may be considered during the recess
and any clhange that is considered necessary
made at the next Session of Parliament.
Hon. Mr. McCOIG: Honourable gentlemen, I heartily agree with what the honourable gentleman has just said. I think this is
a matter that could be very well dealt with
after a thorough investigation before the
Internal Economy Comnmittee, of which I
happen to be a member. I do not think it
should he dealt with too hastily. If there is
any complaint we should have it looked into
very throughly. I should be very glad to
support the amendment moved by the bonHon. ir.

DANIEL.

ourable gentleman from Assiniboia that the
consideration of this question be deferred
until next Session, when we can have before
us the officials of the Senate who will be able
to give us the benefit of their advice.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: Honourable gentlemen, when this matter came up the other
day, notice was given of a motion to refer
the Report of the Debates Committee to the
Committee on Internal Economy.
At that
time some question arose in my mind as to the
propriety of one Committee reviewing the report of another Committee. I feit that if
that were to be the decision of the House, it
would mean that the Internal Economy Committee would be treated as the Finance Committee, with control over the financial part of
reports coming from other Committees.
I am not ready to adhere to the idea that
the Debates Committee should be deprived of
its initiative and autonomy. J feel that perhaps it would be better for this Report to be
returned to the Debates Committee, or to be
suspended, in order that at the opening of next
Session the Committee may make a thorough
inquiry. I realize that the Committee had but
one sitting on this matter, and I am informed
by the Clerk of the House that the understanding with the translator was that when he
was appointed ha would receive the sum of
$4,000, the amount of the preceding contract,
and would be given help only after bis work
had gone beyond 800 pages; and I think that
ha was given help, under those conditions,
under the contract. The Clerk of the House
bas told me that the matter of extra help did
not arise last year, because the number of
pages, I am informed, was but 700 or 800, and
that extra help was not granted, nor asked,
this year, because the number of pages will not
go much beyond 400. I confess that I am
somewhat surprised at the high figure mentioned, of 800 pages, for a single individual.
To translate so many pages seems to be a remarkable feat. I do not know how many pages
the translators in the Commons do. However,
the matter could perhaps be investigated in the
light of the work done in past years under the
contract, as compared with the work done
under the present arrangement.
I remember that when there was a question of bringing the present occupant of the
position into the service, although not myself
a member of the Debates Committee or the
Committee on Internal Economy, I suggested
to the Clerk of the Senate that some help
should be given to the translator, in order
that half ai bis salary might not have to be
paid to outsiders for assistance in translation.

that this report was brought in. It seems to
me that tbe Speaker and the Clerk are held
rosponsible by the members for the work of

Speaker and the Clerk, I fbink, are anxious
that the business of the Senate should ho

the convenience of bonourablo members of

account the question of expense and are desirous of keeping the finances of the Senate
in proper slitpe and preventing any money
from being wasted. We found sorne time
ago that the question of franslating the unrovised Hansaýrd wes a very expensive matteT

Now, the effeet of this report would be that
an effort would be made to resu-me the work
of baving the unrovised Hanserd translated
into, Frenchi. It is not so mucli a question of
flic cost of translation as of the cost of printing-the amount we should bave to pay to the
Printing Bureau.
As has beon pointed out by the lionourable
genfleman from St. John (Hon. Mr. Daniel),

SENATE
the figures referred to by the Chairman of
the Committee on Debates and Reporting
(lon. Mr. Poirier) were those for the year
ending March 31, 1926. For the year ending
March 31, 1927, we have the salary of the
Translator, who was appointed at a salary of
$4,200 per annum. If this report were to be
carried, we should have also the salaries of
one or two translators. as the case might be,
and, in addition, a great expense would be
incurred in the cost of printing, which we
should have to pay to the Printing Bureau.
I dEsired to iake that statement so that
honourable members of the Senate might understand the position, and I would like to say
that I think a matter of this kind should have
been brought to the attention of the Clerk
and nyself before it was submitted in the
formn of the present report.

Hon. Mr. POIRIER: May I say a word as
to the matter of correcting proofs?
If we
talked over the question it would be foundithat
there is no reason why the French members
should not do to the French version what
the English members are doing to the English version. There would be no additional
cost in the printing, because there would be
only one copy sent to the press.
As for our failure to notify his Ilonour
the Speaker and the Clerk, it is 'egrettable
that we did not do so, but there was not the
faintest idea of doing wrong when we moved
in the very way that all Committees do. If
Standing Committees exist in this House it
is for the purpose of taking the initiative in
matters appertaining to them.
We thought
there was no reason to consult the Finance
Committee, since the money is voted, indeed
over-voted.
We thought we knew as mouch
as others about the French language and what
is proper translation. I must pay his Ilonour
the Speaker the compliment of saying that
he has learned the language remarkably well,
especially as to pronunciation; and I do not
doubt tiat the Clerk is a French s-holar too.
But we thought we were as efflicient to judge
of good French as those gentlemen are, or
as my honourable friend from St. John
(Hon. Mr. Daniel). He is a scholar-a Latin
scholar, too-of the first magnitude, I am
glad to tell you.
In not notifying these
gentlemen, our purpose was not th offend
any of them; we simply thought we were
within our rights, and I still think we are
moving in the right way. The recormendation will come from his Honour the Speaker
and the Clerk, acting as Minister and Deputy
Minister. The appointment will date from
the opening of next Ses-ion, and we shall

again say that Mr. Potvin is a splendid
translator, but in a rush he has a right to
get help.
The help is not what it should
be, and we have a right to see that it should
be.
The amendment of Hon. Mr. Turriff was
agreed to.
CIVIL SERVICE SUPERANNUATION
BTLL
REPORT OF COMMITTE -AMENDMENT
DECLARED OUT OF ORDER

The Senate proceeded to consider the
amendments made by the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce to Bill 231, an Act
to amend the Civil Service Superannuation
Act, 1924.
Hon. F. B. BLACK: Honourable gentlemen,
when the Civil Service Superannuation Bill,
1924, came before this House, certain changes
were made in it. IL was thought that a
certain group of civil service employees who
would be able to derive benefit from the Act,
but who were very mueh in arrears in their
pyments, or had not contributed at all, to
the Superannuation Fund, should pay the
arrears. and should puy also interest on the
arrears at the rate of 4 per cent annually uîntil
they were fully paid up.
Now, as Chairman of the Committee on
Banking and Commerce I have been asked.
and I desire. to call vour attention to the
fact that by the acceptance of the amendment
now proposed we accept the Bill as it came
to us in 1924. That means, according to the
information that was placed before the Committee by the Finance Department, that there
will be refunded to those w-ho have already
made payments of arrears, something, but
not very much. over half a million dollars.
We tried to ascertain how much expense it
might mean to the country in addition to this
half million. The Finance Department said
thrat they were unable to give us that information at the present time, and could not give
it to us for some months at least; but as
nearly as I icould ascertain it myself, the
additional expenditure will be some fewç
millions of dollars.
That is the explanation, which. as Chairman
of the Banking and Commerce Committee, I
desired to make.
Hon. b. W. LAIRD: Honourable gentlemen, one of the clauses of this report of the
Committee will impose upon the publie
Treasury a very large expenditure of money.
When announcement was made of the amrend-

APRIL 13, 1927
ment approved by the Banking and Commerce
Committee the Minister of Finance did net
receive it very graciously. He stated that he
would not accept this amendment until he
had assurance of the probable expenditure
which was made necessary by it
Under these circumstances, and in view of
the fact that the proposed amendment would
impose upon the country an expenditure of
money which, according to the Superintendent
of Insurance, the departmental official in
charge of the Bill, would be a very large
amount, a question has arisen in my mind
as to the competence cf this House to amend
a Money Bill along the line of imposing a
tax upon the country. The idea occurred to
me to inquire on this point at the time the
Bill was before the Committee, but it escaped
my mind. Now that we are about to send
this Bill te the other House, I think that we
should have a ruling on the part of the
Speaker as te whether or not this House is
competent to amend a Money Bill in such a
way as to increase the taxation.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: It was upon my
motion that the Committee struck out of the
Bill the provision for the payment of 4 per
cent interest on the instalments in arrears.
The matter is a complicated one. I do net
know that it was explained to the Committee
as clearly as it should have been. That may
be the reason why my honourable friend from
Sackville (Hon. Mr. Black) and my honourable friend from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird)
have the impressions whiich they have just
stated to the House, and which I think are
in both cases entirely erroneous. The departmental official affirmed, after going into the
matter, that the striking out of the provision
with respect to the 4 per cent interest is net
going to entail any charge on the public
treasury.
Hon. Mr. BLAiCK: I want to correct the
I reported to this
honourable gentleman.
House the exact statement made to the Committee by Mir. Finlayson, that it will cost the
people of this country at least half a million
dollars for the refund of the sum already paid
in. That is his statement, and I submit it is
absolutely correct.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: There was a statement of thaît kind, which Mr. Finlayson afterwards corrected.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: No, no.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: If I may be allowed
Mr.
te go on I will make my statement.
Finlayson, when pressed, admitted that the
fund required te cover this superannuation

had been determined on an actuarial basis,
that no account was taken at the time of any
interest that might be paid upon arrears
and that the Superannuation Act could be
carried out on thé basis intended without there
being added anything at all as a public charge.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: Will the hon'ourable
gentleman say ·that Mr. Finlayson said in the
Committee of which I am Chairman that
there would not be a charge of half a million
dollars, and a few dollars over that?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, I do net say
that.
Hon. Mr. BLACK: I do net want my word
I am right.
questioned.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I admit that Mr
Finlayson did say at one time that it would
entail an expenditure of about $500,000.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is to say,
the reimbursement.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Exactly, if this
interest were net insisted upon.
Hon. MT. BLACK: That is all I want.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Then we are
agreed. Then he went on to say that when
the Bill was presented to Parliament in 1924
it was not thought for one moment that any
interest of that kind should be collected; for
the Superannuation Fund had been calculated
on an actuarial basis, not including at all any
sum for interest to be paid by anybody. That
is why I say that if we carry out the Act as
it was adopted by the Commons in 1924 we are
not imposing any charge whatever on the
public.
It is well known, and is within the recellection of everybody, that it was the Senate
that in 1924 inserted in the Bill the provision
requiring the refunding of 4 per cent interest
on the part of those who were in arrears. My
honourable friend from Welland (Hon. Mr.
Robertson), I think, is the one who proposed
the clauses in Committee. I think I am correct in that statement. When the Bill came
before us recently, some of us-in particular
my honourable friend whom I have just men.
tioned-thought that that was wrong, and he
and others were quite willing that we should
not require the 4 per cent interest. So we
amended the Bill accordingly. In other words,
we did exactly what the Commons itself had
done in 1924, and what Mr. Finlayson told
us was the basis upon which this Bill was
By
founded and was expected to operate.
striking out that clause we are not imposing
any burden on the public-and, after all, that
is the important point.

412

SENATE

May I cite sonne of the discussion in the
other flouse? I might quote things that were
said in 1924, but that would take too long; I
wvill content myseif with just one or two references. The principle underiying the Superanouittien Acf of 1924 is that of equal contributions by the Goverument and the civil
servants. At thc meeting of the Banking and
Commerce Committee on Friday 'Mr. Fin'layson, when he 'vas asked regarding the 4 per
cent inferest charge, admitted that if was not
necessary for the purposes of the fund.
Thc flouse of Commons, according
f0
flansard of July 3, 19,24, page 3977, put itself
on record in this way:

APRL 13, 1927
He was in charge of this Bill. The Minister,
of Trade and Commerce had charge of the
Bill during the present Session.
May I now give the information which was
furnished to me by a high official in the
Finance Department who has made a special
study of this question? This memorandum
was handed to me so that I might read it to
the House in order to give the information it
contains:
According to Publie Accounts 1925-26, there

was a balance in the Fund, March 3lst, 1926,
of $10,833,272.15.
When the benefits were arranged in the provisions of the Act of 1924, it was considered
that the cost would be fifty-fifty; the Service
contributing half and the Government half.
To the end of March 1926, the Service with
approximately 14,000 contributors, had paid in
to the fund, $10,230,927.33. Interest at 4 per
cent, amounting to $315,157.47 had been added.

The Government had contributed $282,996.58.
As the number of contributors has increased

during the past year. to approximately 18,000,
the fund bas increased accordingly and at the
lst of January, 1927, amounted to $12.811,446.
It is pointed out that the interest alone on
the balance to the credit of the Fund each year
is an appreciable amount interest at four per

cent on thirteen millions being more than half

a million dollars, and this would more than
equalize the refund requested, which was
stated before the Banking and Commerce Committee by the Superintndent of Insurance, to
be approximately half a million.
I draw special attention to those words
I have just read.
It is estimated that whereas the present num-

amendber of contributors is some 18,000, if the number
ment carries it is expected that this

will be increased to 25,000. It is further
estimated that the total salary of the 25,000 contributors will approximate $40,000,000. Five
per cent of this amount would be $2,000,000 a
year, i.e., the current contribution from the
Service. This added to the interest brings the
total annual increment from the Service, on the
most conservative estimate, to two and a half
million dollars.

If the Government contributes an amount
equal to the five per cent contribution from
the Service, quite irrespective of the four per
cent interest on arrears, the annual income of

the Fund must be estimated at approximately
four and a half million dollars.
If ten per cent of the contributors which
is a high estimate-each year enjoy the benefits
of Superannuation either as retiring allowances,
withdrawal allowances, or dependents' allowances, at an average of $1,000 a year-also a
high estimate-this would total only two and
a half millions, which would appear to assure
the solvency of the fund, inasmuch as the
minimum revenue of the fund is estimated at
four and a half million.
Information cannot easily be obtained as to
the actuarial basis of the scheme, but when the
Act was framed the Superintendent of Insurance did nlot provide for four per cent interest
on arrears of contributions, and assuming his computations to be approximately right,
it follows that the removal of this interest will
not involve further outlay by the Government

on the fifty-fifty basis as originally contemplated.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, it is not Mr.
Finlayson.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Not the Insurance Department?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not know
whether it is Insurance or Finance; it is from
one of those Departments, but I cannot tell
which.
I do not think I need labour this any
further. I think one thing is quite clear from
these figures, that the Government at no time
intended that there should be any interest
insisted upon from those who were in arrears.
It has also been established that in many
instances this question of interest has prevented men from coming under the Act. The
figures given to me showed that between 7,000
and 8,000 people, on account of the large
amount they would have to pay by way of
interest, were prevented from taking advantage
of the Act. The honourable gentlemen of
the Committee will remember that I gave a
very typical case of an employee in the Department of Indian Affairs, Mr. Emile Jean,
who would have had to pay by way of interest a sum larger than the total of his arrears-some $1,155.74 of interest, while his arrears amounted to $1,101.78, I think. In this
way the amendment has unquestionably prevented thousands of civil servants from having
the benefit of the Superannuation Act. There
is a double disadvantage to that; it is a disadvantage to the fund itself, inasmuch as the
larger the number of contributors the more
readily will the half to be provided by the
civil servants be raised.
I think that in the interest of the civil servants themselves. and also the proper operation of the Act and its success. we should
strike out the provision requiring the payment of 4 per cent interest, whieh was inserted in this House under misapprehension
of the facts and the results to be attained.
I think we ought to surrender ourselves to the
evidence, and do what apparently is the proper thing under these circumstances, and in
that way be completely in accord with the
other House.

414

SENATE

The clause which was adopted in the Committee was clause 11, but since then Mr.
Finlayson and the Department of Justice have
gone over these clauses and have suggested
that for the sake of clarity, and perhaps precision, there should be three new paragraphs
substituted for the three paragraphs of section
11. One advantage is that in the new draft
the time at which operation begins, as between arrears and fixed amount, is related
back to the time of election. Apart from
that, I do not find that the new section differs
materially from the old one. There was a
time fixed within which this election should
be made. That time has passed, and because
of the changes we are now making in the
Act it is thought desirable to extend it to
the 31st of December next. The last subsection is merely for the purpose of giving
an opportunity to those who did not come
in within the period fixed.
Honourable gentleHon. Mr. BLACK:
men, I simply wanted to make the renark
that the honourable member fron Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Belcourt), having admitted that
my statement was absolutely correct, is apparently contradicting himself.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

No, no.

Hon Mr. BLACK: And he apparently has
taken my remarks as to the pronouncement
in the Comnittee as being in oppositior to
the amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

No.

Hon. Mr. BLACK: He is entirely wrong
in that. J am not opposing the anendnent,
I am merly making a plain statement of
fact.

money Bills or increasing the charge on the
public revenue.
The Act refers nerely to
the public revenue. This, I submit it may
be a very fine distinction, and I may not be
able to convince my honourable friendHon. Mr. LAIRD: It is His Honcur the
Speaker's ruling on the question that I want.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am speaking on
the question. I say this is nat subject to the
conditions prescribed by the Act, because
this money is not going to come out of the
public revenue.
This is a schemge between
the Government and the Civil Servants, by
which contributions on a fifty-fifty basis are
set aside for the purpose of creating a fund.
Hon. Mr. LAIRD: What did the Superintendent of Insurance mean when he said it
was going to cost the country over half a
million dollars?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I am not disputing
that. I am trying to point out ncw that this
does not come out of the public revenue. It
is independent and outside of that; it is to
provide a superannuation fund to which the
Crown contributes one-half, and the service
the other half. I do not think (hat, strictly
speaking, it comes under the provision upon
which my honourable friend bases his objection.
Hon. Mr. TANNER: May I refer to the
point raised by the honourable gentleman
from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird)?
I nerely
want to express the opinion that the matter
of the rights of this Chamber bas been
settled. I need not recall the investigation
made by a special Committee, and the Report
of that Committee, on the question of the
power of this Chamber to amend or aiter a
money Bill. That Report was unanimously
adopted by this House, and is of record.
Honourable members will recall that the subject came up later, in connection with a Bill
relating ta the indemnity question, and that
the House, as I understand it, reiterated the
sarne principle, namely, that under the British North America Act the Senate bas power
to deal with money Bills, but not the power
to introduce them.

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: I would not like it to
be inferred from what the honourable gentleman has just said that there is any opposition to this Bill on its merits. I do not
desire to discuss the merits of the Bill at
all.
I make the statement here an.d now,
that the official designated by the Department which is in charge of the Bill came
before the Committee, and, in answer to
questions put by himself, made the statemnent
that this was going to impose upon the treasuny an expenditure of at least half a million
dollars-bhow much more he was not prepared
ta say at the time, and would not be in a
position to say for probably eighteen months.
Under these circumstances, I simply ask for
a ruling as to the competence of this House
to amend such a Bill.

Hon. Mr. TANNER:
The honourable
Leader of the Opposition says it cannot he
increased. He may be right. I amn merely
stating my impression of the Report.

Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I do not think this
comes within the section of the Act under
which the Senate is precluded from initiating

Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON: Inasmuch as the
honourable gentleman from Ottawa (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) mentioned my name in connection

Hon. W. B. ROSS:

The amount cannot

ÂPRL 13, 1927
with the arnendrnent made to the Superannuation Bill a couple of years ago, JI wish
t0 say a word. I arn in favour of the amendment now proposed, and the adoption of
the Report, for the reason that' zince we
made that amendment a couple cf years ago
1 have found out two tlhings: first, that it was
flot the intention of the Finance Departrnent
to charge 4 per cent interest, and that had
flot been taken into caleculation when the
actuarial estimate was made; and, second,
that in many cases civil servants who for
years made payments under the Superannuatien Act withdrew or dropped what they
paid in, without getting any interest on their
money for the tirne it was in the hands of
the State. If that be so, and the Government
intended net te charge this 4 per cent interest,
it cannot be said that the adoption of this
proposai is increasing taxation. Furthermore,
I have talked with a number of civil servants,
some of whom arc heads of departments, or
of important branches, and they have assured
me that there are many old and faithful civil
servants who are unabie te take advantage cf
the Superannuation Act because they are required to pay the double penalty cf this 4
per cent over a long terra cf years. I have
been assurcd by some civil servants that there
would he no objection on the part cf the
others te this concession. I feel that there
is ne question as to the power cf this House
te deal with the subjeet now before us, because it is net increasing taxation and is net
incrcasing the cost over and ahove what the
Gevernment itscîf proposed when the Bill
was introduced into this House two years
a.go. This is simply correcting what I now
think was a miistake made in this Heuse two
years ago when we amended the Act.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: I desire te know, first,
whcther this Bill when introduced into the
Relise of Gemmons was authorized by message of the Governor General, and second,
whcther the moneys that have been paid in
by way cf interest forma part cf the Conselidated Revenue, or whether they were kepý
separate.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: As te the first
question, I do net know. I assume, however,
[bat a Bill cf.this kind was net subrnitted te
the Comnrons without the usual authority cf
a resolution passed by the Commons. As te
the second question, I de net know hew the
bocks have been kept, or whether the intereet
bas been kept separate frem the principal
or not. 'In any event, I do net think it would
he very difficuit te segregate the interest from

415

the principal. I should think we could easily
ascertain what was paid in as principal ani
what was paid in as interest. In fact, that
will have te be donc in order -te give ýcredit.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: If it forrns part of the
Consolidated Repenue, I do net think that
this House would he competent te take the
meney eut, except under a Bill authorized hy
the Governor in Council.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN:
My recolle ction
cf what happened at the meeting cf the iCommittee the other afternoon is this. Mr. Finlayson told us that there had been paid in on
account cf the 4 per cent, something over
hall a million dollars, which weuld have te
be returned te the people whe paid it; and
that te that extent the amount in the fond
would ha reduced, and would have te ho
made up from the public treasury.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I have before me
an extract from the Public Acceunts cf 192526, whieh reads as follows:
Statement of Superannuation Fond No. 5, for
year cnded 3lst March, 1926.
I wculd take that as an evidence cf earmarking. Evidently this rnoney is in a
special fund.
Hon. Mr. LAIR.D:
Finlayson said.

That is net wbat Mr.

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANIYURAND:
gentlemen, I have in my hands a statement
frorn the acceuntant cf the Department, Mr.
Macfarlane, which. reads as folews:
There are 5,434 contributors who are paying
with respect to past non-contrihutory service.
In ail these cases interest is included in the
payments. In ascertaining the monthly instalments payable with respect te past non-contrihutory service the principal cf the deficiency
and interest thereon are lurnped tegether. It
is therefore impossible, without perfýorrning a
mathemnatical, calculation in each individual
case, te, arrive with accuracy at the amount
paid in respect cf interest to date. The ameunt
probably will be somewhere in the neighbourhood of $550,000.
This is the ameunt which has9 been spoken
cf, and which is cevered by the amendment
hefore us, which directs the reimbursernent
of those who have cerne in and paid interest,
in order te establish an equilihriuin between
them. and others who are yet te corne in,
and who will net have te pay interest. Now,
my honeurable friend fram Ottawa says that
the ameunt will go te a special fund.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

I assume that.

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I may say that
in the Cornittee Mr. Finlayson was simply
asked one or two questions, which he

SENATE

416

answered. He had put his views on this point
in writing for the Minister of Finance. I
will read what he says. It will enlighten the
House:
I have been frequently asked to recommend
its repeal,That is referring to the 4 per cent
provision.
-but have declined to do so on the ground that
until all transfers to the fund are effected and
a valuation of the fund made I am not in a
position to say that the cost to the Government
will not bo in excess of 50 per cent of the
total cost. It is impossible to say what the
effect of the repeal of the provision will be. I
cannot tell, nor can any person tell, how much
money will be lost to theeGovernment, because
no person can tell how many men will transfer
because of its repeal who would not have otherwise transferred.
He states that whatever we take from the
fund will have to be made up from the
Treasury.
Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER: Will the honourable gentleman tell me about how many have
come in since the 4 per cent interest requirement was introduced?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:

About 18,000.

Hon. Mr. SCHAFFNER.: And about how
many will come in if this amendment is
made?

Hon. Mr. BFLCOURT:
that if it carries it will bring in 7,000 or 8,000
more.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Will those who came
in first and paid their money be in the same
position as those who corne in now?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes, I think that
is the effect of the amendment.
Hon. Mr. McMEANS: Is it the intention
that those who paid in their money should
get a rebate of 4 per cent of what they paid
in?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: No, no. The whole
Civil Service have put themselves on record.
There is no objection, on the part of the
18,000 who have come in. that this favour be
granted to those who may come in.
Hon. Mr. BELAND: If they agree, they
will submit no claim for a refund.
They are quite
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT:
willing that the fund should be reduced by
the amount necessary ta pay the 4 per cent.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: The honourable
gentleman from Regina (Hon. Mr. Laird) has
asked whether, this being a money Bill, the
Senate can deal with it. As has been stated
Ho.

MIr. DANDURAND.

by an honourable gentleman, the Senate decided that question in May of 1918, when it
adopted a Report dealing with the whole
question of the rules of the Senate in regard
ta money Bills. Upon reading these amendments, as proposed, it does seem ta me that
if we adopt them we shall be creating a charge
which will have ta be borne by the Government, and which therefore will be a charge
on the revenue. I read from page 418 of the
13th edition of May, where, in dealing with
this question, ho says:
On consideration of a Bill on report, no
clause or amendment may be proposed which
creates a charge upon the public revenue, or
upon rates or local burthens upon the people,
or wbich increases taxation, but the Bill may
be recommitted in respect of any such proposed
clause or amendment.
This is dealing with the action of the Flouse
of Commons when they have before them a
Bill which has been amended in Committee,
and the charge has not been sanctioned by
the Government.
In respect of a charge upon rates or local
burthens, a bill may be recommitted and considered in Committee forthwith: but in the
case of a clause or amendment which creates
a charge upon the public revenue, this course
cannot be taken unless previously such charge
has been recommended by the Crown, and
sanctioned by a resolution of a Conunittee of
the whole House, which bas been agreed to by
the House upon report.
It seems to me that that is ta some extent
the position that we are in. There is no doubt
that the Senate bas a right to amend a
Money Bill, but it bas no right ta increase
the charge upon the public. Whether it would
be advisable in the interest of the Senate that
it should send this Bill back with a recomiendation that these changes be made by the
House of Commons is a matter for the Senate to consider. I do not consider that the
Senate should pass this report and commit the
country to a change of this kind.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: The honourable
the Speaker decides that the point of order is
well taken?
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Unfortunately,
the point of order was put ta me on the ground
that this was a Money Bill and therefore we
could not deal with it. That point of order,
I think, was not well taken, because the Senate has decided, long ago, that it can amend
Money Bills. The difficulty is that in what
we are doing we increase the charge on the
country, and I have to rule on that point.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: That is the point
raised. The question was whether that was
in order or not.

APRIL 13, 1927

Hon. Mr. LAIRD: Bonourable gentlemen,
that wus the position that I took. I made
that the proposed
the direct statement
amendment imposed a tax, an extra cbarge
on the Treasury. I asked your ruling, Mr.
Speaker, as to wbether it was in order or not.

Hon. Mr. BELAND: That is correct.
honourable gentleman raised the point.

The Hon. the SPEAKER: On that particular point I would have to-rule that it is
not in order.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
ment is nut in order?

That tbe arnend-

Tbe Bon. tbe SPEAKER: In su far as it
creates a charge.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: 1 do flot risc to
discuss the decision of the bonourable the
Speaker, only I tbink I might point out, with
the leave of the Senate and witb bis Bonour's
leave. that Mr. Finlayson. in the statement
whicb bas just been read by the bonourable
leader of tbe Goveromient, does not say that
tbe amendrnent will increase the public
burden: be says it may.
Bon. Mr. LAIRD: I took, it to mean tbat
be did say s0.
No; be says it
lion. Mr. BELCOURT:
niay. Be cannot tell tu wbýat extent. He
does not say it does.
Hon. Mr. McLENNAN: Dues be not quote
there that it wilh be about, $550000?

Bon. W. B. BOSS: I was going tu say,
bonourabie gentlemen, that I amn sorry that
tbis Bill should miscarry, because from the
information that I bave had I think that it
would work, out well; that is to say, it would
let in a class of persons, to the number of
seven or eigbt thousand, who cannot afford to
corne in now, but would as a matter of fact,
wbet.her yuu liked it or not, in five, ten, or
fifteen years from now, be the subject of new
legislation, wbich would mean that in tbe long
run you would escape none of tbe burden.
Now this question bas been raised. I bad
thought of it, but did not raise lt-I said
nothing about it-because I assumed, for sorne
reason or another, that tbe Goveroment were
aware of tbe fact tbat tbe Senate intended
to make the proposed amendment. But 1
agree with tbe ruling of Bis Honour the
Speaker. It all faIls under section 53 of the
British North America Act:
Bills for appropriating any part of the public
revenue, or for imposing any tax or impost,
shaîl originate in the Bouse of Commons.
32655--27

4ý17

The reason I rpad this is to suggest that
if the bouse of Commons would send us a
message to say that they consent that we
sbould deal with it, that would remove the
wbole difficulty.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Section, 54 says:
It shall fot be lawful for the House of
CommunS to adopt or pass any vote, resolution.
address or Bill for the appropriation of any
part of the publie revenue or of any tax or
iînpost, to any purpose that bas not been first
recoïnmended to that Bouse by message of the
Governor General in the Session in which sucb
vote, resolution, address or Bill is proposed.
Tbey would get the
Bon. Mr. ROSS:
consent of the Crown.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: 0f course, the powers
of the Senate would flot, extend beyond those
of the Bouse of Commons.
Hon. Mr. ROSS: This thing bas been done
The Communs got the
mn other colonies.
consent of the Crown, and then they sent a
message to the Senate or the Uppeïr Bouse,
saying that they migbt proceed to deal with
the matter.
Bon. Mr. BEIQUE: For rny part I think it
is important that we should be careful always
to remain within the unanirnous decision of
the Senate on these questions.
.Hon. Mr. ROSS:
I think that is a wise
observation.
Hon. Mr. BEIQUE: Otherwise we sball flot
know where we stand. I tbink the ruling of
the Chair is quite in accord with the decision
of the Bouse.
Bon. Mr. BELCOURT: Will by bonourable friend (Hon. W. B. Boss) move that a
message be sent to the other Bouse, requesting the other Bouse to obtain the additional
power, if necessary? Tbere is a clear invitation to do so. in the speech of Mr. Malcolm,
wbo suggested tbat tbose wbo bave influence
in t.his Bouse might exert that influence bere
in order to get it dunýe. Onýe 18 naturally
inclined to believe tbat if a request were
made to the otber Bouse to get power to deal
with this, it could be put througb probably
this Session.
Bon. Mr. BOSS: I tbink tbe bonourable
gentleman who is in cbarge of the Bill would
be tbe man to do that. Ail I cao say is that,
s0 far as I know the facts, if a message of
that kiind came to us, 1 would be prepared
to vote for tbis Bill, because I am in
syrnpathy with it.

CIVIL SERVICE SUPE.RANNUATION
BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the third
reading of Bill 231, an Act to amend the
Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1924.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I bring
to the Senate information which we had in
1924, when the Superannuation Act was
passed, but which, I think, bas since escaped
our memory. We sometimes hear representations that gradually grow in our minds until
we believe that an injustice bas been or is
being done to a certain class of people. When
such claims reach us we are responsive to
them and are actuated by a desire to right
the injustice. In order that honourable gentlemen of the Senate may understand the
provisions of the Superannuation Act, I desire, before moving the third reading of the
Bill, to read a statement which Il think will
clarify the situation and show that not only
bas no injustice been done, but we have even
gone a certain distance towards paternalism.
We did that with our eyes open, and I do
net regret it. I think that when honourable
gentlemen have heard this statement they will
realize that there is no cause for grievance in
32655-24j

419

what Parliament bas donc in connection with
the Superannuation Act.
This memorandum has been addressed by
Mr. Finlayson to the Minister of Finance
since the discussion of yesterday afternoon:
The amendment made to this Bill by the
Banking and Commerce Committee of the Senate
with reference to the four per cent interest
included in contributions for past service has
been declared by the Honourable the Speaker
of that Chamber to be out of order, and the
question has been raised as to what the effect
will be if the Bill passes without that amendment.
The Civil Service Superannuation Act, 1924,
was designed primarily for persons appointed
to permanent positions in the Service after that
date. Such persons are required to contribute
5 per cent of their salaries and their maximum
allowance is reached after 35 years' service, 2
per cent per year, or 70 per cent in all, of the
average final salary being allowed. Widows'
allowances equal to one-half the contributors'
allowances are also provided for.
At the same time, provision was made for
persons already in the Service transferring to
the new fund. These persons were those,
(a) Subject to the Retirement Act, under
which the rate of contribution was 5 per cent;
or
(b) Contributing, or having contributed to
Superannuation Funds Nos. 1 or 2, the rate of
contribution being 2 per cent or 3ý per cent;
or
(c) Contributing to no fund. This class includes the so-called "permanent temporaries."
Honourable gentlemen who are familiar with
the traditions of the various departments know
thait some departments, for instance, the Department of Public Works, are practically
manned by "permanent temporaries."
The Act provides that persons in class (a)
may transfer with right to full scale allowances.
Persons in this class have paid the 5 per
cent.

Persons in class (b) may transfer with right
to full scale allowances for themselves, but the
widows' allowance is on half scale, unless the
difference between the 2 per cent or 3J per
cent and the 5 per cent in respect of past
service is made good with interest at 4 per cent
simple interest.
Persons in class (c)That is to say, persons who have contributed
to no fund whatsoever-may transfer, but all allowances are on half
scale unless the 5 per cent in respect of past
service is made good with 4 per cent simple
interest.
It will be seen from the foregoing that persons
in all the above classes are permitted to transfer
to the new scheme whether contributions are
made for past service or not. Future service
will in such case count in full, but past service
will count as above indicated unless contributions therefor are made at the rate of 5 per
cent.
For example, a person in class (c) who transfers without contributing anything for past
service, will rank on retirement for an allowance of 1 per cent for each year of service.

Speaker's Chair or afterwards. He had expressed dissent from a Bill, but it passed the
three readings. I do not remember exactly
the career of the Bill-whether it had been
disputed in Committee or in the House, but
he made up his mind only at the very moment when, after the third reading had
passed the final suppaementary question was
put, "Shall that Bill pass?" He rose from his
seat and made such an onslaught on the Bil
that a vote was taken, and the decision was
that the Bill should not pass. That is the
only precedent that I remember. That precedent was afterwards cited in the House; and
it would bear on the present stage of procedure.
My honourable friend can divide the House
on the question put by the honourable the
Speaker.
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: I can do better
than that. I am strictly within the rule mentioned by Bourinot at page 532:
Motion, that the Bill do pass.-The next
question put by the Speaker is: "That this Bill
do pass, and that the title be", etc.
This motion generally passes nem. con. immediately after the third reading, though it is
quite regular to defer the final passage until
a future day. or to move that the further consideration of the Bill be postponed; or to
propose other amendments against the principle
of the measure with the view of preventing its
passage.
The rule seems to be quite clear.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That supports
the procedure of Senator Miller. 'He stopped
the Bill as it was about to leave the hand of
the Speaker, and defeated it on a vote. My
honourable friend says, "I can move thait it
do not pass, but be further amended, or be
referred back to Committee."
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. The rule
clear, it seems to me.

is

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: That is not a
ruling; that is a statement from Bourinot. It
is a question of practice.
Some Hon. SENATORS: Carried.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Does the honourable member insist on his amendment?
Hon. Mr. BELCOURT: Yes. 'My amendment is to insert the following words as subsection 2 of section 1:
(2) Any contributor who, at the time of his
election to become a contributor under the
provisions of sections sixteen, seventeen, twenty
and twenty-two of this Act, did not elect to

421

pay contributions in respect of past periods of
service, may, at his option, on or before the
thirty-first day of December one thousand nine
hundred and twenty-seven, amend the terms
of his election by electing to pay contributions
in respect of such service.
I beg to move that as an amendment.
The Hon. the SPEAKER: Honourable
gentlemen, the question before the House is
that this Bill do now pass; to which Hon.
Senator Belcourt moves in amendement that
the Bill do not now pass, but that it be
further amended by inserting in section 1, as
subsection 2, the amendment which he has
read. The question is on the amendment.
Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I am not disposed to accept the
principle that an amendment may be introduced at this stage, though that may have been
a procedure accepted and practised in a distant
past. I have now been 29 years in the Senate
and I take it for granted that our tradition,
at all events, is that all such propositions or
amendments must be made on the motion for
the third reading, the last stage, notwithstanding that precedent of the final question"Shall this Bill pass?"-having been once
answered by a negative vote. I make that
reservation so that we may not-at all events,
speaking for myself, I would not-be bdund
by the motion that is now made by my
honourable friend.
On the merits I intend to vote against that
amendment, considering the argument made in
the memorandum which I have read as to the
necessity of closing as early as we can the
period of election. We have already granted
delays, and it seems to me that the interval
from the present time to Judy next will be
sufficient to allow the parties to think the
matter over. They are not losing anything
by joining in, but are gaining something.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Honourable gentlemen, I would like to understand just the position. If I heard aright what
was read by my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Belcourt) and colleague as to the practice in
the Senate, an amendment can be moved at
this stage only if its purpose is to defeat the
principle of the Bill. I do not think my ears
deceived me in that. Is my honourable friend
willing to take the position that he is now
moving an amendment for the purpose of
defeating the principle of the Bill? If so, I
can hardly join with him in voting for his
amendment.
Hon. Mr. BELOOURT: Though I have not
had occasion to see it applied in practice, I
think the wording of the passage I have quoted
from this authority does not justify the con-

clusion that a motion such as I am now
making can be proposed onily with a view to
dissenting from the principle of the Bill. It

DIAMOND JUBILEE 0F
CONFEDERATION
RESOLUTION

Honourable
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
gentlemen, I have in my hand a resolution
adopted unanimously
which has just heem
in the House of Commons on the motion of
the right honourable the Prime Minister,
seconded by the leader of his Mai esty's loyal
Opposition. The leader of the Progressive
party joined also, in order to make the resolution absolutely unanimýous.
I think it is proper that this resolution
should be recordcd as the action of hoth
branches of Parliament, as it is an officiai
statement and an address to, the people of
Canada. I have askcd my honourable friend,
the leader of the Conservative party in this
Chamber (Hon. W. B. Ross), te second this
resolution. I do not style him tihe leader
of His Majesty's loyal Opposition, because
by his whole demeanour in tii Chamber
be bas shown that hie was not a leader of an
opposition in this House in the same sense
as the opposition leader in the other flouse.
I therefore move, seconded by Hon. W. B.
Ross:
Resolved. that as Canada is approaching
the Sixtieth Annivcrsary of lier founding as a
Dominion. the Parliament of Canada place on
record its deep appreciation of the achievements of the Fathers of Confederation. and
with united voire express its f ajtl and cunfidence in the future of thiA our country, and
its development as a miember of the British
Commonwealth of Nations, owing allegiance to
His -Majesty the King.
It is the earnest wish of Parliament that the
Diamond Jubilee Celebration, for which plans
are now being rapidly matured, shal romnmnemorate appropriately and enthusiastically
the accomplishinent of Confederation and the
subsequent pregress of the Dominion. Wr trust
that this commemoration will ]end added inspiration to the patriotic ferveur of our people,
and afford a clearer vision of our aspirations
and ideals, to the end that from sea to sea
there may be developed a robust Canadian
spirit, and in ail things Canadian a profounder national umity.
The motion was agreed to.

APRIL 14, 1927
Hlon. IMr. DANDURAND: Yes, but it allows a renewed application if new evidence is
found.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
That is reasonable, I think, to a very large
extent. We all know the history of pension
legislation in the United States. Long after
the war was over, and when all the guns had
rusted into powder, new applications were
stial coming in and enlargements being made.
Sixty years after the war the pension bill of
the United States was larger than it had been
at any preceding time.
If this Bill applies only to the hearing of
new evidence, there is ground for it. There
are various reasons why evidence sometimes
But we âhould guard
cannot be obtained.
very closely--and I believe our military men
are in unison on this-against enlarging the
scope of applications for pension.
Hon. Mr. GRI!ESBACH: This Bill has two
'aspects. One is, to all intents and purposes,
the right of the Board of Appeal to hear a new
appeal; the other is the extension of time.
To deal with the first. The law governing
the Board of Appeal was that the decision of
the Board, when given, should be final, and
the appeal was not afterwards submitted to
But
the Board of Pension Commissioners.
while the decision of the Board of Appeal was
final, there was no finality at all in the aplication to the Board of Pension Commissioners. As a consequence, this situation
might result: a man might apply for a pension,

submit his evidence, get an adverse decision,
be dissatisfied, and appeali to the Appeal
Board, who might confirm the decision. So
far as the Appeal Board was concerned, that
man was done; but so far as the Board of
Pension Commissioners was concerned, he was
not. He might get fresh evidence and submit it to the Board of Pension Commissioners,
and it was their duty to hear it. They might
then say, "This new evidence convinces us
that this man should have a pension," but the
Board of Appeal had previously ruled that he

is designed to cover that feature.
The extension of time is another matter.
Under the Pension Act a man who was hospitalized for disability while in the service
Las a claim, continuing throughout his lifetime, to a pension with respect to that particular disability. Let that be clear. If he
was hospitalized for a lung condition-"T.B.,"
for instance-so long as he lives that hospitalization constitutes a continuing application which is not governed by any statute
of limitation. But with respect to any dis-

ability which a man might develop in aiter

ago to provide that the application must be

think, expired in September of last year, and
this amendment extends it for two years. No
new grounds or new rights are created; the
time is extended, that is all.
The right
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
honourable gentleman (Right Hon. Sir George
E. Foster) has spoken of the experience of the
United States in the matter of pensions. I
have heard the same warning uttered in this
Chamber within the last few years. I may
say that I attended the meetings of the Senate
Committee when the amendments to the Act
came under review, and I want to bear
testimony to the spirit of loyalty and fair
play shown by the gallant soldiers that we
have with us in this Chamber, in approaching
the matter. They were always desirous of
doing the right thing by the soldier, but
stopped at the point beyond which they
thought an undue advantage would be given.
I may be for only a short space of time in
this Chamber myself, but I trust that, should
any pressure come from the House of Commons-for one must not forget that if there
is any pressure it will come from the members
of that flouse, who have to look for popular
support-that in the general interest of
Canada we may rely upon the judgment of
the soldiers who so gallantly led to battile the
very men who may be appealing for a revision
of the pension law.
Right Hon. Sir GEORGE E. FOSTER:
Not only was there an extension of grounds
in the United States, but there grew up in the
Senate, if not in the representative branc of
Congress itself, what was really a system of
log-rolling, by which individual pension bills
were introduced, and under which one Senator
would say to another: "You support my bill
and I will support yours." This was acknowledged everywhere in the United States to
have become a very gross scandal. I am
satisfied that we are quite safe from that
situation in this assembly.
Hon. Mr. GRIESBACH: May I just touch
upon that? Entirely apart from the natural
fondness of the people of the United States
for politics, the scandal which grew up there
was largely if not wholly, attributable to
the fact that their whole scheme of enlistment
and records was haphazard, almost nonexistent.
The result was that after the war there were
no documents at all concerning a man, and he

426

SENATE

was permitted to introduce the evidence of
comrades that he had been wounded or hurt
in a certain way, and this created the basis
of agitation.
I have said before, and I take pleasure in
saying it again, that the system of Canadian
records in the late war was the finest and best
system evolved by any country that took part
in the war. There was nothing to equal it.
It is difficult to know how we came by that
system. We followed the War Office to a
certain extent. Every document was made
out in triplicate, one copy being kept in
London, one in Rouen, and one sent to Canada.
Everything that happened a man-promotion,
appointment, punishment, absence without
leave-was shown. His medical papers showed
every bit of medical attention that he received.
After the war all those documents were
assembled, and five hundred tons of them were
returned to Ottawa, where they now are. They
are very badly housed; they are not in a
fire-proof building, and are apt to be destroyed
at any time. However, this system is complete,
and if you know a man named John Smith
who served in the war you can find the Smith
you are looking for. If you go down to where
the records are kept and say he had a red
head or a wart on his nose, or anything about
him that you can think of certain keys of a
machine will be touched and the card of that
John Smith will be produced, and all the information regarding him made available.
Consequently the country is secure against
the imposter who says he was injured, ill, or
sick on a certain day. If that is not the record
on his sheet, it is not truc. Of course, there
is the human element, and some mistakes have
been found; but they are so few as to be
negligible. The country is absolutely protected
against the situation that grew up in the
United States. It cannot exist here.
Just one other thing. If the private bill
for the relief of an individual appears. it
must bo stamped ont at once, and this House
must do it. We have laid it down in our
soldier legislation that Parliament can legislate only for the mass, and not for classes.
As far as possible this principle should be
followed, and Parliament should legislate foi
classes only when the individuals making up
those classes become sufficiently numerous to
be capable of identification.
We have
legislated for the tubercular classes and for
the neurotic class because such cases are
sufficiently numerous to be segregated and
described in an Act of Parliament. Beyond
that we should not be asked to go.
Hon. Mr. MACI)ONELL: I wish to add
a word to what the right honourable gentleHon.

Mr. GRIESBACH.

man from Ottawa (Right Hon. Sir George E.
Foster) has said regarding the possibility in
this country of a log-rolling system such as
existed in the United States. Shortly after
the war between the North and the South, the
pension bill of the United States was $34,000,000 a year. I thinik I am correct in that
figure. By reason of log-rolling that figure
was increased, until to-day it is something
like $129,000,000 a year that the United States
is paying in pensions for the war between
the North and the South.
While we in this Chamber are most anxious
to be just and in every way considerate
towards the soldiers who deserve pensions as
a result of the war, nevertheless we must
remember that it is our duty to watch the

APPROPRIATION BILL No. 6
FIRST READING

Bill 340, an Act for granting to His Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service of the financial year ending the 31st
March, 1928.-Hon. Mr. Dandurand.
SECOND READING

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND moved the second reading of the Bill.
He said: Honourable gentlemen, I shall not
enter into a discussion on the details of the
Supply Bill. We have all reccived the estimates as presented in the House of Commons; aIso the supplementaries. We are familiar with the contents of those Bills, and,
as the Senate bas never claimed the right to
amend a Supply Bill, I now move the second
reading.
Hon. W. B. ROSS:
Honourable gentlemen, since I have been in this House some
cause or another has always prevented anything like a full discussion of the estimates.
They have come to us in the last hours, sometimes in the last minutes of the Session. I
do not recall any occasion on which there has
been opportunity for a thorough discussion
of the financial condition of the country in
relation to the estimates for the current year.

APRIL 14, 1927
It is manifestly out of the question on this
occasion to attempt to discuss the whole of
the estimates or to deal with them in detail.
I do not know whether it would be possible
for us at another time to adopt some other
procedure. Perhaps in the early part of the
Session, when the Senate is not pressed with
work from the other House, it might be well
for us to take time to discuss in detail the
0f
financial condition of the country.
course, the money that is voted this year
will be spent before we meet again and that
will be the end of it; but we are not settling
the question of the financial condition of the
country, or the question whether the Government is working on proper financial principles or not.
I have always thought, since the time of
the Great War, when we incurred so heavy an
expenditure and so great a debt, that the
Government should proceed upon the principle that every possible step ought to be
taken to reduce expense; that they should
save every dollar that could be saved, with a
view to decreasing the taxation of the country,
which, I need not argue, is very high. Our
taxes take a large percentage of the earnings
of the people and undoubtedly increase the
cost of living. I think we ought to keep in
mind that we have a large national debt
and that, if possible, a substantial reduction
of that debt should be made every year. I
am not satisfied that the Government are saving money as they should. Anyone who looks
over the estimates that we are asked ta vote
cannot reasonably anticipate an early and
further reduction in taxation.
To enter into details would take a long
time, and I will not do so. I intend to pass
by the estimates simply with the statement
that I think we are entitled to demand of the
Government more economy than is practised,
in order that, as I have said, there may be a
decrease in taxation and in the cost of living.
There is one item in the estimates that I
think I ought to mention, because it strikes
me that it is not justified. You may have
justification for an item like the $1,600,000
that is voted for subsidies to the 'Maritime
Provinces. Those subsidies are the result of
an award, and they are allowed as a matter
of right; therefore I do not see how the Government, once it became involved in that
arbitration, could avoid making this expenditure. So I am not criticizing them on that
score. It is one of the large new expenditures,
but, as I say, I do not see how it couild be
avoided. But, coming to the expenditure of
$500,000, which is item number 467 in the supplementary estimates, for the Canadian Legation at Washington, I think thait is an expenditure that the Government might very

427

well have avoided. I do not mind saying
that J never believed in this Legation at
Washington. I think that we were getting
along very well when we were represented
there by the British Ambassador. The proposail to have a representative at Washington
originated, I believe, under the old Conservative Government. If instead of establishing a Legation the Government had appointed a Trade Commissioner at Washington, I believe we would be in a more comfortable and more secure position in our dealings with our neighbours to the south, and a
very substantial expenditure could' be saved.
For my part I cannot see any justification at
alil for this enormous expenditure, even for
an Ambassador at Washington. This Government were in no hurry to act in the matter; for two or three years they allowed it to
stand; and I was in hopes that they would
let it stand permanently. However, they seem
to have changed their minds, and they have
now appointed their Ambassador.
I doubt very much that the American Ambassador, when he comes here, although he
represents a much wealthier country than this,
will find himself supported by hundreds of
thousands of dollars from his own Government, for the maintenance of his office or
residence.
As I have stated, I do not intend to enter
into the details. It would take a long time,
and perhaps when the other House is waiting
for us it would be out of place for me to
take any longer.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: Is the other
House waiting for us?
Hon. Mr: DANDURAND: Yes, the other
House is waiting for a call from the right
honourable the Deputy Governor. Of course,
that does not preclude us from discussing the
Bill that is before us.
Hon. W. B. WILLOUGHBY: I desired to
say only a word on the subject to which my
honourable leader has particularly referred.
May I ask, in the first instance, what
provision is made for the salary and for
the secretarial help of the Minister at
Washington?
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: If it is not to
be found in the Supply BillHon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:.I do not find it.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND: I have not examined the items, but I think that has been
provided for. I think my honourable friend
will find the answer in the estimates that are
before us. If he does not, I will supply it
to him.

428

SENATE

Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY: I intend to say
only a few words. I did not know my honourable leader intended addressing himself to
the question of the Minister at Washington.
I have read the address of the first Minister
in the other House. A copy is not in front of
me at the moment, but perhaps it is not
necessary for my purpose. I think he mentioned that the representative of the Argentine
Republic built in 1923, if I remember aright,
a residence which cost $350,000, and said
that the Argentine Republic was expending a
very large amount, $200,000 or more, in addition to that; also that Mexico had repeated
the same experiment. So if we launch into
an expenditure of $500,000, of which $300,000
will be spent upon a house and the balance
upon equipment, we may be confronted a
year or two hence with the necessity of making
additional expenditures if we are to keep pace
with the Latin nations to the south. Perhaps we may be asked to vote an amount
equivalent to what we are asked to vote now.
Where will the expenditure stop?
I desire to say- and I say it as a humble
member of the party--that the policy in this
respr et enunciated by my own distinguished
leaders some vears ago was a policy that
never appealed to me, and I have never had
any hesitation in expressing my opinion octside of this House as I express it now. I
concur in the attitude taken by the honourble leader on this side (Hon. W. B. Ross).
I for one desire to see this country maintain
the most friendly and most pleasant relations
with the great nation to tlhe south. Our
interests are inextrieably interwoven; we
speak the saine language and our intercourse
is a growing one; but we are not in exactly
the same position as.they are, or any of those
other nations that are represented at Washington. We are part of the British Empire;
ive are not an independent nation, though
we may have a theoretical status of equality
with the other menbers of the Empire. Those
other nations are separate entities dealing
with a distinct nation, the United States. It
would have been safer, more economical and
wiser to have at Washington a gentleman
occupying a position less distinguished than
that of Ambas-ador. I presume that is what
our representative really is. I have never
heard any complaint, or at any rate, not for
a long period of time-not since the time,
back in the last century, when we began to
negotiate our own treaties-that the British
Minister at Washington did not represent us
satisfactorily; and I know that there are on
his staff some gentlemen to whom some of us
Honk.

Mr.

DANDURAND.

have appealed very frequently for information
regarding current matters or legislation pending or likely to be introduced in the United
States, and we have always had the courtesy
of prompt and most satisfactory attention,
and all papers desired have been forwarded
to us.
We are only a night's journey from Washington.
Our Minister there will negotiate
nothing, I assume, without the approval of
the Ministry at Ottawa. By reason of our
contiguity to the United States, the Ministry
at Ottawa are within close range, and in less
than a day one or more of the Ministers can
go down to Washington for a conference between principals, instead of ambassadors. on
important questions of policy. I do not think
the distance is too far. Some of us-I amu
not often one of the fortunate number-find
the Board Walk at Atlantic City not very
far when we desire a little holiday. Washington is not much further than that.
I regret that the Government have decided
on the step thev have taken in appointing an
Ambassador. I have no intention whatever of
saying a word derogatory to the occupant
of that high position: he may be a worthy
representative of this country: but I think
that we are fit the present time too anxious
for what ve think is a place in the sun. Like
a young boy, our Government are troubled
with growing pains. There is too much desire
for display before the people of the world,
as if we were a self-contained community, a
distinct nation, and not one in the great circle
of self-governing dominions that form the
British Empire.
Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Honourab!n
gentlemuen, I quite uindertaind the state of
mind of my honourable friend who leads the
other side of the Flouse (Hon. W. B. Ross)
when ho finds himself confronted with the
pretty large items that appear in the present
Supply Bill.
His surprise would quickly disappear if he had the task of sitting in Council
and listening to the demands that come from
aIl parts of Canada.
This is a very large
country, with considerable public works, and
it is the bounden duty of the Government to
see that those works are rnaintained.
W
teceive here, from all over this country, claims
tîat immediate repairs are needed on works
alon.g our shores and at our ports.
All these
matters must be attended to and provided for.
My honourable friend says he bas consented
to the new item of 81,700,000 for the Maritime
Provinces, but he singles ont the appropriation
of half a million dollars for the Legation at
Washington.
I want to tel: my honourable

APRIL 14, 1927
friend that very often we have been surprised
at figures which at, first glanice appeared large,
but wh-en we came to stud'y the situation we
found they were justified.
I wvila refer to only
one item, in relation to the purchase of the
Scribe Hýotel in Paris, to, which there was such
objection that the Canachan National Railway
mnanagement felt it owed it to -publie opinion
Since thon I have been
to seil the property.
ini Paris two or three times, and I have deplored the day when we abandloned the titie to
that property. The Canadian Commissioner's
office is of so poor a chara.,ter tbat we felt
somenwhat ashamed when we walked into it.
It will be necesary to place our Commissioner
General in proper quartera.
In the Scribe
Hotel we had a property worth double tlhe
amrount that shocked titis iChamber and public
opinion., and we had there an opportunity to
place ouT Commissioner and ail the services
at the very hub of Pairis.
When we come to this figure for Washington we must flot forget that we occupy a position there beside ail the nations of the worl.
We represent hallf of North America.
Potentially we are a very big nation.
Hon. Mr. WILLOUGHBY:

Geographicaly.

Hon. iMr. DANDURAND:
Yes, but I say
potentially aise. We have nine millions of
people, and we play a m*ost important part
in commerce and trade with the United States.
Hon. Mr. ROBERTSON:
the population of Mexico.

We have haîf

Hon. Mr. DANDURAND:
Yes, but our
primary duty is to play our national role
there as becomes a nation cf our position.
The matter with which, we have to deal in
connection with the United States are cf the
Most vital importance to Canada. I could,
if 1 would, name haîf a dozen problems that
have te be solved within the next few days,
but this is not the time te open a discussion
on that phase of this Legation development,
and the sending cf an official delegate to
Washington; it would be too vast a subject
te be dealt with now.
I am convinced that this Government stands
well. It has within the last two or three years
reduced taxation; it ham shown surpluses; it
bas reduced the debt; and I hope that with
the prosperity which. appears te, fili our sails
the present expenditure wîll be found quite
ligbt when we look at the results next year.
With these f ew remarks I move tihe second
reading of this Bill.
