greater stability in the prices of their products. Every possible effort is now being made,
and will continue to be made to seek new
markets for agricultural products as well as
to regain those that have been lost.
Due to inability to market their grain,
prairie farmers have for some time been
faced with a serious shortage of funds to
meet their immediate needs. In order to permit them to receive an advance payment for
the grain they can expect to deliver this year
you will be asked to authorize a system of
cash advances for grain stored on farms.
My Government will strive to secure additional markets for the products of our fishcries and to promote the development of
international rules to safeguard the living
resources of the sea.
My ministers believe that a national development policy carried out in co-operation
with the provinces, and in the territories, is
needed to enable al regions of Canada to
share in the benefits to be realized in developing the resources of this great nation.
It is their intention to propose to you from
time to time programs and projects to
implement this policy.
As an immediate start upon a program of
more extensive development in the Atlantic
provinces, you will be asked to authorize in
joint action with the provincial Governments,
the creation of facilities for the production
and transmission of cheaper electric power
in those provinces. You will also be asked to
provide assistance in financing the Beechwood project which has been under construction in New Brunswick.
My ministers will advance this national
developnent policy further by initiating new
discussions with the Government of Saskatchewan in order to make possible the early
commencement of construction of the dam
on the South Saskatchewan River.
My ministers are pressing for a favourable
settlement of international problems in connection with the Columbia River to clear the
way for a joint program with the Province
of British Columbia to develop the immense
power in the waters of this River.
My ministers will place before you a
measure to ensure that those working in
industries under federal jurisdiction will
receive annual vacations with pay.
You will be asked to approve bills relating
to certain railway branch lines, amendments
to the Canadian and British Insurance Conpanies Act, and, in so far as the other business
before you permits, to several other statutes.
Members of the House of Commons,

You will be asked to appropriate the sums
required for carrying on the Government of
Canada during the remainder of the current
fiscal year.
Changes in certain of the taxing statutes
will be submitted for your approval.
Honourable Members of the Senate,
Members of the Commons,
I wish to express to you and to the people
of Canada my gratitude and that of my
husband for the warmth of the loyalty and
affection with which we have been welcomed
here in Canada.
As I now address you here for the first
time, I will call to your minds the words of
the earlier Elizabeth when, more than three
centuries ago, she spoke from ber heart to
the Speaker and members of her last Parliament and said "Though God hath raised me
high, yet this I count the glory of my crown,
that I have reigned with your loves". Now
here in the new world I say to you that it is
my wish that in the years before me I may so
reign in Canada and be so remembered.
On this happy day when we give thanks
to God for all that He has bestowed on us, I
ask that He may bless and guide you.

APPENDIX

HER MAJESTY'S BROADCAST TO THE NATION
SUNDAY, OCTOBER

(Ordered to be printed in Hansard on
When my husband and I were leaving
Canada last time-in the teeth of a gale, as
you may remember-we heard the kindly
people at Portugal Cove singing "Will Ye No
Come Back Again?" We could not tell thern
then that we had every hope and intention of
returning as soon as possible. Now after six
years I want you to know how happy I am to
be in Canada once again, particularly at
Thanksgiving.
Tomorrow afternoon I shall open the 23rd
Parliament here in the nation's capital. As
you may know, it will be the first time that
the Canadian Parliament has been opened by
the Sovereign in person and I am very much
looking forward to performing this duty. At
this ancient ceremony I shall preside at a
formal assembly of the men and women
chosen to guide the destinies of Canada. Tom-orrow I shall address your representatives
. . . Tonight I want to talk to you more
personally.
Next week I have another important and
pleasant duty to perform. When I go to the
United States I shall be going as the Head of
the Canadian nation to pay a State visit to
the Head of our great neighbouring country.
I shall be going in other capacities as well,
but when you hear or read about the events
in Washington, and other places, I want you
to reflect that it is the Queen of Canada and
her husband who are concerned in them.
I am afraid my visit to Canada this time
is going to be very short, but travelling is
becoming so quick and easy that I hope to
be able to pay more visits in the future. In
the meantime I have vivid memories of my
journey across the country in 1951. All the
varied scenes of that tour have been crowding
back into my mind since I arrived and I have
been going over the great events of those
days with old friends.
I remember particularly the welcome of
the children . . . How you all shouted with

one voice. I remember thinking that it
augured well for Canada that the rising generation, whether English- or French-speaking,
whether born here or abroad, could show so
clearly that you belonged to one great Canadian family. This is a wonderful and exhilarating country worthy of your very best
service when you grow up. We hope that
one day we shall be able to bring our children here to see it.

motion of Hon. Mr. Pouliot. See p. 329)
Different language is no bar to unity of
outlook, so I want to say a few words to
the French-speaking children who may be
listening.
(Translation):
Whether you be English- or French-speaking, whether you were born in this splendid
country or abroad, you all belong to one great
family. You live in a wonderful and exhilarating country. So many other children
would love to share your happiness! When
you grow up, you will be proud to serve your
country and better able to realize all it has
done for you. I hope that -one day I shall be
able to bring my own children here to see it.

Great things have happened here in the
last six years. For one thing there are more

Canadian currency is the admiration of other
nations and it reflects the unceasing and
sensible development of the natural resources,
and your own hard work.
In 1959 I am hoping to be present when the
St. Lawrence Seaway is opened and then I
hope to take that chance to travel more
widely across the country. All these developments and adventurous undertakings are
making a contribution to Canada's prosperity,
but I am also pleased to see the way Canada's
stature has grown in the councils of the
world.
(Translation):
Industry and commerce may bring wealth
to a country, but the character of a nation is
formed by other factors. Race, language,
religion, culture and tradition all have some
contribution to make, and when I think of the
diversity of these factors in Canada today

of the solid and durable foundations of our

REPORT OF LIBRARIAN

Honourable
Speaker:
The Hon. the

report of the Parliamentary Librarian.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
To the Honourable the Speaker of the Senate:
The Parliamentary Librarian has the honour to
submit his report for the first nine months of the
year 1957.
We now have in the library building some 200,000
volumes, of which 89,385 had been re-catalogued
at the end of September last. Since the last report
our enlarged cataloguing staff have re-catalogued
17,259 volumes. During the same period our staff
have answered 2,512 reference questions, and have
circulated 10,613 books.
We have brought back to the Supreme Court
building all the boxes of books which were in
dead storage in the Dominion Bureau of Statistics
building except those intended for the National
Library. Those still in the Supreme Court building
are being arranged on shelves and will be gone
over soon with a view to deciding which should be
kept and which sent to the National Library. This
Is a long operation which is not likely to be completed until two or three years hence.
In accordance with a recommendation of the
Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament at its
meeting in March 19, 1957, the Department of
Public Works have studied ways of improving the
general illumination of the main reading room and
steps are now being taken to implement the recommendation of the Joint Committee.

The Committee of Selection appointed to nominate
senators to serve on the several standing committees for the present session, make their first
report, as follows:
Your committee have the honour to submit here-

with the list of senators selected by them to serve
on the Standing Committee on Divorce, namely:
The Honourable Senators Baird, Barbour, Burchill,
Cameron, Croll, Euler, Farquhar, Farris, Fergusson,

*Ex officio member.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senaconsideration?
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot:

Honourable

the Divorce Committee. It comes as the most
important appointment, although it is the
one which should pass last. As a member of
the Senate, and being rather assiduous, I
have considered that many of my gifted colleagues have spent much of their valuable
time in the Divorce Committee, where they
served with efficiency, and it was a most
unpleasant task for them; they did it conscientiously and admirably, and they deserve
to

be

praised

for

the

excellent

although

painstaking work which they have done. But
naturally

there is

a certain

deformation

of

the mind due to application to the work, and
some members of the Divorce Committee
may be under the false impression that because they sit on that committee and perform their duties as well as they can, they
do their utmost to serve this country. My
opinion is that they are greatly mistaken.

For this reason: if we go back to the time
of Confederation we will see that at that
time the number of divorces were very few;
in fact, in some years there were none. It is

very easy to check and verify the record by
perusing the Votes and Proceedings of each
session at the time of Confederation. The

number of divorces were nothing-one or
two per year. Therefore, the Fathers of Confederation decided that the matter should
come under the jurisdiction of Parliament.
Well and good. But if we consider the most
interesting and most important report that

was tabled during last session by the honourable senator from Huron-Perth (Hon. Mr.
Golding), on behalf of the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee, we will see that conditions are entirely different now from what
they were at the time of Confederation. I

have the highest opinion of my colleagues of
the Senate; I consider that they are able,
conscientious, broad-minded, well-informed
Canadian citizens. And this is not flattering.
I express with great sincerity my personal
feelings, after two years of assiduous work
in the Senate.

Now, there are many committees that never
sit. It is unfortunate. But the Divorce Committee is sitting too much, and we take for
granted that Mr. and Mrs. So-and-so, who
cannot manage to live together, make a case.
It is made by Mr. So-and-so, or Mrs. Such-

and-such. They hire an investigator of minor
repute, with good eyesight, who from a distance of several hundred yards can see
through the keyhole of a door and tell what
is happening inside. Perhaps there is some
substance in the evidence that is given,
because if we take report after report we
find the story is always the same. It reminds
me of the story of a general storekeeper who
had bought 50 barrels of good black molasses
to sell to the lumberjacks of his district.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I am
sorry, but I feel I must interrupt my honourable friend to point out that there is no
motion before the house. We will give him
every opportunity to speak at the proper time.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What about the story?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think we should get on
with the business.
Hon. Mr. Beaubien: It is a little sticky, but
it is all right.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend may tell his
story if he wishes, but I point out there is
no motion before the house. We are anxious
to have the motion for the appointment of
the committee approved.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We have not got to
the motion yet. Should we not decide whether
we will allow the honourable senator to conclude his remarks? It seems to me that he is
about finished. If we shut him off now he can
start all over again when the motion is before
the bouse. As I say, I think he is about
through.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will my honourable friend
guarantee that?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators, if
I may be allowed to move that the report be
taken into consideration now, it will then be
in order for my honourable friend to say what
he has to say. In my opinion, he is out of
order at present.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would agree to that,
but I think that what the honourable senator
from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) has
said should be taken as having been said
after the motion is put.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
with leave I move, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Monette, that this report be taken into consideration now.
Hon. M. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I do
not want to be accused of obstruction. As
a rule, I try to make short speeches, and I
thank the house for being so indulgent today.
As I was saying, there was a fellow who
bought 50 barrels of molasses to serve to
the lumberjacks of his district. His customers
96702-2

came, and they were served in pints, quarts
or gallons. Soon afterward they returned
to the store and complained that the molasses, instead of being sweet, turned sour
and was very acid. The storekeeper tasted
some from the barrel and found that it was
not very palatable. So he asked the wholesaler to cancel the deal and take the molasses
The
back, which request was refused.
storekeeper then took action. The court
appointed referees, all good men, and each
one had to drink a large soup-spoonful of
that sour molasses. Imagine anyone drinking
50 large spoonfuls of sour molasses. It
must have been very unpleasant. And so it is
that when I think of an unpleasant task like
sitting on our Divorce Committee I am
reminded of the sour molasses case that was
decided by the experts. Naturally, all comparisons are odious. I do not want to
infringe on the rules, I just want to bring
to the attention of my honourable colleagues
of the Senate a few facts, which I will
summarize.
In the first place, one should have a sense
of proportion and agree that the Divorce
Committee-and I am not discussing the
kind of work that is done by members of
that committee at all-is the least important
of all the committees set up in the Senate.
In the second place, it will be agreed that
a large number of our colleagues spend their
valuable time in listening to those sordid
stories, wasting their time which they could
occupy much more beneficially for the good
That being submitted to
of the country.
the wisdom of all my colleagues, I thank
them for the good hearing they have given
me.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Will the honourable
gentleman tell us if he has any suggestions to
make?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Yes, surely. I make
the same suggestion that I made to the house
at the time the honourable gentleman was ill
last session. I am glad to see that he has
completely recuperated.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: And this suggestion is
now made by special request. I am very
thankful to have the opportunity to answer
my honourable friend who has spent a lot
of time serving on the Divorce Committee.
Going back to what took place at the time
of Confederation, we must put ourselves in
the minds of the Fathers of Confederation and
see the divorce question as they saw it in 1867,
when there were none or very few divorces.
The suggestion that I made last session, and

SENATE
which was as clear as crystal-and I hope
that it will be accepted-is this: putting ourselves in the place of the Fathers of Confederation, let us go back the ninety years to
the time when there were just a few divorces.
Some years there were none, in other years
there were two and in other years, one. Let
us put the average at five a year at the time
of Confederation.
Coming back to the present, to 1957, we
must take into consideration another point,
the increase of population, a fourfold increase
since 1867. Now looking at the question as
it was seen in the minds of the Fathers of
Confederation, my idea is to multiply the
average number of divorces at the time of
Confederation by four, the number of times
the population has increased, and that would
mean that each year the Senate Divorce Committee would hear twenty petitions for
divorce. That is my suggestion. And if my
honourable friend who has been doing so
much as Chairman of the Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) asks, "What can
we do, seeing we have 400 petitions a year?",
I reply: "Well, the thing is simple. If you
consider 20 divorce petitions a year, and if
400 petitions are filed, then there will remain
380 on the waiting list for next session."
Hon. Mr. Horner: Would the honourable
member tell us how he would select the 20
out of the 400?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: In numerical order. And
that would be fair-first to come, first to be
judged. That would discourage applicants,
and the whole question would be solved.
There was another suggestion, which was
made by no less a jurist than the present
Leader of the Opposition in the House of
Commons. He suggested that as most divorce
petitions come from the province of Quebec,
all the applicants frorn that province should
in the first place be required to obtain a
judicial separation from bed and board from
the Superior Court of the province of Quebec,
which requirement would reduce considerably
the number of divorce petitions. And not
only that, but each applicant would have to
file with his petition for a divorce a certified
copy of the judgment of the Superior Court.
Well, those are two suggestions, honourable
senators. If my honourable friend insists, I
will give him some more in due course.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That will do for the
moment.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
before the question is put may I ask the
mover of the motion (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) if
this committee is composed of the same
number and the same members as last session.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: Yes, exactly.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are there some
vacancies still on the committee?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: There are quite a
number.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am glad to hear
that. I am rather disappointed that there
have not been some names added. When
I realized that there were a number of new
senators joining us this session, I hoped that
at least some of them would see their way
clear to consent to sit on the Divorce Committee. I can only express the hope that,
when
other
honourable
senators
are
appointed, some of them will serve on this
committee.
Hon. Mr. Aseline: The object of having
these vacancies is that other members can
be appointed when the senatorial vacancies
are filled.
The motion for consideration of the report
was agreed to, and on motion of Hon. Mr.
Aseltine the report was adopted.
APPOINTMENT

Hon. John T. Haig, with leave of the
Senate, moved:
That the senators mentioned in the report of the
Committee of Selection as having been chosen to
serve on the Standing Committee on Divorce during
the present session, be and they are hereby appointed to form part of and constitute the said
comrnittee to inquire into and report upon such
matters as may be referred to them from time to
time.

He said: The purpose of the motion is
simply to enable the Divorce Committee to
get together and organize. The Senate does
not appoint its chairman; the committee
appoints its own. Also the committee will
have an opportunity to arrange dates for
hearings of divorce cases. Hearings cannot
be held before the 28th of this month, but
the persons concerned can be notified that
hearings will take place on and after that
date. Quite a little work is involved in
making these arrangements. As a former
chairman, I understand that very clearly.
I do not think there can be any objection to
the adoption of an arrangement which
worked very well last session and will, I am
sure, be useful this session.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I agree with what
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) has said, but am I to understand the latter part of the motion to mean
that matters other than divorce can be
referred to the committee?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, just matters which
relate to the Divorce Committee. I am dealling only with the Divorce Committee,
because it is desired to give that committee
a chance to get organized.

OCTOBER 15, 1957
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am not very clear
about the purport of the motion. So far as
organizing the committee and giving it the
necessary powers is concerned, that is good.
If this or whatever other resolution may be
required is passed today we can meet tomorrow and organize for the present session.
That is necessary because, as the honourable
the Government Leader has said, there is a
great deal to be done in bringing these
cases to trial. Due notice must be given
to the parties involved. I am not passing on
the phraseology of the motion, but the
general purpose of it is right.
The motion was agreed to.

BUSINESS OF THE SENATE

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I move
that when this house rises today it stand

Before the question is put may I explain
why I am asking for this adjournment? In
the first place, I have been informed by
members of the Senate staff that it will
take until Thursday or Friday of this week
to restore the Senate chamber to its normal
state. In the second place, many honourable
senators had anticipated that we would adjourn today until next Tuesday night.
I have not consulted with anyone on the
matter but I want to say quite candidly that

STANDING COMMITTEES
NOTICE OF INQUIRY

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
wish to give notice of the following inquiry
for Wednesday, October 23:
1. What is the membership, the quorum, the
purpose and the jurisdiction of each one of the
sixteen standing committees of the Senate?
2. Besides the yearly routine meetings to set a
quorum and elect a chairman, how many meetings
of each standing committee were held during each
one of the last ten sessions of Parliament?
3. For each standing committee how many subcommittees were there?
4. What is the membership, the quorum, the
purpose and the jurisdiction of each said committee?
5. In what year were the said subcommittees
appointed for the first time?
6. How many meetings of each one of the said
subcommittees have been held during each one of
the Iast ten sessions of Parliament?

I had intended to make this inquiry at
the last session. I discovered it in my files
and I have redrafted it and brought it up
to date. The purpose of the inquiry is to
ascertain how many committees we have and
how often they have sat. Now, I have a list
of the committees, but this list was made
prior to presentation of the Selection Committee's report, which will be taken up at
the next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask the
honourable senator whether he is asking for
that information with respect to all the standing committees?
Hon. Mr. Pouliol: The standing committees
that are not joint committees.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend
would assist me and the staff of the Senate
if he were to put this in the forrn of an inquiry on the Order Paper. Then we would
get the answer and give it to him.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: That is what I am doing.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: My honourable friend
should give written notice of it. He cannot
make a speech on it now.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I am giving a copy of
it to the Clerk. I do not expect an answer
today. That would be impossible.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: But you would like to
make a speech on it.

Lester B. Pearson today, informing him he has
won the 1957 Nobel Peace Prize:
"I have the honour to inform you that the Nobel
Committee of the Norwegian Parliament today has
awarded to you the Nobel Peace Prize for 1957."

Honourable senators, in my opinion this is
a great honour which has come to a very
deserving and distinguished Canadian who
has served Canada well both at home and
abroad. It is a distinction that has never
before come to a Canadian citizen. In fact,
this prize has been awarded to citizens of
this continent on only three previous occasions. The Honourable Lester B. Pearson
has made the name of Canada highly respected in the councils of the world. He has
represented our country at international gatherings whose main purpose has been to
preserve peace, and he has done his work
so well that he has now been given this
great honour. I am sure honourable senators
will join with me in extending to the Honourable Mr. Pearson our hearty congratulations on the winning of this award, and our
deep appreciation of the splendid work which

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 6
FIRST READING
The
Hon.
the
Speaker: Honourable
senators, a message bas been received from
the House of Commons with Bill 1l, for
granting Her Mai esty certain sums of money
for the public service of the financial year
ending the 3lst March, 1958, to which they
desire the concurrence of the Senate.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon.
the
Speaker:
Honourable
senators, when shahl this bill be read the
second time?
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I would like, with the consent of the house,
to move second reading o! this interim supply bill tonight, because of circumstances
which have neyer arisen before and are not
likely to arise again.
In the spring of 1957 the Government of
the day .brought down a budget which contained certain estimates. Then Parliament
passed an interim supply bill to provide supply for a six-month period ending October
31. When the new Government came into
power, on June 10, it found it could not cali
a session of Parliament; in September,
although apparently both parties had anticipated there would be such a session when
they made this deal with respect to the supplementary estimates, and voted supply only
to the end of October. Before the former
Government went to the country it promised
an increase in salaries to civil servants,
members of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police, members of the armed forces and
certain classes of that kind, but apparently
there was not; enough time to provide for
these salary increases before the election
came on.
When the new Government came into
power it saw fit to fulfil the salary promises
that haýd been made, but flot enough money
had been voted in the estimates, which will
run out on October 31. If new estimates are
flot put through by that date, Thursday of
next week, there will flot be sufficient funds
to pay the employees to whom I have
referred.

Further supplementary bills will be introduced, because this one will take care of only
the shortage in October and the requirements
for November. Estimates will also have to be
brought down and voted on for December of
1957 and January, February and March of
1958. The Government's expendîtures for
those items and any other items beyond the
original estimates will have to be included
in those supplementary estimates to come. I
reserve to ahl honourable senators the right
to discuss or examine all the general estimates for those four months. I would ask
honourable senators to permit this bull to be
put through tonight, so that the Governor
General or his representative may corne here
on Thursday to give Royal Assent to the bll.
The bull is sornewhat cornplicated, but fundamentally it is being introduced for the very
reason I have stated. I am quite wifling to
give any explanation I arn able to give. I
may say, and I think this is something we
ought to remember, that the House of Commons put this bill through ini a very short
time, by unanimous vote. They of course
were very close to the estimates and understood the matter clearly, sorne of the memnbers of the former Goverrment and some
of the members o! the new Government
having been in the other house at the last
session. Apparently, it was flot very difficult.
They indulged in some high talk, but I do flot
think it had anything to do with the estimates at ail. I read the report, and it looked
to me as though the discussion of the est!mates was very limited, if they were discussed

honourable friend said, we will have an opportunity of discussing more recent supplementary estimates fully at a later time. But
I would like to know from hi
why the
required proportions of certain items are
different from those of other items.
I would also like to know something as to
the intention of the Government with regard
to the expenditure of this money we are
voting tonight.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, the
Government will spend the money asked for
in this interim supply bill. That is why they
are asking for it. Honourable senators must
remember that only the money contained in
each estimate can be spent; the Government
cannot go outside the vote. That is what
makes it difficult.
Referring to the difference between the
proportions required for different items, I
would repeat the answer my honourable
friend often gave me, and which I thought
was very effective, that at some periods of
the year, because of the nature of the work
to be provided for, more money is needed
than at other times. I assume that is the
case here. The big expenditures of the
Government have not come up yet. I see in
the press, for example, that legislation is to
be introduced to increase the old age pension.
This item, and a provision, also mentioned
in the press, for the financing of the wheat
crop, will require considerable sums. But
at the present time we are asked to provide
money which is needed at once. The bill
takes care of the difference between what
has been supplied, say, for certain months,
and what is needed in addition. These estimates cover requirements to the end of
November. There was no interference with
the estimates in October. The case I mentioned is where the interference occurred:
one-sixth, or whatever the proportion is, was
put in to cover special items, but not others,
in October. I think my honourable friend
can rest assured that the money included in
this supplementary estimate will be spent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In the main estimates
also?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot tell my honourable
friend that. I do not know how much the
main estimates will be or what they will
contain but any increases of that order will
be included, of course, in the main estimates
when they come down. These are supplementaries, because a certain amount of money
is needed to carry on. Some of the main
estimates were not included in the money
voted in April, because nobody anticipated
that there would be any delay beyond September, but events made a difference to the

financial situation. I read carefully what
was said by the Minister of Finance, and
although there was criticism, I did not observe that any was directed to what he was
doing. Nobody suggested that he should have
taken any other course than he has taken,
which is the course I am taking here. I do
not see how the current shortages could be
met except by doing what we are doing;
and any questions which honourable senators
wish to raise can be put forward when the
main estimates are brought in,-probably in
November, because they must be dealt with
before prorogation.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
some aspects of this bill are a little puzzling
to me. Al I am asking now is that the
situation should be clarified. It really appears
to me that it should be. Last session, but
earlier in the session, the main estimates
were presented. We found it necessary from
time to time to vote interim bills to carry
on the affairs of the country; and before
dissolution there were supplementary estimates and, as I recall, a second group of
supplementary estimates. Speaking the other
day, the Minister of Finance described the
estimates as main estimates, supplementary
estimates, and supplementary estimates No. 1.
Now we have supplementary estimates No. 2:
all these, I understand, are included in the
bill now before us. It appears to me-I am
asking for information on this point because,
quite frankly, I am not clear about it-and I
would draw the attention of the house to the
fact that the amount of these supplementary
estimates No. 2 exceeds eighty million dollars.
I am not saying they are not necessarynot at all-although on a few items I believe
further explanation should be available to
the house at a later time. I understand that
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) is desirous of proceeding
with the debate on the address tonight.
Certainly we are all looking forward with
a great deal of pleasure to the initial speeches
of the mover and seconder of the motion for
adoption of the address. So I merely wish
to ask my honourable friend if these supplementary estimates No. 2 which were received
the other day are new estimates, apart from
the main estimates, supplementary estimates,
and supplementary estimates No. 1 that were
placed before Parliament prior to dissolution.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot answer that question. However, I know that the present
estimates are not duplications, and there was
no suggestion to that effect in the other house.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I understand that.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: Not a single member of the
Opposition there raised any question about
duplication, and when it came to a vote, not
a vote was cast against it. Surely, if these
estimates constituted a duplication, there
would have been some opposition to them in
the other house. As I read the speech of the
Minister of Finance, what he tried to do was
to set out as nearly as he could the cost of
various items, and I think he accomplished it
pretty well. As I have said, the complete
picture will come in the main estimates; or if
it is the wish of the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) or the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), there is no reason why a full examination of the estimates cannot be undertaken
here. The only problem I face is to get action
soon enough. There is no reason why the
Government would try to conceal any items
in the supplementary estimates: certainly, had
they attempted to do so, the other house would
never have allowed the estimates to go
through in that form. I believe that when the
final estimates are before us they will disclose clearly what the Government expenditures are for, and I have no doubt they will
be accompanied by a clear explanation. In
talking of eighty or one hundred million
dollars, one must realize that these are small
amounts in relation to a budget of five and a
half thousand million dollars.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Somebody once said,
"What is a million?"
Hon. Mr. Haig: I know, but that man isn't
here any more.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I did not want my
honourable friend to repeat the statement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: To me, a million dollars is
quite a lot of money.
I cannot give the house any further information but I can say that my confidence in the
Minister of Finance is such that I do not
think he would try to cover up. And even
if he did try, I feel confident that certain
members of the Opposition in that house
would not let him cover up. Not one member raised any question about covering-up
in those estimates. That is all I can say
about it.

November, to have the status of No. 2 supplementary estimates, as they are called, clarified.
I think a reasonable request might be made
for an explanation of a few of the items, but
I do not propose to make that request tonight.
Quite frankly, I myself am uncertain about
them, although all the evidence leads me to
believe that the supplementary estimates
No. 2 were prepared by the present administration and not by the former administration. If that is so I think we should know it.
But I am not asking my honourable friend
to elucidate that point tonight. We certainly
must pass these estimates and I have no objection to them going through. The honourable
Leader of the Government has given us his
assurance that passage of this bill will not
impair in any way our right to ask questions
later on, and with that assurance I am content to let the estimates go through.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I have another
word?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Leader of the
Government has stated that Royal Assent will
probably be given to this bill on Thursday
of this week. With respect to the question
raised by my honourable friend from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) concerning further
supplementary estimates No. 2, I am definitely
of the same opinion as he is; that is, I am
reasonably sure that these supplementary
estimates were prepared by the present Government and tabled in the House of Commons
by the prcsent Government and not by the
former Government.
I should like to make a proposal. As
Royal Assent is not to be given until Thursday, could we not give this bill second
reading now and third reading tomorrow, and
perhaps in the meantime my honourable
friend could get the information we want and
give it to us before the bill is read the third
time? Would there be any objection to that?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I can assure honourable
senators that I have learned something tonight. The next time I introduce an appropriation bill I will have a statement from
the Minister of Finance explaining exactly
what the estimates cover. That would be
much better than any statement I could give
the house.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators,

Haig). Perhaps it would be possible before and the speeches made by other members
the next supplementary vote comes along, in and I could not find anything to indicate that

OCTOBER 22, 1957
everything was not all right. I do not want
to pass the estimates if there is any question
about them. I will hold them over. It may
mean that we will have to sit on Friday and
Monday in order to get the estimates through,
but I will have to ask the house to do that
because I do not want honourable members
to pass anything they do not want to pass.
The only thing I can do is to ask the house to
sit on Friday and perhaps on Monday in
order to get the bill through. I will tell the
Minister of Finance that I am held up, that
objection has been taken and that I feel the
objection is so serious that I would not dare
to ask the members of the Senate to pass
the estimates now. I will have to get whatever information I can, and in the meantime
I would ask that the debate be adjourned
until Thursday. If we did not get through
by that time we would have to sit on Friday
and perhaps on Monday. We could certainly
clear them up by Monday.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I would like to say a word on this very imI think the honourable
portant question.
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) is
quite correct in stating that supplementary
estimates No. 2 are estimates filed by the new
Government for the first time on October 15.
They consist of several very large items. For
instance, there is $31.2 million to cover civil
service salaries which were authorized after
Parliament was dissolved last spring. Then
there is an arnount of $8.1 million to take
care of the deficit of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Also there is $8.8 million
to take care of expenses in connection with
maintenance of new immigrants, and so on.
These are new supplementary estimates
entirely.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I am not quarreling with
these items at all. There are a few items of
interest here. I see one for the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation of over $8 million
in addition to what they had before. I think
that requires a little explanation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
as far as I am concerned, the information
that I was seeking has been given, namely,
that further supplementary estimates No. 2
were prepared by the present Government and
tabled in the other house. Therefore, I am
withdrawing any objection to this bill going
through tonight.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you very much.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

THIRD READING NEXT SITTING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move that the bill be
placed on the Order Paper for third reading
tomorrow.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
would it not be possible to refer this bill to
committee for discussion tomorrow morning?
It could be sent to either the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce or the
Standing Committee on Finance, where the
Minister of Finance or others might come
and give us more detailed and clearer information about the items involved, which
come to a substantial amount. I would suggest that the bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce for
consideration tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, if I
may speak again I think I had better move
that the bill be given third reading on Friday
or next Monday, whichever suits the house.
Let the civil servants wait. Apparently, the
house does not want to support me. Honourable senators, I move that third reading be
given to this bill on Friday next.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
that does not dispose of the suggestion that
the bill be referred to the Banking and Commerce Committee. I think that should be
decided first. Although I should like to have
further information on a number of these
items, I might say that during the four years
I have been in this bouse an interim supply
bill has never yet been referred to any committee. One of the reasons for that is that to
examine a bill like this one adequately
clause by clause would take much more than
one or two days of the time at our disposal.
In that limited time we could scarcely deal
fully with one item of one department. I
do not think it is feasible for us to examine
these estimates in that way. I feel it would
be better if the estimates were consideredand I refer to all the estimates-by a committee of this house at its leisure, rather than
that one committee should devote a morning
to this bill. We could not get very much
information in so short a time. Therefore, I
think it would be preferable to follow the
suggestion of the Leader of the Government
and give the bill third reading tomorrow.
We would then have an opportunity to
peruse these estimates in the meantime, and
to ask for any further particulars tomorrow.
May I also mention that I believe the
main estimates were considered by our
Standing Committee on Finance last session.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Not last session.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At any rate, they
have been considered from time to time. The
Committee on Finance is qualified to examine
the main estimates. I repeat that I think it
would be more practical to have this bill
placed on the Order Paper for third reading
tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I am
quite willing to have the bill come up for
third reading tomorrow, as suggested by the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). We can peruse the estimates in the
meantime.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask the honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) if he would
identify this bill as being the one referred to
by the Minister of Finance in the other
house, as reported on page 11 of the House
of Commons Hansard for October 15? An I
right in supposing that the bill now under
discussion deals with supplementary estimates No. 2, and covers the item included in
that definition? If the honourable leader
could identify this bill clearly as the one
covering supplementary estimates No. 2, we
would be in a better position tomorrow to
discuss the bill. At present I am completely
at a loss to know which one of these estimates it is.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) if when the
bill cornes up for third reading tomorrow he
will furnish information regarding item 759?
This is something new, and we are asked
to pass a measure which apparently no one
knows anything about. I am particularly
interested in item 759.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I add one more
word? The honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert) bas raised the question
as to what this bill includes. I understand that
this is the interim supply bill with respect to
all the estimates that have been brought down
up to the present time, that it includes the
main estimates, the supplementary estimates,
the supplementary estimates No. 1, and the
supplementary estimates No. 2. If honourable
senators will look at the bill, I think they
will sec that in clause 2Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, I

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It would be if it were
not for the fact that I asked the house for
permission to speak for another minute, and
I understood that I had the unanimous consent
of the house.

The Hon. the Speaker: I understood that,
too.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It will be seen that
in clause 2 there is a reference to the main
estimates. In clause 5 there is a reference to
the supplementary estimates. In clause 6 there
is a reference to supplementary estimates
No. 1. In clause 8 there is a reference to
supplementary estimates No. 2. I think it
is clear, therefore, that this is an interim
supply bill with respect to all the estimates
that have been brought down in the house.
The motion of Hon. Mr. Haig was agreed
to, and it was ordered that the bill be placed
on the Order Paper for third reading
tomorrow.
DIVORCE
PETITIONS
Hon. F. W. Gershaw: Honourable senators,
on behalf of the Chairman of the Committee
on Divorce (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) I wish to
present some 270 petitions for divorce. Some
of these petitions may be withdrawn. However, divorce petitions can be filed during the

first six weeks of the session.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Gershaw, for Hon. Mr. Roebuck,
presented the flrst report of the Standing
Committee on Divorce, as follows:
1. Your committee recommend that their quorum
be reduced to three members for all purposes,
including the taking of evidence upon oath by the
committee or any subcommittee as to the matters
set forth in petitions for bills of divorce.
2. Your committee also recommend that leave be
given them to sit during all adjournments of the
Senate, and also during sittings of the Senate.
3. Your
committee
further
recommend
that
authority be granted for the appointment of as
many subcommittees as deemed necessary by the
committee for the purpose of hearing and inquiring
into such petitions for divorce as may be referred
to them by the Committee on Divorce, the subcommittee in each case to report their findings to
the Main Committee.

Honourable senators, I should perhaps
explain that it is necessary for the conmittee to sit during the sittings of the Senate
so that witnesses who come from other
provinces will not be detained unnecessarily
in Ottawa. It is also necessary for the conmittee to sit on days when the Senate is not
in session because of the shortage of shorthand reporters.

Honourable senators, I would like to thank
you for the very kind and gracious welcome
you have given me on my appointment to
the Senate. Your welcome has been most
Here I am
sincere and heart warrning.
together again with many old friends from
the House of Commons. It is one of the most
cherished and nicest things about our parliamentary life that while we may have
different political faiths, we may have views
and opinions which are strongly opposed and
be divided on many issues, yet underneath
it all, no matter what differences may divide
us, we can still be very good friends. I say
again, honourable senators, how much I have
appreciated your very kindly, courteous and
friendly welcome to this chamber. I am indeed looking forward to my association with
you, and I hope that in the days that lie ahead
that I may be able to make some small contribution to the welfare of Canada. It matters
little our race, colour, creed or political
faith, or where we live in this great country,
or the nature of our occupation, or for that
matter our financial status, for above all we
are Canadians first, and Canada is our first
great love; and while, as I said a moment
ago, we may differ on many matters, yet we
are really only concerned with one great objective-what can we do that is in the best
interest of Canada and all Canadians from
coast to coast.
I was much impressed when I took the
oath of allegiance in this chamber in observing the procedure centuries old, and, in
particular, the old-world language used on
occasions. Our Speaker, our judges, and
counsel when appearing in court all wear
gowns, which always add much to the dignity of the occasion. But there are some in
this country who are always seeking something new and strange; they wish to discard
old customs and traditions. We are a young
nation, and I think we should cherish and
maintain the customs and traditions we have
inherited from the old world. I have often
observed in other countries the intense pride
and affection the people of those countries
have for their own country, their customs,
traditions, dress, music, language, special
holidays, culture, their national achievements
and their heroes, and all those things that
go to unite, and build up a strong national
fibre in, the love of their country. Let us

retain what we have inherited from the
countries of our racial origin, but also let us
build up and maintain our own Canadian
traditions and culture.
To you, Mr. Speaker, I pay my respects,
and congratulate you, sir, on your appointment as Speaker of this house. You have already given evidence, sir, that you will be a
good Speaker, that you will add to the dignity
of your office, and that you will more than
live up to the very high traditions set by past
Speakers. If I may say so, sir, your very
charming and gracious manners, which are
always associated with your race, your perfect English-and I am told by my colleagues
that your French is equally good-your long
training in the law, your great interest in
our national sports, your interest in the
theatre and the cultural side of Canadian
life, all provide an excellent background for
your high office. I am sure that I speak for
all honourable senators when I say that we
are delighted and happy to have you as our
Speaker.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. White: I feel that the Prime Minister bas paid a great honour to my native
village of Madoc, where I was born and have
always resided, and to the riding of HastingsFrontenac, which I had the honour to represent in the House of Commons for eighteen
years, in my appointment to the Senate. My
many Liberal friends at home were just as
pleased and happy as my Conservative
friends. In this huge country many have
never heard of my little village of Madoc,
which is half way between Ottawa and
Toronto. It is a land of paradise for the
fisherman and hunter. It is also a great
agricultural country, where the really good
cheese is made, and where a large share of
your good roast beef is grown. My little
village, like so many other small hamlets
across this country, has produced men and
women who have become famous throughout
Canada, perhaps throughout the world. One
distinguished gentleman, well known to many
honourable senators, is William Mackintosh,
the Principal of Queen's University, who
during the war made a valuable contribution
in the work he did in the Finance Department here in Ottawa. Dr. Roy Allan Dafoe,
who achieved world-wide fame at the birth
of the quintuplets, came from my small village; and in the recent war a Madoc boy,
Major Jack Foote, won the Victoria Cross.
This gallant padre took part in the raid on
Dieppe, and was fortunate enough to get
back to the ship, and could have returned to
England, but when he looked towards the
shore and saw the many Canadian boys who
were taken prisoners, he jumped in the

OCTOBER 22, 1957
water, swam to shore, and stayed with the
Canadian prisoners for the duration of the
war.
Hastings county, where I reside, is, like
many other parts of Canada, becoming very
conscious of its hidden mineral wealth. At
Madoc there is the largest talc mine in the
world. We have fiuorspar and feldspar marble
and marble chips, roofing granules, four producing uranium mines in the Bancroft area,
and a huge iron ore development at Marmora,
the Bethlehem mine, where over 20 million
tons of limestone had to be removed to reach
the ore body. The mine is now in production
with enough ore in sight for open-pit mining
for at least twenty-five years-a most
valuable asset in time of war.
I would like to offer my congratulations to
the Prime Minister of Canada, a great
Canadian. Canada has indeed been most
fortunate in the calibre of men who have
filled this high office since Confederation. His
sincerity and his most earnest desire to serve
the people of Canada have endeared him to
tens of thousands of Canadians.
I notice in the Speech from the Throne that
it is indicated there will be increased assistance to our senior citizens. How fortunate we
are that we live in a country with resources
which enable us to make such financial
assistance to our older citizens. Those of us
who live in small villages or in the country
are, perhaps, more conscious of the struggles
and the hardships that the elderly people have
to endure, in many cases through no fault of
their own, perhaps through age and physical
disabilities. They find that the old age security
payments provide just the difference between
poverty and some small share in the better
things of life to which we all feel they are
entitled. With the decrease in the value of our
dollar, and the increased cost of living, I
doubt if there will be objection from any part
of Canada to the proposed increases in these
pensions. The same applies to the pensions for
the blind, payments to the group in the 65-70
year age group, and payments under the Disabled Persons Act. Any honourable senators
who have had anything to do with that act
will agree that the definition it contains,
"totally and permanently disabled", is most
rigid. To me it sounds like an almost impossible requirement. Many times I have heard
in the other place requests from all parties to
the Minister of National Health to modify this
most restrictive definition.
As you are aware, the present scale under
the War Veterans Allowance Act is $60 for
a single veteran and $120 for a married veteran. This amount certainly is not excessive,
especially when you consider that the applicant for the allowance is subject to the means

test. An increase in the allowance will be
most welcome to the thousands of veterans
who receive payments under the act. While
there is no reference in the Speech from the
Throne to any change in the ceiling on permissible income, I sincerely hope that the
ceiling will be raised, for as the act stands at
the present time, if the veteran earns income
in addition to his allowance, which puts him
over the ceiling, his allowance is reduced
until the overpayment is recovered. I have
always felt that this was wrong and that, on
the contrary, the veteran should be encouraged in every way to work and supplement
his income without any fear of having his
allowance reduced.
Mention is made in the Speech from the
Throne that the groups to whom allowances
are paid will be enlarged. I presume this
refers to the veterans who served in the
United Kingdom in World War I, which
under the act is not classed as a theatre of
war. If this is what this reference means, I
think it is a most worthy effort, because
everyone knows that the soldier-and we are
dealing entirely with private soldiers and
N.C.O's under this act-is subject to army
discipline and has no control over where he
is sent. He goes wherever he is ordered, and
in many cases veterans had to stay in the
United Kingdom through no fault of their
own. Now that most of the veterans of World
War I are getting close to sixty or over sixty
it seems to me that the veterans who served
in the United Kingdom are entitled to come
under the War Veterans Allowance Act. As
the allowance is subject to the means test,
the number of veterans who will qualify will
not be very large and will decrease each
year.
Mention is also made in the Speech from
the Throne of certain sections of the Pension
Act. It is to be hoped that some of the
minor wrinkles will be ironed out of this
act. We are indeed fortunate that we have
at the head of our Pension Board two officials
who are capable and are doing a fine job.
The chairman of the board is a veteran with
a distinguished war record, and he is most
efficient and sympathetic. The vice-chairman,
a former member of the House of Commons,
tries in every case to do the very best possible
for the veteran; but, after all, these officials
can only proceed under the terms of the act.
It has often occurred to me with respect to
cases that have passed through my hands that
the medical officers who examined the veterans might have adopted a more sympathetic attitude. In World War II the soldier
was given a most complete and thorough
medical examination on enlistment, including X-ray examination. In all cases where

SENATE
the soldier was placed in category "A" it
always appeared to me to be only logical that
if he was placed in a lower category during
service or on discharge, such lower category
should be accepted without question as being
due to war service. But that is not always
the case. So often you read the words on
pension documents, "pre-enlistment condition
not aggravated by service". I say to you
honourable senators that they are the most
hateful and distasteful words I know of to
the veteran.
A brief reference is made in the Speech
from the Throne to taxing statutes. I am
sure that any reduction in the rates of income tax or any increase in the amount of
the exemption will be most welcome to all
Canadians.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. White: I doubt if any honourable
senator will agree that the present exemption
is sufficient, especially in the case of children
and more particularly with reference to
children attending university.
While no
mention is made as to revising the Dominion
Succession Duty Act, I for one hope that
something will be done in this session to
revise it. Revision of this act has been mentioned in the Speech from the Throne in
previous sessions, but no action has been
taken. In my opinion the present act should
be revised in the light of economic conditions
which have changed considerably since the
act was introduced early in the war.
At the present time an estate up to $50,000
is exempt from succession duty tax, but if the
estate exceeds $50,000 it is taxable in its
entirety. I think that would appear to everyone te be most unfair. I feel that the exemption should be increased to at least $75,000
and that this amount should be exempt in
any event.
Every honourable senator who is a member
of the legal profession knows from his own
knowledge and has seen from his personal
experience in his law office many instances of
the effect of income tax and succession duties
on incomes under wills, trusts, pensions,
lump sum payments and other similar payments received by a surviving dependant.
Honourable senators who are lawyers are
quite aware of the hardships created. One
other matter in connection with succession
duties is that of charitable bequests and
charitable donations made within three years
of the date of death, as well as unpaid subscriptions to charitable organizations.

Many

people feel that these should not be included
in arriving at the value of an estate for the
purpose of determining the initial rate of

duty.

In Ontario we used to have up to

eighteen months to pay succession duties, but
the period has now been reduced to six
months.
It is the same with respect to
dominion succession duties. With the diffi-

culties that arise today in the administration
of an estate, I know that all honourable
senators who are members of my profession
will agree when I say that six months is a

very short period. For instance, take an
estate at the present time which might be
holding large blocks of certain stock. What a
loss it would be to such an estate if this stock

had to be sold at the depressed market rate of
stock today.

As one who comes from a farming community I was interested in the reference to

farmers in the Speech from the Throne:
In order to assure to the farmers of Canada a
fair share of the national income, you will be
asked to enact a measure to provide stability
in the prices of their products. Every possible
effort is now being made, and will continue to be
made to seek new markets for agricultural products
as well as to regain those that have been lost.
Farming is such an important industry
in so many parts of Canada that any announcement or plan which will benefit the
farming community will be of great interest
throughout Canada. Everyone who is familiar

with the farm picture will readily admit that
for a long time the average Canadian farmer
has not been receiving his fair share of the
national income. Ail of us who were here
during the war years can recall very easily
the great contributions the farmers of Canada
made to our war effort, when the production
of food was greatly increased to meet the
needs of the armed forces. The farmers of
Canada increased production at a time when
labour was very scarce and new machinery
was almost impossible to obtain, and the
prices of their products were frozen. Certainly, during the war years the farmers of
Canada did not have a price tag on their
loyalty. As I said earlier, their prices were
set, while in industry the manufacturer
always had a profit, often on a cost-plus
basis. Since the war, the method of farming
has changed on the average small Canadian
farm. With new mechanized machinery the
farmer has had to expend a large sum of
money for new equipment. With the great
expansion in industry labour has been attracted to the city, with higher pay, shorter
working hours and all the other benefits
that are not available to the agricultural
worker. Today many farmers find themselves
in the position that they must operate farms
by themselves, with only the help available
of their own family. Everything in connection
with the operation of the farm has greatly
increased in cost. The cost of machinery has
increased, municipal taxes are much higher,

OCTOBER 22, 1957
labour costs are almost prohibitive-gas,
machine repairs, upkeep of buildings, feed,
combine and threshing costs, and interest
rates,-everything in connection within the
operation of the farm has increased in cost,
yet the price of farm produce has not increased in proportion to these rising costs.
We have seen that over the years large
quantities of cheese have been imported from
other Commonwealth countries, and until recently turkeys and fowl were imported at
prices against which our Canadian producers
could not compete. Enormous quantities of
canned vegetables, especially tomatoes and
tomato pulp, are carried across the Atlantic
and sold in Canada at prices against which
we cannot compete. The same applies to eggs
from Hong Kong. Action has already been
taken by the Government in reference to
the import of dry skim milk. Vegetable oils
enter Canada, in many cases, duty free, and
compete against our dairy products. We are
always ready to admit that when the farmer
is prosperous, when he receives a fair price
for his products, the country is also prosperous. Today the farmer has to reduce his
purchases in many fields for the very simple
reason that the price be receives for his
produce does not permit him to make these
purchases. So I think honourable senators
will agree that any effort to introduce legislation to lay the foundation for the stabilization of agricultural prices at reasonable
levels, taking into consideration market conditions and also the cost of production-and
I emphasize "the cost of production"-would
be most welcome to the Canadian farmer.
In the Speech from the Throne is a reference to the Beechwood project in New
Brunswick, the South Saskatchewan dam, and
the Columbia River, all having to do with
power. We who reside in Ontario have had
cheap hydro for so long that we naturally
take it for granted. I am sure that so far
as the Beechwood power plant is concerned,
cheaper power will do much to attract industry and be of great assistance to the economy
of the Atlantic provinces.
Another item in the Speech from the Throne
which very much interested me was the
reference to a meeting between the Dominion
Government and the provinces regarding
The allocation of
financial arrangements.
the tax dollar has been the subject of many
debates in the House of Commons, and no
doubt in this chamber, yet today in Ontario
we find the municipalities hard put to to
find the necessary funds to finance the services which the local municipalities must
supply, for after all the municipality has only
two sources of income-direct levy on real
estate, and whatever grant or sums are

received from the provincial Governmentand we find in practically every municipality a greater demand every year for water,
sewage and garbage services, hospitals,
schools, roads, sidewalks, bridges, and all
other services which come under a municipal
But in practically
council's jurisdiction.
every Ontario community today either a new
school is being built or plans are being made
for erection or enlargement of a school, as
well as for construction of new hospitals
and new roads, but the stumbling block is
where is the money to come from. Certainly,
I do not think anyone would advocate that
the present tax level or the present tax rate
on real estate in Ontario should be increased
beyond its present burden. Therefore, the
municipality can only look to the province for
extra funds, and many feel that the provinces
should have a larger share of the tax dollar.
I think we will all agree that the division of
the tax dollar is most complex, for the
federal Government bas heavy responsibilities and commitments.
The Speech from the Throne also referred
to a national development policy to be carried
out in cooperation with the provinces. I
mentioned earlier the huge development of
iron ore in Hastings county of the Bethlehem
Steel Corporation. This huge deposit of iron
ore, discovered as a result of a geological
survey by the province of Ontario, has resulted in an expenditure of well over $40
million to date, and the company employs
over 300 men. The Canadian National Railways, the Ontario Hydro-Electric Power Commission, and the federal Government, through
taxation, have all benefited greatly through
this one new mine, which has, in addition,
done much for the whole economy of the
county of Hastings. The same applies at Bancroft, in the county of Hastings, with its four
new uranium mines. In this one district expenditures of from $40 million to $50 million
have been made, creating hundreds of new
jobs, and involving new housing, schools,
shops, and everything else that goes into the
making of a new community. These are just
two incidents that have occurred in my own
county. What has happened in Hastings
county can also happen in many other counties, as far as the discovery of minerais is
concerned. That is why I think that anything
in the nature of a national development
policy, in conjunction with the provinces, will
certainly result in the discovery of much new
hidden wealth in our country.
Honourable senators, the majority of Canadians belong to two races, but in this
country we have Canadians from many other
races. Sometimes I feel that too often we
speak of the French race, the British race,
the Italian race, the Ukrainian race. Surely,

SENATE
after all, there is only one race in Canadathe Canadian race. We are all Canadians,
irrespective of our national origin. No matter
where we live in this large nation, we all
have the same problems, hopes and ambitions,
and may we always show our pride in being
just Canadian.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Léon Méthot: Honourable senators,
as a newcomer to the Senate and in order
to make myself better known, I feel bound
to remind you that I represent the city of
Three Rivers, my native town, and the adjoining ridings of St. Maurice and Champlain.
Three Rivers, everyone in this chamber
may not be aware, has its St. Maurice
and its Maurice.
The St. Maurice, this
magnificent river which falls tumultuously
over the Shawinigan Falls,-after which my
division is named,-produces the power
for the largest paper mills in the world, as
the Consolidated Paper, the Canadian International Paper and the St. Lawrence Paper
are all located in Three Rivers. It also supplies the power for one of Canada's largest
cotton companies, the Wabasso Company,
which is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary,
this year, and for many other industries which
are too numerous to be listed here. I would,
however, like to mention the Canadian Westinghouse Company, which settled in our
locality some months ago, barely two years
ago, I believe, and which has already doubled
the number of its employees.
The St. Maurice supplies power not only
to the city of Three Rivers and to the whole
surrounding district, but also to nearly all
the province of Quebec. Indeed, it is the
envy of several of our sister provinces which
are not endowed to the same extent with
such a precious resource.
Maurice, on the other hand, is the power
which, through his courage and hard work,
has already for many years managed to guide
the province of Quebec in the tremendous
strides it has made toward its economic
development.
Maurice and the St. Maurice also have
many other attributes and qualities of which
the people of Quebec are aware. But the main
qualification of the two is that they have both
succeeded in bringing light not only to the
larger centers but even to the remotest rural
parishes, to such an extent that our farmers
and our farmers' sons are now in a position
to see the true road, to find the right direction, and they proved it not so long ago.
Three Rivers, which had been silent in this
chamber since the death of the Honourable
Charles Bourgeois in 1940, may now, through

my feeble voice, make itself heard, thanks to
the trust that the Right Honourable John
Diefenbaker, our Prime Minister, has placed
in me.
Honourable senators, without further preamble, I will take on the role which was
entrusted to me and which, I shall not attempt to hide from you, moves me deeply.
May I first congratulate the honourable
senator from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr.
White) upon the splendid summary he has
given us of the Speech from the Throne.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Méthot: Clearly and eloquently,
he explained to us the subject-matter of the
Speech from the Throne which touches on
the most important aspects of our national
position and even of the international
situation.
The voters of the riding which had chosen
him to speak on their behalf in the House of
Commons will immediately realize that he
will now play just as effective a part for the
welfare of their district and of Canada as a
whole.
I should also like to take this occasion, Mr.
Speaker, to congratulate you most heartily
upon your appointment to the high and
honourable position you occupy and which,
during the impressive and important events
which have just taken place, you have filled
with such distinction.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Méthot: I have, for quite some
time, been in a position to appreciate your
talents, but I think you are unaware of a
detail which I will take the liberty of revealing to this chamber.
At the very beginning of my legal studies
in Three Rivers, one of the judges of our district, Hon. F. X. Drouin, did me the great
honour of inviting me to become his private
secretary. For two years, I had the advantage
of knowing him intimately, I benefited from
his advice and lessons, and I was given the
opportunity of appreciating his deep knowledge and his nobility of character. That is
why, Mr. Speaker, I was not surprised last
week to see his grandson represent us before
the Queen with such dignity.
May I now express to the Prime Minister
my deepest gratitude for having invited me
to sit in this house and to contribute as best
I can to the work which he proposes to
accomplish.

OCTOBER 22, 1957
In 1859, nearly a century ago, the man who
later became one of the greatest leaders of
the Conservative party, Sir George Etienne
Cartier, suggested that Queen Victoria be
invited to the opening of our Parliament.
The invitation was approved by the Legislative Council and the Legislative Assembly
of Upper and Lower Canada but, for reasons
unknown to me, the Queen had to decline it
and was represented by the Prince of Wales,
who subsequently became our Sovereign
under the name of Edward VII.
After almost one hundred years, Providence
decreed that one of his worthiest successors
should have the great honour of implementing the proposal, and we who admired him are
very proud of it.
All those who were fortunate enough to
be present at the awe-inspiring ceremonies of
last week, all the citizens who had the
pleasure of seeing the Queen of Canada on
television, all those who heard her speak over
the radio to all her subjects of the Kingdom
of Canada, are still under the spell of the
emotion which they felt and are anxious to
honour her.
The Right Honourable the Prime Minister
silenced all who might have been tempted to
claim that royalty would put an end to our
political liberty. He rendered great service
to the Crown and surely contributed to
enhance the prestige and the stature of our
Queen.
Notwithstanding those who claim to be
the only saviours of our national unity and
who, even now, accuse the Conservative party
of endangering it, the Right Honourable John
Diefenbaker bas proved that he is the true
champion and defender of that unity.
What he did upon the opening of this
session would be reason enough to justify
his presence at the head of our Government.
But this is not all, honourable senators.
As was indicated in the Speech from the
Throne, the Right Honourable the Prime
Minister had barely taken over his duties
when he met with the other Commonwealth
Prime Ministers in London; a short while
later he himself represented our country at
the United Nations and on two occasions
showed that he was a true statesman.
In the national field, the Speech from the
Throne proposed legislation which, when
applied, will greatly contribute to the
security and happiness of all our fellow
citizens and largely rernove certain inequities
which our predecessors had too long allowed
to remain.

The farmers of my province have already
benefited by his advent to power and, since
August 24, 1957, those of my district have
obtained a better price for their chief product.
It is said that the life of a nation, just as
the life of an individual, is made up of
details, habits, even prejudices, and of
unimportant incidents accumulated over a
period of years and that, in politics, all of
them must be taken into consideration.
The Prime Minister masters anything that
can be learned with the help of memory
He
or understood through reasoning.
immediately grasps everything and remembers it all; that is probably the true explanation of everything he has been able to
accomplish since coming into power.
Although this is the first time I have had
the advantage, not only of participating in,
but even of attending, a meeting of the Senate,
politics has for a number of years been one
of my chief concerns.
What I have read in various newspapers
and periodicals concerning the speeches delivered by you who represented, and still
represent, a majority in this house, has taught
me to appreciate your disinterestedness, your
wisdom and even your impartiality.
I therefore trust that you will join with us
in supporting without hesitation the Government bills that come before us.
Evidently, we are only a small minority
here. As far as I am concerned, I am without
experience or any special qualifications. Our
strength, however, lies in the fact that we
have a leader like the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Haig), whose ability and
eloquence were already known to me. Such
a chief, such a general...
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Métho: . . . is worth a whole

regiment, and I am confident that under his
leadership
we
will
overcome
many
difficulties.
(Text):
If you were tempted to minimize the
capacity of our leader, may I remind you
that he has a deputy leader (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) who is a sharpshooter, a first-rate
marksman. I had the privilege of learning,
at the beginning of this session, of his
ability to shoot ten to fifteen ducks in a
row. May I add that these two leaders are,
first of all, men of mark.

SENATE

(Translation):
Convinced of the real value of the legislation we will be called upon to judge, and
sustained by two such leaders, it is with confidence that I second the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne.
(Text):
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
debate was adjourned.
STANDING COMMITTEES
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF SELECTION
ADOPTED
The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the report of the Committee of Selection.
which was presented on October 15.
Hon. Mr. Aselline moved that the report
be adopted.
Hon. Jean-Francois Pouliot: Honourable
senators, before this report is adopted I must
express regret that membership of the committees is the same as it was previously. I
say that in the hope that some day the
membership of many committees will be
reduced.
Now that there are more members on this
side of the house I do not agree that in the
first place the Leader of the Opposition
should be ex-officio a member of all the committees. He cannot give enough time to that
duty. That procedure dates back to the
time when the Leader of the Government
and the Leader of the Opposition in the
Senate were two gladiators. I refer to the
Right Honourable Senator Dandurand and
the Right Honourable Senator Meighen. The
former thought that he embodied the Liberal
party, and I say that with all due respect
to his memory because I had great admiration for him. The other gentleman thought
that he embodied the whole Conservative
party.
I know that Senator Dandurand
rose at 5 o'clock in the morning, and Senator
Meighen was a hard worker too. Those two

gentlemen did all the work of the Senate
and gave no opportunity to their colleagues
to share in that work-I say that in the
friendliest manner.
So the procedure in
the Senate was changed by those gentlemen,
the memory of whom still lives. I am very
glad to see that in the Senate there is a

bust of the late Senator Dandurand, and I
hope that in the future we will have also
a bust of the Right Honourable Mr. Meighen.
Now, honourable senators, last year I and
other members of the Senate asked for some
improvement in the Senate. The changes
were made by one of these committees. I

appreciate the interest that all the honourable
senators have taken in improving the physical
appearance of the Senate and in the first
place I say that to the honourable gentlemen
who are welcome here and say that they are
an asset to this chamber. We will have
another opportunity to say something good
of them. I must tell them that when we
older senators were appointed to this group
it seemed to us that there was no light in
this chamber. The light was so poor that it
was impossible to read Hansard. It has now
been discovered that, by using stronger
bulbs, we can have more light, and conditions
for reading are better than they were.
In the second place, it was almost impossible to hear anyone speaking in this
chamber, because the acoustics were bad. I
hope that in the near future some gadgets
will be installed that will give us the opportunity of not missing a word of our colleagues
who tell us secrets when they deliver
speeches here.
Also I remember very well that the

honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig) suggested. when he was Leader
of the Opposition, that the house needed
better ventilation. In this connection one of
my friends in the press gallery came to see
me for an interview, and put in my mouth
something I never said, namely, that honourable senators were asleep during debates. I
never said that in my life: on the contrary,
I told him that the air was so thick and so
heavy that each senator had to make a superhuman effort to stay awake, not because of
the dullness of the speeches, for the speeches
were very interesting, but because there
wvas next to no ventilation. I congratulate the
honourable Leader of the Government upon
his suggestion of a better ventilating system.
Further, I recall that a certain honourable
senator complained of the dirty condition of
the Senate walls. It is to the credit of the
committee which was headed by the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) and so ably seconded by the

honourable senator from Ottawa West (Hon.
Mr. Connolly) that so great an improvement
has been made.

Honourable senators who were appointed
this year will have noticed the appearance
of this chamber when Her Majesty read the

Speech from the Throne. These honourable
junior senators, if I may so term our newer
colleagues, would have been shocked had
they seen the rug which has now been

replaced.

It was 35 years old and full of

holes.

would seem that what finally de-

It

cided some honourable senators to consent
to the purchase of a new rug was the possibility that some members of Her Majesty's

OCTOBER 22, 1957
entourage might trip and fall over the holes
in the old rug. So we got a new and splendid
one, the one we now have.
It required foresight to ask for the cleaning of the walls and the panels, better light,
improved acoustics, and a new carpet. These
things came just in time; for every honourable senator would have been ashamed to
have had Her Majesty attend the opening of
the Senate in its former condition.
Some of our colleagues have suggested
the building of new galleries, and a subcommittee has been set up to consider this
matter. With respect to the repairs which
have been made I must pay a special tribute
to the late Government, and especially to the
former Minister of Public Works, the
Honourable Robert Winters, who considered
favourably all the suggestions which were
made to him by the subcommittee which
dealt with this subject.
I have spoken of suggestions made by
several members to improve the physical
appearance of the Senate, but there is something else which is very important, and
which I draw to the attention of new
senators whose support in this matter I hope
to have in due course. It is directed to the
spiritual reform of the Senate. I am not
now commenting on the Speech from the
Throne: that may come later. What I am
now going to say is that no government in
the world can reform the Senate; that is
something which must be done by honourable
senators themselves, and it can be done in
only one way, namely by amending our
rules. Those rules were made thirty years
ago, which means they are nearly as antiquated as the worn-out rug. They must be
reformed. We have to distribute the work
of the Senate in such a manner that each
honourable senator is given an opportunity
to share in the work of this body and to
give to it the full measure of his capacities.
It is a very simple problem, and one way to
deal with it is to make good use of a rule
which concerns the Committee of the Whole.
Although I have not been a member of this
honourable body for very long, I have deeply
lamented that, in spite of the provision in the
standing orders, all legislation is not brought
before the Committee of the Whole. My
reason for insisting that this course should
be followed is that each honourable senator
is a member of the Committee of the Whole,
and the Leader of the Government has the
opportunity of inviting any member of the
cabinet who sponsors a piece of legislation
in the other house to come here and explain
it, thus giving an opportunity to all honourable senators to ask questions of the Leader
of the Government and his cabinet colleague who introduced the bill in the other

chamber. Another advantage is that all the
discussions between honourable senators and
any cabinet minister who, by special privilege, sits with us are recorded in Hansard.
Now, why was the Narcotic Control Bill
referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce at the last session?
Was it because those who indulge in the
traffic of those drugs make so much money
that they have big bank accounts? I object
to such bills being sent to that committee.
It was agreed between the leaders thirty
years ago that we should have as few
meetings as possible of the Committee of the
Whole, and that nearly every bill should be
sent to the Banking and Commerce Committee.
I have an inquiry on the Order Paper
which I hope will be answered in the near
future. I want to know how many meetings
our various committees have held during
each of the last ten sessions. I will draw
the attention of honourable senators to the
answer that will come in due course and
they will see that several committees have
not sat at all. I remember when I was in
the House of Commons I was chairman of a
special Parliamentary Committee on Civil
Service. That committee had some very
well-informed members on it. One of them
later became Minister of Public Works and
is now serving on the Bench of the Exchequer Court. I think there should be a
permanent Committee on Civil Service in the
Why? To prevent
House of Commons.
favouritism and to give an opportunity to
each civil servant to place his grievances
before Parliament and under the protection
of Parliament. This would give all the rank
and file of civil servants protection against
the despotism of some bureaucratic chiefs or
assistant chiefs. This idea has never been
accepted.
In any event the Senate Committee on
Civil Service Administration has not been
sitting for many years, even though there
have been changes in the Civil Service Commission. It is an internal committee that
deals with civil service positions. That is an
absurdity. I hope that the Senate Committee
on Civil Service Administration will be raised
from its ashes and used for the protection of
civil servants. This is my hope. I have
nothing to say about the new board of the
civil service because I do not know its members, but having been a member of the
House of Commons for a very long time I do
know that one of the most helpful gentlemen
in the civil service was Mr. Stanley G.
Nelson, former Chairman of the Civil Service
Commission. Why do I say that? It is
because he was endowed with that quality

SENATE
which is admired even in judges. He was
fair. He was just. He had good judgment.
And he can be held up as a model administrator to all those who come after him in
that high office.
I could say much about the memberships
of the various committees to be established,
but I will only say one thing now. There are
eight vacancies to be filled in the Senate.
But there are really other vacancies, and
honourable senators know about them. I
refer to vacancies created by the absence
from the Senate of honourable members who
come here for the opening or for prorogation
of Parliament. When Her Majesty opened
Parliament last week I noticed one of our
colleagues, a man whom I meet very often
on the street, who was in this chamber for
the first time in two years. He came to save
his seat. There are others who come for
short visits. They may have good reasons.
I do not ask for any sanction against them
but I do not see why their names are kept
on the membership lists of active committees.
I do not make these comments to be hard
or unpleasant, but it seems to me there are
members of this house who have not got a
proper sense of proportion. Some people are
sentimental enough to say of them: "Well,
they are unfortunate. They came here once
but they could not come again for some
reason." They should try to follow the good
example set by the honourable senator from
St. Albert (Hon. Mr. Blais), who comes here
on crutches and is very assiduous in his
Senate duties. Others could do the same, and
if some cannot come the thing to do is to
strike their names from the committee lists.
It would not hurt them and it would relieve
their consciences. I presurne that when they
are away from the Senate they are still
interested in our proceedings. They cannot
forget us and they may say, "I wonder how
such and such a committee is doing today?"
Well, if their names were stricken from the
lists of the committees in a gentle manner
they would not have that worry.
Honourable senators, I hope you will consider these remarks in the same spirit that
I have made them, not to cause trouble to
anyone but to improve the efficiency of the
Senate. I said last week that I had the highest
regard for all honourable senators, including our unseen colleagues. I do have the
highest regard for you, but I want the Senate
to give the full measure of its efficiency, and
that is why I hope you will give favourable
consideration to my suggestion to improve the
standard of the Senate by distributing the
work as evenly as possible between all our
honourable colleagues.

NARCOTIC CONTROL BILL
INQUIRY

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I would like to direct a question to the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig). Would ho be good enough to find
out and report later, if ho has not the information now, what is the intention of the
Government with regard to the Narcotic Control Bill which passed this house after a
report by a Senate committee?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall make inquiries.
APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 6
THIRD READING

Hon. John T. Haig moved the third reading
of Bill 11, for granting Her Majesty certain
sums of money for the public service of the
financial year ending the 31st March, 1958.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I have read with much attention what the
Minister of Finance said in the other place,
and I think it is quite clear that this bill is
simply an interim bill, leaving open onetwelfth of all the items of the estimatesthe main estimates, supplementary estimates,
and further supplementary estimates which
have been flled since the opening of the session. Therefore every department of state
romains open to inspection and discussion for
one-twelfth of the budget and estimates and
supplementary estimates for the year ending
the 31st March, 1958. Of course this procedure is somewhat unusual, but under the
circumstances it is quite satisfactory to me.

OCTOBER 23, 1957
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators, it
is not my intention to ask any further questions of the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig), but I wish to make
a few observations of a somewhat general
character, and to suggest to him that the new
administration should take under serious
consideration these matters of supplementary
estimates. When I first came to Parliament
the traditional practice year by year was
that in the main estimates the Government
laid before Parliament its requirements for
the coming year, and supplementary estimates were confined wholly to some new
circumstance that might arise which could
not have been foreseen when the regular
estimates were prepared and submitted to
Parliament. In the present year we have had
three groups of supplementary estimates. The
first lot was submitted by the old administration, and then before Parliament prorogued
a further lot of supplementary estimates
were submitted. Now we are meeting in a
new session under a new administration and
we find further supplementary estimates submitted for our consideration. The total of
these various supplementary estimates submitted to Parliament is almost $200 million.
It is worth recalling that in 1939, before the
war, the total supply asked of Parliament was
around $550 million. So that already we are
coming near the point where we are asking
for supplementaries equal to almost half of
that sum.
I would suggest that when the estimates
for 1959 are under consideration by the Government, as they will be very shortly if indeed
they are not now, the Minister of Finance
should make a new departure. I am quite
free to say that this habit of asking for
supplementaries after supplementaries was,
in a measure, a product of the methods that
developed during the war. But we should
get back to more solid ground. The Leader
of the Government is a member of the administration, and I warmly congratulate him
on that fact. I hope be will take under
consideration, and possibly pass on to his colleague the Minister of Finance, this suggestion. Let the Minister of Finance serve
notice on the departments that they must
present in the main estimates the estimates
of their total requirements for the next fiscal
year, and that the supplementary estimates
-and in each session there should not be
more than one bill for supplementary estimates-should be confined to those unforeseeable things which arise subsequently to
the presentation of the main estimates. I
offer this suggestion because we are growing
into a very loose habit in connection with
the handling of the taxpayers' money.
96702-3

As the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) suggested last night,
some of the items in the supplementaries
submitted to Parliament by the new Government are consequent upon new developments;
but more than half of the eighty-odd million
dollars comes from various departments. If
you look over these series of supplementary
estimates you will find some of the departments asking for more money in each of the
supplementaries. Well, that to me is a very
slipshod habit to fall into. I can understand
the new administration's position, and I am
willing to make very large allowances for it.
After all, the ministers are new to their jobs
and it is the most natural thing in the
world-and I think my honourable colleague
from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) would agree
with me in this-that the officials in the
departments will press for more money if
they think there is a chance of getting it.
I can understand how under these circumstances departmental officials will go to their
new minister and say, "Well, now, here are
things we must do and we want you to ask
for a supplementary estimate." I can give
you a few illustrations. Take the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation, for which the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon.
Mr. Reid) has a great affection.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You can say that again.
Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Their request in the main
estimates, of which we are voting a portion
in this supply bill, was for a total of
$34,250,000. That was for the C.B.C. radio and
television services. Then the international
services asked for over $1,800,000, or a total
in the main estimates, as can be seen if you
examine them, of over $36 million. Well,
honourable senators, $36 million is a substantial sum of money. At least it used to be
considered so. We find in these supplementaries brought down by the new administration that they are asking for another
$8,155,000, or a total for this fiscal year for the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation of over
$44* million. Now, where is this going to
end? I am not asking questions about it
today but I am drawing to the attention of
honourable senators that this practice surely
must find some limit.
The only other item I wish to refer toand I could cite a score of other items if I
wished to do so-is that of National Health
and Welfare benefits, under the heading of
Indian and Eskimo Health. In Vote 261, which
was in the main estimates, the total asked for
was over $17 million; and in the supplementary estimates, in Vote 709, we are asked
to supply an additional $1,600,000, or a total
for Indian and Eskimo health services of

SENATE

over $18, million. I draw to the attention of
honourable senators the fact that this does
not include other services like educational
services, assistance in farming operations, and
that sort of thing, for our Indian population.
I am uncertain at the moment just what
the exact Indian and Eskimo population of
Canada is, but I think I am within the margin
of safety by saying that it does not exceed
170,000. So what we are in effect doing in
these votes is to provide for Indian and
Eskimo health services over $100 for every
Indian and Eskimo man, woman and child
in Canada. That is a very high average. At
present I am merely drawing attention to
these things, and I may have something
further to say upon them if I should launch
into a speech on the Address. The growth
of our expenditures should be given sober
thought by every member of Parliament,
whether of this house or the other house;
because there is not only a growth of expenditure by our federal Government, but
also ever mounting expenditure by provincial
and municipal Governments, and the combined total sum is very large indeed. I know
there are economists who say: "Oh, we can
handle this. We are for ever going to be on
the up and up; we are for ever going to have
an expanding gross national product and an
expanding national net income." Well,
honourable senators, the present time affords
some evidence that our expectation in that
respect may be built upon a rather shadowy
foundation.
I will close by simply saying that there is
no greater responsible duty on members of
Parliament than to see that the taxpayers'
money is wisely spent and none of it wasted.
There can be no dispute about that. In the
great surge forward, in the new conception
of the welfare state, and in other directions,
we go on spending, spending, spending, without serious thought as to what the consequences to the taxpayer may be.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion for the third
reading of Bill 11. Is it your pleasure to pass
this motion?
Hon. Mr. Reid: On division. I was supposed
to get some information.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed, on division.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of Her Majesty the Queen's speech
at the opening of the session and the motion

of Hon. Mr. White, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Méthot, for an Address in reply thereto.
Honourable
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald:
senators,Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I cannot let this
occasion pass without stating at the very
outset how happy we all were to welcome
to Canada our Queen, Elizabeth the Second,
and His Royal Highness the Prince Philip,
the Duke of Edinburgh. It was not possible for
Her Majesty to visit any other city in Canada
than our national capital, but I am sure
that all Canadians from coast to coast felt
they were having some part in expressing
to their Queen the deep loyalty, respect and
affection which we all have for her.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
those of us who were in this chamber will
never forget the colourful scene when for
the first time a reigning sovereign was
present in person to open our Parliament.
It was a circumstance of deep significance
and an historic occasion for all Canadians.
It had been my intention to speak at length
in connection with this great historical event,
but last night I felt that the two honourable
senators who moved and seconded the
Address expressed our feelings adequately
and exceptionally well. Therefore, I shall
only add that I concur in all that they said
in that respect.
Honourable senators, as the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot) mentioned last night, I am sure
that we were all pleased with the physical
appearance of the Senate chamber on the
day of the opening. It will be recalled that
prior to the close of the last session we
supervise
subcommittee to
appointed a
alterations and additions to the Senate
chamber, and the Senate agreed on what
alterations and additions could be made.
Perhaps I could not do better at this time
than give an account of the stewardship of
that committee. The subcommittee consisted
of myself, as chairman, the Honourable
Senator Connolly (Ottawa West) and the
Honourable Senator Dessureault. We commenced our duties even before Parliament
was dissolved, and the work was well in
process by June 10. Notwithstanding the
change in the administration that took place
after that date, the subcornmittee felt it
should continue to function. I was at that
time chairman of the Internal Economy Committee, and I continued to act in that capacity
until Parliament reassembled. I could not
do otherwise because, as you know, the new
Leader of the Government was not appointed
until a short time before the session opened.

OCTOBER 23, 1957
The subcommittee held meetings from time
to time. The work did not go on by itself.
The Honourable Senator Connolly (Ottawa
West), who was in this city most of the
time, kept his eye on the work from week
to week, and we consulted with the Honourable Senator Dessureault. We were fortunate
in having the assistance of Mr. MacNeill, the
Clerk of this House, who was here almost
every day, and when the work lagged he
urged the representatives of the Department
of Public Works who were responsible for
the work to press on toward its completion.
The result was that when Parliament reconvened on October 14 most of the work had
been completed.
This work could perhaps be divided into
three categories: in the first category I
would put the cleaning of the walls and
woodwork. As the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye said last evening, prior to
this session both walls and woodwork were
very dark, and in some places black. One
can readily see the improvement that has
taken place.
I now come to the second category.
Honourable senators will recall that the
carpeting in the chamber had been in service
for many years and had become badly worn.
I am sure all honourable senators were
pleased, as I was, with the appearance of the
new carpet on the opening day of Parliament.
It will also be recalled that the windows
in the upper part of the chamber were of a
not too pleasing colour, and did not provide
the proper amount of illumination. The
windows have all been changed. Whether
the change
is satisfactory, honourable
senators will have to decide. When the
windows were first put in, your subcommittee felt that too much direct light was
allowed to enter the chamber, and that it
would be uncomfortable for honourable
senators sitting on the east side of the house
to have the sunlight shining down on them.
Various proposals were made as to how to
keep the direct rays of the sun out and yet
allow more light in. Time will tell whether
the change is satisfactory. I am sure the
new Internal Economy Committee which
has been set up will make observations and
determine whether or not the windows can
be further improved.
I come now to the question of ventilation
of the chamber. Again, as the honourable
gentleman said last evening, it was most uncomfortable to sit in this chamber on hot
summer days; the air became so stuffy and
stagnant when the chamber was occupied
for any length of time that it prevented us
from doing our work properly. A conpletely new system of ventilation has now
been installed. During the last session some
96702-3j

honourable senators could not remain in the
chamber because of the direct drafts on them.
We hope that condition has been overcome.
The present system has been so devised
that there will be fresh air in the Senate at
all times, warm air in the winter and cool
air in the summer, but with no direct drafts
being felt by honourable senators.
The subcommittee was requested to inquire
into the possibility of installing what I call
a voice amplification system in the chamber.
The system that is in use today is the one
which was approved by honourable senators
at the last session, and the installation was
supervised by your subcommittee. It will be
recalled that we met in the chamber last
spring and had a demonstration of the voice
amplification system. We all agreed that
the system tried out then appeared to be
satisfactory and that it should be installed.
The subcommittee carried out the wishes of
the house in that respect. The system was
tried out during an actual sitting for the
first time last evening. A number of the
senators who spoke to me about it were
somewhat disappointed with its operation.
Some senators sitting at the south end of the
chamber complained that they could not hear
the honourable senator from De la Durantaye
speaking from his seat at the north end of
the chamber. We have an operator on hand
in the southeast corner of the south gallery
and he is endeavouring to manipulate the
mechanism so that speakers can be heard
at any point in the chamber. So, before we
criticize the system too severely, I think we
should give the operator a chance to demonstrate the fuctioning of the equipment that
has been installed.
While there have been, as I have said, complaints from honourable senators about the
amplification system, I have heard no
criticism of it by people sitting in the galhery. I recall that previous to this session
when representatives of the press wanted to
hear a senator who was speaking from the
east side of the chamber they had to move
to the east side of the gallery; and if a
senator rose to speak on the west side of
the chamber they had to rush back to that
side. Also, at times when I have remarked
to people who have been sitting in the galhery about the excellence of an address made
in the house the previous day they have
replied that they had not heard a word of it.
Well, even if the system is not yet entirely
satisfactory in the chamber-and this is the
important place-it is quite satisfactory in
the galleries.
Honourable senators, your subcommittee
also took up the question of lighting in the
chamber. This I put in the third category

our efforts have been entirely sucessful. The

officials did not entirely approve of the
equipment which was suggested for installation. Our lighting has been improved somewhat, but I am sure honourable senators feel
that there can be further improvement in it.
Honourable senators, two other questions
were left, not for the subcommittee but, I
think, for senators generally-two questions
which have been raised in the Senate. One
of these, raised by the honourable senator
from De la Durantaye, has to do with the
Some
paintings hanging on the walls.
honourable senators feel that the paintings
are quite appropriate; others feel that there
should be a change. Some think we should
have Canadian murais on the walls. Weil,
honourable senators, the making of that
change would present a difficult problem.
Those walls have been prepared in such a
way that they assist favourably the acoustical
properties of this chamber, and we would
need to have expert advice as to what effect
the change would have on the acoustics. That
is something for honourable members to consider in the future.
The question of an additional gallery was
also mentioned. It was said during the royal
visit that it would have been much more
satisfactory if it had been possible for many
more Canadians to be in the Senate chamber
on that occasion. But more people could
have been seated here only if we had had an
additional gallery. Well, an additional gallery
would involve a structural change which
would be very costly, and one which would
have to be undertaken, I am sure, by the
Government, as the appropriations of the
Senate itself do not provide sufficient funds
to make so extensive an improvement.
Honourable senators, that is the report of
your committee. We feel that we did look
after the task that was given to us, and,
generally speaking, I think the Senate chamber is a much more attractive place today
than it was severai years ago.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Now, honourable senators, while I am speaking about this chamber
on the opening day I want to refer to one
official of the chamber who had a very important part to play. I have in mind the
Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod. It was
his responsibility to arrange the seating in
this chamber and to send out the invitations.
What a task he had! There were thousands
of applications for seats. Many people asked
me if I could arrange for their accommodation
in this chamber and invariably I referred
them to the Black Rod; and some of them

later showed me the letter they received
from him, saying, as politely as any one
could say it, that it was impossible to arrange
places for them. I never heard a complaint
from a single applicant after the receipt of
that courteous reply from the Black Rod.
And I am sure that at the opening of Parliament we were ahl pleased by the way in
which he performed his very important function as the personal messenger of Her Majesty
from this chamber to the other chamber. No
one could fail to observe the fine impression
he created by his gracious manner and his
stately bearing.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I would also like to refer to another official
of the Senate. I have in my hand an excellent booklet, entitled How Parliament Works.
A number of prominent, well-informed members of ail the parties represented in this
Parliament have spoken to me about this
booklet and that is why I mention it. In
every instance they say it is the best publication of its kind in Canada. It was written
by E. Russell Hopkins, Law Clerk and Parliamentary Counsel of the Senate. I take
pride in the fact that it was prepared by one
of our officials, and I heartily recommend it
to ail honourable senators. I feel certain
that when you read it you will be pleased
with it and will want to obtain a number of
copies to send to your friends.
Honourable senators, I have spoken of
the opening of Parliament on October 14, and
I would like to refer briefly to another event
which took place prior to that date. I mean
the General Election of June 10. Many
changes have resulted from what took place
on that day. One, which is very noticeable,
is that those of us who formerly were sitting
on the right of the Speaker are now sitting
on his left, and those who are sitting on his
right were previously on his left. Probably
that is the most notable change which has
taken place since we last met.
I want to take this opportunity of saying
that, if there had to be a change in the
person who was to occupy the position of
Leader of the Government in the Senate, no
more appropriate appointment could have
been made than that of the present Leader
of the Government in this chamber (Hon.
Mr. Haig).
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He is a man of wide
experience in business, learned in the laws of
our land, and with a broad knowledge of
legislative affairs. For sixteen years before
he came to Ottawa he was a member of the
Manitoba Legislature, and he has been in the
Senate twenty-two years. While in opposition he was a good Leader of the Opposition,

OCTOBER 23, 1957
and I am sure he will make a good Leader
of the Government. I want to thank him
for the co-operation he gave me during the
time that I was honoured to hold the position he now occupies. No one could have
co-operated with any leader more wholeheartedly than did Senator Haig.
I would
like to wish him a long term in the office he
now holds, but if I did so I would be wishing
for myself a long term as Leader of the Opposition, and I cannot say that I desire that
role for myself. So I will content myself by
saying that I hope his term will be a happy
and profitable one for himself, for this house,
and for the country.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: With a new Parliament a change has also been brought about
in the Speakership of this house.
(Translation):
Honourable senators, I would like to welcome our new Speaker, the Honourable Mark
Robert Drouin. You have become, sir, the successor of a long list of distinguished Canadians
who have occupied the Chair, three of whom
are with us today: Hon. Arthur Hardy, who
was Speaker in 1930; Hon. Thomas Vien,
who was Speaker from 1943 to 1945, and your
immediate predecessor, Hon. Wishart McLea
Robertson, who was Speaker from 1953 to
1957. I congratulate you upon your appointment. As were those who came before you,
you are particularly well qualified to fulfil
the difficult duties of Speaker of the Senate,
and I can assure you that you may count
upon the full co-operation of all the members of this house. And when your term of
office expires I hope Providence will keep
you in good health so that you may remain
among us, as a senator, for many years to
come.
(Text):
I wish also at this time to express my
personal warm welcome to the new senators,
most of whom, though not all, were unknown
to me. I know I speak on behalf of all
honourable senators when I say to them:
"We are glad to have you in our midst. We
look forward to years of association with you.
We are sure you will enjoy the years during
which you serve in this chamber, and we
know that you will be of service to Parliament and to your country. I am pleased to
welcome you here."
Also I would express my congratulations
and appreciation to the mover and seconder
of the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne. The honourable senator from
Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White), who
moved the Address, is one of my very good
friends. We sat together in the House of
Commons from 1940 to 1953. I got there a
little earlier than the honourable senator

did, but he stayed there longer; now he has
caught up with me again. I have heard his
utterances on many occasions in the House of
Commons. I know of his great interest in
the welfare and wellbeing of the veterans
of our country. His speech last evening
made it evident that his interest in their welfare has not slackened over the years. As
an old parliamentarian he followed the
Speech from the Throne with great care, and
in bis first address he dealt with it thoroughly
and proved to us that he bas a good knowledge of the legislation which will come before us. I congratulate him heartily on his
speech.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
(Translation):
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I wish to congratulate
the honourable senator from Shawinigan
(Hon. Mr. Méthot) upon his maiden speech
before this honourable bouse. He was already
known to several of the senators and recognized as a distinguished lawyer. He spoke to
us of the great St. Maurice river which flows
through an important area of the province of
Quebec. He will no doubt address us again
over the many years we hope he will spend
among us.
(Text):
Honourable senators, an event took place
in this house last night which went by
unnoticed by many honourable members. A
reporter sat at the desk beside our regular
and very capable French shorthand reporter,
Mr. Victor Lemire, and if honourable
senators were looking at that desk during
the speech of the honourable senator from
Shawinigan (Hon. Mr. Méthot) they would
have observed that the speech was being
taken down on a stenotype machine. The
machine could not be heard, it was completely silent. The use of this machine was
something new in the Parliament of Canada.
it having never before been used in either
bouse at Ottawa.
I think this incident
provides a further answer to anyone who
says that the Senate is old-fashioned.
Honourable senators, I am gradually
approaching a very important portion of my
address, and I assure you my remarks will
not be long. I do not think I should let the
reference which I made to the change which
took place on June 10 go by without further
word. There is a new government and I
hope it will be a good one. I am satisfied that
the former Government was a very good one.
It had been in power for twenty-two years,
and I can say they were twenty-two glorious
years.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They will be
described as golden years in the history of
our country.

SENATE

Let me recall just two of the changes
which took place during that period. In
1935 Canada had a population of 10,845,000
people. In 1957, after that Government had
been in power for twenty-two years, Canada
had a population of 16,589,000 persons. During that period while our population was
growing we enjoyed great prosperity and our
standard of living and general well-being was
raised. Our total trade also experienced a
terrifie increase. On March 31, 1934, our
our
and
$522,431,153
imports totalled
exports $764,284,888, and our total imports
and exports for the fiscal year ending March
By
31, 1934, amounted to $1,286,716,041.
March 31, 1957, our imports had increased
to $5,792,549,000, and our exports to
$4,930,787,000, a total of $10,723,336,000. Putting it in round figures I would say that
from the time the old administration came
into power, in 1935, our total trade had increased from $1,286,000,000 to $10,700,000,000,
a staggering increase.
Honourable senators, we had great problems during those times, the most serious
arising from World War Il and its aftermath.
During all that time the Government had the
support and the co-operation of the people
of Canada and we came through all right.
We came through the war well and we came
through its aftermath well. I am sure no
one would deny that in the person of the
Right Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King and
in the person of the Right Honourable Louis
S. St. Laurent we had two great leaders. I
think, honourable senators, that the millions
of people who supported the Government
that went out of office can feel proud of the
accomplishments which came about during
the years in which that Government was in
power, and of the leadership given to Canada
during that time. We can only hope that the
future of this country will be in as good
hands, and that we shall continue to go
forward in the future as we have in the past.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I now proceed to the conclusion of my
remarks? I should like to make a statement
which I feel is a very important one. I am
sure that this house and the country would
wish me to indicate at this time the attitude
which I, as the Leader of Her Majesty's
loyal Opposition in the Senate, propose to take
with respect to public legislation, particularly Government legislation, during this
Parliament.
The circumstances in which those of us
who are in opposition find ourselves are
unusual but far from unique. I am confident
that in approaching our parliamentary duties
we shall have greater regard for the wisdom
and experience of the past, and for the effect
which our actions may have on future gene-

rations of Canadians, than for any exigencies, political or otherwise, of the present.
We shall take the long view, backward as
well as forward. Some may say that we can
well afford to do so. I would prefer to say
that this is our historie duty and that we
shall do our best to discharge it.
May I be permitted to add, as an aside
and in a somewhat lighter vein, that most
things must grow into perfection. That is as
truc of this young and virile country and
its system of government as it is of anything
else. Mr. Borglum, the celebrated sculptor
who fashioned the famous Mount Rushmore
Memorial in the United States, was once
asked if his work was perfect in every detail.
He replied: "Not today. The nose of George
Washington is one inch too long. But it's
better that way. By the process of erosion
it will be exactly right in 10,000 years."
To return to my main theme: Honourable
senators, in view of our numbers, it will be
immediately apparent that we could, under
the Constitution, resist and, indeed, prevent,
the adoption of every piece of legislation
initiated by the new Government. On the
other hand, we could allow that legislation
to proceed through this house without comment or criticism. I feel sure that we will
follow neither of these extreme courses.
There are historie considerations which
would dissuade us from adopting either
alternative, and which I devoutly hope would
similarly dissuade others who, in the future,
might find themselves in a comparable
position.
In the first place, the Senate was not conceived of by the authors of Confederationwho "builded better than they knew"-as a
competitor of the House of Commons in the
field of public legislation. On the contrary,
one of its prime functions, in the words of Sir
John A. Macdonald, is to take a "sober second
look" at legislation which has passed the
House of Commons. It is therefore a solemn
trust, which all senators share alike, to examine with the utmost care all legislation which
has passed the House of Commons. This we
must do to ensure that those basic principles
which all Canadians hold dear are not lightly
or carelessly cast aside for any reason,
whether through haste or impulse on the part
of the House of Commons, or as a result of
political expediency or compromise, or otherwise.
On the other hand, we recognize with Sir
Robert Borden that any system of government based upon the British system could
not function long if the executive and each
of the houses of Parliament were to exercise
their powers constantly and "to the legal
limit". There should be, of course, common
sense in all things, and certainly in respect

OCTOBER 23, 1957
of the functioning of the Parliament of Canada, which stands at the apex of our governmental system.
Honourable senators, if I read Her Majesty's
Speech from the Throne correctly, it seems
to me that most of the Govrnment bills
to be introduced during this session will have
financial implications which would prevent
their introduction, in the first instance, in
this chamber. So far as public legislation is
concerned we will therefore be primarily
concerned with so-called "money bills" which
will have already passed the House of Commons. With regard to all such legislation,
whether financial or otherwise, I have two
principal comments. In the first place, I think
that we would all do well to remember that
the Senate has not, traditionally, resisted
the adoption of any piece of Government
legislation for which a government has received a clear popular mandate, whether as
the result of a general election or otherwise.
Nor would it, in my view, be inclined to do
so in future, in the absence of the most
compelling reasons for believing that the
issue should be referred once again to the
electorate.
So far as I am concerned, I propose to
have full regard to these important precepts
and principles. However, in so doing may
I add this: there will be room for argument
as to whether or not there has been a
popular mandate for any particular bill All
Government bills will be examined in an
honest endeavour to determine whether there
has been such a mandate, but this examination
will not be conducted in any unfair or hypercritical way.
In taking this stand, I am in good company and in step with history. Eminent
statesmen in this house and in the other
house have also been of this opinion. The
Right Honourable Arthur Meighen has had
something to say on this subject. Here are
his words:
Where there is a mandate for legislation which

comes before the Senate; where such legislation

was clearly discussed and placed on the platform
of the successful party in an election, then only
in most exceptional circumstances should there be
any attempt or desire on the part of the Upper
House to refuse to implement a mandate by its
* concurring imprimatur. No one, however, who has
thought the subject out can say that under no
circumstances should legislation coming to the
Senate from the Commons, though clearly supported
by a popular mandate in an election, fail of support
in the Second Chamber. It has been plainly and
tersely enunciated by Sir John Macdonald, by
George Brown and by Maritime statesmen, as well
as by Taché of Quebec, that the Senate's duty, or
one of its duties, is to see not only that wise
legislation, having for its purpose nothing but the
public good, is allowed, irrespective of mandate, to
become law, but in certain conceivable events to
see to it as well that the public of Canada, which
may at one election have endorsed extraordinary
proposals, has opportunity, if such proposals are of
a particularly dangerous or revolutionary character,

to think
Senate
allowed
day" to

the subject over again; in a word, that the
may, under certain circumstances, be
to appeal from the "electorate of yesterthe "electorate of tomorrow".

In the second place, as I have said before
in this house, the Senate has often asserted,
and on many occasions exercised, the right to
amend money bills wherever the amendment
would not increase the appropriation or any
charge upon the people. On the other hand, I
have also expressed the view that the Senate
should not lightly, or without the most mature
reflection, seek to alter the terms of a money
bill in such a way as to affect materially the
balance of ways and means. While reserving
to the Senate its constitutional prerogatives
I will, for my part, while in opposition continue to respect this important principle.
Finally, honourable senators, may I remark
that this chamber, in accordance with my
understanding of the intention of the Fathers
of Confederation, is organized along party
lines. However, party lines are not severely
drawn in this chamber. There is an important
judicial or quasi-judicial element in our principal transactions and deliberations, which we
all recognize, and which I hope and pray will
continue. A very great senator, the Honourable
Raoul Dandurand, found himself during his
tenure successively Leader of the Opposition
and Leader of the Government in the Senate
just as, somewhat surprisingly, my honourable
friend Senator Haig finds himself. At the same
time I, equally surprising, find myself in the
opposite position. May I quote the words of
our distinguished predecessor in both offices,
Senator Dandurand, in the Senate Debates of
February 12, 1936:
The framers of the Confederation intended this
chamber not to be a duplicate of the Commons
. . . if we felt and acted as though we were, our
usefulness as a second chamber would be gone.
The Senate is not a duplicate of the House of
Commons. We stand above~the sharp divisions of
party that exist in the other chamber, and we
approach all questions with a desire to do our
best for the general interest of the country.

Honourable senators, I do not feel that I
could say more without weakening the effect
of my earlier observations. May I simply
repeat that throughout my whole term as
Leader of the Government in the Senate I
received the utmost courtesy and co-operation
from the honourable senator who now holds
that position, and I can assure this house that
my endeavour will be to extend to the Leader
of the Government at all times the same
courtesy and co-operation.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the debate was
adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

Hon. Mr. Haig: -I find myself in some
little difficulty. On twelve different occasions
I have risen in this house as the Leader of
the Opposition in the Senate to make the first
speech here for my party after the speeches
of the mover and seconder in the debate on
the Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, and on those occasions I have always
criticized the Govermnent. Now as Leader
of the Government in the Senate I am scared
to death that before this speech is concluded
I will slip up somewhere and start criticizing
the present Government. If I do you will
know it is entirely a slip.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Let your conscience be
your guide.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I warn you that I have
every intention of trying to praise the Government before I am through. I am very
happy to record that every member of Parliament, every citizen of Ottawa and I am
sure every person in the dominion of Canada
was delighted that our Queen, Elizabeth the
Second, and His Royal Highness the Prince
Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, came to visit this
country, and that Her Majesty opened her
Parliament of Canada. It was the first time
that a reigning sovereign came here to open
Parliament, and it will probably be some
time before this happens again. We in this
chamber were doubly delighted. I do not
want to boast about the Senate, but I think
this body seems to stand closer to the Crown
than any other parliamentary body in the
dominion of Canada. We were all most
pleased with Her Maiesty's gracious conduct
during ber entire visit, and we were particularly pleased when she came to this house to
read her Speech from the Throne in our two
languages.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot help saying that
originally I was not in favour of televising
the opening of Parliament until I received
letters from the mothers of my grandchildren
and also from some of my friends in the
United States. Two of my grandchildren, said
to their father: "We wonder what the Queen
said to granddad, and what he said to the
Queen. We will judge whether he is a good
actor or not by the language he employed on
that occasion". When I return home I shall
be expected to answer that question.
Honourable senators, we were delighted at
the visit of royalty; it justified our long confidence in our system of government whereby
we could have under our own jurisdiction
a separate estate which would not be part of
our politics at all, and yet which would
enable us in the case of a crisis to use good
judgment between the parties and to choose
for ourselves a man or woman as leader,
whether for a province or for the country.
We in Canada are upholders of that system
of government and of that system of freedom
which no other nation can surpass and which
many nations cannot equal. This is the
system of government copied from the Mother
Country, and also copied from some of the
other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations.
We are indeed very happy that Her Maiesty,
with her consort, the Prince, came and visited
us on this occasion.
I wish now to say a word or two to you, sir,
the Speaker of this house. We are delighted to
have you with us as Speaker. I am reminded
of a little story, which is personal, but I will
tell it. A very close friend of mine was a
pilot on a bomber fiying over Germany. The

SENATE
navigator became ill after fifteen trips, and
the man who took his place was a young
fellow from the north of Scotland, who spoke
very broad Scotch. Most of the crew consisted of Canadian and English boys. A day
or two after this young Scotsman joined them
they said to the skipper, "How do you understand what he says?" His reply was, "Well,
boys, I am bilingual; my father speaks
English, and my mother speaks Scotch". Well,
honourable senators, I think the Speaker is
bilingual-I really believe he is. I think he
can speak English and Scotch, and, of course,
incidentally, a little French. As I say, sir,
we are delighted to have you with us as our
Speaker. We feel sure that in the course of
time you will bring credit to Canada and rank
highly with your predecessors in this important position.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to say a word or two
to the mover (Hon. Mr. White) and seconder
(Hon. Mr. Méthot) of the Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne. I admit that
I chose the two gentlemen for the task. I
must have had a good sleep the night before,
because I was so successful in my choice.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am highly pleased, and
I am sure I speak for all of us, that these
honourable gentlemen have been added to our
membership in this house. Honourable senators, the mover and seconder of the Address
have done credit to this chamber.
If I might say so as an aside, it may be
that the former Prime Minister of this country, the Right Honourable Mr. St. Laurent,
made some mistakes, but from the standpoint
of the party to which I have the honour to
belong he made no mistake when he left
sixteen vacancies for us to fill, because we are
filling them to the best of our ability.
Honourable senators, I feel that I cannot
say enough to the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for the very kind
words he used yesterday about myself. I
had the honour, and I deemed it a very great
honour, to serve as Leader of the Opposition
flrst under the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) as Leader of
this house, and then under the present Leader
of the Opposition. In all my experience in
the Legislature in Manitoba, as well as in
this chamber for over 22 years, I cannot
imagine two men who could give the Opposition a fairer chance, a fairer deal, or a
fairer opportunity to carry on reasonable
opposition, to make reasonable explanation
of the Opposition's stand on the subjects under
debate, than they. On this occasion-and
this is the first real opportunity I have had

-I
want personally to thank these two
honourable gentlemen for the very great
kindness they showed not only to me, but
to all members of the Opposition, and for
helping to facilitate the work of this chamber.
My hope is that when my period as Leader
of the Government in the Senate expires and
someone else takes my place, they will be
able to say that in a small way I have repaid
in some degree the kindness they showed
to me, and that I did not let the banner go
down, that I was as helpful and courteous
to the Leader of the Opposition as these
two honourable members were to me during
the years I occupied that position.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, may
I say one word about the officials and the
other staff of this house? I speak not only
of those who work inside the chamber, whom
we see almost every day, but of all the
staff.
The Honourable Senators Horner,
Aseltine, Marcotte and Quinn-who I am
sorry to say is not well enough to be here
today-and I have been here so long that
we know the employees of this institution,
in their various occupations, from the highest
to the lowest. They have all done their
best to serve the members of the Senate and
to make our sojourn here happy and pleasant.
We appreciate their loyalty and devotion to
the work of this chamber, and I want to
thank them one and all, including the page
boys.
Honourable senators, one of the problems
we face in Canada today is the present
position of the farmer. I do not want to
enter into what one might call politics,
whether Liberal, Conservative, C.C.F. or
Social Credit, but I think it is safe to say
that despite scientific advancement in other
fields the farmer in all parts of Canada is
in some respects not nearly as well off as
he was, say, 20 years ago.
The production, handling and sale of
farmers' products have changed radically in
the past 15 or 20 years, and we as members
of a legislative body in Canada must recognize that fact. I can speak with considerable authority of the conditions in my own
province of Manitoba, and as well with respect to the provinces of Saskatchewan and
Alberta, because these three provinces face
somewhat the same problems, but the situation is different in British Columbia,
Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime provinces.
By and large, if one attends today a caucus
of the Liberal party, the Conservative, the

OCTOBER 24, 1957
C.C.F. party or any other party with a nationwide representation, one finds the first question raised is with respect to the farmers and
the farming communities in the various parts
of Canada.
This is one of the problems the new Parliament must face. No quick solution can be
found: it may take a year, or ten years, or
no solution may be found at all. But if
there is a solution, or the possibility of one,
we must find it. No body is better qualified
to do that than is the Senate of Canada, for
the reason that we here have nothing to gain
politically one way or the other.
To a lesser extent, perhaps, a similar
situation faces fishermen, miners, lumbermen
and labour generally. By and large, the
whole scheme of the distribution of the earnings of our country has got to be considered
in the light of the position of the various
parties in the community.
I do not pretend to tell the Senate that I
have a solution to this general problem, beBut I point to the
cause I have not.
existence of the problem and say that it is
not too great for the Senate to attack. I do
not claim that every one of us is qualified
to say what is best for the farmer, the fisherman, the lumberman, the coal miner or the
industrial worker. But I do say that with
respect to each of these branches of activity
there are in this chamber men and women
from every part of Canada who can inform
the house and thus help us to form a judgment that is in the best interest of the whole
country.
I hope, therefore, that before this Parliament ends-and it may end sooner than
one would expect, because it is a divided
Parliament-some progress will have been
made toward a solution of the problem to
which I have referred.
I turn to another mater. I have been
asked frequently in Winnipeg, and a few
times here, about the prospects of an early
general election. I say quite candidly I
have no special knowledge or information in
that respect. Certainly I have no political
interest in it, and neither have my fellow
senators. But I am interested to this extent,
that an overall majority in the House of
Commons is required to carry on effectively
the government of this country. Some may
accuse me of making an excuse to try to
justify an appeal by the present Government
to the people in a general election. That is
not my intention, and I do not think it is the
issue today. I recall in 1921 and 1922 in the
Legislature of Manitoba the Government of
the day had 26 members, and the combined
Opposition parties had 29 members. That
Opposition was of course divided, with 12

members in one party, eight or nine in
another, and so on, making a total of 29 for
four parties. But the day came when the
Government was defeated on an issue that
had nothing to do with the business of the
province. That Government was never able
to bring down a firm policy with a long-term
view of three, four or five years ahead. It
had to operate month by month and introduce what it could justify for the ensuing
few months. But in the end, as I say, the
Opposition defeated it. You may think that
was wrong, but, human nature being what
it is, that is what happened.
So I say if we are to have a government
that can formulate strong and far-seeing
policies in this country we must, inside of
the next year, have a general election. What
the results may be is in the lap of the gods.
But whatever they are, I hope the party which
forms a government will have a clear
majority in the House of Commons, because
that will mean better government for Canada in the meeting of the problems we will
undoubtedly face in the years to come. We
have a very close relationship with the
United States, and we trade with Europe and
other countries. Therefore, we in Canada
need a stable government which can make
agreements and long-term commitments.
This can only be done by a government
which is sure it has the backing of the majority in the House of Commons.
The other day the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) said he
was not in favour of supplementary estimates. I am sure that opinion is generally
shared by all honourable senators. Indeed, I
do not think I am in favour of supplementary
estimates. However, I do not know how,
under our present financial arrangements,
we can get away from supplementary estimates. For instance, the Government has
on its Order Paper now a resolution dealing
with cash advances to the farmers for grain
stored on their farms. I do not know what
it amounts to, but it is something in the
order of $100 million. That is not an expenditure in the true sense, because presumably
it will be repaid. But that $100 million-odd
has to be provided for by way of supplementary estimates, because it was not
anticipated when the estimates were brought
down. The situation was not known and not
expected to be as bad as it is now.
Furthermore, provision has to be made for
increased pensions for the aged, blind, physically disabled and war veterans and for
increased civil service salaries. Those obligations have to be taken care of now. They
are part of the promises that the present
Prime Minister made to the people of Canada, and he would be foolish indeed if he

SENATE
did not attempt to have legislation covering
them put through. That will mean more
supplementary estimates to take care of
those expenditures up until March 31 next,
after which date they will be provided for
in the budget. But I do not see how anyone
could have anticipated last March that by
October legislation would have to be introduced asking for $100 million or more to
cover advances to farmers, increased pensions, salaries and so forth. These are ail
part of a policy that was undoubtedly
accepted by the people of this country.
These are some of the things I think my
honourable friend from Churchill overlooked.
However, J agree with him that there is a
danger in passing supplementary estimates.
There is always a great danger that the
Government of the day can cut down on
the preliminary estimates, and by supplementary estimates provide for total expenditure of a larger amount. But by and large
a year like this is an exceptional period,
with two Governments in one year and the
present one not having an overall majority.
I probably have said enough on that
honourable senators.
There are just one or two other matters
that I think should be touched on.
As the Prime Minister said the other day,
we stand four-square behind the United
Nations system of dealing with world affairs.
I have always been in favour of the United
Nations although I was not sure that it
would ever accomplish what we anticipated
it would. I agree with the Prime Minister,
as I am sure all the people in Canada
do, when he says that only through the United
Nations can we have any hope for world
peace today.
We do not want war. I asked a young
fellow who came back from the war, after
having made 52 trips over Germany in a
Lancaster bomber, "What did you think
about when your plane was taking off down
the runway at eleven o'clock at night?" He
replied: "Isn't it strange that you should ask
me that question? Well, I will tell you. I
thought 'Dad and mother are safe: let her
go'." I asked why he thought about it in
that way, and he said: "My dad and mother
were safe, but I knew that before I got
back from the trip I would kill ten or
twelve dads and mothers. Wouldn't you
think about it too?" At the time that young
man was 19 years of age.
On one occasion one of his plane's two
engines was damaged while he was flying at
27,000 feet, and he had to bring the plane
down quickly to 6,000 feet. He said to the
rear gunner, "What about it?" The rear gunner knew what he meant: "Should we land

and become prisoners of war or try to make
it back to England on one engine?" Ail members of the crew were asked the same question and every one gave the same answer,
"It's up to you, skipper." When the rear
gunner appeared before the commanding
officer the next morning he was asked why
he had made that reply to the skipper, and
he gave this explanation: "We made fifteen
trips with that same skipper and he was not
hit once, so I knew that they did not have
his number up, although they might have
mine, and I took no chances."
Honourable senators, that is what war is.
We do not want another war; that is one
thing that we Canadians do not want. We
feel and we know that our people are loyal
to the institutions of freedom and democracy
that we have in this country. We differ sometimes with the United States, and sometimes
with Great Britain, but we know that they
and we stand for freedom-freedom of the
individual, freedom of the people to live
their own lives under the law. Those of us
who have had the very great honour of
assisting at the deliberations of the United
Nations know that one day the Russians will
be on one side and the next day they will
say they did not take that view at ahl the
day before. I saw that myself. I was there.
That is the situation we have in the world
today.
We sometimes criticize the expenditures
that the Government is making on defence
equipment. I can remember when in 1939 we
in this chamber voted to go to war against
Hitler. Some other senators who were here
then are here now. We knew at that time
what we were doing, that we were sending
our boys and other peoples' boys off to war.
I knew that I was sending eight boys-one
of them was my own son and the others were
nephews. I knew they would not ahl come
back, that you could not throw eight boys
into a war and bring them ail back. One of
them did not come back. That is what war
means, and I say that if the United Nations
can give us any hope of avoiding a war
nothing is too good for it.
I have only one suggestion to make about
the United Nations. I think the Government
was right in 1946 when it sent as a delegation from Parliament to the United Nations
not only a number of supporters of the Government, but also a representative of the
C.C.F. party, in the person of Mr. Coldwell,
its leader, and two representatives of the
Conservative party, Mr. Bracken and myself.
I think that is a good system, and I hope the
present Government will follow it instead of
appointing Government supporters only as
delegates. I think it is a mistake to follow

OCTOBER 24, 1957
that policy. We must be united on our foreign
policy if it is to succeed. This requires that
all the people should know what we are
doing, and nobody can tell them about it as
well as those who are called upon to deal
with it. In my city of Winnipeg, after returning from the meetings of the United Nations,
I addressed quite a number of meetings. Now,
I may be wrong, but I think that a good
many people are still supporting the United
Nations on the basis of the representations
and facts that I gave them on those occasions. I think without those representations
some events might have changed their minds
in the meantime. I feel strongly that the
United Nations meetings should be attended
not only by Government supporters, but by
representatives of the Opposition and of the
other parties. That is very important indeed,
honourable senators.
Now, I have come to the point where I
want to say one or two things about the
Senate. We are under quite a responsibility
now, the greatest responsibility that the Senate has had since I entered this chamber in
August 1935. My honourable friend from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) came here in
December 1933, and my honourable friend
from Ponteix (Hon. Mr. Marcotte) in 1931.
Our great responsibility arises from the fact
that the Government bas not an overall
majority in the House of Commons and we
have to be very careful how we treat the
business that comes from that chamber so
that we will not mix up in any political
struggle that may be going on there. I want
to be very clear about that. I do not want
this chamber ever to get mixed up in political
affairs. To speak candidly, it has been charged
against me by some of my friends that I
have been too prone to help the Liberals.
I do not believe that is so; but if I have ever
given that impression let me tell my Liberal
friends, to remove any possible impression
that they "owe Haig something because he
did something for them," that they do not
owe me anything. What I have done I did
because I believed, first, that it was best for
Canada, and secondly, that it was best for
the Senate. All I urge on the Opposition
here is that, in reaching a decision upon any
issue, if they cannot justify their proposed
action as something which the Senate ought
to do in the interests of Canada, and on that
basis alone, they should not do it. If, however,
they believe that some measure which is
proposed by myself or my associates is in the
interests of this country, their duty is plain.
When I sat on the opposite benches I thought
now and then that I should vote against this
or that measure, but when the number in
opposition becomes as small as ours-it fell
to five-it is difficult to dispute the passage

of a Government measure in the way one
might do with more support. If Government
legislation is to pass this house it can be
done only with the consent of the Opposition.
But I do not want to be misunderstood. I am
anxious that the men and women on the other
side shall decide their course in the issues
which will be before them. In that way they
will perform the greatest service they can
render to their country.
Let me say further that we on the Government side will do our best to promote
efficiency in the work of the Senate. We
hope to give fair consideration to everybody.
We shall sit more regularly in the future
than we have done in the past week or two.
Last week we were handicapped because of
the littered-up condition of the chamber.
I expect that next week we shall receive
seven bills from the other house. Bills
relating to pensions and wheat will probably
be here before the end of the week. From
then on we shall be pretty busy, and I am not
sure but that we shall have to sit much more
frequently than we have done of late, because everybody is anxious to have the
business of Parliament finished not later
than the end of November, or very early in
December.
I thank the house for having listened to
me. I thank especially the present Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and
his immediate predecessor, (Hon. Mr Robertson): I shall use them as examples in trying
to give service such as they gave to the
Senate and to the people of Canada.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Gershaw, the
debate was adjourned.
THE HON. THE SPEAKER
BIRTHDAY FELICITATIONS
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Honourable

senators, may I be permitted to make a brief
statement? I heard this morning that today
is our Speaker's 54th birthday. If that is so,
I should like very much to congratulate him.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I cannot remove my hat in acknowledgment,
and perhaps you have heard enough from me
in the last few days. Thank you very much.
PRIVATE BILL
BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY OF CANADASECOND READING
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard moved the second

reading of Bill C, respecting The Bell Telephone Company of Canada.

SENATE
He said: Honourable senators, the main
feature of the Bell Telephone bill is an
increase of its authorized capital from its
present amount of $500 million to the amount
of $1,000 million, divided into shares of $25
each par value.
I think it might be of interest to give some
explanation of what the company has done
since its incorporation, the work it had to
do in past years, and the reason why additional capital is required to discharge its
obligations to the public.
This company was incorporated in 1880,
about four years after the invention of the
telephone. The purpose of the incorporation
at that time was to integrate the very few
local telephone companies that existed in the
main cities of Canada. There were telephone
systems in Toronto, Windsor, Hamilton,
Montreal and Quebec with, altogether, about
three thousand subscribers, having no other
communication but the local connections in
their respective cities. It was thought that
the company, with proper support, would be
able to combine these local companies into
one big corporation for the development of
its facilities, and furthermore to so associate
these companies that it would be possible
for a subscriber in any city to get in touch
with a subscriber in any other. That was
the purpose of the incorporation of The Bell
Telephone Company at that time, with the
very small capital of $500,000, which the
directors had power to increase to $1 million.
In the year 1881, one year after incorporation, these five or six local telephone companies were integrated into The Bell
Telephone Company of Canada, which had at
that time approximately 6,000 customers.
Since 1909 the Bell Telephone Company has
confined its operations to Ontario and
Quebec, although by its charter it is not so
confined. The rest of Canada is served by
other telephone systems. At the present time
there are approximately 2,700 telephone systems serving Canada, including 677 systems
which serve Ontario and Quebec alone. Later
on I will give statistics on the numbers of
subscribers the Bell Telephone Company and
other telephone companies have in this
country.
If we look at the conditions under which
the Bell Telephone Company operates, we
find that Parliament has always looked upon
telephone service as a great public utility,
and has always been very prudent about the
conditions under which the service functions.
In 1906 the Board of Railway Commissioners, which was later named the Board
of Transport Commissioners, was given exclusive jurisdiction over all Canadian telephone companies. The board's jurisdiction

over the Bell Telephone Company is very
broad. It has complete control over tolls
and charges for both local and long-distance
telephone calls, and it bas the right to act
on its own initiative to review, rescind,
change, alter or vary its own decisions. The
power of the board to examine and control
the operations of the company is far from
limited. The board has the right to inquire
into, regulate and inspect the construction
of the company's works. It also bas authority
to order repairs and to examine and approve or disapprove of all contracts of the
company, including anything that might limit
its responsibilities. In other words, if something happens to indicate there should be a
reduction or an increase in rates, the board,
without an application being placed before it,
may inquire into the matter and rescind or
change or alter its previous decisions.
In 1926-27 the board ruled that all telephone companies must file with the board a
monthly report of their operations. This
ruling bas never been altered and therefore
the Bell Telephone Company is obliged to
give the board these monthly statements.
Since 1929 the company bas been unable
to issue any stock unless the terms and conditions of the issue have been approved by
the board. As honourable senators can see,
control over this public utility company has
been pretty thorough and rigid for a long
time.
May I point out that the company is not
only authorized to give service, but it is
obliged upon demand to give service within
a reasonable length of time. That is to say,
if a person applies for telephone service the
company is obliged to install that service
within a reasonable period. It is not surprising, therefore, that the company has from
time to time petitioned Parliament to increase its capital in order to get the necessary
funds to extend its system and give the public
the service it is entitled to.
It may be of interest to honourable senators
if I were to give a short review of the financial history of the company.
In 1880 the authorized capital of the company, then $500,000, was increased to $1
million. In 1884 Parliament increased this
amount to $2 million, in 1891 to $5 million, in
1902 to $10 million, in 1906 to $30 million, in
1920 to $75 million, in 1929 to $150 million, and
in 1948 to $500 million. Now the company
is asking that its authorized capital be
doubled from $500 million to $1 billion.
Also it may be of interest to state what
the company bas done with all the money
that has come into its hands, and some
statistics might be impressive. For instance.
in 1881 there were only 3,100 telephones in

OCTOBER 24, 1957
Ontario and Quebec, in fact in all of Canada.
By 1883 the company was serving 6,000
customers and by 1891 over 22,000 customers.
By 1901 the number had more than doubled
to over 44,000. In 1905 it had increased to
82,000, in 1919 to 337,000, in 1928 to 714,000,
in 1947 to 1,306,000 and in 1956 to 2,766,000.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Those are customers
in Ontario and Quebec?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes, in Ontario and
Quebec only.
There are approximately
4,500,000 telephone customers in Canada, of
whom the Bell Telephone Company serves
2,766,000. As I have just said, they are located
in Ontario and Quebec. In addition to this
the Bell Telephone system has a longdistance service within Canada and to all
countries that permit such connections. A
certain number of countries are without connections, but in every case the Company
has provided connections to enable Canadian
citizens and others who are living in Europe
and Asia to connect with Canada.
If we look at the mileage figures we find
that they are extremely impressive. In 1891
the company had over 9,213 miles of wire
lines; in 1901, 24,000; in 1905, 37,000; in 1919,
964,000; in 1928, 2,449,000. At the present
time there are very close to 18 million miles
of lines.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Have you
any figures showing the number of telephones
per capita in the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec, compared with the rest of Canada?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Yes. In Quebec and
Ontario there is one telephone to three persons. The figure for Canada as a whole is
one to four persons. For the United States
it is one to three persons, and for Great
Britain one to seven persons. Therefore.
the telephone operations of the telephone
system in Canada are extremely important,
and also highly appreciated.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: May I ask the honourable
senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: How do you arrive at those
figures showing the number of telephone
connections?
Does that include the connections that are internally within the
organization, or does it refer to connections
for outside service?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I have both figures.
When I say inside connections, I mean connections that are not long distance. In 1956
there were approximately 18 million daily
inside connections, and for long-distance tele-

phone calls at the present time the figure is
very close to 400,000. And the figures are
growing all the time.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: I was referring to the
number of telephones that are installed in
Quebec and in Ontario. Does that include
the internal connections from one switchboard in a company, for instance?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It means subscribers,
and does not include the internal telephones.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): May I
ask a question? Would the honourable gentleman say what the general statute is which
governs telephone companies under federal
jurisdiction?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: It is the Railway Act of
Canada. All the legislation that gives control to the Board of Transport Commissioners
is contained in that act.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I wonder if the honourable
senator would state how the amount of $350
million, to which he has referred, has been
expended?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Let me say first that,
for instance, in 1947 the number of telephones
was only 1,306,000, while today the number
is almost double that, 2,873,000. From 1928
to 1947 its customers increased from 714,000
to 1,306,000; its underground cable from
1,694,000 miles to 3,542,000 miles; its aerial
cable from 551,000 miles to 1,153,000 miles;
its employees from 16,000 to 23,000. From 1947
to 1956 its central offices increased from 430
to 733. Capital expenditures have to be made
for these increases in the company's operations, and that is where the money goes.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask another question? The capital of the company was increased to $350 million. What balance has
it now on hand?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am coming to that
point now. At the present time, there is left
in the treasury $34 million in stock. When
subscriptions under the provisions of the Employees' Stock Plan are deducted, only $26
million is available in the treasury. That
balance of $26 million is far from sufficient
to carry on. The company has to build equipment, and it is very special equipment, which
has to be designed about a year and a half in
advance. Apart from that, at present 25,000
applicants for service are without telephones
as yet. The number of subscribers is increasing at the rate of 10,000 a month. Many subscribers use party lines, and want individual
service with a dial system. The company has
to cope with these problems and to improve
its equipment and facilities. There is a backlog of over 53,000 applications for a higher
grade of service. The company will also have

SENATE
to organize a direct service which will enable
subscribers to telephone directly from one
city to another, as is done in the United
States, so as to expedite business.
The expansion program which the company must provide for and carry out within
the next five years amounts to $962 million.
This program has already been designed and
prepared. Honourable senators might be interested in the amounts of expenditure per
year. They are:
1958 ............ $191 million
1959 ............ $204 million
1960 ............ $197 million
1961 ............ $199 million
1962 ............ $181 million
Of course the total expenditure will nat be
met out of the additional $500 million of new
stock that may be subscribed, if it is authorized. About 40 per cent will be provided
for by way of bonds which will be sold to
the public as a funded debt. The company
will also use its depreciation fund to invest
in the organization. The cost will be borne
from the three sources, depreciation money,
funded debt and capital stock, to a total of
$962 million over the next five years.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator if he is in a position to say a
word about the cost to the company of maintaining a nation-wide service involving rental
payments to the provinces for facilities operated under the ownership of the provincial
Governments?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I
am not in a position to give that in detail,
but as it is intended that the bill be considered in committee there will be present at
that time officers of the company who will
be in a position to supply that information.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: One question that puzzles
me in regard to expenditures is this: Do you
anticipate any expenditure for extensions outside of your own boundaries, that is Quebec
and Ontario?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: No; the contemplated
expenditure is precisely for the system as it
extends throughout the provinces of Ontario
and Quebec, for making the necessary connections, providing new equipment for the new
applications that have already been received
and for further applications that will come
in. Thus, the company will provide faster
service and carry a greater load than is being
carried today.
Hon. Mr. Lamber±: May I ask one more
question? The honourable senator referred
to the percentage of ownership in the company by residents of Canada. Has he any

figures to indicate any financial affiliation
with the American Telephone and Telegraph
Company? I think at one time the participation by that company was quite extensive.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I know at one time
the rumour was that the American Telephone
and Telegraph Company owned the Bell
Telephone Company of Canada. That cannot
be true of the present time, because out
of 154,000 shareholders there are 151,000
Canadians, representing 98 per cent, owning
16,400,000 shares, or 92 per cent of the capital
stock of the company. Therefore, there can
be no question of control by interests in the
United States or elsewhere.
I assure honourable senators that this bill
will be referred to a committee of this house,
which will meet next week, and the officers
of the company will be there to give any
to the
necessary,
deemed
information
satisfaction of the members of this house.
If there are any more questions which I
can answer, I will be delighted to do so, but
I must admit that with respect to about 99
per cent of the details of the operation I
have no information.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
senator does have a very good knowledge
of the operation.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I have a fair knowledge
of the main issues, but I do not have details
that may be of interest to honourable
senators. As I have said, the officials of the
company will attend the meeting of the committee when the bill is considered and will
be in a position to answer any questions.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Would the honourable
senator be able to venture a guess as to
when the Bell Telephone Company of Canada
may again have to come to Parliament to
seek a further extension of its capital
structure, in view of the expansion that has
taken place and that which is foreseen?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: If we look at the history of the past we find that the company
came eight times to Parliament seeking an
increase in capitalization. In the past few
years it came in 1920, 1929, 1948, and it
has come again in 1957. Looking at the
expansion that is to be undertaken in the
next five years, I would imagine that at the
end of that time the capital that will have
become available or be in the treasury will
have been completely wiped out. While I
have no assurance of this, I would anticipate
that in perhaps five years from now the
company will again come to Parliament
seeking increased capitalization.
Hon. Mr. Wall: I have one other point,
which the honourable senator would perhaps
take under advisement. Section 3 of the bill,

OCTOBER 24, 1957
which is new, empowers the company to pay
commissions to persons agreeing to subscribe,
etc. Surely, in the past there have been
issues of stock and commission has been
paid on some basis.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
the company feels that legally it has no right
to pay commissions, and up to the present
time it has not done so with respect to subscriptions of stock. It has given shareholders
the right to buy stock on a one share for five
or one share for six basis, at a price a little
lower than the market. But no commission
was paid on the sale of stock.
The company is asking by section 3 to be
empowered to pay commissions if the financial market at the time of issue warrants it.
But, in any case, if there is a commission
on the issue of stocks, all the terms and conditions are subject to the approval of the
Board of Transport Commissioners. No issue
of stock can be made without the approval of
the board as to terms and conditions. In that
way the public is well protected.
I should perhaps draw attention to one
further matter. In the past the by-law with
respect to the issue of stock had to be approved by a majority of the value of the
shares. This made no sense at all, and was
not in keeping with the general policy of the
company. So, provision is now made for representation by a majority of the shareholders
present or represented at a special meeting,
rather than by a majority of the value of
the shares. It amounts to the same thing, but
this arrangement is more in line with the
Companies Act. But, once the Board of Transport Commissioners has approved of the new
issue, the company is bound by it, and the
shareholders and bondholders are assured
that the issue is a legal one. I believe we
owe it to the public, where there is as high
capitalization as there is here, to give assurance to the public that it is fully protected
and that the issue is legal in every respect.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Is the
company required to submit to securities
regulations within either of the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: All the "blue sky" laws
have to be complied with in every province
of Canada.
Honourable senators, if the bill is given
second reading I will move that it be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, which will be
meeting next week.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Bouffard, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
PRIVATE BILL
BRITISH COLUMBIA TELEPHONE COMPANY-

SECOND READING
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the second
reading of Bill B, respecting British Columbia
Telephone Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I am much
more modest than my learned friend who has
just piloted his bill through second reading.
The present capitalization of the British
Columbia Telephone Company is -$75 million,
and I am asking only for an increase to $250
million. I may say to honourable senators,
after listening tb the questions that have been
asked of my honourable friend from Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), that I think I would
stumble a little if some of them were asked
me. I am somewhat like the man who was
walking through deep snow; he had a good
path and as long as he kept on it he had no
trouble, but when he left the path and got
intp the deep snow, he found the going difficult. I hope I won't stumble around too much
in presenting this bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hadn't you better get
the snow shovelled?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I don't mind.
First, as my honourable friend from Grandville did with respect to his bill, I wish to
state that if this bill is given second reading
I will move that it be referred to the Committee on Transport and Communications,
where the company's manager and perhaps
other officers will be present next Wednesday
to flounder around in the snow just as much
as they like, as far as I am concerned, though
I think they will be able to give complete
answers to any questions that may be asked.
Therefore I shall, as far I am able to do so,
confine myself to general principles.
I may say that in looking up the discussions
that took place in 1951, the last time a corresponding bill was presented, I read some
remarks made in the other house by the
then member for Skeena, Mr. Applewhaite.
He quoted authorities to show that when dealing with private bills the custom was only to
consider whether the principle was right,
and, if it was, then to refer the bill to committee. So if the principle of allowing an
increase in capitalization is a sound one,
subject to its being justified in committee,
this bill should more or less as a matter of
course be referred to committee. That seemed
to be the accepted procedure in the other
house, and without having looked up the

. 54

SENATE

rule I presume, generally speaking, that is
the rule here. I have only been here 21
years.
The British Columbia Telephone Company
was incorporated in 1916, and either then or
shortly afterwards was declared to be a
company for the general benefit of Canada.
As all senators know-at least I am sure all
lawyers know-under the British North
America Act once that is done the company
becomes subject to federal jurisdiction.
In 1940 the capital of the company was
increased to $11 million, and when I say
capital I mean only the authorized capital.
In 1947 the authorized capital was increased
by Parliament to $25 million; and the last
time the company was here, in 1951, it was
authorized to increase its capital to $75
million. I think if honourable senators will
read the discussions at that time they will
see it was anticipated that that $75 million
would last a great deal longer than it has
in fact. More money is now needed sooner
than was expected not because of any prodigal
spending on the part of the company, but
in order to meet the demands of the public
for increased telephone services.
Perhaps this might be a good place to refer
to the explanatory notes in the bill, quoting
the old section, which the bill does not
change except for the increase from $75 million to $250 million.
By referring to the note facing page 2 of
the bill it will be seen that the section provides, in subsection 3:

present application is that the company
believes it needs the money for which it
seeks authorization to give the kind of service to which British Columbia citizens are
entitled. There are many reasons why in the
past expenditures have been made faster than
was expected. The same reasons explain the
needs for the future. One, which all of us
chafe under, is the depreciation of the dollar
and a corresponding increase in the cost of
all the company's construction work. The
second is the remarkable growth of the province of British Columbia. I have here a chart
which was given to me and which depicts
the comparative growth of the Canadian provinces in the last eleven years. I should like
to refer to it; I think honourable senators
will find it of interest even apart from the
question which is before us. In this elevenyear period the percentage of growth in
Saskatchewan has been 5.8.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Are these figures of
population?

Hon. Mr. Farris: I am referring only to
population. The increase in Ontario has been
35 per cent and in Quebec 30 per cent; but
British Columbia, which advanced between
1945 and June 1956 by 47.47 per cent, heads
the list. The company serves 93.6 per cent
of this rapidly growing population. Individual
demands on service by customers have grown
in a far greater proportion. In 1946 there
were 175,000 stations; eleven years later, or
rather to the end of last year, there were
412,135. So customer demands, if my mathehave grown

OCTOBER 24, 1957
Mountains served by the Government telephone and telegraph services, and located
in the northern areas of the province. Honourable senators will keep in mind that in a
country like northern British Columbia distances compared with population are great;
and the expenses necessary to provide the
system with better equipment and facilities
have been very large.
I would submit that while as a general rule
monopolies are undesirable, telephone companies are essentially, by their very nature,
more or less monopolies. You cannot have
two systems in one. It would drive everyone
crazy. It is advantageous to have an organized single company operating in the cities
and outlying communities. People in cities,
and certainly those in rural communities, get
better service once everything comes under
the wing of a big and efficient organization
such as the British Columbia Telephone
Company.
Perhaps honourable senators would be interested in some information about longdistance telephone services. In 1950 the company completed
approximately 5,479,000
originating long-distance messages, and in
1956 the total was approximately 10,588,000,
a gain of over 93 per cent. It is estimated
that the originating long-distance messages
completed in 1957 will considerably exceed
this figure, and there is a continuing indication that the toll service demand will increase each year.
There is another peculiar situation in
regard to telephone service, and I think it
would be interesting if some honourable senators were to ask the company officials about
this in committee.
Incidentally, most of
what I am going to say now is based on something I worked out myself and I may not be
entirely right. Ordinarily when a business
expands, its operating cost become less per
customer. But it is a different matter with
a telephone company. For instance, if a telephone company increases the number of its
subscribers from, say, one thousand to ten
thousand, then the service available to each
customer is increased proportionately. There
are that many more numbers that each subscriber can call.

profits that applies to ordinary business, the
telephone company finds that in many cases
the cost of increased service exceeds the
revenue derived from it. I will go only that
far now. I am merely giving honourable
members something to think about, and if
they want to pursue it they can get the
whole story from the company officials in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was just seeking
some information.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I appreciate that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It also occurs to me
that each subscriber would get better service.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I guess he would.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: You would not say that
the greater the number of subscribers the
smaller the company's net profit is?

Hon. Mr. Farris: I am not so sure about
that. I know there is something in what I
say, but how reliable it is you will have to
find out in committee.
Honourable senators, I have spoken of the
past. What about the future? This company
is a progressive one and, as I say, is serving
over 90 per cent of the citizens of British
Columbia. The recent growth of population
in that province is only an indication of the
much more rapid growth that will take place
there in the next few years.
I endeavoured to get, within the limited
time at my disposal, some of the estimates
of the British Columbia Electric Company.
Mr. Dal Grauer, the president of that company, has made some public statements recently about the amount of money that his
company will have to spend in British Columbia in order to serve its customers. Some
of the figures are so astonishing one can
hardly believe them. I will try to make
them available to honourable senators in
committee.
Honourable senators, with your permission I would like to read a little more from

Columbia Telephone Company, and I take it

That also involves the installation of new
automatie exchanges to replace hand exchanges. The report goes on:
All areas have been affected by this growth
which bas required extensive program for local
outside plant and long distance facilities.
The rural areas of British Columbia have also
shown a very marked growth. With the taking
over of the Government Telephone and Telegraph
Service, the expansion of facilities bas been necessary in a widespread territory. This has required
considerable additions to outside plant and the
provision of new central offices, as well as the
extension of existing ones.
The company's program to meet the demands for
service requires heavy capital expenditures and the
1957 gross expenditure involves more than $40
million and represents the largest construction
year in its history.
The construction projects
planned for the three years ending 1959 will amount
to approximately $150 million .
It will be noted that there remains a margin
of $13,500,000-

That is on the allowance of capital that
was voted by this Parliament the last time.
-between
the company's issued capital and the
limit of capital stock presently authorized by the
company's charter and amendments thereto.
In view of the expansion program which the
company is about to undertake in the next few
years, this margin will be quickly taken up-

I suspected that it would have been taken
up already.
-and further issues of capital stock will have to be
made in order to keep the overall capital structure
of the company in balance.
It bas, therefore,
become evident that the present limit of $75 million
must be increased, and in view of the continuing
expanding economy in British Columbia with which
the British Columbia Telephone Company must
keep abreast, the Parliament of Canada is requested to increase the authorized capital stock
of the company to $250 million.

Honourable

senators, I should

point out

that all the money is not raised by the issue
of stock. There are two classifications, with
which honourable senators are familiar, by
which money is raised. First, what is called
the equity, which is the investment in shares;
and, second, the debt, which is met by bonds.
It is necessary to keep a reasonable balance
between the two. If I may repeat myself,
the present balance, I think, is a little out of
bounds. The equity today is 46.3, and the
debt ratio is 53.7. If the requested increase
in capital or some of it is not authorized the
company will not be able to borrow another
dollar, because the debt ratio here already is
more than 50 per cent, in fact, quite a bit
more.
Honourable senators, to the best of my
ability I have expressed to you the requirements of this company. I speak not only
for the company, but more earnestly for the
citizens of the province of British Columbia.
In modern times no progress can be made
in industry, farming or any other field without a first-class telephone service. There

has been criticisrn of this company in the
past, and some of it was justified; some of it
arose by reason of the fact that there are
always some people who like to find fault.
However, that has died down considerably,
and I think that the British Columbia Telephone Company is giving as good a service
as any company in Canada. Its ambition at
this time is to march hand in hand with
others in the great prosperity looked for in
the future of this country.
Hon. Mr. Méthot: Am I to understand that
if a contract or agreement is made for the
sale of stock it would have to be approved
by the Board of Transport Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I think I read the section,
did I not?
Hon. Mr. Méthoi: I was only wondering
if any agreement for the sale of the stock
must be approved, just the sarne as any
other operation.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Section 2 of the bill says:
The company shall not have power to make any
issue, sale or other disposition of its capital stock,
or any part thereof, without first obtaining the
approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners
for Canada . . .

Hon. Mr. Lambert: Am I also correct in
assuming that the rates and charges of the
telephone company are subject to the approval
of the Board of Transport Commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Farris: They certainly are.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): Honourable senators, perhaps this question might
remain for the committee, but I did not catch
it, or was not paying attention and missed
it. I would like to know if the honourable
gentleman can say where the equity is held
now. Is this stock held in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I cannot give my friend
the details, but the whole policy of the company recently has been to sell its stock in
Canada, and that has very materially changed
the relationship of Canada and the United
States in that connection. Whether or not we
have the entire majority at this time, I do
not know, but that has been the policy, and
as far as I know it will be continued.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: May I ask a further question? I understand the Bell Telephone Company and perhaps other Canadian companies
have associations with the American Telephone and Telegraph Company for overseas
service. Has any similar arrangement been
made with the British Columbia Telephone
Company for overseas service?
Hon. Mr. Farris: I am sorry I cannot answer that question; I do not know.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

The bill was read the first time.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, as the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) has indicated,
the motion to appoint a committee on land
use was introduced last session by me in my
then capacity of Leader of the Government in
the Senate. Instead of making a speech at
this time I would suggest that honourable
senators read the one I made last session
on this motion. I stand by everything I said
then. May I just suggest to the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) that we
substitute the name of the Honourable
Senator Wall for that of the Honourable
Senator Tremblay on the list of senators to
serve on this committee. If we do this now
it will save the need of putting in a new
motion later on.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am agreeable.

I there-

fore move, seconded by the honourable the
Leader of the Opposition:
1. That a Special Committee of the Senate be
appointed to consider and report on land use in
Canada and what should be done to ensure that
our land resources are most effectively utilized for
the benefit of the Canadian economy and the Canadian people and, in particular, to increase both
agricultural production and the incomes of those
engaged in it;

OCTOBER 29, 1957
2. That the said committee be composed of the
Honourable Senators Barbour, Basha, Boucher, Bois,
Bradette, Cameron, Crerar, Emerson, Golding,
Hawkins, Horner, Inman, Leger, Leonard, McDonald,
McGrand, Molson, Pearson, Power, Smith (Kamloops), Stambaugh, Taylor (Norfolk), Taylor
(Westmorland), Turgeon, Vaillancourt, WaU and
White;
3. That the committee have power to engage
the services of such counsel and technical and
clerical personnel as may be necessary for the
purpose of the inquiry;
4. That the committee have power to send for
persons, papers and records; to sit during sittings
and adjournments of the Senate, and to report from
time to time.

The motion was agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, October 24, consideration of Her Majesty the
Queen's Speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. White, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Méthot, for an Address in reply
thereto.
Hon
F.
W.
Gershaw:
Honourable
senators, the opening of this High Court of
Parliament by a reigning monarch was an
outstanding and thrilling event. The ceremony
was one of regal splendour. The manner in
which Her Most Gracious Majesty went
through the dignified procedure with simple
grace and humility was most impressive. It
really stirred the emotions. The Queen of
Canada has lived up to the great traditions of
her illustrious ancesters; she has endeared
herself to her people and has won the
affectionate admiration of the entire world. A
great lady and a gracious Queen, she and her
noted husband have gone from place to place,
and wherever they have visited they have
strengthened the ties which bind together the
people of the Commonwealth of Nations.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: May I at this time, Mr.
Speaker, congratulate you on the high and
honourable position which you occupy. I
also wish to compliment the mover (Hon.
Mr. White) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Méthot) of the Address in Reply to the
Speech from the Throne on their eloquence
and on the subject-matter of their addresses.
Also, in a humble way, may I express my
welcome to the new members of this Senate
chamber. I am sure they will enjoy the
good fellowship which is to be found everywhere here, and that they will be given an
opportunity to contribute something really

worth while to the welfare of the people of
Canada, both during the sessions and the
recesses.
I wish now to say a word about the province from which I come. The Province of
Alberta depicts on its crest snowcapped
mountains, a range of green hills, and a
harvest scene. Over all is the Cross of St.
George, indicating the loyalty of the people
to the land of their birth or to the country
of their adoption. In that region of snowcapped mountains are crags and canyons,
great waterfalls, and breath-taking scenery.
Banff, Jasper, Lake Louise and Waterton, are
mountain resorts which attract tourists from
this and other continents.
Honourable senators, Alberta has more than
blue skies, gorgeous sunsets and beautiful
scenery. Derricks dotted here and there indicate the presence of oil wells. A thousand
barrels of oil is a lot of "liquid gold," as it
is sometimes called. Every day 400,000 to
500,000 barrels of oil are taken from the
ground. It is estimated that, at the present
rate of consumption, there is enough coal
beneath the sod in Alberta to last a thousand
years. The Government of Alberta has had
a Conservation Board inquiring into the gas
situation. It has issued a report that 4j
trillion cubic feet of gas will last the province for 20 years, that there are wells with
an estimated 18 trillion cubic feet in reserve,
and that 1* trillion cubic feet are being
discovered each year. There is an abundant
supply of gas today, and more is being
discovered.
The mountain streams cjning down from
the foothills of the Rockies and from the
historic Cypress Hills have been diverted into
large reservoirs from which flows water to
be used to irrigate a million acres of land.
Before irrigation this land grew nothing but
tumble weed and dried buffalo grass. The
early settlers who tried to cultivate it met
with disaster year after year and ended in
failure and despair. Today over this same area
one can see waving fields of grain and huge
acreages or root crops. The St. Mary's reservoir itself holds enough water to irrigate
410,000 acres. With long days of sunshine
sugar beets grow well and have a high sugar
content. In the area of which I speak there
are three large factories refining sugar. It is a
most impressive sight to see beets being
poured in at one end of a factory and the
beautiful granulated sugar coming out the
other end.
The Northwest Nitro Chemical Company
Limited have shown their faith in the future
of this area. They recently built in southern
Alberta, at a cost of more than $22 million,
a plant which gives employment directly to

SENATE
350 employees. The people of Medicine Hat
are indeed grateful to the company for having
built in that locality. The plant uses 7
million cubie feet of natural gas and 135
tons of molten sulphur daily. These materials are found right in southern Alberta,
the sulphur being a by-product extracted
from wet gas before it enters the pipe line.
The company also uses daily 400 tons of
phosphate rock, which comes from the mines
of Montana. The plant produces a brand
of fertilizer that is proving to be a great
blessing in many parts of the world.
While it is true that the long cycle of dry
years has been succeeded by a few years when
there has been more moisture, the records
over a long period show that moisture from
the sky alone is uncertain and that irrigation
is necessary. It is a fact that crops grown
from irrigated land differ from those grown
on dry land. Root crops, fruits, vegetables
and many specialized crops can be grown on
irrigated land. But what is needed is more
factories to process these products which will
provide a more balanced diet for Canadian
people. Much has been accomplished in this
respect, but much more is needed. With
increased irrigation and more factories to
process farm products, ranching and farming
will become a more stable industry.
I am bound to say, honourable senators,
that farmers today are not in a very happy
position. Wheat, which ten years ago
brought $1.65 a bushel and upwards, now
brings, when it can be sold, $1.25 a bushel.
Taking as the base the figure 100, the products which the flrmer has to sell have come
down to 90 and in some cases lower, while
the commodities which he has to buy have
gone up to 120 and in some instances 140.
Thus the farmer is pinched between the two
sets of prices.
There are in Canada 610,000 farm families;
of that number, only 39,000 pay income tax, or
about 7 out of 100. I want here to make a
plea for more humane, helpful and kindly
treatment of the farmer by the income tax
collector. Some of the collectors are even
abusive, and hint that the farmer is dishonest, when all it amounts to is a lack of
knowledge on his part and inadequate records.
The tax collector comes along with files ranging over the past 10 or 12 years, and of course
the farmer who does not have records that
far back is bewildered. The advantages are
all on the side of the tax collector: be can
go back over an unlimited number of years,
while the farmer can go back over only a very
limited period. If he happens to have overpaid his tax in a previous year he has no
recourse. Some of the collectors are woefully
lacking in their knowledge of farming practices. I believe that farmers generally would

be happier if a more humane and kindly
method of collecting income taxes were
adopted.
Honourable senators, I have just one more
subject to discuss briefly in closing. Through
automobile accidents a life is lost every 15
minutes and an injury sustained every 30
seconds. We in Canada have our share, for
over any weekend one may read of 25, 30 or
40 lives being lost in automobile accidents.
In Canada some 2,500 persons are killed
every year, and about 40,000 injured; of the
injured, 10 per cent have some permanent
disability.
I believe motorcar accidents are one of the
greatest problems of modern times. Reckless driving is a sin; indeed, a greater sin
than is commonly thought. Highway accidents create a terrible situation: hospitals in
this country are for the most part filled. So
many accident cases come in from the highway that some of the injured have to be cared
for in the corridors. Great expense and
human suffering are involved; homes are saddened and left desolate.
Do we realize that the traffic accident is
the sixth major cause of death, and is about
the most common cause in persons under 28
years of age?
The present automobile is a pretty reliable
machine, and roads generally are good. Therefore, most highway accidents are due to the
personal element, which includes disregard
for road signs and traffic regulations, as well
as physical and mental deficiencies of drivers,
and downright carelessness.
Speed is a big factor in 30 per cent of
the accidents. Why, I read the other day
that someone was driving an automobile at a
rate of 105 miles an hour. The human system
is not built to stand such a rate of speed.
I have spoken before on what is called speed
hypnosis, which means that a person is tensed
up when going at a terrifie speed so that be is
not capable of quick action or of doing the
right thing. Under those conditions there
occurs a narrowing of the field of vision.
Normally the peripheral vision is almost 180
degrees. If one is going at a fast rate of
speed it narrows to about 40 degrees, and
if a person has his eye diverted for a split
second disaster may follow. In those circumstances there is often the whip-lash type
of injury. When a car is going at a fast rate
of speed and suddenly stops, the person in it
keeps on going, the body is obstructed but
the head goes forward, the result being death
or permanent paralysis and injury to the
nerves.
Then, of course, some accidents are caused
by fatigue or alcohol. If the alcohol content
of the blood is more than .15 per cent the

OCTOBER 29, 1957
driver is not capable of prompt action. You
cannot take a blood test of a person, without
his permission, but in the province of Saskatchewan they have in use a breather apparatus by which they can estimate the degree
of impairment, and it is compulsory for a
driver in the case of an accident to submit
to that test.
Honourable senators, the Canadian Medical
Association has realized that it has some
responsibility in connection with these traffic
accidents, so it has set up a research board
to inquire into the whole matter and to make
suggestions. It recommends that a safety
belt be attached to the framework of the car;
and it urges that proper eye and physical
examinations should be taken. The board
feels that wrap-around windshields are a
hazard because they interfere with the prism
of light; and because they increase glare, on
account of the way in which the light rays
are focussed. That is one source of danger
in some of the new cars.
The number of highway traffic accidents
could be reduced if more efforts were made
toward prevention. In the city of Medicine
Hat there has not been a fatal accident for
over three years. That is almost a record

for a city of 20,000 people, with narrow
streets and a great many automobiles. That
record has been reached because the newspaper, the radio and the police are constantly
urging people to be careful and to observe
the traffic regulations. The automobile people
and the public generally are co-operative,
and the result is a really good example of
what can be done by observing safety rules.
A few years ago, the railway companies
had a great many accidents. They started in
to preach safety-first to their employees and
they have kept on preaching it, and this has
resulted in a great saving of life and limb
through a large reduction in the number of
accidents.
So I just want to suggest that if more care
were taken on our streets and highways, and
if every driver had a better appreciation of
the tremendous power that there is under
the hood of his or her automobile, the sum
total of happiness in the homes of our people
would be increased.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Davies, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

PRIVATE BILLS
BRITISH COLUMBIA TELEPHONE COMPANYCOMMITTEE AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN

Hon. A. K. Hugessen, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, presented the report of the
committee on Bill B.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, to whom was referred the Bill (B)
intituled: "An Act respecting British Columbia
Telephone Company", have in obedience to the
order of reference of October 24, 1957, examined
the said bill, and now report the same with the
following amendment:
1. Page 1, lines 17 and 18: Strike out the words
"by and with the consent of a majority of twovalue of", and substitute therefor the
thirds in
following: "duly confirmed by two-thirds of the
votes cast by".

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this amendment be considered?
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, the amendment is a small one of
wording. There was some question as to
what the words "by and with the consent of
a majority of two-thirds in value" meant,
and the committee substituted the words
that have just been read. With leave of the
Senate, I would move concurrence in the
amendment.
The motion was agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill, as amended be read
the third time?
Hon. Mr. Farris: With leave of the Senate,
I now move third reading.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: What is the hurry?
Hon. Mr. Howard: I have not even seen
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Unfortunately, as I was
busy elsewhere, I could not attend the meeting of the committee where this matter was
studied, and unless there is some reason for
haste I should like to have a little more time
on it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Then I move that the bill
be placed on the Order Paper for third reading at the next sitting.
The motion was agreed to.

BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY OF CANADACOMMITTEE AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN

Hon. Mr. Hugessen presented the report of
the Standing Committee on Transport and
Communications on Bill C.
The report was read by the Clerk Assistant
as follows:
The Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, to whom was referred the Bill (C)
intituled: "An Act respecting The Bell Telephone
Company of Canada", have in obedience to the
order of reference of October 24, 1957, examined
the said Bill, and now report the same with the
following amendment:
1. Page 2, line 8: Strike out the words "for all
purposes".

The Hon.

the

Speaker:

Honourable

sen-

ators, when shall the said amendment be
considered?
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: With leave of the
Senate, now. Honourable senators, the only
purpose of the amendment is to make it
clear that whenever the company issues
stock, after obtaining approval of the Board
of Transport Commissioners, it will have to
go through the securities commissions in
each province. The company officials are
agreeable to the amendment made by the
committee.

I would therefore move that the

report of the committee be concurred in.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator tell us why the words "for all purposes" are being struck out? Will these
stock transactions not be valid for all
purposes?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: One member of the
committee thought that once the board has
approved the issue of stock, if the words
"for all purposes" were in the section it
might mean that the company would not
have to go through the securities commission
in each province. It is felt that if these
words are struck out there will be no doubt
that the company will still have to comply
with the regulations of the securities commission in each province where the stock.
will be sold. The only purpose of the
amendment is to avoid misinterpretation.
The motion was agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: If there is no objection,
I move that the bill be placed on the Order
Paper for third reading tomorrow.
The motion was agreed to.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of Her Majesty the Queen's

OCTOBER 30, 1957
speech at the opening of the session and
the motion of Hon. Mr. White, seconded by
Hon. Mr. Méthot, for an Address in reply
thereto.
Hon. W. Rupert Davies: Honourable
senators, I spent the night of June 10 last
in the Windsor Hotel, Montreal. When I
came downstairs on the morning of the
llth and read the Montreal Gazette I was reminded of a letter which Sir William Vernon
Harcourt wrote to the Right Honourable H.
H. Asquith, after the Liberal party's defeat
in Britain in 1895. Those of us who are
familiar with the history of British politics
during the last sixty years will remember
that Mr. Gladstone, who had been leader of
the Liberal party for many years, and had
been Prime Minister on several occasions,
had resigned in March 1894. Queen Victoria,
who did not like Gladstone, did not consult
him as to whom she should appoint as his
successor to the Prime Ministership, but she
sent for ber friend, Lord Rosebery, who,
incidentally, would not have been the choice
of the Party. However, he became Prime
Minister, but suffered a severe defeat about
a year later. He dissolved Parliament and
there was an election, in which the Liberal
party was very badly beaten. After the
election Sir William Vernon Harcourt wrote
to his friend Mr. Asquith, saying, "I expected
the deluge, but not the earthquake." That
is the way I felt on the morning of June 11.
But Sir William Vernon Harcourt finished up
his letter by saying, "We must put the boldest face on it we can." I think that was
very good advice indeed.
Honourable senators, I want to say a few
words on the Speech from the Throne, confining myself largely to one particular
reference. Before doing so, however, I offer
my congratulations to the mover (Hon. Mr.
White) and the seconder (Hon. Mr. Méthot)
of the Address in Reply, and also associate
myself with the remarks made by the mover
with regard to our new Speaker. The Honourable Mr. Drouin is the fifth Speaker
under whom I have had the pleasure of
sitting since I came into the Senate. I extend him a most hearty welcome and I hope
he will find his term of office interesting and
enjoyable.
I listened with great interest, to the speech
of the mover of the Address, who is the
honourable senator from Frontenac-Hastings. I learned something from him that
I did not know before: that the very able
principal of Queen's University, Dr. William
A. Mackintosh-Bill to his friends-came
from the pretty little village of Madoc.
I was also greatly interested in the remarks
of the honourable senator regarding the
96702-5

Dominion Succession Duty Act. I have
always felt that the $50,000 exemption should
apply to all estates. The unfortunate part
of non-application of the exemption on
estates of, say, $55,000 or $60,000 is that often
the sufferers are the wife and children of
the man who has died. As I have pointed
out before, it does not seem right to me that
the beneficiaries of an estate of, say, $48,000
should benefit to a greater extent than the
beneficiaries of an estate of, say, $52,000. A
straight exemption on the first $50,000 would
I think be much fairer. As honourable
senators are aware, there is in the United
States of America an exemption of $60,000
which applies to all estates.
Before I speak briefly on one sentence in
the Speech from the Throne, I want to
express my own opinion of the situation
which faces the Liberal Opposition in the
Senate today. We have a larger majority
numerically, but we are no longer the
Government party. The Liberal Government
appealed to the electorate on June 10 last,
and when the votes were counted it realized
it had been decisively beaten. This is no
time for post-mortems. For one reason or
another the Government lost a lot of eeats
and no longer found itself with the overal
majority it had when it went to the country.
I do not think there has been any weeping
or wailing in the Liberal camp. We all know
that all the brains and ability are not centered
in one party. I believe that the Liberal
Govrnment over the past 22 years gave
this country very good government indeed.
It is cheering to realize that not once was
the breath of scandal heard against It. The
Liberal Government may have been too
cautious with the taxpayers' money-but, as
I say, this is no time for post-mortems.
We now have a new administration. We
all know most of the members of the new
administration: we know that they are fine,
honest Canadians, and I for one wish them
well. How I shall feel about the way they
have governed the country in two or three
years' time may be different. The new
Government will be bringing in many bills;
many promises were made during the election campaign, and the Government is
determined to fulfil them.
I am not sure in my own mind that what
is being done with regard to old age pensions is wise. I have expressed my views
on this subject before. I agree with the
Toronto Globe and Mail, that we should have
in this country a sound contributory old age
pension scheme. How it is to be worked
out, I do not know. Furthermore, I feel
that ten years' residence is hardly enough
qualification before men and women start to
draw old age pensions. Perhaps 20 years is

SENATE
a bit too long, but 15 years would, in my
opinion, have been a safer compromise.
However, no doubt we shall have an opportunity of discussing the bill when it comes
before us.
I do not think it is the duty of the Opposition majority in the Senate to try to kill
Government legislation; but I do think it
is our duty to analyze it thoroughly. Honourable senators have always analyzed all bills
which have come before this house in a
careful and painstaking manner. I believe that
bills which the new Government will send
to us should have the sane careful analysis
that we gave to bills brought in by the
previous Government.
I might say I am glad that when Mr.
St. Laurent learned of the election returns
he resigned. Honourable senators will recall
that in 1925 the Conservatives were returned
with 116 seats and the Liberals with 101.
There was also the Progressive party which
had, I think, about 25 seats. In any event,
the Liberals at that time decided to wait and
meet Parliament. That was a decision with
which I personally did not agree. I sat in
the Press Gallery of the House of Commons
during the first week of the session in January
1926, and I remember very well the debate
on motions of confidence and non-confidence
in the Government. On Monday the Honourable Ernest Lapointe moved a vote of
confidence in the Government, and the
Honourable R. B. Bennett moved a vote of
non-confidence. When the votes were counted,
about two o'clock on Thursday morning, the
Government was sustained by a majority of
two. But it did not last long.
It is peculiar how history repeats itself.
On June 23, 1896, the Government which
had been headed in succession by Sir John
Macdonald, Sir John Abbott, Sir John
Thompson, Sir M. Bowell and Sir Charles
Tupper was defeated by the Liberals under
Sir Wilfrid Laurier. It was a big surprise,
but the vote was decisive. Ontario gave the
Liberals 44 seats against 41 for the Conservative party. Quebec, where Laurier had
been freely denounced, gave him 49 seats,
the Conservatives 16. Manitoba, where the
Manitoba school question was the big issue,
gave Laurier 4 seats and the Conservatives 2.
Sir Clifford Sifton, who had been a minister in the Manitoba Government, joined the
Laurier Government in November 1896.
Shortly after the 1896 election gold was discovered in the Yukon. The prospectors and
settlers were very much irritated because the
most direct route lay through American territory for part of the way and they were
charged custom duties on their effects. Not
long after his appointment as Minister of the

Interior, Sir Clifford Sifton made a trip to
the Yukon and thoroughly investigated the

situation. He decided that a railway should
be built from the Stikine river to Teslin lake.
A contract was made with Mackenzie and
Mann for building the railway, and he placed
the matter before Parliament in a four-hour
speech. The bill was carried in the House of
Commons. However, at that time the situation
in the Senate was reversed. The Conservatives were in the majority and they prompt.v
killed the Yukon Railway Bill.
That was 60 years ago, honourable senators. Today the Senate is far less bitterly
partisan than it was then. I agree wholeheartedly with the attitude expressed by my
leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in this house
last week as to the duty of the Opposition.
We must watch legislation carefully, but the
Liberal majority should not use its power to
defeat measures brought in by the new
Government.
Now, honourable senators, my main purpose in rising today is to discuss the second
paragraph of the Speech from the Throne.
It reads as follows:
Parliamentary Government bas been fashioned
Its justice,
by the wisdom of many centuries.
authority and dignity are cherished by men of
goodwill.
It will be the high purpose of my
ministers not only to preserve these qualities but
to take steps to make both bouses of this Parliament more effective in the discharge of their
responsibilities to the people of Canada.

So far as I can see, there is nothing in
that paragraph with which this honourable
house can find any fault. I interpret it as
meaning that more use is going to be made
of the Senate and that more Government
legislation will be initiated in this house than
has been the practice in the past. If that is
the intention I am sure no honourable senator will object. The Senate has always been
and still is willing to deal with any amount
of legislation that is put before it, and, I may
add, to deal with it carefully and well.
I have explained my interpretation of the
paragraph.
Unfortunately however, that
does not appear to be the interpretation put
upon it by some newspapers. During the
election campaign the present Prime Minister
referred in many speeches to the reform of
the Senate. He did not explain just what he
meant by reform of the Senate, but some
newspapers, and some organizations which
have been passing resolutions, seem to have
read into the reference to the reform of the
Senate a change in the personnel appointed
to the Senate, the appointment of a different
type of men and women. I will read two
editorials which I have with me.
The first is from the Victoria Times:
Mr. Diefenbaker's first action on the Senate is
the appointment
of six Conservatives
to fill
Ontario, Quebec and Saskatchewan vacancies in
the upper chamber. This is quite proper. lt helps,
in a small way, to reduce the overwhelming Liberal
predominance-the resuit of continuous Liberal

OCTOBER 30, 1957
appointments for the last two decades in which
promised Senate reform failed te materialize.
The Prime Minister has begun to redress the
balance. But this is net Senate reform as Canadians have visualized it, nor the type of Senate
reform ta which the Conservative national convention gave its pledge less than a year ago.

Now that is fairly mild; no one will complain about it.
The next editorial is from the Globe and
Mail, of Monday, October 14, 1957. I will
read it to you, and I suggest that if any
honourable senators have very high blood
pressure they had better hang on to their
seats.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: We know it by heart.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I will read it:
Surveying the six Senate nominations made by
Prime Minister Diefenbaker last Saturday, the
Canadian public bas for the first time good cause
ta feel disappointed with the new Government at
Ottawa.
Throughout his election campaign, Mr. Diefenbaker promised ta reform the Senate. Precisely
how, be did net say. But, gathering the Conservative
leader ta be as concerned as they were at the
low estate ta which the Senate had fallen,

How do you like that?
thoughtful Canadians deduced that he had in
mind-or intended ta work out-some means of
restoring public confidence In it. For example,
by naming ta it men and women of nationally
recognized ability.
Mr. Diefenbaker had the
opportunity se ta do. When he took office there
were sixteen vacancies in the Senate. He could
have given a token of his Intention by allocating
seme of these Senate seats ta people who had a
real contribution te make.
Sone Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Davies: Don't worry; I am going
to deal with it. By the way, I thought the
lighting of this chamber had been attended
to, but it is not very good.
But the kind of appointments he subsequently
made (elght in all) do not differ in any great
measure from the kind made by bis predecessor.
No doubt the half dozen senators named by the
Prime Minister on Saturday are, like the two
named by him previously, respectable and intelli-

gent men.
That is complimentary.

No doubt, there were good political ressens for
choosing them. But we do net see that they will
make for a more vigorous or more effective Upper
fouse.

I wish the Globe and Mail would get
blacker printer's ink.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Globe is always
hard to read.
Hon. Mr. Davies (reading):
It may be that the Prime Minister stil Intends
te reform, really te reform, the Senate.

There is more, a lot more, but it is a
strain to read it and I will not continue. I
am sure honourable senators will agree with
me that the article is a real slap in the face,
but on me it has little effect. Not for one
moment would I object to the right of the
Globe and Mail to say anything it pleases
96702-5j

about the Senate. I have been an active
newspaper editor since 1908 and I am a firm
believer in the freedom of the press. Furthermore, I have a high regard for the Globe and
Mail. It is a high-class paper, well edited,
and with an excellent news service. I read
it every day; I would be lost without it. I
am afraid, however, that the Globe and Mail,
in common with many other newspapers,
does not understand the Senate, nor bas it
taken the trouble to examine carefully the
work which the Senate has done and is still
doing. When a newspaper urges reform of
the Senate I think it would be much fairer
if it would say in just what way it wants
the Senate reformed.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Just exactly what should
the Senate do that it is not doing today?
Let us not forget that promises to reform
the Senate are by no means new. In 1896
Sir Wilfrid Laurier went up and down the
country saying that he was going to reform
the Senate if he was given the power. Well,
the power was given him. Other political
leaders have promised, when out of office,
to do the same. But when they attained
office they found that reform of the Senate
was more easy to talk about than to put
into practice. According to some people, the
Senate is composed of a lot of overpaid,
doddering old men who know very little
about legislating in the country's interest.
That is far from being the case, as I hope
in a few minutes to show successfully. But
before I do so, let me say that I disagree
entirely with both the Victoria Daily Times
and the Toronto Globe and Mail that it is
wrong to appoint political workers. I would
like to point out to the Globe and Mail that
the members of the Senate are of quite as
good calibre today as when the late Mr.
Jaffray, the then owner of the Globe, was a
member of this honourable body, and in no
way inferior in ability, wisdom and honesty
of purpose to those who were senators when
the father of the present owner of that newspaper was a distinguished member of this
house.
I have no use whatever for those supercilious people who talk in a haughty manner
about refusing to have anything to do with
politics because it is a "dirty business". Politics is not a dirty business. It is really
what I regard as the science of government.
The people who take no interest in politics
are not, in my opinion, good citizens. I will
not go so far as to say that I believe in compulsory voting, but I do feel that the men and
women who do not interest themselves in
the election of representatives to our legislatures and to our federal Parliament are not
first-class citizens.

SENATE
The Globe and Mail thinks that the Prime
Minister could have given a token of his
intention to reform the Senate. To quote the
words of the editorial, he should have
"allocated some of the vacant Senate seats
to people who had a real contribution to
make", or, to quote that paper again, have
named to the Senate "men and women of
nationally-recognized ability". As honourable
senators are aware, representation in the
Senate is divided into five districts. If the
appointees are well known and respected in
their own senatorial district it is of little
consequence, it seems to me, whether they are
known or not known all across Canada. How
many men and women are nationally known?
The names of cabinet ministers and a few
other prominent men and women are known
through the press, because their names are
constantly in the newspapers, but few are
personally known across Canada.
Let us look for a minute or so at the profession or business with which I am best
acquainted,-the newspaper business. How
many editors in this country are known across
the dominion, or their abilities nationally
recognized? We have in Canada some very
able editors, and in this category I include
the editor of the Globe and Mail. But few
of them are known from coast to coast. I
have been in the newspaper business for a
long time, and have known most of the outstanding editors. I believe I can count on the
fingers of one hand those who, in the past
fifty or sixty years, have attained general
recognition outside their own profession. Even
today, how many people in British Columbia
could name the editor of the Halifax Chronicle or of the Saint John Telegraph-Journal;
or on the other hand, how many people in
the Maritime provinces could today name the
editor of the Vancouver Province or the Victoria Times? Canada is a very large country,
and when in discussing appointments to the
Senate newspapers talk about people who are
nationally known they are confining the
choice, quite unnecessarily, to a very narrow
field.
In the news columns of the Globe and Mail
on the same day as the editorial I have quoted
appeared, six of the new senators were
listed. No one of them is a superman, but
they are all men of high standing in their
own communities. One of them is certaintly
nationally known. That one is Senator SulSenator Sullivan was
livan of Toronto.
famed across Canada, when he was a young
man, as one of Canada's great hockey players.
He was goalie for the Toronto Varsity Grads
when, in 1928, they won the Olympic championship. If you want to hear what a great
hockey player Senator Sullivan was you
should talk to Mike Rodden, the sporting
editor of the Kingston Whig-Standard. He

classes him in what are known to sporting
editors as among the "all-time greats". But
leaving aside Senator Sullivan's prowess as
a hockey player, he is known today from
coast to coast as a skilful and successful ear
specialist and surgeon. He is a member of
the Board of Governors of the University of
Toronto; he is chief consultant, in some
strange disease of the ear which I cannot
pronounce, to the armed forces of Canada,
the Defence Research Board, and the civil
aviation division of the Department of Transport.
I have singled out Senator Sullivan because I feel he is the complete answer to the
complaint that men of nationally-recognized
ability were not appointed to the Senate.
I know that this is not the time or the
place for me to be facetious. I have no
doubt that the disease of the ear-which I
did not attempt to pronounce-is a serious
one. It is comforting to know that such a
noted specialist as Senator Sullivan is giving
it his close attention. I have wondered,
however, what name the senator would give to
that strange disease of the ear which sometimes seems to afflict men of mature years
and experience, who know quite well there
would be nothing wrong at all with their
hearing if people would just stop whispering
and speak up, but who are subjected by
members of their families to nasty cracks
about the wonderful advantages of modern
hearing aids.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Davies: In singling out Senator
Sullivan, I do not for a minute mean
to depreciate in any way the other new senators, who are all men of ability and importance. We have already heard from two
of them: the honourable senator from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White) and the
honourable senator from Shawinigan (Hon.
Mr. Méthot). We have heard them speak in
this honourable house, and we know they
are going to be valuable additions to our
numbers.
The honourable senator from
Hastings-Frontenac has served for more than
a quarter of a century in the House of Commons and his experience there will, I am
sure, be of great help to him in this house.
The honourable senator from Shawinigan is
president of the Commission for the Revision
of the Statutes of the Province of Quebec.
He is a member of the Council of the Canadian Bar Association, and he was bâtonnier
of the Three Rivers Bar Association in 1945.
Then, too, we have another lawyer in the
honourable senator from Mille Isles (Hon.
Mr. Monette) who graduated from Laval University in law in 1911. He has had a long
experience in law, and be was bâtonnier
for the Montreal Bar Association in 1947.

to turn the sheep over on its back to give it
the rye. It started to struggle and we
wrestled around but I eventually got it down
on its back, forced its mouth open and stuck
the neck of the bottle into it. It gurgled and
gurgled away and finally half the bottle of

It jumped up and ran all around the barn
and I said, "Ha! I have found the solution
to all this nonsense." I returned to the house
and went to bed, and next morning the sheep
was as dead as a door nail. So, honourable
senators, I know all about unsuccessful farming. When you have ten successful farmers
in the Senate you have men of great ability.
I can assure you of that.
Sone Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: There are six doctors in
the Senate. Doctors are able men. One
doctor here has five sons who are doctors,
four daughters who are registered nurses,
and one who is a laboratory technician.
Honourable senators, if this member has not
outstanding ability, I should like to know
who bas. I refer to the honourable senator
from Montague (Hon. Mr. Grant).
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Davies: We also have eight newspaper men and one newspaper woman. I
will say nothing further about them, because,
as we all know, newspaper men and women
are modest people. We have six educationalists, all well informed, and all very able.
We have 25 business men, interested in
fishing, lumbering, shipbuilding, and other
enterprises. We have a machinist, a printer
and a dentist. We have three men financially
interested in radio and television stations.
We have 33 financiers, by which I mean men
who are thought to be able enough, when
elected to directorates, to deal with money
which people have invested in varlous enterprises in this country. I point this out to
show the kind of people we have in the
Senate.
In religion we have a very wide representation, including 33 Roman Catholics, 18
United Church members, 10 Anglicans, 5
Baptists, 10 Presbyterians (I bow low), one
Lutheran, one Hebrew, and one Church of
Christ Disciples. I think that is a pretty

religious minority is going to suffer with that
religious representation in the Senate.
There is another important point. Many
senators have qualifications other than their
regular professions or trades. Nine men
have been federal cabinet ministers. Were
we ever told that they were not fit to sit in

the cabinet? Not at all. Thirteen were provincial cabinet ministers; there are four
members of hospital boards; 34 have university degrees which they have earnednot degrees of the kind I have; 21 have had

of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Haig) is an expert on curling; he is past
president of the Dominion Curling Association, and vice-president of the Royal Curling
Club of Scotland. The honourable senator
from Shelbourne (Hon. Mr. Robertson), formerly Speaker of this House, is the honorary
president of the Clan Donnachaidh of Scotland. Honourable senators, my mother was
a Robertson and a member of that clan. For
my sins I had to wear a kilt as a small boy
in Wales. That might have been all right in
Scotland, but they did not favour the kilt in
Wales, particularly at the school I went to.
Honourable senators, I have spoken far too
long. However, I felt very strongly that
something should be said to counteract the
constant criticisms of the Senate and what it
is doing. I do not know whether the present
criticisms are made to embarrass the new
Prime Minister, or the Senate. I have no
objection to criticism if it is intelligent and
constructive.
As we all know, the Senate has changed in
some ways since 1867. In 1934 there was a
long debate here on what could be done to
increase the work of this house. Contributors
to the debate included the Right Honourable
Arthur Meighen, who at that time was leading
the Government forces in the Senate, the
Honourable Charles Murphy, former Postmaster General in the cabinet of Sir Wilfrid
Laurier, and the Right Honourable Raoul
Dandurand, who had been leading the Liberal
forces in the Senate for some years. In the
course of the addresses of these distinguished
men there was no fault found with the appointments to the Senate; the fault was found
with the other place for not sending more
business to the Senate. Senator Dandurand
said that there had been some changes in
the form, or shall we say the order, of
proceedings in this chamber since 1867. For
instance, he stated that when he was appointed, in 1898, instead of the Speaker reading the prayers, as is now done, long prayers
were said at the table by an Anglican bishop
in his robes, prayers which often took up as
much as 20 minutes. Senator Dandurand
added that whenever possible the members
would adjourn, as they might as well pray at
home as pray in the Senate. When the

OCTOBER 30, 1957
bishop died a number of clergymen wanted
to take his place. However, it was decided
that henceforth the prayers should be read
by the Speaker, who was also then designated
as the Chaplain of the Senate.
However, what I wanted particularly to
refer to in connection with the 1934 debate
was a letter which was read by the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine). In that year he was a comparatively new member, but ho made, I think,
a very valuable contribution to this debate
when he read a letter he had received from
a Mr. Morrison, formerly a leading member
of the Progressive party, and one who represented his district in the House of Commons
from 1921 to 1925. The letter, which appears
in the Senate Hansard for March 8, 1934,
reads as follows:
I have been consistently and persistently upholding the institution of the Senate. The C.C.F. and
Farmer-Labour party shout "Abolish the Senatel"
A shallow, vote-catching cryl Little they realize
how often the Senate has saved the day for us,
after some ill-thought-out legislation or bill has
slipped through the Commons, more for party
gain than the country's good. For instance, when
the Commons passed a bill to abolish the Crowsnest Pass Agreement, little knowing the import
of it, the Senate threw it out, and Western agriculture was saved at least $25,000,000 annually. The
interest on $25,000,000 wil keep our Senate expenses
paid for eternity.

That letter refers to one thing which the
Senate of Canada has done for the people.
I would like to remind honourable senators
of the fact that since I came to the Senate
the Income Tax Act was revised by a committee of the Senate. Establishment of the
Income Tax Appeal Board was one result of
that committee's work.
Some three years ago a joint committee of
the Senate and House of Commons revised
the Criminal Code. That certainly was a
very important accomplishment. It is not
fair to assume that the Senate does not do
valuable work. I am sure that anyone who

will study the Senate and its work will come
to the conclusion that the Senate is doing a
very good job indeed.
At different times discussion has taken
place in the Senate as to what might be done
to improve or increase its work or make it
more valuable.
Honourable senators will
remember that such a discussion took place
in 1951, when the honorable senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) was Leader
of the Government in this house. Many suggestions were made, but at that time it was
not thought practical to adopt any of them.
I am inclined to agree with the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot) that the Senate can be reformed,
if that be deemed necessary, only by the
Senate. When the British North America
Act was passed it designated the work of
the two different houses of Parliament, the

Senate and the Commons. It does not seem
reasonable to me that one house can change
the other house to any great extent.
In conclusion, I want to say that I think
that so far as the new Prime Minister has
done very well indeed in regard to his
appointments. I am quite sure he can be
trusted to do just as well in the future.
Furthermore, we all know how jealous of
the dignity and position of the Senate in
the Parliament is the present Leader of the

Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig).
I for one am quite willing to leave the rights
of the Senate in his hands. I know of no one
who will more zealously uphold the right of
the Senate to make its own rules and to
reform itself if necessary. I am not sug-

gesting that if the Prime Minister wished
to make certain suggestions to the Senate
they would not be sympathetically received
and discussed. I do object very strenuously,
however, to constant criticism of the Senate
as if it were an unimportant branch of the
Parliament of Canada. It is in my opinion
a most important branch, and, except for
myself of course, it is composed of a group
of very able, thoughtful and representative
Canadians. I mean every word of that. Let
us hope there will be no more talk about
reforming the Senate unless someone has a
constructive plan to put forward.
If I may be permitted, honourable senators,
I would like to close on a lighter note. The
late W. T. R. Preston, who for many years
was Trade Commissioner for Canada in
Great Britain, when on a trip through the
Balkans on government business in 1901 was
asked by his hostess at a very aristocratic
government dinner in one of the Balkan
countries whether he had ever heard of a
Canadian remedy known as Doctor Williams'
Pink Pills and if he knew the owner or
manufacturer of the product.
The lady
wished to know whether the people who
made the pills were reliable or were only
American fakers. She also asked Mr. Preston
if he had ever taken the pills. Mr. Preston
admitted that he had never taken them himself; but he assured her that he knew the
maker intimately, that he was a very fine
gentleman, and that he was at that time a
member of the Canadian Senate. On learning that the maker of the pills was a senator,
the lady heaved a sigh of relief and
announced to the guests at the dinner table
that she thought she could now safely risk
taking them.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: Honourable senators,
as there are several bills on the Order Paper
for second reading today, I move the adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. McDonald, the debate was adjourned.

SENATE
PRIVATE BILLS
OTTAWA AND NEW YORK RAILWAY
COMPANY-SECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill D, respecting Ottawa and
New York Railway Company.
He said: Honourable senators, this measure,
entitled "An Act respecting Ottawa and
New York Railway Company", is a bill for
the purpose of dissolving the company. If I
may, I should like to give a brief historical
survey of the company, so that honourable
senators will better appreciate what the position is. If the bill is given second reading
today, I would propose that it be referred to
either the Standing Committee on Miscellaneous Private Bills or to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
This company was incorporated in 1882
under the name Ontario Pacific Railway
Company, and was designed to provide rail
transportation between Ottawa and the state
of New York. In 1910 the company was
taken over by the New York Central Railroad Company. In 1952 the passenger service
on the road was discontinued, and in 1957 an
order was made by the Board of Transport
Commissioners at Ottawa permitting the
company to discontinue its freight service
between Ottawa and the terminal points in
the state of New York.
This line crossed the St. Lawrence River
at a point near Cornwall, where the company owned a railway bridge. At a later date
the facilities of that bridge were expanded
to provide for vehicular traffic, and some
years ago the company made a lease with
the Cornwall Northern New York International Bridge Corporation for the purpose of
providing service for the vehicular traffic
over the bridge. However, when the St. Lawrence Seaway Authority, both American and
Canadian, began to develop their great project in the St. Lawrence River, plans were
made for a high-level bridge over the south
channel of the new seaway precisely at the
location of the bridge owned by the company
now seeking this legislation. Some negotiations were carried on between the New York
Central Railroad Company and the Seaway
Authority, and finally the Seaway Authority
made an arrangement with the railroad company to buy the right-of-way, the bridge,
and all the undertaking of the railway south
of Highway No. 2 near Cornwall. The price,
I understand, that was paid to the railway
company for those facilities was $4j million.
That disposed of a great deal of the assets
and undertaking of the company, but it left
the line between Highway No. 2 near Cornwall and Ottawa, as well as the station
grounds in Ottawa, to be disposed of. Three
months ago those assets were purchased by
the Canadian National Railways.

The bill provides, first, that the New
York Central Railroad Company, which is
the parent company and owns all of the
assets and stock of this company, shall be
liable in respect of all claims which might
be made against the company to be dissolved.
Secondly, the measure provides that the
company shall be dissolved.
Honourable senators, that is the explanation of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator tell us what the railway is prepared
to do with respect to its employees? Some
at least of the employees are residents of
this city, and others live at various places
along the line. What does the railway propose to do with respect to those employees
who have to move?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Unfortunately, I cannot give a specific answer to
that question. I may say, however, that
the tràck and all of the facilities have been
removed, and there remains only the rightof-way. Whether an arrangement was made
by the New York Central Railroad that the
employees be stationed elsewhere, I cannot
say. I would suggest to the honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) that this question be asked of the
persons who appear before the committee,
when the bill is at the committee stage. In
the meantime I will undertake to have them
advised that they should be prepared to
answer such questions.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa
West), the bill was referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
RIO DE JANEIRO TRAMWAY, LIGHT AND
POWER COMPANY, LIMITEDSECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill E, respecting The Rio de
Janeiro Tramway, Light and Power Company, Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, as honourable senators have noted, items 3, 4, 5 and 6
on the Order Paper are all for the second
reading of private bills standing in my name.
I should explain in the first instance that
these measures originally were to stand in
the name of the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Campbell), but unfortunately he is indisposed, owing to the grippe.
I shall try to be a good substitute for him.
In the second place I should like to say that
there is a great deal of similarity in the bills
mentioned in items 3, 4 and 5, and I think

OCTOBER 30. 1957
it might be more helpful if, before I explain
the details of the bil which is now before
us for second reading, I were to give a
general explanation of what is proposed by
these three measures.
By way of general explanation then, may
I say flrst, that Brazilian Traction Light and
Power Company, Limited is a Canadian company incorporated by Canadian letters patent
i 1912. Through various subsidiaries it
operates, i Brazil, electric power, telephone,
gas and tramway facilities. It has an investment i that country, through its subsidiaries,
and through direct investment of its own, of
some $900 million. Most of this investment
is i three areas, the State of Sao Paolo,
the State of Rio de Janeiro and the Federal
District. These areas comprise about 3 per
cent of the area of Brazil. In them about
27 per cent of the entire population of the
country lives. 1 am told that approximately
68 per cent o! the industrial productive
capacity of the country is located i these
areas.
I am further informed that since 1947 the
power facilities which are required i these
areas have actually been increased by some
300 per cent, the telephone facilities by 100
per cent, and the gas production-that is,
manufactured gas, I understand-by 100 per
cent. Stili there is a very great demand for
the suppiy of additional facilities of these
companies.
This company and the other two companies
to which I have referred, apparently have
great capital requirements and it is beiieved
that these are most readily to be obtained
in Brazil. I also am informed that the provisions of Brazil law make it very difficuit
for a foreign company in Brazil to get money
by public subscription in that country. In
order to obviate this difficulty, what is proposed now is that this, as well as the other
two companies which will be referred ta
later, should be nationalized under Brazilian
law.
The normal way to do this, as ail the
lawyers in the chamber will appreciate,
would be for the Canadian company ta
surrender its charter and have a Brazilian
charter issued in the normal way to a new
company to be formed. But that, apparently,
is a very impractical procedure. First of all
it would involve a great deal of time. I am
informed that it also would involve the
expenditure of unwarranted amounts of
money.
For example, one of the requirements of
Brazilian law in respect of an operation of
this kind would be the provision of a detailed valuation of the assets o! the existing
companies to the satisfaction of public functionaries in Brazil. In the second place very
heavy transfer taxes, of 6 per cent to 10 per
cent. would be imposed as the result of a
96702-6

transaction of that kind. And sa, rather than
go through such devious and cumbersome
procedure, it was sought to do it in a way
in which the corporate personality of this
entity, o! this company, would not be
interrupted.
If that could be accomplished, the rights
and the obligations of the shareholders and
of the company and of the subscribers and
everyone connected with it would not be
inter! ered with, and there would be little
change in the normal day ta day operations
o! the company while the process of
nationalization was going on.
In addition to that, because these three
companies are providing services in the
nature o! the services provided by public
utilities, there are o! course franchises with
local authorities, municipalities and the rest,
granted to the existing companies under the
nafies under which they operate, and all
these franchises would have ta be renewed
or changed or transferred ta a new company, if one were to be incorporated.
The steps to accomplish the desired purposes are steps which have been taken
before by thîs chamber. In 1954, at page
237 of the Senate Hansard, there is a record
o! a similar provision having been made on
behaîf of Brazilian Telephone Company,
which also was a subsidiary of Brazilian
Traction. Likewise, I arn informed, a similar
provision was made by the Ontario Legislature on behaîf of a company known as
Sao Paulo Light and Power Company,
Limited.
The mechanical procedure ta be adopted is
briefly as follows:
First, permission is sought ta transfer the
head office of the company !rom Toronto,
where it is now located, ta some place in
Brazil. Honourable senators are aware that
the Canadian Companies Act requires the
head office of a company incorporated i
Canada to be in Canada. Special legislation,
therefore, as provided in this measure is
required ta permit the head office o! this
company, incorporated in Canada, to be transferred ta a place outside of Canada. In other
words, this act will provide authority for an
exception ta the general rule. In the second
place, when the change of head office has
been accomplished, it is proposed ta take
advantage of the provisions of the law of
Brazil with respect ta matters af this kind,
and ta apply ta the President af Brazil for
a decree ta give the campany Brazilian
nationality. In that way the company wil
then become subi ect ta Brazilian law. In the
third place, the company, while that process
Is going on, continues ta be a valid and subsisting company.
The proposition of law-and 1 think I
should state it for thé purpose of the record

SENATE
-which allows the personality of this company to continue, is contained in the Bonanza
Creek case. In that case, which is to be found
in (1916) 1 Appeal Cases, at page 566, Viscount Haldane said:
The company-

Like this company.
-has the capacity of a natural person to acquire
powers and rights.

I mention the citation because I think it
completes the record in so far as the legal
problem is concerned.
Honourable senators, that, in a very tedious
and lengthy way, is the general explanation
of what is proposed to be done by this
measure.
May I now discuss in detail, but not at
length, the position of The Rio de Janeiro
Tramway, Light and Power Company, Limited. This company is a Canadian letters
patent company. It did not originally have
power to operate tramways, but in 1904 it
came to Parliament for special permission to
do so, and to change its name to include the
word "tramway". The authorized capital of
the company is $50 million, divided into
500,000 shares of a par value of $10 each:
450,000 of these shares are issued, and 99.99
per cent of the issued shares are owned by
Brazilian Traction, Light and Power. The
company has a debenture debt of something
over $84 million, and all of that debt is held
by Brazilian Traction as well. The company
generates and distributes electrical power in
Rio and in the Federal District, and it manufactures and distributes gas through a subsidiary. The assets of the company in Brazil
are said to be worth $350 million. What is
proposed by this measure is that the special
legislation which was passed by Parliament
in 1904 and 1906, authorizing it to change its
name to include the word "Tramway" and
to get permission to operate tramways or
railways, is to be repealed, but the name
which was given by that legislation is to
remain in existence.
The second provision of the measure is
this.
The company is empowered
or
authorized to change the place of its head
office from Toronto to a place in Brazil,
provided a by-law to accomplish that purpose is passed unanimously by the votes
cast at a special meeting of the shareholders
of the company, where not less than 99 per
cent of the outstanding shares must be represented. Upon the issue of a decree granting
Brazilian nationaliy in Brazil, the company
shall no longer be governed by provisions
of the Canadian Companies Act. Finally,
that decree must be filed with the Companies
Branch of the Department of the Secretary
of State. Then, so far as Canadian law is
concerned, the company will no longer be
subject to it. I understand that the officials

in the Department of the Secretary of State
do not object to the proposal; they have
approved it before, and it has worked. So
we are doing something on this occasion for
which there is a good precedent. That is
the explanation of the first measure.
Hon. Mr. Baird: What about the Canadian
shareholders? Will they lose all their Canadian rights and privileges through this
transfer to Sao Paulo or elsewhere in Brazil?
Hon. Mr. Reid: If these bills are passed,
will these companies have any connection
with or any rights in Canada? Is everything, including the head office, to be moved
to Brazil and will these companies still
retain some rights under our laws? If so
I for one would be inclined to object. If
they move their head office and the whole
works, let them go, and may blessings attend
them, but if their action is the result of
changes in Brazilian law I do not see why we
should continue to accord them the rights
they have had here hitherto.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I have two questions.
I see it is stated in these bills that all the
assets of these companies are located in
Brazil. Surely, if there is a head office here,
some assets must remain in Canada: one can
hardly run a head office without, at least,
pens and ink. Is not the statement that all
the assets are located in Brazil rather too
sweeping? Next, since the head office of
these companies is located in Canada, have
they been paying taxes, either municipal,
provincial or dominion? If the head office is
transferred, and the answer to my first question is, "Yes, they have paid taxes," will the
transfer of the head office result in any
change in the tax situation? Perhaps, if there
is no tax, there is no change, but I would like
to know.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Has any request been
made by the Brazilian Government to have
the head office moved from Canada to Brazil?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): If there

are no more questions I will do what I can
now to answer those already asked. I must
say, however, that I would prefer if some
of these questions were asked of officials in
committee. May I deal with these questions
in the reverse order in which they were
asked? Dealing first with the question asked
by the honourable senator from Hanover
(Hon. Mr. Brunt), I understand that the
proposal to make this rule originates with
the parent company, Brazilian Traction, and
I understand it is not as a direct request
from the Brazilian Government. I should
add that there is a provision in the Brazilian
law whereby a foreign company can be
nationalized, and I think there is a rather
open invitation, pressing or not, for foreign

OCTOBER 30, 1957
companies to take advantage of that general
provision of law. Perhaps the honourable
gentleman would like to press his point a
little further in committee, and I will notify
these people that they should be prepared
to give further information on this matter.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The head office of the
Brazilian Traction Company is not being
moved?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): No.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: And these are all subsidiaries of that company?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The head office of
Brazilian Traction is in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Yes, and
it is not being moved. May I now try to
deal with the first question asked by the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck? I find it difficult to say why so
sweeping a statement would be made as that
there are absolutely no assets of this company in Canada. Their head office must be
here. With the exception of 23 shares out
of 450,000 issued, all shares in the company
are owned by Brazilian Traction. Its head
office in Canada is probably in the sane
office as that of Brazilian Traction. I cannot say whether it pays Brazilian Traction
for that advantage. Unless under the Ontario
law there is a tax for a place of business,
there is not likely to be any tax paid by this
company in Canada. All of its earnings are
made in Brazil. Indirectly, of course, Canada
would be collecting taxes on any dividends
that the company pays or any interest on
its debenture debt that it pays when that is
transferred to the Canadian shareholders, the
main one being Brazilian Traction. That
source of revenue will continue because the
main shareholder remains a Canadian. The
honourable senator who raised this matter
may like to press it further in committee.
Next I would deal with the question raised
by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid). He asked: if this
company will have any rights under
Canadian law hereafter. My answer is a
categorical no. This company is removing
itself from the jurisdiction of the Canadian
law and subjecting itself to the jurisdiction
of the Brazilian law. Its corporate existence
was established here but now, as I have said,
it is going to remove itself from the Canadian
law and become subject to Brazilian law.
Finally I come to the question raised by
the honourable senator from St. John's (Hon.
Mr. Baird). If I recall it correctly it was this:
How do the shareholders feel about this and
are their rights being ignored and overridden? As I said, there are 450,000 shares
issued by this company, 449,977 of which are
96702-6j

owned by Brazilian Traction. In other words,
Brazilian Traction, owning 99.99 per cent of
the shares, is for all practical purposes the
only shareholder. I would think it is a matter
of company policy that it has been decided
to do this, and while I am not certain, it
appears to be such a major investment policy
of the parent company, Brazilian Traction,
that I would think their shareholders have
already been asked to pass upon this
proposal.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

SAO PAULO ELECTRIC COMPANY, LIMITEDSECOND READING

Hon. John J. Connolly moved the second
reading of Bill F, respecting Sao Paulo Electric Company, Limited.
He said: Honourable senators, the Sao
Paulo Electric Company, Limited, is a company incorporated by letters patent under the
provisions of the Canadian Companies Act.
I am informed that all of its assets are in
Brazil. The authorized capital of the company is $10 million, divided into 100,000
shares of $100 each. I might say that 6,950
shares have been issued, all of them to Brazilian Traction Light and Power Company.
The company has a debenture debt aggregating $4,368,000, which is also held by
Brazilian Traction. There is a relatively
small first mortgage on certain of its assets
amounting to $45,000, also in favour of Brazilian Traction.
The company generates and distributes
electrical power in the State of Sao Paulo. I
am informed that its assets in that area are
worth some $21,700,000. This legislation proposes that the company transfer its head
office fron Toronto to some place in Brazil.
In order to accomplish this the unanimous
vote of the shareholders at a special meeting
is required to sanction the required by-law.
Honourable senators, I believe here I
need only refer to the general explanation
I gave on the previous bill. This measure
also provides that when the decree issuesthat is to say, a decree of nationalization,
which is to be issued in Brazil-the Companies Act of Canada shall no longer apply.
That decree of nationalization is to be filed in
the office of the Secretary of State of Canada.
When that happens the Canadian Companies
Act will no longer apply.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

DIVORCE
REPORT OP COMMITTEE

Another point which may be of interest
is that we have 31 petitions In which notice
of contest has been filed. In that connection,
rnay I say that our plan this year is slightly
different from that of last year, owing to
the public spirit of one of our members, the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croil), who undertook, when I
was iii, to take the hearings of contested
cases off my hands. The honourable gentleman is a lawyer of long standing at the
bar, and is very capable of handling this
work. I am grateful to him, as 1 arn sure
my feilow colleagues are, for his off er. We
wiil then have four subcornrittees hearing
these cases. At present the Divorce Comrn ttee is sitting daily, but when the other
standing committees increase the demand for
reporters and clerks, sittings of the Divorce
Committee are usuaily confined to Monday
and Friday. The subcommittee for the hearing of contested cases, however, wrnl not be
restricted to those days. Some arrangement
wiil be made, I think without much trouble,
provided the necessary reporters and clerks
are available, for it to sit on other days.
Last session the committee heard and recommuended 341 Petitions, 3 petitions were
rejected, 6 were withdrawn and 91 were
undisposed of, making a total of 441.
Mon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Roehuck: Certalnly.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are the 91 cases
which were flot heard last session included
in the cases which are to be heard this year?
Hon, Mr. Roebuck: Some of them are, but
not ail. For the most part, I think, those
cases were not ready for hearing, by reason
either of non-payment of the necessary fees
or non-compliance with the rules as to, filing
of documents and advertising. As to those
cases that went over to this session, whether
they are ready for hearing now or not 1
do not know. But I amn bound to say that
last session the cornmittee heard every case
that was ready for hearing. I think that
point should be very clear: the cornxittee sat
last session as long as it was necessary to
sit-and that was over a long period of
time-to hear ail the cases that were ready.
The motion was agreed to.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the Committee's reports Nos. 12 to 24 and
moved that the said reports be taken into
consideration at the next sitting.
He said: Honourable senators, may I take
advantage of the motion to present some
figures as to the progress made by the Committee up to date. I do this from time to time
because I believe honourable senators are
interested in knowing what is being done by
tbçe committee. At the last session of Parliament we disposed of a total of 441 petitions.
The number of petitions filed so far this session is 310, or only 31 fewer than we heard
and recommended during the whole of last
session. The time set for the filing of petitions for the present session will expire on
Monday next, November 25, so there is plenty
of time between now and that date for the
filing of another 31 petitions. In a general
way my comment would be that we have
just about the same amount of work ahead
of us during this session as we did last
session.
We have already heard and recommended
40 petitions. The comxnittee has been sitting
every morning, five days a week, hearing a
full quota of petitions on each occasion. The
work of this committee is f alling on a very
few senators. We can hardly spare the
absence of one of our active members, and I

SALTED CODFISH EXPORTS TO JAMAICA
NOTICE OF INQUIRY
Hon. Calveri C. Prati: Honourable senators,
I wish to inquire of the honourable Leader
of the Government:

1. If it has been brought to the attention of the
Minister of Trade and Commerce that the Gov-

ernment of the Island of Jamaica is refusing to
allow importations of salted codfish from the
Atlantic provinces except at prices which the
officials of the Government dictate and that at the
present time and for some weeks past purchases
by Jamaican importers are forbidden because
prices offered do not meet with official approval.
2. If the Minister of Trade and Commerce is
aware of the fact that an official of the Government
of Jamaica has served notice that unless shippers
from Newfoundland and the other provinces enter
into an immediate contract, which will guarantee
that there will be no advance over previous prices
for one year, that Canadian exporters will be
prevented from selling any salted codfish to
Jamaican importers at any price for a year
hence.

Apropos of this, I should explain that by
reason of increased freights, higher production costs and other factors, an increase in
price is needed to make it economically sound
to sell to that market, where values are currently on a lower level than elsewhere.
I would further draw the attention of the

were made during the previous sessions of

like to know who is responsible for this
long-awaited gesture in order to express my
appreciation.

foundland whose major source of income is
fishing, and that at the level of prices now
being dictated by the Government of Jamaica
the industry cannot be economically carried
on.
Under the circumstances, I would suggest
to the Minister of Trade and Commerce the
advisability of examining into the general
trading position between Canada and Jamaica,
and if, as it now appears, there is such a
dictatorial policy as may result in suspension
of imports of that product into Jamaica from
Canada, I would ask our Government to take
under consideration immediately a policy of
encouraging the importation into Canada from
other areas of the West Indies of certain
products which are now shipped from
Jamaica.

OCTOBER 31, 1957
Hon. John T. Haig: I thank the honourable
senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) for his notice of inquiry, and assure
him that I shal ask the Minister of Trade
and Commerce to provide answers to the
questions. On receiving the answers I shall
present them in this bouse, and they will
then appear in the Minutes of the Proceedings
of the Senate in due course.
Hon. G. B. Isnor: Honourable senators, in
view of the interest that we in Nova Scotia
have in the same matter, could the honourable senator who is making the inquiry advise us as to present prices on fish sales to
that market, compared with prices of recent
years?
Hon. Mr. Pratt: I can give the honourable
senator some information. The returns for
codfish which is currently sold to Jamaica
are somewhat less than they were three years
ago. I might say also that the c.i.f. price to
Jamaica on the basis of the last sales made
is, computed in Canadian dollars, about 5
per cent less than it was in 1948.
PRIVATE BILLS
BRITISH COLUMBIA TELEPHONE COMPANYTHIRD READING
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris moved the third
reading of Bill B, respecting British Columbia
Telephone Company.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY OF CANADAMOTION FOR THIRD READING-DEBATE ADJOURNED
Hon. W. H. Golding, for Hon. Mr. Bouffard,
moved the third reading of Bill C, respecting
The Bell Telephone Company of Canada.
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators, I for one wonder whether the terms of
section 2 of this bill are in accord with what
I believe is the consensus of opinion of
honourable senators. The last clause of the
section reads:
The issue, sale or other disposition of capital
stock
by the company in accordance with such
approval shal be legal and valid.

It will be noted that said approval is that
of the Board of Transport Commissioners
for Canada. With such approval, not only the
issue but the sale or other disposition of
capital stock in accordance with such
approval shall be legal and valid. Before
the clause was amended in committee it
ended with the words "for all purposes".
These words which the committee struck
out add nothing to the import of the declaration of validity. The moment a sale is
declared valid in advance it is of great

import; it means that the control by the
provinces through their securities commissions of the conditions of sale is to some
extent discarded; also whatever the circumstances of the negotiations of sale may
have been, they are to be of no importance,
since this bill will declare in advance that
all future sales shall be valid. I do not
understand why, irrespective of the control
by provinces, all sales should in advance
be declared valid. Before we adopt the
motion, I think in fairness to the company
and everyone concerned we should refer the
bill back to committee for further discussion and give all interested parties the
privilege of expressing their views on this
matter. I would so move, seconded by the
honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt).
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable
senators, in seconding the motion of the
honourable senator from Mille Isles (Hon.
Mr. Monette) I would like to mention another
reason why this bill should be referred back
to committee. If this particular sentence remains in its present form, the Bell Telephone
Company could have an issue of capital stock
sold and disposed of without any reference
or compliance with the Dominion Companies
Act. I do not care what company it is, it
should have to comply with the Dominion
Companies Act. This is something that could
well be considered again in committee. When
the British Columbia Telephone Company
bill was considered its officials asked for no
such privilege. They were quite content that
the company should follow all proper procedure and dispose of its securities as any
ordinary company would. I think it would
be most wise to refer this bill back to
committee.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I was present in committee when
this bill was under consideration and I
know that some considerable thought was
given to clause 2. In fact, I associated myself
with the honourable senator from Hanover
(Hon. Mr. Brunt) in questioning this clause.
However, after careful consideration the
committee decided to amend the bill in the
way the mover has mentioned; that is, by
striking out the words "for all purposes" at
the end of the clause. Now it is moved that
the bill be referred back to committee. I am
rising only because the sponsor of the bill
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) is not here today. If the
bill is referred back to committee it will not
be dealt with there until Tuesday next at
the earliest. I would propose that the matter
should stand until Monday night when the

SENATE
sponsor will be present, and in order to bring
about this result I will move the adjournment of this debate.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
there is one thing further to be said. The
proponents of the bill are anxious that it be
sent over to the House of Commons as soon
as possible in view of the contemplated
shortness of the session and the very few
hours, apparently, which will be available
there during this session for consideration of
private bills.
I have nothing to say on the suggestion
that the matter be referred back to the committee, of which I happen to be chairman.
Your committee members are the servants of
the Senate. Should the matter be deferred
to Monday evening, perhaps it could be
understood that if the Senate decides at that
time to refer the bill back to committee I
could arrange for a meeting of the committee to be held on Tuesday so that we might
finally dispose of this matter without too
much delay.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I have no objection to
that. In fact, I may say to honourable
senators that I looked for the sponsor of the
bill so as to discuss the matter with him
today, and not finding him I felt obliged to
make the comments I did. With the permission of my seconder I am prepared to
withdraw my motion.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
then I understand that the honourable
senator from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette)
withdraws his motion for the time being
and that the question before the bouse is
the motion of the honourable Senator Macdonald, seconded by the honourable Senator
Hugessen, that the debate be adjourned
until Monday next.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, unfortunately I cannot be here at
the beginning of the week, and as I shall
not have an opportunity to discuss this bill
before it is disposed of, may I have your
indulgence to make a few remarks about it
now?
I am not particularly impressed with the
objection raised to the sale and other disposition of the capital stock of the company
being valid for all purposes, for when such
sale or disposition is approved by the Board
of Transport Commissioners it is legal and
valid only to the extent to which that
approval goes and not otherwise.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: May I interrupt to ask
my honourable friend a question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Certainly.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: What happens if the board
approves of it without referring the matter
in any way to the provincial securities commission? It just forgets to do that?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We take risks in that
regard.
I am rather appalled at this bill. To begin
with, $1,000 million is a lot of money and I
am very doubtful about a bill that comes
before this bouse giving a company the right
to issue stock for that amount of money without coming back to this Parliament for
approval from time to time as new stock is
issued. I know that in the past we have empowered the company to issue stock in this
way, but never in such an amount. Even if
we had, I would look upon this bill with a
great deal of apprehension and some reserve.
I very much doubt the wisdom of section 3,
which allows the company to pay a commission for obtaining subscriptions for its stock.
It is unfortunate from my point of view that
I was unable to be at the committee meeting
when this matter was considered. As I said
previously, I was otherwise engaged. Honourable senators well know how I was engaged.
I am unaware of any good reason that has
been advanced as to why a commission should
be paid on this stock. None has been paid in
the past, and the stock has been sold very
easily. This company's stock is highly regarded
by the purchasing public. It has been a good
stock and a fine thing to invest in, and there
should be no difficulty in selling it on the
market without incurring the dangers involved in a provision of this kind. The company is being given the power to differentiate
between purchasers, to give discounts to one
and not to another.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Subject to the
approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, to some extent;
just how far I do not know. Remember, too,
that we would be endorsing the principle of
this thing and the board would not run contrary to the word of Parliament. If we consent
to the company being authorized to give a
discount to some purchasers and not to others,
why should the board come to our rescue? I
very much doubt the advisability of this
clause, and I would like to be better assured
than I am now that it will not be abused.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the honourable
senator a question?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I understood him to say
at the outset that the company is asking for
the right to increase its capital stock to
$1,000 million. That is double the amount of
its present capital stock, is it not?

OCTOBER 31. 1957
An increase of
Han. Mr. Roebuck:
$500 million.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Yes, it is an increase of
$500 million.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is quite an increase,
I admit. An amount of $500 million is stili
enough ta appal me.
Honourable senators, I have expressed al
I can at the moment. I wish to thank my
fellow members for permltting me ta make
this statement.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
if I may be allowed, I do not think I amn out
of order in speaking again on this matter, but
in view af what the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has just
said, I think it is a great pity that it was impossible for hlm not ta be present at the
committee meeting yesterday morning when
this bill was considered, and when we heard
the evidence of officiais of the company. I
know that an increase in authorized capital
fromn $500 million ta $1,000 million is big
enough by any calculation, but at the coinmittee we were given some really remarkable
facts as ta the amount of capital which this
great public utility will have ta raise durlng
the next few years in order ta meet the everWe
growing requirements of the public.
were told, for instance, that over the next five
years this comipany will have ta raise, or
anticipates spending, capital on the average
af $200 million a year. We were informed
that there are three sources from which the
company raises its capital. The first source
is fromn the issue of additional shares, which
has a direct relation ta the bull now before
the house. The second source is by the issue
of fuuded indebtedness-bonds. We were told
that under the general supervision of the
Board of Transport Commnissioners, and pursuant ta the views af that board as ta the
relationship which should be borne between
equity capital, that is, share capital, and
bonded indebtedness, that relationship is
roughly of the order af 40 per cent for
bonded îndebtedness and 60 per cent for
shares. The third source from which the campany raises these enormous sumns is depreciation reserves, which it takes out of its earnings each year, and we were told by the
president af the company that it expects ta
get about hall, or very nearly half, of its
capital expenditures out af these depreciation
reserves. Sa the position is that over the
next five years there is a contemplated capital
expenditure af $1,000 million, of which the
company expects ta have ta raise between
$500 million and $600 million by the sale af
bonds and shares in the relative proportion
which I have just mentioned. Considering
the immensity af these figures aI anticipated

capital expenditures over the next few years,
I suggest to the house that an increase ini
authorized capital af $500 million does nat
seem toa excessive. In fact, the officials told
us they expect that if Parliament authorizes
this increase of $500 million in capital stock
it will probably last the campany for the
next ten years or sa, that is, assuming it
raises the other moncys that it will need
during the next ten years, partly from the
sale of capital stock, partly from bonds, and
partly from depreciation reserves. Sa I do
wish that my honourable friend had been
at the comxnittee yesterday morning, and I
think that if he had been and had heard the
story he would not have been sa shocked by
this $500 million as he appears ta be this
afternoon.
The only other matter I wanted ta discuss,
in view of what my honourable friend said,
was section 3 of the bill, which gives the
company the power ta pay a commission ta
subscribers for shares of its capital stock.
In that regard there are only two things I
want ta touch upon. The first one is this-and it was mentioned by my leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald)-that under the section as
it reads the amount af any commission payable by the company would be subject ta
prior approval af the Board of Transport
Commissianers. The second thing is that this
clause of the bill simply brings in for the
benefit of the Bell Telephone Company a
clause which exists in the Campantes Act
of Canada for the benefit aI every commercial corporation which is incorporated
under that act. Sa we are not singling out
the Bell Telephane Company for favourable
consideration in this respect; we are simply
bringing it inta lime with all the other commercial corporations and campantes, the vast
mai arity af which are incorporated under
the Companies Act, as honourable senators
know.
I am sarry ta have taken this time, but I
thouglit perhaps I should say a few words
in answer ta my honourable friend fram
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators, may
I take a moment? Considering the matter
af interlacking directorates and subsidiary
campanies, I would like ta move, seconded
by the honourable senator from Saint JohnAlbert (Hon. Mr. Emerson), that the discussion proceed without those who are at
present shareholders taking part.
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. G. Percival Burchili: Honourable
senators, as I am not a shareholder in the
Bell Telephone Company, I qualify.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McLean: Are you a shareholder
in the New Brunswick Telephone Company?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The Bell Company does
not control that.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Well, it is a subsidiary
of the Bell.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: The Bell Company
holds some of the stock, but it does not
control it.
Honourable senators, may I add a few
words to the discussion? I am not a shareholder of the Bell Telephone Company, but
I hold some brief for them, because I happen to know something about the difficulties
of the telephone business.
I have been
associated with the telephone company in
New Brunswick for some years, and in a
much smaller way we have been faced with
just the very same problems faced by the
Bell Telephone Company, which operates
in the wider sphere of the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec.
I want to assure
honourable gentlemen that for the last ten
years, ever since the close of the war, telephone companies all over this country have
been faced with the great problem of obtaining sufficient capital in order to meet the
demands of the people who want telephone
service.
I am sorry I was unable to be present at
yesterday morning's committee meeting to
which the honourable senator from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen) referred.
Perhaps one feature has not been
emphasized sufficiently, and that is the
tremendous amount of capital that is
required in order to build what is known as
the Trans-Canada telephone service. I do
not know if that point was raised yesterday
morning.
The
Trans-Canada
telephone
service is an amalgamation of all the telephone companies in Canada from the east
coast to the west coast. Linked together
under the Trans-Canada system are the
telephone companies of Nova Scotia and
New Brunswick, the Manitoba, Alberta and
Saskatchewan telephone systems, all of
which are provincial government systems,
and the British Columbia Telephone Company. When the Trans-Canada service is
eventually completed my honourable friend
from Halifax (Hon. Mr. Isnor) will be able
to pick up his telephone, dial a number, and
speak directly to my honourable friend in
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. Farris).
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: At what cost?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: At a trifling cost. The
achievements and developments of the telephone industry in the field of communications
over the past few years in this country, and

indeed on the whole of the North American
continent, have been most amazing. But the
amount of money required to build microwave towers and to complete the intricate
modernization of this amazing development
of science is phenomenal. The various telephone companies have provided a good deal
of the money for the purpose of linking
together the separate parts of this great
Trans-Canada telephone system which, I may
say, is just one more bond uniting Canada
from the east coast to the west coast. And,
let us remember, such a system of communication is a vital factor in our defence program.
I have every sympathy for what the Bell
Telephone Company of Canada is trying to
do, and I think Parliament would do well
to assist in furthering its plans by the passage
of this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Honourable senators,
may I be allowed to say a few words?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Mr. Speaker, is there a
motion before the house? If there is, I would
like to get in on the debate too.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it has been moved by the Honourable Senator
Macdonald, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Hugessen, that further debate on the
motion for third reading be postponed until
the next sitting of the house. Is it the pleasure of honourable senators to adopt the
motion?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I speak on a point of order? I assumed my friend the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was not pressing
his motion. If that is so, are we not back
to the original motion?
The Hon. the Speaker: The motion of
Honourable Senator Monette to refer the
back to committee was withdrawn, and
motion now before the house is that
debate be adjourned.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps my friend the
Leader of the Opposition will withdraw that
motion so that this bill may be discussed now.
It is a salutary discussion, Mr. Speaker, and
I would not like to have it ruled out of
order.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understand that as
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has already spoken, even
if the debate were ruled in order he would
not be able to speak again.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not propose to
speak again.

OCTOBER 31, 1957
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was under the
impression that it was not the desire of the
house to proceed further with the debate
today.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That was the understanding.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it has been moved by the Honourable Senator
Macdonald, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Hugessen, that the debate be adjourned. Does that motion carry?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
debate was adjourned.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of Her Majesty the Queen's speech
at the opening of the session and the motion
of Hon. Mr. White, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Méthot, for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. John A. McDonald: Honourable
senators, we were all greatly honoured to have
the pleasure of welcoming Her Majesty, our
most gracious sovereign Queen Elizabeth II,
and her popular consort, the Prince Philip,
Duke of Edinburgh, to open Parliament. As
the honourable senator from Medicine Hat
(Hon. Mr. Gershaw) has said, the visit by Her
Majesty will help greatly to strengthen the
ties that bind this nation to the other members
of the Commonwealth.
I am sure that those who benefited most
and received the greatest pleasure from the
visit by our sovereign were hundreds of
thousands of young people of whom only a
few have ever been to Ottawa. I refer particularly to the boys and girls from one end
of this country to the other, who through
the medium of television had the privilege of
hearing and seeing the events as they took
place, or of hearing them by radio. The
engineers and technicians of the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation did an excellent
piece of work in their broadcast services and
they deserve our congratulations. I have
heard many favourable comments on how
clearly the scene could be viewed and the
words heard on television throughout the
country.
Honourable senators, at this stage of the
debate I do not think you would wish me to
repeat all the complimentary remarks that
are ordinarily made by one who takes part
in the debate on the Address. Perhaps you
would accept my statement that I concur in
the many fine things that have been said by
way of congratulations to His Honour the

Speaker, and to the honourable Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Haig). Also I wish to join in the cordial welcome extended to the new senators, and to
say how pleased we are with the splendid
appointments that have been made.
I should like permission to make brief
comment on the address given by the
honourable senator from Kingston (Hon. Mr.
Davies), who spoke yesterday. I do not have
the printed copy of his speech before me, but,
having listened to it, I am sure we owe him
our warm thanks for the research and effort
which he put into his speech.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I should also like to
mention briefly that I for one, as a member
of this house, wish to express my appreciation of the outstanding services rendered by
the former Leader of the Government in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), and by our
former Speaker (Hon. Mr. Robertson). Both
these gentlemen rendered very fine service
to not only the Senate, but to the people of
Canada. We hope that they may have many
years of continued good health and public
service.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: We rejoice with our
senior citizens, and others who are going to
benefit, that the Government has decided it
is possible to increase their grants. It is to
be hoped that these increases will not be
taken away by inflation getting out of hand,
and that it will not be found necessary to do
away with any essential public service. In
other words, we trust that inflation may be
kept under control, that our strong economic
position may remain sound and our prosperity continue to expand, so that it will not be
found necessary to suspend any important
public service in order to pay the suggested
and appropriate increases in pensions.
Honourable senators, although there are
several matters discussed in the Speech from
the Throne which I would like to refer to,
with your permission I am going to confine
my remarks to agricultural products, and
more particularly to those of the part of our
great nation with which I am best acquainted.
With your permission also I shall stay quite
close to my notes. The discussion on the
Bell Telephone Company of Canada bill was
well worth while, but time is getting short
and I am anxious to make train connections
this afternoon with the Ocean Limited.
The most serious problem confronting the
farmers of western Canada appears to be the

SENATE
surplus grain which the introduction of
modern farming techniques and favourable
growing seasons have produced in recent
years. Fortunately, these surplus products
may be kept as an asset without deteriorating
much in value; whereas, if and when we have
surplus fruit and vegetable crops, which are
rightly classified as perishables, they must
be disposed of in season.
Public treasury-backed loans were made
available last year to western farmers who
required more money to carry on their farm
operations. The former Government was
asked by every farm organization in western
Canada to pass legislation permitting treasurybacked loans. It is only fair to state, however, that last session certain members of
the Opposition requested cash advances on
farm-stored grain.
I am inclined to think that whatever government happened to be in power at this time
would have had to consider the suggestions
which were made some time ago. However,
up to a few weeks ago it was not known
whether all parties interested could agree on
how cash advances could be administered.
Now it would seem that the Government and
those organizations which represent the
farmers in the west have come to an agreement on administration. We trust that it
can be carried out in a business-like manner.
While we are pleased that the farmers of
western Canada will benefit, we trust that
the Government's benevolence will extend to
other primary producers-for example, our
fishermen, miners, lumbermen, and apple
and potato growers. Many honourable senators will wish to read a special study recently
published on the Progress and Prospects of
CanadianAgriculture, prepared for the Gordon
Economic Commission by Professor Drummond of the Ontario Agricultural College, and
Professor MacKenzie of the University of
Alberta. They are probably correct in suggesting that more and more of western wheat
grains will be fed in the west; but the
farmers of the east will, for a long time at
least, wish to buy large quantities to be fed
in the east and with the continuing financial
assistance of our federal Government on feed
freight.
Now, honourable senators, I would like to
deal briefly with several problems that face
us in the province of Nova Scotia. It has
been correctly stated that farmers' income
in the Maritime provinces is lower than that
in the other provinces. What are the reasons
for this condition and is there anything that
can be donc to correct the situation?
Many of our farms are too far away from
large consuming centres. The increase given
last year by the Government under the Maritime Freight Rates Act was a decided help

and encouragement to our people in our
eastern provinces, but more assistance is
needed in helping our primary producers to
develop our natural market in the New England States through providing additional
modern transportation to this large market.
We are buying much more from the United
States than we are selling to them. It is
therefore hoped that the Governments of
Canada and the United States might agree
on still further tariff reductions, thus making
it more profitable to cultivate this market.
The supplying by the Government of the
S.S. Bluenose, plying between Yarmouth and
Bar Harbour, has been a decided help, but
because of the truck haul from Bar Harbour
to Boston and nearby centres it is still too
expensive to get our products to those markets. The S.S. Bluenose has been a decided
help also in boosting tourist traffic, but more
up-to-date transportation is required now to
further develop the tourist business, as well
as to provide cheaper and more prompt
transportation to market. The solution, many
of our people think, would be for the Government to put into operation another direct
modern freight and passenger service from
Yarmouth to Boston. This service should
be a year-round one, and have some cold
storage space available for fresh fish, fruits,
vegetables, eggs, dairy products and so forth.
Our primary producers, particularly those
in western Nova Scotia, would produce for
this market if they could be assured of regular year-round transportation at reasonable
rates.
Then there is another suggestion that has
been made many times and one which if
carried out would stimulate our varlous industries in assisting them to enjoy the benefits of Confederation to a greater extent by
enabling them to get their products to the
central markets of our own nation, and that
is for the Government to do all that is possible
to encourage the Canadian Pacific Railway
to provide a suitable car ferry running from
Digby to Saint John. It is encouraging to
learn from the manager of the Dominion
Atlantic Railway that some progress is being
made. I do know that the C.P.R. officials
have been thinking of such a change for
some time, and I remember discussing this
with the late Sir Edward Beatty at his office
in Montreal when I was with the Department
of Agriculture for Nova Scotia. As far back
as that one of the chief concerns of the
Canadian Pacific was the cost that would be
entailed for dredging, wharves and breakwaters. Our people hope that the federal
Government will assist in bringing about this
desired change in the near future, by cooperating with that transportation company
so far as is necessary in helping with the

7
OCTOBER 31, 1957
terminal requirements. We hope very sincerely that the Canadian Pacific Railway will
soon enjoy its own running rights from
Windsor Junction into Halifax city. I know
that the honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) will heartily
agree with this. It would mean much, not
only to the company, but also to the further
development of the port of Halifax.
Although these suggestions on improved
transportation are not new ones, they have
become increasingly urgent and necessary
to our proper development.
Much has
already been accomplished, such as the
bridging of the Strait of Canso, with the help
of that province, better transportation to
Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island,
the Nova Scotia-Maine service and other
improvements. I believe that the present
Government is desirous of doing what it can
to assist our provinces. Therefore, I hope
that prompt steps will be taken to do all
that is practical to finish the job so far as
our needed transportation changes are concerned, including the construction of a
causeway to Prince Edward Island.
We are indeed fortunate in having a large
group of our most capable and progressive
men from the Atlantic provinces working
together to improve our economic position
through the Atlantic Provinces Economic
Council. The members of this organization
are unselfishly giving much time and effort to
their very important task of finding ways
and means whereby our people can be
assisted to help themselves, and I feel that
our Government will give willing co-operation to their carefully considered suggestions
of anything that may be done to assist our
people.
Another very important sign during the
last two or three years is the friendly manner in which the premiers of our Atlantic
provinces are meeting together to discuss
problems of mutual interest and even lending support on occasions where they have
little to gain directly and personally, or for
their province. An example is the co-operation of all four to help secure the proposed
causeway linking Prince Edward Island to
the mainland.
Another example is the
co-operation which Prince Edward Island
and Newfoundland are giving to the other
two provinces to secure cheaper power in
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
Although we have in Nova Scotia and the
other Maritime provinces some of the most
progressive and efficient farmers to be found
anywhere in Canada, there are still too many
uneconomic farm units, measured by today's
standards. This is another main reason, I
think, why our farm income in the Maritimes

is on the average lower than that in some
other parts of Canada. There are still many
farmers who, if they would accept helpful
suggestions on farm management by those
who are recognized authorities in this branch
of service, could build up their soil with lime
and fertilizer and produce the crops best suited
to their conditions. It will be found that our
most successful farmers have been anxious to
benefit from our valuable scientific and extension workers in both federal and provincial
fields. I trust that workers in other agricultural services will forgive me when I say that
just at this stage of development I do not
think that there are any more important
services to be rendered our farmers than by
those who are competent in farm management. The chances are that they will also
frequently require the skills of the soil chemists and other technicians. This presents a
challenge to our provincial departments of
agriculture to engage as many men welltrained and competent in extension and farm
management as it is possible for them to
secure, provided of course that our farmers
are willing to accept and benefit from this
most valuable assistance.
There never was a time when education of
our farm youth paid greater dividends. Among
our farmers it is the exception to find that
an agricultural college graduate, or one who
has taken the practical short courses, is not
making a success. Although the agriculturally-educated farmers do not need the
assistance of extension and farm management staffs nearly so much as do others who
have not had these advantages, they seem to
be among those who most appreciate such
services.
The farmer who has not within his own
family the help he requires finds it very difficult to hire outside assistance, pay the
higher wages that competent help can command, and make a success unless he can increase production. If one is to be a successful
farmer today, it is most important not only
to have the soil in condition to produce bountiful crops, but to farm an acreage large
enough to provide for the necessary wages
and sufficient use of the requisite machinery
to justify the expense of the equipment. This
does not mean that farmers with smaller
acreages producing small fruits, vegetables,
poultry, hogs, etc., cannot make a success.
Many of them, especially those who have help
from their own families, are succeeding and
giving their sons and daughters a good education in wholesome surroundings.
Although we produce a surplus of some
crops, we are yet deficient to the extent of
45,000 head of beef cattle, 18,000 veal and
196,000 hogs a year, in supplying meats
consumed in my own province. In all the

SENATE

Maritime provinces we can improve the
economy of our region by increasing livestock production. It would be a great benefit
to both consumers and producers if our meats
were sold by grade. To this end all should
work together to establish a modern abattoir
where meats can be properly dressed and
graded by federal officials. This would encourage greater production, because the
producers of good quality meats would receive
a fair price, while the consumers could buy
the grade they wished and be assured of
clean edible products. There would seem to
be the necessary knowledge of the benefits
of selling only graded meats that was lacking
when many years ago a contract was signed
with a first-class abattoir company from Montreal to establish an .up-to-date abattoir in
Halifax. At that time the effort failed because it was not possible to reach an agreement with the city. I understand that what
is now holding up this venture at Halifax
is the fact that, although the farmers got
together and by their co-operation raised a
considerable amount of money, they still
require very much more. There is hope
that the provincial Government will advance
this money to them. I know that, so far as
the city is concerned, arrangements have
been made to provide a lot. They have done
their part, and it is to be hoped that some
means can be found to secure all the money
which is needed. I take it that probably the
Government will respond if it can be sure
that there is product in sufficient volume to
make the business venture a success, and
also that there will be a capable foreman to
look after the plan. If these conditions
cannot be met it might be well not to lose any
further time but to try to induce a good
abattoir company to go in, for there are
certain advantages in having an established
abattoir company do this kind of work. They
have the know-how and can switch products
from one factory to the other so as to make
the enterprise pay.
At this point I should like to mention
another little industry which could be
established at Halifax for the benefit of the
farmers and the people generally in that area,
and that is an up-to-date flour mill, established
on the seaboard, where the elevator faclities
could be used. Some years ago, just before the
Second Great War, a scheme of this kind was
pretty well under way. We interested a really
first-class miller-one of the finest gentlemen
I ever had the pleasure to meet-from Midland, Ontario, and he expected to be able to
serve his customers on the Atlantic and New
England seaboard and also to look after his
trade with Britain and other European
countries. I cannot see why a business of that
kind cannot be established in the near future

and made successful. At that time we hoped
to bring in our grain from Churchill by tramp
steamer at a saving of about two and a half
dollars a ton, which economy could be passed
on to the farmers, making it possible for them
to get cheaper feed grain for their livestock.
Some of these projects are not easily realized,
but with enthusiasm and energetic drive much
can be accomplished.
It would seem that more could be done in
the eastern provinces by making certain
phases of the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Act
work for our farmers in erosion, flood, and
drainage control. An example would be to
adapt and apply provisions of the P.F.R.A. to
the straightening and deepening of certain
fresh water courses where it is necessary to
prevent further flooding and erosion. I know
that many of our farmers are already greatly
benefiting from the improvement of tidal
water control brought about by the very satisfactory work of those engaged in marshland
reclamation. Possibly many more could be
interested through soil improvement associations to further increase the production of
meats, especially for our Maritime market.
In the east our problem is to get our water
drained from our farmlands and to keep the
tide waters out; whereas in the Canadian west
the problem is to convey, through irrigation,
water into the drier farm lands.
Some of our forest products associations
have done very important work for themselves in building a successful industry for the
future and improving the quality of their
products; and in many areas, with the cooperation of the farmers they can accomplish
much for a successful agriculture in restoring
or in keeping a tree coverage of non-arable
lands.
Our fruit growers would very much
appreciate any assistance that can be given
in developing larger markets abroad. Before the Second World War over 80 per cent
of our marketable apples from the Cornwallis-Annapolis Valley were sold to Britain.
In recent years this former main market for
our fruit has been supplied by an increase
in their own production, and what further
supplies were needed have been largely
secured from sterling areas. There is one
important aid which could be given our fruit
growers this fall, and that is for the federal
and provincial Governments to offer to cooperate with orchardists in reviving a policy
of offering bonuses to help in finishing the
job of removing old trees and those of unprofitable varieties. If this could be done it
would place the fruit growers in a sounder
economic position, as it would reduce the
quantity of inferior product and assist in the
control of orchard pests.

OCTOBER 31, 1957
May I just take time to mention one thing
more that could be done to encourage our
agriculturists and help to keep more of our
best young people on farms where there are
the most wholesome conditions for family
life and where young people most readily
develop a very necessary sense of responsibility for their success regardless of the life
calling that is chosen. I refer to the need
for more generous rural credits for those who
have the natural ability to succeed. In this
connection I would like to call the attention
of the appropriate ministers and honourable
members to the recommendations made in a
report by a provincial Royal Commission
headed by one of our own members, the
honourable senator from Milford-Hants (Hon.
Mr. Hawkins). This commission made an
exhaustive study of rural credits. I believe
that its recommendations are sound and I
hope they can be given the sympathetie consideration they deserve.
Honourable members, I trust you have not
gathered the impression that I am pessimistic
about the future of agriculture because I
have mentioned briefly some of our problems,
for this is not the case. If I could start all
over again it would be in farming. The solving of problems in any growing industry only
adds zest to the undertaking. This machine
age has meant more than the usual changes
in our great industry; but I am confident that
our greatest problems can be solved by all
interested parties working together in a determined spirit of co-operation.
We would indeed be unkind and unappreciative if we were not grateful for the
many federal and provincial government
measures that have been approved, many of
them being carried out by government officials
as successfully as the measure of co-operation of our people would permit. These helpful measures that I refer to cover a wide
field in that they were designed to reduce
production costs, increase production and improve marketing methods.
I know that our best farmers, in fact the
great majority, are appreciative and optimistic
about the future prospects of farming, even
though changing techniques do create new
problems. I trust that the suggestions I
have made today may receive the consideration they deserve by the appropriate ministers
and their officials.
Briefly, in review, these suggestions for improved agriculture, particularly for Nova
Scotia, where I best know the situation, are:
1. That the federal Government render
assistance in providing more up-to-date transportation for our products at rates that our
primary producers can afford to pay.

2. That our farmers make more general
use of the services of competent farm management and extension workers in(a) continuing to improve their soils so
as to grow maximum crops by the wise
use of lime and fertilizers.
(b) reducing the number of uneconomic
units. Now, this can be done in a number
of ways; for example, by changing to more
intensive farming. Where the acreage is
small or uneconomical as far as size is concerned, increasing the acreage would make
it a more economical unit. Then, of course,
consideration should be given to the products to be grown on farms; that is, certain
conditions warrant producing one kind of
product and other conditions warrant producing another kind.
3. That P.F.R.A. be made to work for
eastern farmers in erosion, fiood and drainage
control.
4. That our farmers increase production of
meats to satisfy our own market. In this connection we require now an up-to-date abattoir
so that our meats may be sold on grade. The
establishment of a flour mill in Halifax would
also greatly help to increase production, for
it would make cheaper feed available for
livestock.
5. More and more of our farm youth require
an agricultural education in order to become
successful farmers as well as community
leaders.
6. More generous conditions in offering
farm loans for those who have the natural
ability to succeed.
7. Assistance in placing our fruit growers
in a sounder economic position through larger
markets and in finishing the job of getting
rid of the old trees and those of unprofitable
varieties.
Honourable senators, I hope that those who
have heard this speech and those who will
read it will become as interested as I am in
this work, and that they will give forth with
the necessary energetic drive to put some of
these things into effect. We must get down
to the grass roots of farming and put a new
economic face on agriculture.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Reid, the debate
was adjourned.
CANADIAN VESSEL CONSTRUCTION
ASSISTANCE BILL
MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. John T. Haig moved the second
reading of Bill I, to amend the Canadian
Vessel Construction Assistance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I will not
take up much time in explaining this bill,

because I do not know as much about it as
I ought to. After studying it I did not know
as much as I did before. The purpose of the
bill is to encourage shipbuilding in Canada.
Nobody can argue that the object is not a
good one. The question is: what do you
have to give to achieve the objective? What
is being given under the bill is an adjustment of depreciation in taxation, which the
department thinks will have the desired
effect. If there is one matter that I know
less about than I know about shipbuilding,
it is income tax. I do know that the Government does not trust me, because it deducts
the income tax before paying my salary.
Now that I am Leader of the Government I
think it ought to start trusting me a little.
But it keeps on taxing me just as when I

know that wherever there is the possibility of
building ships in Canada-in the Maritime
provinces, British Columbia, the Great
Lakes, Northern Ontario and Manitobapeople will be anxious to see this bill passed.
With permission of the house I would like
to read a brief memorandum prepared by the
departmental official to whom I have
referred:

Britain and Japan and certain other shipbuilding countries, that we can well afford
to experiment and try to discover ways to
stimulate shipbuilding in our country.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, this bill was placed on the Order
Paper last Tuesday evening, but only distributed this morning, and I have not had
an opportunity to study it. Just a glance at
the bill indicated to me that it is quite
involved, and when I heard the explanation
given to the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig) by an expert I thought it was even
more complicated. I should like to have an
opportunity to study the bill over the coming
weekend at least. A number of senators
have spoken to me about the bill, and I think
some would like to speak on it. Therefore,
I move adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Agreed.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
debate was adjourned.
ALBERTA-NORTHWEST TERRITORIES
BOUNDARY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. John T. Haig moved the second read-

ing of Bill J, respecting the boundary between
the province of Alberta and the Northwest
Territories.
He said: Honourable senators, this is a
simple bill. The boundary line between the
province of Alberta and the Northwest Territories is at the 60th meridian. In 1924 and
1925 explorers were sent out to run the line
of demarcation between the province and
the territories, and apparently they took off a

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, to

referred?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I do not see why we should send
this bill to the Banking and Commerce Committee. What do banking and commercial
institutions have to do with minerals under
the sea? It seems to me the bill should go to
one of the other committees, and there are
many of them.
This is the problem I complained of in the
previous session: everything goes to the
Banking and Commerce Committee, even a
bill which concerns the ownership of the
bottom of the sea. It is most ridiculous. Here
we have a most interesting point: when we
do not know where a bill should be sent,
someone says "Let us send it to the Banking and Commerce Committee". That is the
overall committee which decides everything
under the sun in this chamber. Let me refer
you to some of the committees that were set
up on the second day of this session, and see
how the subject-matter of this bill relates to
the work of those committees.
This bill cannot be sent to the Joint Committee on the Library; it cannot be sent to
the Joint Committee on Printing; it cannot

be sent to the Joint Committee on the
Restaurant; it cannot be sent to the Committee on Standing Orders.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Why not?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Perhaps that would be
just as sensible as sending it to the Banking
and Commerce Committee.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: May I be allowed to suggest that it be sent to the Standing Committee on Natural Resources?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: That is a very bright
idea; I am glad my honourable friend has
suggested it, because I was coming to it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Will my friend allow me
to ask a question? If I withdraw my present
motion and move that the bill be referred
to the Standing Committe on Natural Resources, will he be satisfied?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
withdraw my motion and now move that this
bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Natural Resources.
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on
Natural Resources.

The Commonwealth ministers noted the
progress made since their last meeting
toward the freeing of trade and payments.
In this context they discussed the proposals
for the creation of an industrial free trade

under the Treaty of Rome. They agreed
that, as part of the continuous exchange of
views between Commonwealth Governments
on these matters, particular aspects of the

be examined in London next week by officials
of all Commonwealth countries in the light
of the ministers' discussions.
The Commonwealth ministers noted that the
annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for

in Washington in September. The normal
practice is for this meeting to be followed by
a meeting of Commonwealth finance ministers. The Prime Minister of Canada extended
an invitation that this meeting of finance
ministers should be held this year in Ottawa.
The Commonwealth ministers recognized
the value of the work carried out over the
past thirty years by the Commonwealth

economic committee. They agreed that the
committee should be invited to examine and
suggest to governments what expansion of
its scope and functions might usefully be
undertaken for the particular purpose of
drawing attention to the economic resources
of Commonwealth countries.
The Commonwealth ministers reviewed the
progress of co-operation within the Commonwealth in the use of nuclear energy for civil
purposes. They recognized the growing importance of the contribution which nuclear
energy can make to the peaceful development
of their countries and of the rest of the
world and the value of close collaboration
between members of the Commonwealth in
this field. For this purpose nuclear scientists
from Commonwealth countries will be invited
to an informal meeting in the United Kingdom
in 1958.
The Commonwealth ministers noted that
the federation of Malaya was on the eve of
attaining independence. They extended to
the federation their warm good wishes for
its future, and they looked forward to being
able to welcome an independent Malaya as
a member of the Commonwealth on the completion of the necessary
constitutional
processes.

(See p. 76)
JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED BY THE PRESIDENT 0F THE UNITED~ STATES
AND THE PRIME MINISTER 0F THE UNITED KINGDOM
IN WASHINGTON ON OCTOBER 25
Declaration of Common Purpose
The President of the United States and the
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, at
the end of three days of meetings at which
they were assisted by the Secretary of State
and the Foreign Secretary and other
advisers, issued the following statement:
I
We have met together as trusted friends of
many years who have corne to head the
governments of our respective countries.
These two countries have close and historic
ties, just as each has intimate and unbreakable ties with other free countries.
Recognizing that only in the establishment
o! a just peace can the deepest aspirations
o! free peoples be realized, the guiding purpose of our deliberations has been the determJ.nation of how best to utilize the moral,
intellectual and material strength of our two
nations in the performance o! our full share
of those tasks that will more surely and
promptly bring about conditions in which
peace can prosper. One of these tasks is to
provide adequate security for the free world
The free nations possess vast assets, bot
material and moral. These in the aggregate
are far greater than those of the Communist
world.
We do not ignore the fact that the Soviet
rulers can achieve formidable material
accomplishments
by concentrating
upon
selected developments and scientific applications, and by yoking their people to this
effort.
Despotisms have often been able to
produce spectacular monuments. But the
price has been heavy. For ail peoples yearn
for intellectual and economic freedom, the
more so if from their bondage they see others
manifest the glory of freedomn. Even despots
are forced to permit freedom to grow by an
evolutionary process, or in time there will be
violent revolution.
This principle is inexorable in its operation. Already it has begun to be noticeable
even within the Soviet orbit. If the free
nations are stead!ast, and if they utilize their
resources in harmonious co-operation the
totalitarian menace that now confronts them
will in good time recede.
In order, however, that freedom may be
secure and show its good fruits, it is necessary first that the collective military

strength of the free nations should be
adequate to meet the threat against them. At
the same time, the aggregate of the free
world's military expenditure must be kept
within limits compatible with individual
freedom.
Otherwise we rislc losing the
very liberties which we seek to defend.
These ideas have been the central theme
of oui conversations which, ini part, were
participated in by Mr. Spaak, the SecretaryGeneral of NATO.
In application of these ideas, and as an
example which we believe can and should
spread among the nations of the free world,
we reached the f ollowing understanding:
II
1. The arrangements which the nations o!
the free world have made for collective defence and mutual help are based on the
recognition that the concept of national selfsufficiency is now out of date.
The countries of the free world are interdependent and only in genuine partnership,
by combining their resources and sharing
tasks in many fields, can progress and safety
be found. For our part, we have agreed that
our two countries wrnl henoeforth act in
accordance with this principle.
2. Our representatives to the North Atlantic Council will urge an enlarged Atlantic
effort in scientific research and development
in support of greater collective security and
the expansion of current activities of the task
force working in titis field under the council's decision of last December.
3. The President of the United States wrnl
request the Congress to amend the Atomie
Energy Act as may be necessary and desirable
to permit of close and fruitful collaboration
of scientists and engineers o! Great Britain,
the United States and other friendly
countries.
4. The disarmament proposals made by the
western representatives on the disarmament
subcommittee in London and approved by
ail members o! NATO are a sound and fair
basis for an agreement which would reduce
the threat of war and the burden of armaments. The indefinite accumulation of nuclear
weapons and the indiscriminate spreading o!
the capacity to produce them should be prevented. Effective and reliable inspection must

SENATE
be an integral part of initial steps in the
control and reduction of armaments.
5. In the absence of such disarmament as
we are seeking, international security now
depends, not merely on local defensive
shields, but upon reinforcing them with the
deterrent and retaliatory power of nuclear
weapons.
So long as the threat of international
Communism persists, the free nations must
be prepared to provide for their own security.
Because the free-world measures are purely
defensive and for security against outside
threat, the period for which they must be
maintained cannot be foreseen.
It is not within the capacity of each nation
acting alone to make itself fully secure. Only
collective measures will suffice. These should
preferably be found by implementing the
provisions of the United Nations Charter for
forces at the disposal of the Security Council.
But if the Soviet Union persists in nullifying these provisions by veto, there must
otherwise be developed a greater sense of
community security. The framework for this
exists in collective defence arrangements
now participated in by nearly 50 free nations,
as authorized by the Charter. All members of
this community, and other free nations which
so desire, should possess more knowledge of
the total capabilities of security that are
in being and in prospect. There should also
be provided greater opportunity to assure
that this power will in fact be available in
case of need for their common security, and
that it will not be misused by any nation for
purposes other than individual and collective
self-defence. as authorized by the Charter of
the United Nations.
For our part we regard our possession of
nuclear weapons power as a trust for the
defence of the free world.
6. Our two countries plan to discuss these
ideas with all of their security partners. So
far as the North Atlantic Alliance is concerned, the December meeting of the North
Atlantic Council may, perhaps, be given a
special character in this respect. This has
been discussed with the Secretary-General of
NATO, Mr. Spaak.

7. In addition to the North Atlantic Treaty,
the Southeast Asia Collective Defence Treaty,
the Baghdad Pact and other security arrangements constitute a strong bulwark against
aggression in the various treaty areas. There
are also vitally important relationships of a
somewhat different character. There is the
Commonwealth; and in the western hemisphere the organization of American states.
There are individual mutual defence agreements to which the United States is a party.
8. We recognize that our collective security
efforts must be supported and reinforced by
co-operative economic action. The present
offers a challenging opportunity for the improvement of trading conditions and the expansion of trade throughout the free world.
It is encouraging that plans are developing for
a European free trade area in association
with the European common market. We
recognize that especially in the less developed
countries there should be a steady and significant increase in standards of living and
economic development.
9. We took note of specific factors in the
ideological struggle in which we are engaged.
In particular, we were in full agreement that:
Soviet threats directed against Turkey give
solemn significance to the obligation, under
article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, to consider an armed attack against any member
of the Alliance as an attack against all;
The reunification of Germany by free elections is essential. At the Geneva Conference
of 1955 Messrs. Khrushchev and Bulganin
agree to this with us and our French allies.
Continued repudiation of that agreement and
continued suppression of freedom in Eastern
Europe undermine international confidence
and perpetuate an injustice, a folly and a
danger.
III
The President and the Prime Minister believe that the understandings they have
reached will be increasingly effective as they
become more widespread between the free
nations. By co-ordinating the strength of all

Honourable
Hon. John J. Connolly:
senators, I should like for a moment to
associate myself with the remarks that
have been made by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) and by the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in
respect of the late Senator McGuire.
Naturally, I felt particularly close to him
because our racial origins were similar.
Many years before I came to this chamber he
was a friend of mine and I frequently sought
and got his very good advice. When I came
to the chamber I was rather young, and I
must confess that without the advice and
the encouragement of the older senators I
would indeed have had great difficulty in
getting along. I think that will always be
true of young appointees to this chamber.
Senator McGuire was one of those people
to whom I and people like myself could go
and be helped and encouraged greatly indeed.
The Leader of the Opposition has referred
to Senator McGuire's interest in history and
to the fact that he was president of the
Canadian Catholic Historical Association. I
knew of his work in that association, because

I too have had an interest in it. But I also
knew of his interest in historical matters
generally, and I remember in my early
days in the Senate I had a talk with him in
which he told me about the great virtues
of one of his predecessors in this chamber,
and perhaps by devolution a man whose
place he took here, namely, Sir Frank Smith.
He spoke so warmly and so highly of Sir
Frank Smith-of whom, I must admit, I had
never known much-that I thought they
were political associates. It turned out that,
unlike Senator McGuire, Sir Frank was not
a Liberal at all; he was a very prominent
Conservative, a strong supporter of Sir John
A. Macdonald, in one of whose cabinets he
was a member. That little story illustrates
the breadth of view that Senator McGuire
had. He was, however, a very strong Liberal,
and I know, from what I have heard from
others and what he told me, that he was
one of Mr. Mackenzie King's leading supporters in the Toronto area and in Ontario
generally.
The last time I saw the late senator was
here, at the opening of the present Parliament. I, and I am sure others, were very
much impressed with the courage he showed
in coming here when his sovereign was to
open Parliament, to do-in the language of
the Coronation ceremony-"his homage and
service" on that occasion.

experience in the marketing of grain, particularly wheat, and even though we do not
always agree, I have great respect for his
opinions.
I am pleased that he will have
an opportunity to speak on this legislation
tonight.
Honourable
senators, I welcome the
opportunity of explaining the principle of
this bill. I feel it is a measure that will
receive the hearty approval of this chamber. No doubt quite a number of questions
will come to the minds of honourable
senators as I go along, and I would suggest
that they make a note of them and ask them
after I have finished my explanation.
I do not intend to go into the whole question of marketing of wheat and other grains
at this time, but I think I should say a few
words about the wheat industry generally.
Honourable members are aware that since
I came to this chamber, in 1934, I have
spoken on the wheat question many times.
The growing and marketing of wheat is one
of our great industries and has played a very
important part in the economic life of
Canada. Grain growers of western Canada
have created on many occasions $1 billion
worth of new wealth in a single year. I do
not need to tell the house what that means
to the economy of the whole country. The
export of our wheat has earned in many
a year the income with which to pay for our
imports. If the farmers of western Canada
have large crops there is prosperity in
every part of Canada;
the railways,
merchants and wholesalers are busy, and
almost everybody is prosperous. If the crops
are poor the whole economy is affected and
the result is entirely different.
Except for the year 1940-41, or thereabouts, the farmers of western Canada,
the producers of wheat and other grains,
have been able to market their grain after
harvesting and threshing, and with the
money received they have been able to pay
their debts and buy the supplies needed to
carry them through the winter months. But
commencing around 1950, and for seven
years after that, large surpluses of grain,
particularly wheat, have been building up
on farms, in country elevators and in
terminal elevators. As a result of the congestion the producers have not been able
to sell their grain and so have not, been
96702-7

able to get the necessary funds to carry on.
Perhaps I will be excused for giving some
of the reasons. First, is the loss of former
markets and the reduction of exports; second,
per acre; third,
increased productivity
larger average crops; fourth, subsidized competition of other countries; and fifth, giveaway programs of other countries. There
may be other reasons, but these are the
principal ones why we have built up such
a large reserve of wheat and other grains.
The present situation as to wheat is something like this. There -are 400 million bushels
in country and terminal elevators and in
transit, and. there are 300 million bushels in
storage on farms. The 1957 wheat crop
amounts to approximately 350 million bushels.
If you add those figures together you will
find that at the begining of September, say,
we had on hand slightly more than 1 billion
bushels of wheat. Practically all that wheat
was grown and produced in the Palliser Triangle, an area which was once considered to
be unfit for the successful growing of wheat
or any other grain. I might add that from
30 to 50 million bushels of that wheat were
grown on farms located in the district from
which I come.
I should like to say a few words about the
disposal of wheat and other grains in the
crop year 1957-58. It is estimated that 150
million bushels of wheat will be used in
Canada and that 300 million bushels will be
exported. That will account for a total of
450 million bushels, and if this estimate turns
out to be correct we will have used up 1
million bushels of the old carryover before
the end of the crop year 1957-58, on July
31, 1958. However, at present the elevators
are full and the farmers are unable to deliver
much grain, so they have no cash to pay their
taxes, to meet their harvesting expenses and
store bills, and provide themselves with the
necessities for the coming winter.
This bill proposes to do something about
that situation, but before I go into that I want
to explain just how wheat and other grains
are marketed at the present time. I think
it is necessary to have an understanding of
that in order to appreciate the remarks I
intend to make.
All wheat, oats and barley must be sold to
and marketed through the Canadian Wheat
Board, except local sales of seed grain and
feed grain, and the like, which can be sold
locally if the producer can find a buyer. In
view of the congestion in the elevators the
Wheat Board has seen fit to provide each
producer with what is known as a permit
book or quota book. When the producer
takes a load of grain to the elevator he
produces his quota book, and if there is room

SENATE
in the elevator for the grain the elevator man
gives him a cash ticket for the initial payment
on that load and enters it in the book; so
that at all times, no matter where that producer markets his grain, the elevator agent
at the point where he takes the grain will
know exactly how much grain the producer
has marketed and will not allow him to
market any more than his quota. It stands to
reason that if the farmer is unable to get his
grain into the elevator he is also unable to
get any cash and will therefore find himself
in a poor cash position.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What quota is allowed?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Well, he has a 300bushel unit. In some places they have a
one-bushel quota, but that only gives the
farmer a few dollars, and he needs more
money than that. I shall give all of this
information later on.
While I am dealing with the marketing of
wheat, oats and barley, may I say that the
Wheat Board has no control over flax, rape
seed or rye. Any farmer growing these grains
can market them wherever be can find a
purchaser, and in most cases the elevators
have found room for a reasonable quantity
of flax and rape seed. The quota for flax
right now is five bushels per seeded acre.
Most producers who have grown flax have
marketed that number of bushels, and have
a little money on hand as the result of being
able to sell their five-bushel quota.
Honourable senators, I have said that ever
since 1950, or thereabouts, the farmers have
not been able to dispose of the fruits of their
labour and have been demanding that some
provision be made for cash advances on
grain that has had to be stored on their
farms, because they were unable to get it
into the elevators and therefore were unable
to sell it. Farmers have spent large sums
of money to build granaries and other forms
of storage to hold their grain safely until
such time as it could be marketed. I have
spoken on the question in this bouse on
several occasions. Promises have been made
in Parliament by the members of the present
Government, and also during the recent
election, to bring down legislation similar to
the provisions of this bill, which is intended
to implement those promises. No one for a
moment will claim that this is a cure-all,
but it is hoped that if the bill is passed it
will enable farmers who have grain on hand
and cannot get it into the elevator to receive
some money with which to pay their debts
and carry on through the winter. The bill
provides for cash advances to be made by
the Wheat Board on wheat, oats and barley
on the basis of a six-bushel quota per specified acre. The term "specified acre" may

need some explanation: If I have a quarter
section of land, and have 100 acres of it
under cultivation, my specified acreage is
100, and if there is a six-bushel quota I can
deliver at the elevator 600 bushels of wheat.
If I have a half section of land with 300
acres under cultivation, my specified acreage
would be 300 acres, and so on.
It is proposed to make a cash advance of
50 cents per bushel for wheat, 20 cents per
bushel for oats, and 35 cents per bushel for
barley on a quota of six bushels per specified
acre. Possibly I can explain that best by
giving some examples. We will take a 100acre specified acre farm with a quota of six
bushels per acre. Six bushels per acre on a
100-acre farm is 600 bushels. The producer
gets a cash advance of 50 cents a bushel on
those 600 bushels, which amounts to $300,
but this is in addition to the 300-bushel unit
which every producer is allowed to deliver
at the beginning of the crop year. The fact
that he bas already delivered his 300-bushel
unit does not prevent him from obtaining this
cash advance.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: How much does he
get on the 300-bushel unit? Does be get the
full price?
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Yes, he gets the full
price. He gets an initial payment, and the
balance when the Wheat Board makes further
payments.
In the case of oats, the producer gets for
100 specified acres a cash advance of 20 cents
a bushel on 1,500 bushels, which gives him
$300, and this puts him in the same class as
the man who is marketing wheat. In addition, be gets an 800-bushel unit, which every
oat producer is allowed to deliver at the
beginning of the crop year.
In the case of barley, if we take the samesized farm, the producer gets for 100 specified
acres a cash advance of 35 cents a bushel on
857 bushels, which gives him $300. In addition he delivers his 500-bushel unit, which
every barley producer is allowed to deliver
at the beginning of the crop year, and he
receives the money for that also.
By this scheme the men who grow grain,
whether wheat, oats or barley, are all placed
in the same position. The six-bushel quota
is the starting point.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Will my honourable friend
permit a question? This is a point on which
I am not very clear. Let me read the relevant
section in the bill.
The quantity of grain in respect of which an
advance payment may be made to a producer shall
not exceed the quantity that would be deliverable
under the applicant's current permit book on a
quota of six bushels per specified acre . . .

The six bushels refers to "grain", not to
wheat.

NOVEMBER 4, 1957
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: It is all based on wheat;
these other grains are being brought into line
with wheat. You have to have a starting
point; in other words, you cannot have one
quota for oats and another quota for barley.
The quota of six bushels per acre is the basis
for the starting of the arrangement, and, as
I have stated in the examples which I gave,
they come out evenly.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But I do not see where
that is provided for in this legislation.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I took it up with the
Minister of Trade and Commerce, and he
told me that was the case.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is provided for in the
legislation on the $3,000 basis. If you keep
that in mind, you will get it right.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: You may ask why the
amount per bushel is fixed at 50 cents for
wheat, 20 cents for oats and 35 cents for
barley. The reason is that we had to arrive
at a sum which would be somewhere near
one-half of what the farmer would receive.
By fixing the amount per bushel in that way
it obviates the expense of inspection, grading and that sort of thing. As honourable
senators know, there are five or six grades of
wheat, perhaps as many grades of barley, and
several grades of oats. In each case the
expense of inspection and grading is saved.
These cash advances will be made up until
June 1, 1958, and in subsequent years from
the beginning of the crop year, August 1,
until June 1 in the following year.
I should like to inform honourable senators
that there are approximately 231,000 permit
holders, and their 300-bushel units amount
in all to 69 million bushels. Perhaps I should
go further and mention that there are 62 million specified acres. By doing a little arithmetic, it is easy to figure out what would be
the total if everybody applied for a cash
advance. But of course everybody will not
apply.

Hon. Mr. Golding: Would the honourable
senator permit a question before he leaves
the marketing end of this scheme? It has
been stated to the house that an attempt is
being made to put the producers of wheat,
oats and barley on an equal level, or as
nearly equal as possible. Is that the suggested
plan?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I should like to know
whether as much difficulty is being experienced in the marketing of barley and oats as
in the marketing of wheat. That is my first
question.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think there is
very much difference. We are shipping feed
oats and barley to Ontario and the Maritimes
under the freight assistance arrangement.
Barley for malting purposes is an exception;
some producers have been able to grow malting barley and ship it out by the carload.
But that is taken into consideration in the
total amount which such a producer can
market.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Secondly, would the
honourable senator tell us what is the carryover in each case with respect to oats and
barley?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I do not have that
information for my friend tonight.
Hon. Mr. Golding: The point I wanted to
raise was, if these two grains are selling
freely without any heavy carryover, what is
the necessity of providing for them on the
same basis as is being provided with respect
to wheat growers?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: I can assure my honourable friend that there is a large carryover in
both oats and barley.
Hon. Mr. Golding: That is what I want to
know.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I shall try to get those
figures for my friend.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What would it amount

of the country. The banks will loan the
96702-7j

SENATE
money to the Canadian Wheat Board at 4j
per cent, subject to the guarantee of the
Minister of Finance.
I should like to impress on honourable
senators that the advances are not loans; no
interest will be charged to the recipients,
except in the case of default, when 6 per
cent will be charged until the amount is
paid up in full.
No objection should be made by honourable senators to the farmers getting these
interest-free advances. It will be remembered that when price controls were put on,
the millers of this country obtained wheat
for 77k cents a bushel, at a time when we
were selling wheat under the British Wheat
Agreement at $1.55 a bushel, and on the
open market for more than $2; and at the
same time wheat growers in the United
States were getting as high as $3.50 a bushel.
Honourable senators will remember when
we passed legislation to bring the British
Wheat Agreement into effect, and what happened. I spoke several times on the question
of losses under that agreement, and so did
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig). Under that arrangement
the farmers lost at least $500 million. So I
see no reason why anyone should object at
this time to the grain producers getting
interest-free advances. These advances are
bona fide part payments for grain. Formerly,
the farmer got an initial payment when the
grain was delivered to the elevator. Under
this arrangement he will get the advance
and deliver the grain later when the elevator
space is available.
Honourable senators should also know
that an agreement has been entered into between the Government and the elevator companies which will have charge of making
these cash advances on behalf of the Wheat
Board, whereby they will absorb 10 per cent
of the loss in respect of each individual
advance up to one-quarter of 1 per cent of
the total.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: How could there be
any loss?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: We do not expect there
will be any losses, for the reason that the
elevator people are fully conversant with the
affairs of practically every farmer who
delivers grain to the elevator, and no advance
will be made to a farmer without some
assurance that he has the grain and can subsequently deliver it to retire the debt.
It is believed that this system, which is
familiar to producers now, will result in
efficiency without unnecessary expense. Before the elevator agent makes an advance he
insists on an application being signed. This

application covers all details and is verified
by an affidavit. The farmer or producer also
gives a lien on the grain to the Canadian
Wheat Board. One-half of the initial payment
on each subsequent delivery is deducted and
applied by the elevator agent on the debt,
and the entry is made in the man's permit
book. For example, when the elevator man
makes the advance he enters in the permit
book the amount of the advance and al the
other details. When the producer brings
in wheat after a quota is set up he deducts
one-half of the initial payment on that
delivery and credits it to the debt in the
permit book and sends the money to the
Wheat Board.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Would the elevator
agent be permitted to deduct from that
advance other charges that a farmer might be
owing to, say, the implement dealer or to
someone else?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The object of these
advances is to enable the farmer to pay his
debts and I don't think there is any intention
of helping a farmer to get out of paying his
taxes or any bank loans that he may have
obtained under that act; it will depend on the
procedure that is followed as to whether or
not the elevator agent has to honour any of
those claims.
I want to say something further in favour
of this legislation, and that is that the small
farmer will benefit most. In spite of the fact
that there is a tendency in the Prairie provinces towards larger farms, most of the
farmers are still in the category of small
farmers.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What does that mean
in acreage?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I will give the figures:
31,299 permit holders are in the 100 specified
acre category.
63,272 permit holders are in the 100-200
specified acre category.
51,762 permit holders are in the 200-300
specified acre category.
31,206 permit holders are in the 300-400
specified acre category.
20,672 permit holders are in the 400-500
specified acre category.
12,160 permit holders are in the 500-600
specified acre category.
I have not given them all. That makes
210,371, out of a total of 231,000 permit
holders. The others are larger farmers.
I would like to say that only two permit
holders have between 7,000 and 8,000 of
specified acres-that means acreage under
cultivation. A permit holder would need to
have 1,000 specified acres, that is 1,000 acres
under cultivation, before he could secure the
limit under this legislation, which is $3,000.

NOVEMBER 4, 1957
I have certain examples here which might
be of interest to honourable senators. Take
the case of a man with 50 cultivated acres.
He gets his unit of 300, which brings him
in about '$370, and he gets 300 bushels, that
is 6 x 50 on which he receives 50 cents a
bushel, $150. So, even with a small farm like
that he gets altogether $520 with which to
carry on.
I could go on and give examples of 100acre farms, but I do not think that is
necessary. It is just a question of arithmetic.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Would you mind
putting them on the record?
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: Well, to do so I will
have to make computations here. I have
only one or two examples made up. I thought
they would be sufficient to show honourable
senators what was meant.
Now, honourable senators, this bill does
not repeal the Prairie Grain Producers
Interim Financing Act, which was amended
in 1957 to increase the amount of the loan
that a producer could obtain from $1500 to
$3,000. The amendment to that act was proclaimed some weeks ago, and provides for
the making of loans by the banks to producers with a Government guarantee. The
banks are charging 5 per cent interest for
that money. Under that act in 1955 and 1956
the amount of the loans that a producer
could obtain was fixed at a maximum of
$1,500. In the crop year 1955-1956, from
November 1 to May 31, 10,326 loans were
made by the banks. The average loan was
$764.46, and the total amount loaned was
only $8 million.
In the crop year 1956-1957, from November
1 to May 31, there were 6,117 loans made by
the banks to producers. The average loan
amounted to $647.04, and the total amount
loaned was only $4 million.
The farmers do not like that system of doing business. They do not want to pay interest on the product of their own labour.
So, recalling that there were 231,000 permit
holders, it can be said that comparatively
few took advantage of the act.
To my mind the advantages of this new
legislation, compared with the old, are four.
First, its benefits will be available to all
producers. It is not necessary to make application to a bank or banker, with risk of the
refusal one meets sometimes when one goes
to a bank to borrow money. In many cases
farmers who wished to borrow money under
the existing act were entirely unknown to the
local banker; they had to travel many miles
to the nearest branch, and the manager had
to investigate their entire financial standing
before he could advance them any money.
Under the proposed legislation advances will

be made by the elevator agent at the delivery
point. In the third place the advances will
be interest-free. Whereas, in the crop year
1956-57 loans for only $4 million were made,
if the present bill is passed the system for
which it provides will put in the hands of
the farmers between $100 million and $150
million, and the consequences will be of
great benefit to the whole economy of
Canada.
I believe, honourable senators, that I have
explained the principle of the bill. I do not
intend at this time to deal with it section by
section; that is not, in my opinion, the proper
way to deal with a measure of this kind. However, I think I should add that there are
provisions to deal with producers who make
default in connection with the repayment of
advances, and with those who obtain the advances by giving false information. Such
people will be liable to fine or imprisonient
or both.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does the honourable
senator intend that the bill shall go to
committee?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Yes. I have no doubt
that this evening the debate will be adjourned,
to be proceeded with tomorrow, and it is my
intention to move, either on Wednesday or
Thursday next, that as this is a money bill,
it be sent to the Banking and Commerce
Committee, at a meeting of which committee
the honourable Mr. Churchill, Minister of
Trade and Commerce, will be present.
I hope that I have explained the bill to the
satisfaction of honourable senators, and if
there are any questions I shall try to answer
them now.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Could the honourable
senator explain the meaning of section 5
subsection (1) (a)?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not see anything
wrong with it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I do not either, because
I do not know what it means.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The producer makes
his application and sets out the amount of
advance payment for which he makes the
application. Any points of this kind can be
dealt with in committee. I do not think we
should go into such matters when we are
dealing with the principle of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I understood the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) to state that the specified
limits for oats and barley would be 15
bushels and 8j bushels respectively. As I
read the bill, the only number of bushels
per acre- mentioned in it is 6, which I take

NOVEMBER 4, 1957
Board was brought into being by an order
-in council of the Government by virtue of
powers under the War Measures Act. Under
the order in council, wages and prices of
practically everything were frozen at their
existing level, with the exception of wheat,
which was left out of the order in council
because for many years it had been of a
very low order in price. It was considered
only fair to let the law of supply and demand operate so far as wheat was concerned
until the prices rose substantially higher.
It was not until September, 1943, that
wheat, again by order in council under the
Wartime Measures Act, was brought under
the control of the Wartime Prices and Trade
Board. There it remained for some time after
the war. In 1946 the Government of the day
negotiated with the United Kingdom an
agreement known as the United Kingdom
Wheat Agreement. I am not going into the
details of that agreement. It is not necessary
on the present occasion to do so, but under
that agreement the compulsory feature was
incorporated in the order in council and it
was provided that the Wheat Board would
have complete control of the selling of wheat.
At that time oats and barley were not
included.
In 1947, it will be recalled, legislation was
brought in to validate this agreement which
had been made under the Emergency Powers
Act. Well, I just wish to say in passing that
in my judgment and in the judgment of men
more competent to form a judgment on the
matter than I, the wheat farmers of western
Canada lost at least $500 million under the
operation of that agreement and during the
first period of operation of the subsequent
International Wheat Agreement. I wish honourable senators to note this, for I do think
it is important, that not only did the Prairie
wheat growers subsidize the British consumers at a price of $1.55 a bushel Fort William
during the first two years of the agreement,
but they subsidized the Canadian bread consumers at the same price, and during all this
time the Wheat Board was selling wheat outside the British Wheat Agreement at much
higher prices, as high at one time as $3.40 a
bushel.
It is worth while keeping that in mind. I
-do not deny for a moment that much foolish
talk comes from some of the farm leaders in
western Canada in respect of wheat marketing. But there is no doubt that they did
suffer. The British Government withdrew
from the International Wheat Agreement at
the expiration of the first agreement.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald:
years?

After how many

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Three years. The first
International Wheat Agreement was negotiated in 1949 and, it overlapped the British
Wheat Agreement by one year. At the end
of the first three-year period of the International Wheat Agreement the British withdrew because they did not wish to tie themselves to buy under an agreement. Now, this
all arose because the agricultural economy of
Europe was broken to smithereens by the
war. It was not until five or six years later
that Europe's agricultural economy became
sufficiently re-established that it could produce nearly the same volume of food stuffs
as they had before the war. Those international agreements are still in effect; I think
the present one expires in about 1960 or
1961-I am not certain.
While this was going on in Canada the
United States followed a policy of price supports for farmers, not only for wheat farmers, but cotton growers, tobacco growers, and
many other producers on a somewhat different principle. They said quite frankly,
"We are going to support the farmer at this
point, and are going to charge the difference
up to the Treasury." We did not do that in
Canada, and I think we were wise in not
doing .so. The policy followed by the United
States is one which they have great difficulty
in getting away from, and which everyone
who has any responsibility in government
wants to get away from. I have stated before
in this house, when the matter was under discussion, that it was costing the American
taxpayer over $1 million a day to pay the
storage on all the commodities on which the
United States Government had given advances. I mention it because of its effect on
the United States, as well as Canada, particularly over the past four or five years,
during which time an effort has been made
to maintain prices for wheat at as high a
level as possible. I have always been convinced that the ultimate effect was that we
are holding the umbrella over high-cost producing countries. If the old law of supply
and demand had been allowed to operate our
farmers in western Canada would have received the very high prices that obtained for
five or six years after the war, but would
have received very much lower prices in
successive years. On balance, however, I am
convinced they would have been ahead.
Honourable senators, that gives the background.
Now, under the compulsory Wheat Board
legislation no farmer could deliver a bushel
of wheat for sale outside the boundaries of
the province in which he resided until he
had a permit from the Wheat Board to do
so. That is the origin of the permit book to

SENATE
which the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) alluded in his
explanation of this bill. That, of course,
introduces great rigidity into the whole
system of marketing.
It has been argued that one cannot differentiate in a matter of this kind between
one section of the community and another.
The honourable senator from Huron-Perth
(Hon. Mr. Golding) raised the question of why
it was necessary to include oats and barley.
Can the farmer not sell those grains? He can
if he is free to do it and can get cars to ship
them, just the same as wheat. But the
accumulation of wheat, as the honourable
senator from Rosetown said, amounted at
July 31 last to over 700 million bushels,
with a new crop of 350 million bushels to be
harvested a few weeks later. That has
created a congestion, and the barley and oat
farmers are in the same position as the
wheat farmers-they cannot get cars or space
to market their grain. For that reason they
are necessarily entitled to the same consideration as the wheat farmers are getting
under this legislation.
May I draw attention to another matter
which was alluded to by the honourable
senator from Rosetown, that is, the Prairie
Grain Producers Interim Financing Act. I
rather gathered from the tone of his remarks
that he did not think very much of that act,
which was introduced by the late Government to provide cash advances to farmers
against grain on their farms which they
could not deliver to markets because of the
congestion.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Not cash advances, but
bank loans.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend is
very alert tonight, and he is anticipating
what I am going to say. The method used
under that legislation was advances through
the banks. In other words, an arrangement
was made with the banks by which they
made a loan to the farmer at an interest rate
of 5 per cent, and the Government guaranteed the banks in the event of loss up to a
certain small percentage of the loss. The advantage of that method was that it left the
Wheat Board free of dealing with this matter
altogether; it also left the elevator agents
free of dealing with it altogether. In addition, the bank could take security on the
grain under section 88 of the Bank Act, and
the farmer was then obligated to repay it,
and if be did not do so he was criminally
responsible.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Civilly, not criminally.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: Civilly, yes; I used the
wrong word. I am not a legal man, and consequently I get these phrases mixed up
sometimes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You do pretty well.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But under this bill we
are now considering the Wheat Board makes
the advances to the elevator companies. The
Wheat Board gets the money to do so, under
a provision of the bill, whereby the Minister
of Finance gives the banks a guarantee for
the amount required, and the money is made
available through the Wheat Board to the
elevator agents at the thousands of country
elevators scattered over the prairies. The
elevator agent then makes the advance direct
to the farmer. What he will do, in all likelihood, is to issue the farmer a cash ticket,
which he could not do under the Grain Act,
but which he can do under this measure,
since the provision of the Grain Act in this
respect is set aside. The farmer then gets
his money, and he is supposed to repay it
within that crop year.
The first observation I wish to make about
that is that it will increase very greatly the
clerical work of the Wheat Board, and especially the clerical work of these elevator
agents.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have not heard the
elevator agents complaining about the money
they are making and which they are getting
as the result of all this storage.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Of course, they are not
complaining. Why should they?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Let them do a little
more work and earn it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They are agreeable to
this, too.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, that is one interesting method of getting back at them.
I know something of the responsibility
that the elevator agent has-he is the man
who manages the elevator for his company
-in taking these applications. If honourable
senators will refer to section 4 of the bill
they will get an idea of the amount of work
involved. When the farmer has completed
the application, be then signs an agreement
that he will repay the loan by the delivery
of grain, and he receives his cash advance.
But before that is done he has to make an
affidavit declaring that the statements be has
made to the elevator operator are true and
correct.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Is this a loan or an advance payment?
Hon. Mr, Crerar: It is not a loan. It is an
advance payment, on grain to be delivered

NOVEMBER 4, 1957
later. The elevator agent will issue the
farmer a cash ticket, but delivery of the
grain is deferred. But as I have said, before
he can receive the advance he must make
the application, sign the undertaking, and
prepare the affidavit stating that the facts as
set forth are true and correct.
I notice, although it is not very important
at the moment, that the bill makes no provision, as is usual in legislation of this kind,
as to who is qualified to take the affidavit.
There was a question raised, I believe by
the honourable Leader on this side (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), as to how losses would arise.
While there were some small losses under
the method by which banks made loans to
the farmers, the losses, if any, which would
arise under this arrangement would probably be very small in amount. But a farmer
who receives a cash advance may say to
himself, "True, I owe this amount to the
Government, but the Government has lots
of money". So, he sells his farm, his grain
and everything and moves away.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: How can he sell his

would that be if the grain had been consumed? But I have in mind another section,
which I am unable to find at the moment,
which states that the claim of the board has
priority over all other claims.
Now, I am not a lawyer, but as I see it, if
some other resident in the community has a
registered lien on the grain-for whatever
consideration you may like-will that lien
not be a prior lien to the claim of the Wheat
Board? This is a matter which occurred to
me as I was reading the bill, and it is a
matter for the lawyers to discuss.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And for the committee to discuss.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Yes, for the committee
too. I think that it is a matter that should
be cleaned up.

That refers to sub-

Hon. Mr. Crerar: No.
Let me give an illustration-and I am
afraid I am not making myself clear at all
tonight. A farmer has grain in his granary;
he owes an implement company, a bank or
someone else, who takes a lien on his grain.
That is a common practice in western
Canada. Then if he does not pay his debt
they take his grain.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: They do not do that
any more, because if they take a lien on grain,
they cannot sell it anyway, as they have no
permit.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That is not quite the
point I have in mind. If there is a prior lien
on the grain-and there may be under a
provincial law-what is the meaning of
stating in this bill that a lien to the Wheat
Board has priority over everything else? I
may be entirely wrong on the matter, but
I do think that when the bill is at the committee stage we should have a full explanation on it.
I do not wish anyone to get the impression
that I am opposed to this legislation. I think
under the circumstances it is necessary. I
doubt very much, however, if it is better than
the method of making loans through banks,
as has obtained for the last few years. There
is of course the advantage, as the honourable
senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine)
has pointed out, that this is really a purchase
of grain with a deferred delivery; and in
that case the farmer gets the money and pays
no interest on it. However, interest is paid
on that money, and it comes from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
The second point my honourable friend
made is-and I must admit there is some
force to it-that it is frequently not convenient for a farmer to go to a bank and
get a loan. He bas elevator agents within a
few miles of him, whereas he might have
to travel 15, 20, 35 or even 40 miles to reach
a bank. Unquestionably here is an advantage
in that respect; but on the other hand against
that we have to recognize that there will be
a great increase in cost for the Wheat Board
staff in looking after the detail of the several
hundred thousand loans, if they are made.
It means a great deal of additional work for
elevator agents, and the only thing that the
Treasury will pay is the interest and the
losses, if any losses occur. All the other
incidental expenses that I speak of-the

necessary clerical help, the printing, the forms
and everything else-are all to be charged
to Wheat Board funds, and consequently,
when the final adjustment for the year is
made, will be a deduction from the total
receipts going to the farmers. It is worth
trying out, but the one thing I do wish to
say before I sit down is that I think it is
important to get a clear understanding of
the problem as it affects the farmers.
One other point has just occurred to me,
and that is the criticism that has been made
that this is a discrimination in favour of the
farmers. Well, that can be argued. There are
pulpwood producers, I am told, who cannot
sell their pulpwood today because the pulp
mills are unable to find a market for their
product. Well, it would be just as reasonable
for the Government to come to their assistance and say, "We will buy your pulpwood
and give you a cash payment on it and you
can deliver it later on." The same point
applies to all other primary products. The
fishing industry is not in too good shape
today.
There is a principle running all through
this legislation that I think should have the
serious consideration of Parliament. There
is one difference, however, in respect of grain
and that arises because the marketing of
grain today is a state monopoly. A farmer
is not free to sell his wheat outside of the
province where he lives for any price he
might be willing to accept. I think those
circumstances place wheat in a little different
category from these other things that I have
mentioned.
Hon. Calveri C. Prat: Honourable senators,
just to set the record clear as I see it, I would
like to refer to one matter which the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) dealt with a moment ago. He
referred to the British Wheat Agreement and
the loss which the farmers of Canada suffered
under that agreement, which I think extended over a period of three or four years.
I had a close connection with this issue at
that time, and being a resident of Newfoundland, which was then a foreign country
as far as that wheat disposal was concerned,
I can state from first-hand knowledge that the
agreement did not result in the direct loss
to the farmers of Canada which the honourable senator indicated.
When the British Wheat Agreement was
made Canada had an assured market in
Great Britain for, I think, practically the
whole of the wheat requirements of that
country. The very next day after that
assured market was created by the signing
of the agreement the price of flour to all
foreign markets of Canada was increased.

NOVEMBER 4, 1957
In Newfoundland the report came out in the
evening of the day on which the agreement
was signed, and I remember it well. Next
morning the quotations came in from the
flour millers of Canada advancing the price
to the same level as in all foreign markets,
so that less than 400,000 people in Newfoundland paid an increased price which on
800,000 sacks, the equivalent of a year's
requirement, would amount to an increase
of about $1 million.
That price was increased the next year and again the following
year, and there was a time when Newfoundland consumers paid an increased price equal
to $1,250,000 per year on a year's purchase
of flour while the British Wheat Agreement
was in force. Foreign prices had all gone up
over the level that had previously prevailed,
and that was the offsetting factor for the
reduction to farmers under the British Wheat
Agreement. It was the stabilizing effect of
that agreement which permitted the advanced prices in foreign markets.
I thought I should make that clear, honourable senators. I have often heard it said
that the farmers were penalized by that
agreement. The amount of recovery by the
increase in foreign prices was tremendous.
I know that personally, because I was a
member of a committee which took the
matter up with the Newfoundland Government to try to get Newfoundland brought in
under that agreement. Of course, our efforts
were not successful, because the agreement
applied only to Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I say a word about
that, honourable senators?
Before the British Wheat Agreement came
into effect, at the beginning of the crop year
in 1946, the first of August, the prices that
governed were the wartime prices and the
Wheat Board prices for wheat, which then
were lower than the negotiated price with
the United Kingdom. But as the honourable
senator from St. John's West (Hon. Mr.
Pratt) states, Newfoundland did not parConsequently
ticipate in the agreement.
Newfoundland was in the same position as
Holland or Denmark or any other country,
and paid what was known then as the world
market price for wheat. That explains why
flour prices in Newfoundland advanced in
the way they did after the war.

PRIVATE BILL
BELL TELEPHONE COMPANY OF CANADAMOTION FOR THIRD READINGDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
October 31, the debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Golding for the third reading of
Bill C, respecting The Bell Telephone Company of Canada.
Hon. P. H. Bouffard: Honourable senators,
it is getting late, and I do not want to be
very long. May I first excuse myself for the
fact that, owing to uncontrollable circumstances, I could not be here on Thursday,
when the third reading of this bill was
moved. I wish especially to thank all honourable senators for the great courtesy they
have shown me when dealing with this matter
in my absence. All of them-those who were
not entirely satisfled as to the meaning of the
bill, as well as those who were-have shown
me extreme courtesy, and it makes me the
more appreciative of belonging to an assembly which is so kind to every one of its
members.
Certain members of the committee which
dealt with the bill expressed doubt whether
the effect of section 2 would not be to interfere to a certain extent with provincial legislation, especially as regards the securities
commissions which operate in practically
every province for the prevention of fraud.
Certainly any such intention never entered
the minds of the company or any of its
officers, including the eminent lawyer who
drafted the bill-and whom, I believe, most
of you have seen before the committee. He
assuredly never believed that federal legislation could, in any way, shape or form, cancel
or invalidate that provincial legislation which
was declared by the Privy Council to be
within the jurisdiction of the provinces. His
contention that no provincial laws are violated is based on the case of Lymburn et al
versus Mayland. In that case securities commission legislation was attacked as being unconstitutional, and the Privy Council decided
unanimously that there was nothing unconstitutional about this legislation, and that all
these provincial commissions entrusted with
the supervision of sale of securities rightly

existed and operated in each province, notwithstanding the fact that federally incorporated companies would be subject to these
commissions. Since that time there has been
no judgment of any court in which so much
as an attempt has been made to question the
constitutionality of any provincial legislation
relating to commissions regulating the sales
of securities. I repeat, therefore, that this was
not in the mind of those responsible for
drafting the bill.
It may seem to some honourable senators
that the validation of issues of this kind by
the federal authority is an encroachment upon
provincial legislation. I met today with the
honourable senator from Mille Isles (Hon.
Mr. Monette), who spoke on this matter at
the last sitting of the Senate, and I assured
him that nothing of the kind was intended.
The company certainly feels that no legislation passed by the central Goverment would
enable a company to avoid provincial laws. At
any rate, I informed the honourable gentleman that I would be glad to second any
amendment that would clarify this legislation
in the minds of honourable senators. The
company never intended to bypass necessary
"blue sky" laws, which come under the
exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces.
I would like to comment briefly on the
possibility of not sending this bill back to
committee. As honourable senators know,
time is limited for the handling of private
bills in the House of Commons. If before
the session ends the company is not authorized
to increase its capital stock it will not be
able to go through with its financing and
expend a proposed $198 million on work
during 1958. This will mean unemployment
for many, and a large number of applicants
for telephone service will not be able to get
it. The company will not be able to make
certain improvements needed to enable it to
give the kind of service it would like to give.
It seems to me that a debate could be held
now in this chamber and, if necessary, an
amendment could be made to clarify the
special situation which has already been
discussed. If the amendment met with the
approval of honourable senators it could be
adopted and the bill could be read the third
time and sent to the House of Commons as
soon as possible.
BILL AMENDED

Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators, I am pleased with the explanation just
given by the honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard). May I
assure the house that I have no intention of
delaying passage of this bill. Last Thursday
when the honourable leader opposite (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) moved the adjournment of

NOVEMBER 4, 1957
the debate on third reading of the bill, I
immediately agreed to withdraw my motion
that the bill be referred back to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications for further consideration. At that time
I had not had an opportunity to discuss the
bill with the honourable senator from
Grandville, but we met today and went over
the bill together. We fell into immediate
agreement that there was no desire on the
part of the Bell Telephone Company to avoid
the authority of the provincial securities
commissions, but I express my surprise as
to the wording which appeared in section 2
of the bill, although I am sure that the company had no intention to disregard any
authority. The bill makes only one condition
as to the validity therein decreed of the issue
as well as of the sale of capital stock, namely,
that such issue and sale be in accordance with
the approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada.
In view of the well-known rule in law that
if you make an exception for one particular
case you are not supposed to extend the
exception to other cases, some honourable
senators on both sides of this house felt that
it appeared as though the company wished to
disregard the authority of the provinces.
There is no doubt that the authority of the
provinces would have been maintained by
the courts; but this would have entailed
litigation and certain difficulties, and innocent parties would have been put to expense.
I explained my point of view to the
honourable senator who sponsored the bill
(Hon. Mr. Bouffard) and we came to an
agreement which is embodied in an amendment that I wish to move. Therefore,
honourable senators, I move, seconded by
the honourable senator from Grandville:
That section 2 of the bill be amended by inserting
after the word "stock." on page 2, line 6, the
following:
Subject to any applicable legislation relating to
the issue, sale or disposition of securities by
corporations,

The last sentence of section 2 would then
read:
Subject to any applicable legislation relating to
‡he issue, sale or disposition of securities by
corporations, the issue, sale or other disposition of
capital stock by the company in accordance with
such approval shall be legal and valid for ail
purposes.

Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I
inove the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I would suggest that we might approve the
amendment and then if the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croll)

wishes to speak on the bill he can adjourn
the debate on third reading. If he is not prepared to speak tonight, perhaps we could
still dispose of the amendment now.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I do not want to be
misunderstood. If the house is prepared to
sit longer, I am prepared to speak.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I suggest that we dispose of the amendment first.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I have
not yet got the full significance of the point
of the amendment, and I should like to hear
from some of the members who have been
discussing the matter, to ascertain what their
opinion is.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The purpose of the
amendment is to make more clear that all
legislation, whether provincial or federal, concerning the issue, sale or other disposition

of the stock, shall continue to be valid and
applicable.
That is all that it seeks to
clarify.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Al right.
The Hon. the Acting Speaker: Honourable
senators, the question is on the motion of
the Honourable Senator Monette, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Bouffard, to amend
clause 2 of Bill C by inserting after the word
"stock." in line 6 on page 2 of the bill, the
following:
Subject to any applicable legislation relating to,
the issue, sale or disposition of securities by
corporations,

Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Reid: On division.
The amendment was concurred in, on
division.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Croll, the debate
on the motion for third reading of the bill
was adjourned.

consideration. However, so far as I am concerned this discussion left much to be
desired. Quite a number of points that were
raised were not cleared up to my satisfaction
nor, I am sure, to that of many other
honourable senators. I was glad to know
that it is the intention of the honourable
senator who introduced the bill to recommend that it be sent to committee. That
course, in my opinion, is the right one, and
no doubt in that way we shall get a lot of
information which we desire to have, and
possibly we may be able to improve the
bill. When this "Act to provide for advance
payment for prairie grain prior to delivery
thereof" was introduced, it was hailed as a
means of solving a great problem with which
this country is faced. We were given to
understand that at last a solution had been
found to a great question which has occupied
Parliament for many years, and that now
we could turn our attention to something
else. But it is evident, honourable senators,
that the problem of the sale and disposal of
wheat remains as insoluble as ever. It is
with us today, and will remain, though this
bill is passed, as acute at is has been over
the years.
I think honourable senators will agree
with me that there is only one solution, and
that is to sell the wheat. We have to dispose
of it. There are those who say we should
curtail wheat production, but I do not line
up with them. In the United States they
had what they called a soil bank, but from
what I understand that scheme did not work
satisfactorily. I think it would be very difficult to say to western Canadian farmers
that they are not to grow wheat on their
wonderful wheat-producing lands. To my
way of thinking the solution is to dispose of
the wheat.
We have been doing fairly well in selling
wheat over the years. It is true we have not
sold as much as we have produced; but we
have sold a considerable amount. The honourable senator from Rosetown when speaking last night gave the impression that we
had not been able to sell our wheat. He was
talking about the production of wheat, and
he is reported at the bottom of the first
column of page 95 of Hansard as saying:
As a result of the congestion the producers have
not been able to sell their grain
Well, is that so? Then he went on to say:
and so have not been able to get the necessary
funds to carry on.
The fact is that every year millions of
bushels of wheat have been sold. The honourable gentleman from Rosetown even said

so himself. I quote from his remarks in the
second column of page 95:
The present situation as to wheat is something
like this. There are 400 million bushels in country
and terminal elevators and in transit, and there are
300 million bushels in storage on farms. The 1957
wheat crop amounts to approximately 350 million
bushels.
That makes 1,050 million bushels. Then in
the next paragraph he said:
It is estimated that 150 million bushels of wheat
will be used in Canada
And of course it will be sold in Canada.
and that 300 million bushels will be exported.
And of course that wheat too will be sold
if it is exported. This means that during the
coming year the estimated sale of Canadian
wheat will amount to 450 million bushels.
Therefore it is not correct to say that as a
result of what has taken place the western
farmers have not been able to sell their
grain and so have not been able to get the
necessary funds to carry on.
It is true they have not been able to sell
their grain as soon as it is harvested, but
over the years a huge quantity has been
sold. Many hundreds of millions of dollars
have come into Canada from the sale of
Canadian wheat, and of course this money
has gone to the farmers who produced the
grain. That is as it should be. But I mention
this to point out that we have not been entirely without the revenue which comes from
the sale of three or four hundred million
bushels of wheat every year.
Honourable senators, when the present
administration came into power we all had
great expectations as to what would occur
as a result of the new trade policy. We
looked forward to great things, and we
thought that Canada's trade would be greater
than it ever had been in the past. But what
happened? We are more confused about this
trade problem today than we have ever been
before. We cannot see the daylight. I hope
it is there, and that the problem will be
solved. We find, however, that shortly after
the new Government came into power the
Prime Minister went to the Commonwealth
Prime Ministers' meeting in London, England, and made a proposal that 15 per cent
of our purchases from the United States
should be diverted to the United Kingdom.
We did not take any objection to that proposal,
if it can be done, nor do I think the
people of Canada took any objection, but that
statement was scarcely in the press when
shortly afterward another minister went to
the United States and boldly and courageously
told the Americans that we did not like
the way they were doing business, especially
their give-away policy with respect to wheat.
Shortly after that there was a meeting at Mont

SENATE
Tremblant, and we were all startled when a
proposal was made that we should have complete free trade with the United Kingdom.
That proposal did not come from our Government, but nevertheless it was made, and we
were becoming perplexed. A short time later
another minister, probably one who had been
at those conferences, went to Washington, and
again the Americans were boldly told that we
did not like their way of doing business, especially their give-away policy in connection
with wheat. Then there was a hurried trip by
the Minister of Trade and Commerce to London. We thought something might come out of
that. The minister returned and, despite our
hopes, nothing has come out of it yet. Again,
a minister went to New York with a hat in
one hand and a club in the other, and he
also told the American people that we do
not like the way they are doing business,
especially their give-away policy. That minister has scarcely returned home, when another minister is off to Geneva, and of course
we hope something will come of this. And
now what do we hear? Well, we hear that
the ministers are going to China to sell goods
to that country. Honourable senators, we
trust these endeavours will produce the desired results, but I must say that none of us
can see the daylight; it seems more like a
Chinese puzzle to us than anything else. The
problem is truly there.
Again, we were amazed just at the end of
last week when we read that India was to
get $7 million worth of wheat under the
Colombo Plan. Under that plan India or any
other country does not pay dollars or sterling
-in fact, does not pay anything-for what it
gets. So what are we doing? I am in favour
of the Colombo Plan, wholeheartedly in
favour of it, but what are we doing? Are we
now going to compete with the United States
give-away policy in connection with wheat?
Is that the proposal? We do not like it when
the United States gives away wheat, and we
have complained to them for doing so. Are
we now saying that we, too, are going to
give away wheat? If that is the policy of the
Government I think we should know it. I
repeat that I am strongly in favour of anything that we can do under the Colombo Plan.
This year the former Government provided
for an expenditure of $34.4 million under the
Colombo Plan. The present Government has
increased that to $35.4 million. How is that
expenditure distributed? Honourable senators, as far as I can make out we have not
given any wheat to India under that plan
since 1953. We have been using that money
for the payment of metals, for capital projects, and for sending people to India in order
to give certain technical assistance. So the
$7 million which during the last few years

has been paid largely to Canadian industries
for capital goods is now not going to be paid
to them. I am not here to say that Canadian
industries are more entitled to it than is the
Wheat Board, but when we divert it from
the industries to wheat it means that $7
million less will be going into the industries
of this country for wages and so forth. That
is what the shift means. And I ask you,
honourable senators, whether at this time,
when the industrial picture and the employment situation is not too bright, is it advisable to make the shift now from industry to
the Wheat Board. I say that is the only way
in which this gift of $7 million in wheat can
be carried out.
Honourable senators, may I now turn to
the bill itself? I was disturbed last night
during the discussion on clause 10 of the bill
relating to liens. Clause 10 reads:
Where the board bas made an advance payment
to a producer, the board bas a lien for the amount
thereof on the grain in respect of which the
advance payment was made.

There is no information here as to whether

this is a first lien or second lien, or whether
it has priority over any other lien. Now, I
understand-and if J am wrong some honourable senator from the west can correct methat if a farmer neglects to pay his taxes
the municipality has a lien on whatever
he possesses for the payment of those taxes.
If I am wrong I stand to be corrected, but
if I am right I want to know which lien
cornes first, that of the Wheat Board or that
of the township.
I understand provision is made under the
Prairie Grain Producers Interim Financing
Act that a bank can take a lien on the produce of a farmer; that I am told can be done
under section 88 of the Bank Act. If that is
so, which lien comes first, that of the township, that of the Wheat Board or that of the
bank? This is a question which was not
answered satisfactorily last evening; I hope
that when the bill goes to committee the
matter will be definitely settled, and that if
necessary the bill will be amended.
One further matter was not, in my opinion,
disposed of satisfactorily last evening: I refer
to the affidavit which the farmer has to make
before he gets his advance. Who draws the
affidavit, and before whom is it sworn? Does
the farmer have to go to a lawyer who prepares the affidavit for him and then acts as
commissioner in the taking of the affidavit,
for all of which the farmer has to pay the
lawyer? I am not practising law in western
Canada, so I cannot speak for myself. But
does the farmer have to go to this trouble
and expense?

NOVEMBER 5, 1957
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No. All the elevator
operators are commissioners for taking oaths
and they can swear the affidavit.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And do they prepare
the affidavits?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The affidavits are
printed.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Thank you for that
information.
Further, I should like to know how the
additional expense in connection with the
administering of this legislation will be
handled. It is obvious that the board will
have to take on a great many more employees, and additional expense will be
incurred in connection with this legislature.
Is that to be paid out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund, or will it be a charge against
the farmers when they get their final
payment?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is going to be paid by
the Government, of course.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I fail to see anything
in this bill to that effect. All I see in that
connection is that the Government will pay
all interest charges, and any losses less 10
per cent. According to the bill, al other
expenses are to be charged up against the
money the board gets when it sells the
wheat, and the farmer is going to have to
bear his share.
Honourable senators, I feel that the farmers
will be rather disappointed with this legislation. It was introduced because the Prairie
Grain Producers Interim Financing Act was
not satisfactory, in that the farmers were not
able to borrow enough money. It will be
recalled that in 1956 that act was amended
to increase the limit of borrowing by farmers
from $1,500 to $3,000. Under that legislation
the farmers now can borrow up to $3,000. But
under the bill now before us a farmer must
have 1,000 specified acres to qualify for an
advance of $3,000. If he has fewer than
1,000 specified acres he cannot possibly get
$3,000. Now, how many farmers in western
Canada can qualify for 1,000 specified acres?
I thank the honourable senator from Rosetown for the figures he put on page 98 of
Hansard last evening. He pointed out that
there was a 'total qf 231,000 permit holders.
He gave' the breakdown of the number of
permit holders for the 100-200 specified acre
category, the 200-300, the 300-400 and so on
up to the 500-600 specified acre category. I
have added up these figures and I find. that
there are 146,333 farmers in the 300 specified
acre category or lower. That is to say, out
of 231,000 permit holders, 146,000-or about
65 per cent-have 300 specified acres or less.
Now, a farmer with 300 specified acres will

get the 6-bushel quota, or a total of 1,800
bushels, and at 50 cents a bushel he can get
an advance of $900. And mark my words,
that is merely an advance, not a gift, for this
money has to be paid back. That farmer
could go to the bank and borrow $900 at 5 per
cent for a year, at a cost of $45. But he does
not have the $900 for the year. The longest
time he can have it is nine months. An
honourable senator suggests it is ten months,
but I would say nine. It has to be paid back
before the next crop year. He does not have
the $900 throughout the whole term of nine
months because as he takes his wheat to the
elevator he has to pay back part of the money.
So we will say he has the $900 for six months
on an average, and at 5 per cent that would
cost him $22.50. So, all that about 65 per
cent of the farmers of western Canada can
get out of this legislation in dollar value in
one year is $22.50.
Now, honourable senators, I don't blame a
lot of them at all for being disappointed. I
think that during the last election campaign
they were given to understand-I was not in
western Canada at the time and I stand to
be corrected if I am wrong-that there would
be a change.
Hon. Mr. Haig: So there is.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They thought they
would not have to avail themselves of the
provisions of the Prairie Grain Producers
Interim Financing Act but would be able
to get money some other way. Formerly
they told us they needed $3,000, and we
amended that act so that they could get
that amount. They were not satisfied with
that; they said they could not get along with
it, but would take the $3,000. And what
do we find they can get now? We find they
can obtain $600, for a period of less than
nine months.
How can they get along? Well, there is
one think I like about this bill, namely,
that it does not repeal the Prairie Grain
Producers Interim Financing Act. That act
remains in force, and that is a very good
thing. This is one reason why I am in favour
of the bill. If the Interim Financing Act were
repealed the present bill would be practically
useless, but in combination with the Prairie
Grain Producers Interim Financing Act the
bill will be of some help to the farmer. However, I am sure it does not measure up at
all to the expectations of those who feel they
do need more money and need it soon.
Well, honourable senators, I repeat that
this bill does not solve the problein of how
to dispose of surplus wheat. As I said at
the outset, the problem cen only be solved.

the Government for what it has done. I
hope it will keep up its efforts and be
successful this year in exporting the largest
quantity of wheat that has been shipped from
Canada in many years.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I promise the house I will not delay it long.
As I listened to the address of my honourable
friend my mind took me back to a night
around the 24th of May, 1957, at a little town
called Morris in Manitoba. Dear old Morris.
At a meeting held there that evening a
very distinguished parliamentarian who was
supposed to know more about the grain
trade and the Canada Grain Act than any
other man in Canada-or, in fact, in the
worldgot up and told what wonderful
things he had done for the farmers of Canada,
especially those of Manitoba.
When the
ballots were counted on the 10th of June the
Liberal party had elected one member, and
that from a city seat. Not a single member
of the Liberal party was selected from rural
Manitoba. That speech did it. And he was
not a Conservative either. He told much the
same story as my honourable friend just now
told us.
What are the facts of the case? Who
started this wheat business? Who started
this piling up of wheat? Did the Conservatives do it? No. It was started about five
or six years ago when the crops were good
and it was impossible to sell all the wheat
that was produced. The fact is that today,
after you sell 400 million bushels-you won't
sell that much, but whatever you do selyou will still have over 700 million bushels
of wheat still on hand.
Now, my honourable friend says we are
doing with India what the Americans are
doing to the rest of the world in regard to
the disposal of wheat. No, honourable
senators, we are not. We promised the
Indian people some $35 million, and part of
that money was to be paid over in the form
of machinery from Canada. But, instead of
taking all that money in machinery they are
taking part of it in wheat. For goodness'
sake, can't we give the farmers a little
chance against industry? Can't we allot $7
million out of the $35 million to the producers of wheat? Must industry from Brantford and all the other industrial centres
receive the whole of the $35 million? Surely
the farmers can have $7 million of it. That is
all we are doing. We are not giving it away,
we are simply carrying out the promise we
made.
Hundreds of people in Canada have suggested to the Wheat Board that we should
give our wheat to the peoples of the world
who are hungry.

Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the argument they
make. We are not even doing that. We are
giving it to the people to whom we promised
to give $35 million cash value or cash equivalent. So that argument fails.
Now we come to the question of whether
this bill will solve the surplus wheat problems. Of course it will not do that. How in
the world does anybody expect that any
body of men can dispose of a carryover of
700 million bushels of wheat when our
average yearly sale to the world is now 300
million bushels? We can never catch up on
that carryover as long as the crops remain
good. The United States could not do it, so
they are giving wheat away; and not only
wheat, but oats and barley.
Honourable senators, the new Government has found the situation to be as follows.
Today the farmers of the Prairie provinces
are faced with this tremendous problem. I
am reminded of an expression which I remember as well as though I heard it yesterday. When I was a boy in Manitoba, and
a newcomer entered the district to farm
there, my father, who for quite a few years
was reeve of the municipality, would make
it his business to meet him and when he
came home my mother would ask, "Well
Joseph, what kind of a man is this Mr.
Smith?" If my father replied, "My dear, he
is just as good as the wheat", it meant that
he was all right, for that was the highest
recommendation which could be given a
man. But since then I have learned that to
be "just as good as the wheat" is to be good
for nothing, because we cannot sell our
wheat and we cannot do anything else
with it.
It is not my intention to criticize anyone
or any body for adopting a wheat policy
which is past and gone, but for goodness'
sake let us not accuse the new Government
of being responsible for the unsold grain
which is piling up in the west. This Government did not pile it up. When I was Leader
of the Opposition in this house I was bitterly
opposed to the wheat legislation then recommended to us; in fact I used the strongest
language I could think of about it. I predicted that it would be an absolute failure,
that it would not enable us to sell on the
world's markets against world competition.
Some people in my part of the country tried
to corner the wheat market, but they never
succeeded. It is a commodity which grows
almost everywhere on earth, and other foods
can, in case of necessity, be substituted for
it. The result is that people in other countries can never be reduced to a condition
where they must buy wheat at almost any

NOVEMBER 5. 1957
price. When prices on the United States
market varied from $2 to $2.50 a bushel I
was sure the day would come when we
should have to accept half that price.
Honourable senators will recall that, at the
time of the International Wheat Agreement,
the British Government offered us $2 per
bushel. We demanded $2.05.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That was a mistake.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was an absolute blunder.
We rejected the $2, but the market price
soon fell much below that figure. One cannot hope to succeed with tactics of that
kind.
I repeat that the present Government
cannot be blamed for either the accumulation
of all this wheat nor for the failure of
attemped solutions. I can speak with some
authority of the position of many farmers in
Manitoba and Saskatchewan, where conditions are much the same; in Alberta, with
more mixed farming, the situation is rather
different. Why do our farmers need the
money which will become available if this
bill is passed? First, to pay their taxes.
Next, to meet the costs of fuel for their farm
machinery. Third, to meet their grocery
bills, so that their wives and childen shall
have the means of subsistence for another
year. These are three "musts". If you ask
why they do not look to the banks for accommodation, I will relate a typical case, and
perhaps a personal reference may be pardoned. The girl at the desk in my office tells
me that Mr. Brown is here to see me. I
invite him in, and ask him what I can do
for him. "Well", he says, "I owe you $250
in interest on that mortgage of yours. I owe
$450 for two years' taxes; and I am in debt
for one year's insurance on my buildings.
Also there is an unpaid grocery bill. The
whole thing amounts to $1,500, and it has got
to be paid. I went to the bank today, and
under the new law"-referring to earlier
legislation passed by a previous Government
-"I may borrow $1,500. The banker said
he would lend it to me, but first he must
deduct the $500 I owe the bank. If I pay
that $500 and do not pay my taxes, I shall
lose my land to the municipality. If I pay
my taxes my grocer will go unpaid, and he
will sue me. If I do not meet the interest on
your mortgage you will foreclose. Will you
give me one more chance?"
That illustrates the problem of the western
farmer; and it is no chicken-coop affair; it
is a difficulty of critical importance to him.
He cannot handle it at all unless someone
will come to his assistance; and I tell you
that if, like me, you were brought up on a
farm, and knew what it means when a family

are without adequate food or clothing and
are reduced to eating grain cooked on the
stove, you can understand why this advance
is being demanded. Farmers say to us who
represent the Government, "We know that
you did not get us into this hole, that your
party had nothing to do with it, but we are
in the hole none the less, and we want your
assistance to get us out."
Let me point out to my honourable friend
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) that his party did not oppose
this bill when it was in the other place.
Why? Because they were told by the Prime
Minister that if they voted against the bill
they would have to face the people of this
country. I do not believe they would be
willing to face the country on this issue.
They cannot. They know that the Canadian
people are absolutely opposed to the manner
in which the wheat business of this country
was handled under the former Liberal Government. There were other issues, such as
pensions, which made them unpopular, but
the greatest factor against them in the three
Prairie provinces was their attitude to the
wheat problem.
Our farmers are good people. In the first
World War the record of volunteering from
my province was equal to that of any in any
province in Canada. We had a similar high
record in the Second World War, and we
were second to none in our contributions to
patriotic funds and the support of measures
on behalf of the armed services. Those who
serve us in Parliament or in any other public
capacity are as loyal to and as interested in
Canada as are any others. I insist that we
do not want something that we do not deserve. Our case is this. We say to the people
of Canada: "For years and years you got
wheat at a lower price than it cost the
farmers to raise it. Under the wheat agreement our grain was disposed of at much
below the world price." As the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
told us the other evening, the loss to the
farmers of western Canada by reason of the
British wheat agreement alone-and I defy
contradiction-was not less than $500 million.
I forecast that result on the floor of this
house when the agreement was under discusBut only a few of us shared my
sion.
opinion, and we were a small voice crying in
the wilderness: everybody else laughed at
us, but our prediction came true. You can't
make people buy wheat if they don't want
to buy it. That is fundamental. That is
why the former Government was in trouble.
It couldn't make people outside of Canada
buy our wheat at $2 a bushel when they

SENATE
only wanted to pay $1 a bushel. There is no
law anywhere that could make them do it.
We want this bill passed in order to help
the farmers of this country. But I will be
quite honest with you. Nobody would welcome more than the Prime Minister of Canada
the Senate's defeat of this bill. That is all he
would want. Just do that and he will do the
rest. If the men and women on the Opposition
side of the house will just stand up and
vote solidly to kill this bill, that is all he
would ask them to do.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Nobody has suggested
that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Your speech suggests it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Don't interrupt. I could
have interrupted but I kept quiet. You know
what happened to Mr. Howe at Morris when
he started to talk. I am sure the Senate
doesn't want to kill this bill. I have always
been very loyal to this chamber and I feel
we are able to perform a great service for
Canada, but the Senate would be wrong to
oppose the majority opinion of the other
house on a subject that was an issue in the
recent election which saw the Conservative
party sweep the Prairie provinces, in comparison with what the Liberals did. This is
legislation we promised the people of this
country we would give them, and we want to
carry out our promise. Recently the Liberal
editor of an Ottawa paper wrote that the
Diefenbaker Government was to date making
a greater effort to carry out election promises
than any government before it had done. The
editor praised the present Government for
this. We are trying to carry out our election
promises, but we cannot hope to fulfil them
all in a short session like this.
I do not ask honourable senators to pass
this legislation because I am from Manitoba
or western Canada, but simply because the
people who have carried the load deserve
this help. The money that will be advanced
to these farmers will be paid back. Oh, there
may be a few losses here and there but the
legislation will be of help not only to the
farmers of western Canada but to people
generally in Ontario, Quebec, the Maritime
provinces and British Columbia. Everyone
will benefit from the lifeblood that will spurt
all over Canada as a result of this new money
being made available in the provinces west
of the Great Lakes.
Honourable senators, for these reasons I
would humbly ask you to support this
measure. Don't let it be said that the Senate
is divided on this question. Don't let the
western farmers feel that we are oblivious

to their problems. My honourable friend the
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has raised some technical objections
as to whether there will be a loss. The
Deputy Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) has promised to refer the bill to
committee, and if there is any technical
difficulty, which I rather doubt, it can be
rectified at that time. We want the bill to be
as legally proper as possible. I have a high
regard for the legal proficiency of certain
members on both sides of the house and we
want the bill to receive their best consideration. I would like it to be said that the
Senate wanted to vote a sum of money to the
farmers of western Canada to enable them
to carry on for another year.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I rise on a question of privilege. The Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) attributed
to me a remark to the effect that we should
defeat this bill. I made no such suggestion;
on the contrary, I said that the bill would be
helpful to the farmers but that it would not
solve our wheat marketing problem.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I now have the answer to the question raised
by the honourable senator from Huron-Perth
(Hon. Mr. Golding) with regard to the marketing of oats and barley. It is as follows:

Hon. Mr. Golding: I would like to thank
the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) for this information.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Question!
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, as has been said on this floor many
times, the marketing of western wheat and
other grains has been a hardy perennial
in the garden of parliamentary debate over
a long period of years. I think it would be
easily found that pages of Hansard of both
houses, as well as the statute books of this
country, contain more references to the
subject of the marketing of grain than almost
any other subject with which we are called
upon to deal from time to time.
During the past twenty years here I have
taken part in most of the discussions connected with this question of grain marketing, and I must say that after every one of

believe that our troubles really arise from
under-marketing rather than over-production. In saying this I am entirely in agreement with a very interesting statement made
recently by an expert observer, a former
member for several years of the present
Wheat Board, who said:
The squeeze between the costs of things farmers
buy and the prices received for their products
remains troublesome-although possibly not so
apparent to the farmers themselves as to the farm
leaders, who watch the price indexes. The obvious
and important squeeze, however, lies between
production and market capacity. A good case can
be made for the idea that our troubles arise from
under-marketing rather than over-production. In
the years immediately ahead, our efforts must be
turned to marketing and consumption if our
agriculture is to grow normally.

of surplus production. We are showing too
great an inclination to criticize other people
for lack of markets and lack of trade. To
go over to New York or Washington, for
example, with our hat in one hand and a
club in the other, complaining about the way
in which the commercial and financial
economy of the United States is being run,
is becoming a humiliating spectacle to many
Canadians and, one suspects, increasingly
irritating to many of our good friends in the
United States.

than dividing our efforts in dealing with a
common problem of vital concern.
In relation to wheat disposal, which is the
subject of this bill, I should like to conclude
the thought which I have been trying to
express by suggesting that the Government
of Canada might well endeavour to interest
the Government at Washington in bringing
about a joint North American wheat pool
which would undertake to sell the surplus
grain production of this continent to the best
advantage of both countries.
In making that suggestion, I do so in the
hope that I may have an opportunity later
of developing more in the way of background
and practical considerations bearing upon it.
It is not a new idea in any sense. To my
way of thinking, in the conditions that are
tending to drive countries and areas of this
world into a state of economic isolationism,
not dissimilar from the conditions that obtained in the thirties and prior to the outbreak of war, it would be well for those
who are in charge of the affairs of this
country now to consider the most logical
area in the western hemisphere for Canada
to explore possibilities of dealing effectively
with her economic and financial problems.
With that suggestion I beg to conclude what
I have to say in the debate on this bill, and
to reassure my honourable friend the Leader
of the Government that there is no partisan
opposition to the principle of this bill, as far
as I am concerned.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. J. Wesley Stambaugh: Honourable
senators, the senator who has just taken his
seat seems to think that one should have
40,000 or 50,000 bushels of grain storage to
qualify him to speak on this bill. If that is
a necessary qualification, I must say I do not
qualify, for I have no wheat in storage,
although I am a bona fide western farmer.
The principal reason why I have no wheat
in storage is that I have been for some time
raising oats, barley and fiax, and I have had
little difficulty disposing of these grains. But
I am very much interested in the people
who, like myself, are raising oats and barley.
I might say that in my own case I do not
expect to have to use the act this year. I
think I will be able to finance my farming
without coming under the act-for one reason because half of my crop is snowed under
and I won't have to dispose of it anyway.
But I would like to direct my remarks to
the honourable member from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) of whom I asked a question
last night and received an answer which I
find, on reading it in Hansard,is a little different from what I thought it was last night.

I wonder if I might just read an extract
from my honourable friend's explanation. I
quote from yesterday's Hansard, page 96,
second column:
In the case of oats the producer gets for 100
specified acres a cash advance of 20 cents a bushel
on 1500 bushels, which gives him $300, . . .

I mentioned last night that I could not
see anything in the bill that would give the
producer of oats, any more than the producer of wheat, the right to sell more than six
bushels to the acre. I brought that question
up and I understand the honourable member
to say that an amendment would be introduced that would cover that.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I did not say that.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: I read in Hansard
that you said an amendment could be introduced. I understood you to say "would",
which is quite different. That is the reason
I am on my feet again today, because there
is nothing in the bill that would warrant
me to think that a producer of oats could
sell 15 bushels to the specified acre. Where
do you get your information? Those on the
Government side of the house must have
some information that we on this side do
not have. If it is the case that a producer of
oats can get $300 on 100 specified acres, the
same as a producer of wheat, on six bushels
to the acre, and the producer of barley can
get the sane amount, I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: That is the intention.
Hon. Mr. Siambaugh: Well, I cannot see
that in the terms of the bill before us.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: That is your argument.
Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: Can you see it in
the bill?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Don't ask me.
answer it when I come to it.

I will

Hon. Mr. Stambaugh: I would like to have
it on the record that you can see it in the
bill, or that you give an undertaking that
it is the intention to introduce an amendment
to provide that a producer of oats and a
producer of barley will be on the same basis
as a producer of wheat and able to get the
same amount of loan for 100 acres that a
producer of wheat can.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
I have just a word or two to say, as a
purchaser of wheat and not as a seller of it.
First of all, however, I would like to make
one or two comments regarding the statement
made by the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig), when he challenged us to vote against the measures and
go to the country. Everyone realizes of
course that the Government is just waiting

SENATE
for such a move to be made by the Opposition. And as I see it, the Government is
carrying out quite a few of the promises
made during the election, and they are all
good vote-catching promises that are being
carried out.
I would like to remind the Leader of the
Government that while I have been in Parliament, since 1930, the Liberal Government
has done wonderful things for the three
Prairie provinces, but those accomplishments
did not always produce votes for the GovTime and time again in the
ernment.
House of Commons I listened to discussions
on wheat, and always was surprised at the
splendid things the Liberal Government did
for the Prairie farmers, but when it came
to the voting somehow or other these things
did not count. Oh, this would count now if
you went to the country, because this is a
very urgent matter indeed.
But, as I said, I am rising as a purchaser of
wheat to plead again that the Government
do something regarding the regulations of the
Wheat Board. We have in Canada the greatest socialistic piece of legislation that ever
this country has known, and the most tightly
closed corporation.
We in British Columbia, and not only we,
are prevented from buying wheat from farmers in another province, and are not even
allowed to import any from the United States,
although I could get wheat cheaper from
across the line than from Calgary or Edmonton. So honourable senators can readily
understand that the feelings of the people
are very strong on this matter.
We say that if you are out to sell the
wheat, for goodness' sake change some of the
Wheat Board's socialistic regulations and let
us buy our wheat freely from the farmers on
the prairie. Honourable senators, I am going
to rise on every possible occasion until we
purchasers of wheat in British Columbia get
some redress on this.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators, I
will take only a few minutes. Always when
the discussions turns to wheat I feel it
necessary to make a few remarks, and having
been a practical farmer in Saskatchewan for
almost 50 years, and having some knowledge
of farming in Quebec as well, I take no back
seat to anyone. I deplore this wide publicity
we are giving to the world about the immense
carryover of wheat. I always took that stand
when I sat on the other side of the house and
a similar discussion was taking place. What
manufacturers or producers of other goods
give out detailed information as to their inventories? We do not find that information
noised about, but great publicity is given as
to the number of head of cattle, for example,

that the farmers have: they are all counted
and we are told beef should be cheaper because there are so many cattle, and so on.
Honourable senators, a similar policy is not
followed by producers of any goods which
the farmer has to purchase. Details of their
business are a close secret.
I think I can make some useful remarks.
A large amount of wheat on the prairies is
being fed at present to cattle, and I want to
say that that method of disposal is a good one.
We have found out that wheat can be fed
pure to steers, just as corn is fed pure to
steers in Iowa. The Intercontinental Packers
in Saskatoon are buying wheat there now,
and they can get all they want at 60 cents a
bushel. The cattle fed on wheat are excellent.
The farmers also are feeding wheat, and I
think I am safe in saying that 100 million
bushels of the estimated sales of 300 million
bushels are being fed to cattle in the west.
There is not a creature on the farm-whether
chickens, pigs, ducks, geese or all ýdown the
line-for which wheat is not an almost perfect food. Nowadays an immense amount of
grain is fed to cattle. In the first week they
get a certain amount of oats and wheat. Then
they are fed either crushed or rolled wheat
by means of these huge self-feeders, which
may hold a thousand bushels or more, and are
equipped with blower and elevator: wheat
mixed with other grain and straw is fed automatically. Very little roughage is required,
and a great quantity of wheat can be absorbed
in that way.
I do not wish to enter into an argument,
but for the benefit of the honourable senator
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), and
to remind him of what his Government did,
I would recall what happened in 1937, just
twenty years ago. At that time the marketing board was busy selling wheat at 70 cents
a bushel. I mention this because some people
seem to believe that our wheat is too highly
priced, and that if it were offered more
cheaply much more would be sold. But 50
cents per bushel makes a difference of only
one cent on the price of a loaf of bread. I
am rather inclined to agree with the idea of
the honourable senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert), that there should be a North
American pool. At the present time the
United States farmer is getting, for wheat
consumed within his own country, over
$2 per bushel. Our price for No. 1 Hard
is down to $1.60.
As regards Canadian wheat generally, a
few of our crops have suffered from rust or
frost, but also we grow wheat of very high
protein content, perhaps the best in the
world for mixing purposes.
So, looking at the situation over the years,
I am sure another season like 1937 would

NOVEMBER 5, 1957
result in the disappearance of all our surplus
and there would be no problem of disposal.
I well remember that twenty years ago, when
I left this house in July and travelled across
Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta to see
what condition the crops were in, I found
no crops at all; it had gone, burnt up with
drought. Yet the board boasted that they
were selling wheat at 7 cents a bushel.
Afterwards the price rose to $1.55. I held
tickets on some of it, on which I had merely
got the first payment. The then Government having sold the great bulk of the crop
at 70 cents, and the price for the balance
having risen to $1.55, it was necessary to
ship large quantities back to western Canada
to provide feed and seed. Of course that was
a mistake.
Then we have been reminded that by a
reduction of only 5 cents per bushel we could
have held Britain within the International
Wheat Agreement. I remember that I met
the head of one of the pools in the Chateau
Laurier while the subject was under discussion in New York, and I told him they would
have to accept a lesser amount from the
United Kingdom. I made the same statement in this chamber, and said I hoped that
the Government would not hold out for the
additional 5 cents, and I knew the western
farmers hoped so, too.
If there are any questions, I have no doubt
that they will be dealt with by the honourable
senator who introduced the bill.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I move, seconded by the honourable
senator from Bruce (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh)
that this bill be referred to the Committee of
the Whole House.
I will explain the reason for this motion.
When speeches on a subject of this kind are
made, on either side of the house, they are
rather academic, and the only information
that we can get is through asking questions
of the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) or the sponsor of the particular bill, so that we may know the precise
meaning of each provision of the bill. For a
long time that procedure, which exists by
virtue of the rules of the house, has been
disregarded. This is a great mistake, because
very often honourable senators have not had
the opportunity of gathering the information
to which they are entitled; moreover, even
the largest standing committees of this house
contain only a fraction of the total membership of the Senate. The result is that
some of us are prevented from asking questions because we do not belong to the committee to which the particular bill has been
sent. If this bill were sent to the Committee
of the Whole, each senator-

Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable zenators, I
rise to a point of order. The debate is not
completed. This motion to refer the bill
to the Committee of the Whole House should
be made after the close of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Euler: And the motion bas not
been put.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If my honourable friends
will permit me,-debate may be resumed
upon the third reading after the bill is reported from the Committee of the Whole,
so what is the use of having this discussion
meanwhile? In committee we can ask for
the information we want, and any honourable
senator who is willing to answer can do so, or
he can refuse to answer. But I am discussing
a question of order with regard to this bill.
Is there a motion to send the bill to any
committee?
Hon. Mr. Farris: The time has not arrived.
The Hon. the Speaker: A point of order
has been raised, that the debate on the
motion for third reading is not yet completed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to say just one
word. I made a promise, which I want to
carry out, to the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), when he
raised, and very properly so, certain questions. I promised that we would send this
bill to a special committee, and I arranged
with the Minister of Trade and Commerce
that he and his deputy minister, together
with the solicitor from the department who
drew the papers, would be present at the
meeting to explain why these particular words
were used. While I do not want to force
honourable senators to agree to this procedure, I think it would be a good idea,
because everyone would be free to ask questions. I promise honourable senators that
they will be given every facility to make
inquiries and pass comments. If the bill is
to be dealt with in Committee of the Whole
I could have the deputy minister here but
not the other officials. I do not think that
would be as satisfactory. We are very anxious
to answer the questions raised as to the
legality of the bill. We want to be certain
we are right about this feature, and I think
my honourable friend from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot), being a well-known
lawyer himself, will understand my point.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I understand very well
the point raised by the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) and I
appreciate his courtesy. I must tell him, too,
that as Leader of the Government in the
Senate he follows the great tradition of
leadership established by past Government
leaders in this chamber.

SENATE
Honourable senators, the point of order
raised a few minutes ago by the honourable
gentleman from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) has to be ruled on before we can
proceed further, and speaking to this point
of order I want to say that I know of no
arrangement which has taken place between
the Leader of the Government and the
Leader of the Opposition with regard to the
disposition of this bill. As a private member
of the Senate I am entitled to the same privileges as anyone else in this chamber, and I
was very much surprised to be interrupted
by the Leader of the Government, even
though be spoke in a kindly way. He took
the floor from me when I was arguing a very
important point, the urgency of sending this
bill to Committee of the Whole House so that
each senator, being a member of that committee, would have an opportunity to ask for
information that would enable him to come
to a decision with regard to this legislation.
I am open-minded about this bill and I have
no prejudice. I know that every farmer,
whether he raises stock or grows wheat, potatoes, oats or barley, is entitled to some consideration. I do not pretend to be trying to
help His Honour the Speaker in deciding on
this point of order, but I will do my best to
help him understand my point of view, which
I hope will be shared by honourable senators
other than my seconder (Hon. Mr. Stambaugh), for whom I have a high regard. In
answering my honourable friend (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) I must be very careful to discuss
only the legal aspect of his point of order. As
I understand it, we are now on the third
reading of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No; second reading.

The Hon. the Speaker: Will the honourable senator please bear in mind that he is
supposed to be discussing the point of order
raised by the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), and that he should
not attempt to explain his own motion to
refer the bill to the Committee of the Whole.
The honourable gentleman should restrict
his comments to the point of order to the
effect that his own motion should not be
proceeded with until after the bill has been
given second reading.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I agree with the remarks of His Honour the Speaker.
The Hon. the Speaker: Then I would ask
the honourable gentleman to confine his remarks to the point of order.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Both matters are closely
connected.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I understand that His
Honour the Speaker bas ruled that the
motion of the honourable member from De
la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) is out of
order.
The Hon. the Speaker: No, I have not
done so.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No, and it is very unfair
for the honourable senator from Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine) to anticipate a ruling
and try to put words in the mouth of His
Honour the Speaker.
The Hon. the Speaker: I might inform the
honourable senator from De la Durantaye
that his motion bas not been ruled against,
but I would ask him to confine his remarks
to the point of order under discussion.

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: That is still better. EloHon. Mr. Pouliot: To show how conciliaquent speeches have been made by members on both sides of the bouse, and these tory I am and how much good will I have,

NOVEMBER 5, 1957
Hon. Mr. Davies: Before the sponsor of
the bill speaks, may I ask him ta explain
Is it
why there is a surplus of wheat?
because the Wheat Board is holding the
wheat at a certain price, and that there is
no market at that price? Could the wheat
be sold if the board reduced the price, and
would the farmers agree to that?
Hon. Mr. Horner: No, they would not.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: May I remind the
honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) that if he speaks now he will
close the debate on the second reading of
this bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I think yesterday I answered the question
which has just been put to me, when I said
that in my opinion the Wheat Board is not
holding wheat or other grains at too high a
price, and that if the board reduced the
price and threw the grain on the market it
would not result in greatly increased sales.
If that were donc, it would possibly mean a
terrific loss to all concerned, not only to the
farmer but to the economy of the country
as weil.
Like the honourable senator from Blaine
Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), I am not terribly
worried about the fact that we have seven
or eight hundred million bushels of wheat
in the granaries of western Canada. I can
point to other years when we had a surplus,
followed by a series of poor crop years, and
the first thing we knew was that we had no
grain on hand at all and had to import seed
from the United States. At that time we did
not have feed for our livestock. Circumstances change, and I think it is a good thing
to have some grain on hand.
I was somewhat surprised at the speech
made by the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), in which
he referred to bank loans under the Prairie
Grain Producers Interim Financing Act,
which was amended last year to make the
maximum amount of the loan $3,000 instead
of $1,500. He is labouring under a wrong
impression if he thinks anyone can go to
the bank and get a loan of $3,000. It just
can't be done.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was not labouring
under a wrong impression.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: The quota is six bushels
to the specified acre, and before a man can
borrow $3,000 be must have one thousand
specified acres.
Would the bonHon. Mr. Macdonald:
ourable gentleman kindly quote the section
of the act?

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No; I know it from
experience.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is nothing
in the act to that effect.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: A farmer could not
borrow that much money so easily, for the
banker would not give it to him. A farmer
has to pay back the money by giving half of
the receipts that be gets on the interim
payment for the grain as be delivers it, and
it has to be paid back by July 31, which is
the end of the crop year. Therefore under
that act, with a Government guarantee, no
banker could make the loan so large that
the man could not pay it back by delivering
the quota that was set by the Wheat Board.
That is an actual fact.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is not in the act.
Hon. Mr. Aseliine: And anyone will tell
you that. If the farmer had more grain than
that he could borrow the money from the bank
without a Government guarantee. But I submit that the honourable Leader of the
Opposition is entirely wrong in his interpretation that anybody -could go to the bank and
get $3,000 by way of a loan guaranteed by
the dominion Government.
The honourable gentleman also stated that
I said in my remarks-and he was perfectly
correct-that we hoped that about 150 million bushels would be used in this country,
and that we hoped to export about 300 million bushels. But that grain is not used up
yet, nor is it exported, and the farmers who
own that grain cannot get it into the elevator, so how in the world are they going to
be financed in the meantime, unless they
borrow money under this legislation? The
very purpose of this legislation is to give the
producer a right to go to the elevator and
get a cash advance on his grain, and later on
deliver the grain as quotas are set up and
space is available in the elevator. As I said
yesterday, this is no cure-all. It is not intended to solve this whole wheat problem;
it is intended simply to enable the producer
on the land to obtain money with which to
pay his taxes, meet his store bills, buy coal,
and pay other bills, which he cannot do
under ordinary circumstances until there is
space in the elevator and he is able ta deliver his grain.
As the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) has stated, this question of the six-bushel quota will be fully
explained by the Minister of Trade and
Commerce if the bill goes to a committee for
consideration. I can give no further information on that right now, for I have not been
able to see the minister since the debate
yesterday, but he will be prepared to answer

SENATE
the questions raised by the Leader of the
Opposition on sections 10 and 11 of the bill,
and if any amendments are necessary they
will be made. No one in this chamber, or
anywhere else, wants legislation to be passed
that is not perfectly intelligible and understandable and which does not cover the
situation in the best possible way.
I appreciate very much the suggestion of
the honourable Senator from Ottawa (Hon.
Mr. Lambert) for establishment of a joint
Canada-American wheat pool to dispose of
the grain surpluses of the two countries.
There might be something to say concerning
that. It is an idea well worth consideration
and study, and I understand that he bas
agreed to look into it further and to speak
on that subject at a later date.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question? Has any
thought at all been given to accepting
sterling in the sale of wheat?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I cannot answer that
question.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Would the honourable
gentleman venture an opinion as to the
advisability of accepting sterling for wheat?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No. I am sponsoring
this bill, and I do not intend to make any
statement that might bind the Government
in any manner whatsoever with respect to
sterling.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: I am just wondering
whether the honourable gentleman has ever
speculated on how much wheat could be
moved if sterling were acceptable in
payment.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: No. In view of the
fact that we are very closely tied with the
United States at this time, that just cannot
be done.
Honourable senators, I have no further
remarks to make in this connection.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill

Banking and Commerce" and substituting
therefor "Committee of the Whole".
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators,Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I do not wish to prevent
my friend the Leader of the Government
from speaking at this time, but I want to
be sure that if he speaks now it will be with
the understanding that I shall be permitted
to speak after him. My point is that much
valuable information can be brought out
in discussion of this bill in the Committee of
the Whole.
I ask honourable senators to
bear in mind, in the first place, that all
senators are members of the Committee of
the Whole; in the second place, all the questions asked and answers given will be recorded by the reporters, without any extra
cost to the country; and in the third place,
the discussion in the Committee of the Whole
will be much better than that which would
take place in the Banking and Commerce
Committee, in that honourable senators will
be well posted on all points and be in a
position to ask important questions from the
experts who do appear at the committee.
I will not say anything more, except to
point to the fact that this is another instance
where the Banking and Commerce is the
overall committee. Yesterday it was asked
to consider problems relating to water, today
it is wheat. There is no end to it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators,
usually I do not care to what committee a
bill is sent, but in this intance, as I have
pointed out, the minister and his experts will
be before the standing committee, not before
this house. I say quite candidly that I cannot
promise honourable senators any better explanation or advice than they have received
from the honourable senator for Rosetown
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine). Some honourable senators
would like further advice and information,
and I agree they are entitled to it, but we
cannot get it on the floor here. It is for that
reason that I am anxious that the bill go to
the Banking and Commerce Committee rather
than to the Committee of the Whole.

which I could not answer I consulted with him
and then gave the answer. The honourable

we cannot get close enough to the problem in
the Committee of the Whole. In a standing

members of the legal profession, and whose
opinions are respected, can exchange their
views with our Law Counsel. That discussion

well. I hope that it continues to do well. I
will quote from an article on the financial
page of the Montreal Gazette of October 31.
I gather that, the market being what it is,
everybody is reading the financial page of
newspapers these days. The article reads:
BELL TELEPHONE PROFIT UP ONE PER CENT
SIX PER CENT TO DATE

I

QUARTEH,

Though operating expenses and other charges
rose at a somewhat greater rate than the gains in
operating revenues and other income, net profit
of the Bell Telephone Company of Canada in the
first three or four months of this year increased
by $1.6 million, or 6 per cent, as shown above.

the public are suspicious of a million-dollar
corporation, and downright distrustful of a
billion-dollar corporation?
It is eminently true that there are in this
house a large number of honourable senators
who can read and evaluate the implications
of a financial statement. It is an achievement
which I should like to share. As a matter
of fact there are far more members of this
house who can appreciate a financial statement than there are in the House of Commons, yet often after only two or three
hours of unrecorded evidence before a Senate
committee an important matter is disposed
of, though I readily admit there is every
opportunity to ask questions, and if they are
asked, the answers are given. I always have
the feeling that we really know very little
about these great corporations, their corporate
structure and their interlocking directorates.
We deal with them piecemeal, one at a time,
in air-tight compartments. We never see the
overall picture. How can one say anything
fruitful after such a quick capsule education?
Take a case in point, the pipe lines. They
obtained charters from Parliament. We hear
of profits that are described as amazing, as
an avalanche of profits. We hear talk of
watered stocks and other machinations, and
that they are building private corporate empires. These same men who came before us
last year and the year before are being
referred to by responsible Canadians as
buccaneers. If they are, we made this possible
by giving them a licence to go free-wheeling
in the economic world.
Honourable senators, I have here a clipping
from the Winnipeg Free Press under date of
October 31. It is rather long but I feel I
must read it in order to give you the whole
picture:

I bring this to the attention of the house
because the rates have constantly increased.
I cannot recall a reduction of rates, either
voluntary or ordered. I have been led to
believe that mass consumption or mass services and mass production usually lower the
cost to the consumer. I wonder if we now
must believe that that is true only in the
competitive field. I wonder what the situation would be if the company had to meet
competition to expand marketing opportunities. If it had to show more aggressiveness,
would the story be different?
The Consumers Gas Company of Toronto,
a very large corporation, has taken a somewhat different course. It needed expanded
markets and it had to meet aggressive competition. Its rates, mind you, are set by the
Ontario Fuel Board. Yet in Toronto, Ottawa,
Brockville, Lindsay and other Ontario municipalities the company voluntarily reduced
its rates on February 1, 1955, by $2.5 million
per year; on October 1, 1955, by $550,000 a
year; on October 15, 1956, by $1 million per
year; on September 30, 1957, by $1 million
per year,-a $5 million reduction of rates
in 31 months. So, in these energy-short fuel

Central Gas Company.

Hon. Mr. Hayden:

Because of natural gas.

Hon. Mr. Croll: It has not come in yet,
and is not likely to be here for a year; yet
the company started to reduce rates in 1955.
The point is, it expects a certain amount of
competition.
Our experience with monopolies and combines has not been good. There is, for al
to see, a record of investigations, reports
and prosecutions which indicates that we have
required continuous tightening-up of the
Combines Act, with increasing penalties. The
corporations involved are many, responsible
and respectable, the list of whose boards of
directors reads like Who's Who, but who do
not mind doing a little price fixing and trade
regulating if it pays. Can one wonder that

I quote from further on:
Gas pipeline companies are showing ominious
signs of behaving as the equivalent in these times
of the railroad barons of an earlier generation.
I quote again from further on:
A pipeline company has to have a franchise and
it needs a lot of capital. Having once got its
franchise and its capital, it may feel itself in an
impregnable position to exploit the advantages of
monopoly and make a mockery of the utility-board
type of control.

Bank Act did the banks a great deal of good
in the field of public relations, and it
broadened their services; the result was to
reaffirm confidence and give the people a
better understanding of what the banks do.
Confidence and understanding are the
greatest asset a bank can possibly desire.
As a result of the hearings the banks have
never stood higher in public esteem.
Now, my friends may well say, "But there
are boards and commissions to whom these
various corporations must answer." That is
true. But in the main they are administrative
bodies which make rules and regulations and
give day to day direction and have some
control of rates. They do not even scratch
the surface. These boards do the best they
can, and they do what the law says they must
do, but there is no planning or direction. We
in Parliament often find ourselves in the
position where we endorse these decisions
almost like a rubber stamp.
I think this house knows that capital is
increasingly concentrated in big corporations
which have every incentive to buy out their
smaller competitors, to expand staff and
operations, to obtain a better economic gain
and to build private corporate empires. If
we look across the border we see small
corporations being gobbled up and used in
many instances as a promotion vehicle by big
corporations. We have recently witnessed
such a performance which affected the Maritimes, and about which they are much concerned and very dubious. I am not at all sure
that the moving of a head office of a small
corporation to Bay street or St. James street
gives an added stature or value, or improves
employment opportunities for the people of
small communities. I have a feeling that it
merely brings the treasury within easy reach.
We have to fight bigness and keep the
economy competitive. The Combines Investigation Act is useful against a large number
of small corporations, but it is not useful
against large corporations.
Honourable senators, I have no immediate
solution to the problem that I present, but
I have this suggestion to make: that we
should at the very first opportunity appoint a
joint standing committee of this house and
the House of Commons on public service
corporations incorporated by Parliament, to
study, examine and make recommendations
with a view to the maximum development
of the entire country. Great corporate empires are being built up without Government
control or direction, yes, even without Government knowledge, and in years to come we
may have to pay a very heavy price for our
failure to act or for our neglect to correct.
Public service corporations grow and grow;
they become bigger and bigger and more and
96702-9

more powerful. That is not a healthy situation. We know too little about them. We may
wake up on some cold morning and find that
the resources and the services that we consider vital to our security and our economie
life are controlled in Britain, the United
States or Germany, or acquired by dummies
or agents in Switzerland, for a principal who
may well be behind the Iron Curtain.
What we know about these corporations
is not the best word, and should not be the
last word. What we do here affects to an
increasing degree an increased number of
people. Should we not know how public
service corporations are dealt with in the
United States and in Great Britain? Should
we not profit- from their long and varied experience and avoid their mistakes? We are
only in our infancy: we have a long road
ahead of us, and it looks like a bright one.
Thus I repeat my suggestion, that the two
houses should jointly interest themselves in
the development, regulation and control of
public service corporations.
It is high time we took some steps, and
this is an appropriate occasion to sit back
and take stock of the position of these corporations which are too important to our
future to leave to uninhibited private enterprise, and which to an increasing degree
affects an increasing number of people. I
believe that such a committee could render
great service.
Honourable senators, I leave this thought
with you: If it is good for the country and
good for the banks that the Parliament of
Canada should examine their activities
periodically, then it ought to be equally good
for the country and for these public service
corporations to have the Parliament of
Canada
examine
them periodically.
I
seriously suggest to this chamber that action
be taken for the purpose of creating a joint
standing committee
on public
service
corporations.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honourable
senator answer a question? Last evening he
saidi he did not thoroughly understand the
true significance of the amendment. I am
wondering if he has now caught the significance of the amendment, and if so would
he please explain it. That is why the bill
was held up last evening.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No. The bill was held up
because I wanted to speak to it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Because you wanted to
make this speech?
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes. I would have made

even prepared to make it last Thursday. I

DIVORCE BILLS
FIRST READINGS

Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
the opening of Parliament by Her Majesty
the Queen, accompanied by His Royal Highness the Prince Philip, was one of the great
historical events in our history, and one which
will long be remembered by those fortunate
enough to be present on that occasion. It was
a thoughtful decision, especially in a country
extending some 4,000 miles, to televise not
only the opening of the session but events
of the entire three or four days when Her
Majesty was here, and so provide an
opportunity to Canadians in all provinces
to see and follow the events as clearly, if
not more so, as if they had been here in
Ottawa.
I notice some suggestion has been made
recently in the other place to have the
proceedings of that house televised. I trust
the Government will not take such a suggestion seriously. In my opinion, televising
of the proceedings of Parliament would
tend to make actors out of the members;
although of course it might help to bring
about a better attendance there as no member would like to be called upon by one
of his constituents to explain why he was
not present when the proceedings were
televised.
Before proceeding to the main part of
my speech, may I at this time extend my
sincere congratulations to the Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Haig), who at long last finds himself a member of the cabinet and the Leader of the
Senate. In the words of Longfellow:

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
No doubt most Canadians were pleased to
hear the statement which was made after the
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED
conference between the Right Honourable the
The Senate resumed from Thursday, Octo- Prime Minister of Great Britain, the Presiber 31, consideration of Her Majesty the dent of the United States and the Right
Queen's speech at the opening of the session Honourable the Prime Minister of Canada,
and the motion of Hon. Mr. White, seconded that the three countries have now agreed to

can give credit to the Russian satellite

SENATE
Sputnik for the decision to pool all scientific
knowledge, a decision which in my opinion
was long overdue.
As to the satellite, let me say that until
we solve our human weaknesses and problems
on this earthly planet of ours I will have no
great enthusiasm for devoting time and talent
toward landing on the moon or one of the
other planets. It reminds me of a foolish idea
that was experimented with as far back as
4,000 or 5,000 years ago, when some men
set out to build the Tower of Babel, which
they hoped would reach up to the heavens.
So, there is nothing new in the idea. Krushchev's truculence today should, I believe,
serve as a warning to all of us of what the
Soviets would be tempted to do, once they
felt they had a preponderance of power. The
advent of Sputnik has encouraged the Russians to aggravate the cold war with brazen
threats and barefaced lies. To the cold war
practice of divide and conquer they are now
trying to add fear. I am really surprised that
some naïve scientists believe the Russians
will pass on scientific information. So long
as Russia devotes all her resources to military purposes, seeking to achieve complete
mastery of the world by building up the
greatest war machine the world has ever
seen, so long must the Western democracies
prepare to meet the most deadly weapons.
However, the North American continent
seems to be more concerned with acquiring
additional luxuries and an easier way of life.
Canada and the United States have a great
many scientists and trained men, but they
are largely wasting their time on luxury
goods and making money for big concerns.
At times I wonder how many of our scientisis are employed in turning out such articles
as new varieties of soap suds and new
chrome-trimmed chariots. We should face the
fact now, that we cannot have all these
luxuries and at the same time compete successfully with Soviet Russia. Our desire for
a more luxurious way of life could, in my
opinion, be our downfall. I sincerely trust
that our military efforts will be expanded
while, in my opinion, there is yet time.
I should like now to discuss for a few
minutes the recently announced conference
which is shortly to take place between the
dominion and the provinces. Premier Frost
of Ontario has said that at the conference he
is going to demand for Ontario 15 per cent
of the revenue from income and corporation
taxes, and 100 per cent of the revenue from
succession duties. At present, I understand
Ontario is receiving 10 per cent of the
revenue from these taxes and 50 per cent
of the succession duties. Mr. Frost points
out that Ontario's financial needs are short
by $100 million.

Honourable senators who have watched this
system of distributing the income of Canada
among the provinces know that not one province has ever been satisfied. As a matter of
fact, the distribution has been used politically
by most provinces against the federal party
in power. With respect even to the Government of the province of British Columbia,
when the premier there compared the province's share of $40 million out of income tax
collections with the federal share of $385
million, he used to say the province was being
robbed. Today the premier of that province
is still saying the same thing. If you look
back you will find, I think, that only one
province has ever given credit to the dominion
for collecting taxes and dividing them as
fairly as is being donc. That province is
New Brunswick.
Note, however, honourable senators, that
although the provinces cry about being robbed,
none of them are willing to withdraw from
the agreement and collect their own taxes.
We used to hear a great deal about provincial rights. But the cry now is about provincial wrongs, and most of the provinces
today, if not all of them, are bewailing the
fact that they do not receive a larger proportion of the total tax revenues. I am confident
that if at the conference the dominion government accedes to the request of Premier Frost
of Ontario, every other province will say,
"Me too", for each and every province will
come with both hands out to get more from
the federal treasury.
The provinces like the present system. It
is the finest thing that could have happened
for them, because taxation now is centred
at Ottawa and if people complain of high
taxes the provinces say, "Why, it is the
federal Government that is taxing you." But
they fail to point out that the provinces are
reaping the benefits. As I have said, we
used to hear a great deal about provincial
rights under the British North America Act.
That subject, like free trade, bas now disappeared from discussion, no matter in what
part of Canada you are. The provinces do
not mind about their rights, so long as they
can hand their responsibilities on to the
dominion Government. They are willing to
give up any birthright they ever had. Old
age security and health are now being firmly
loaded on to the dominion authorities. And
I read in the press that at its convention last
week the British Columbia Young Liberals
seriously advocated that the dominion Government pay part if not all of the salaries
of teachers. Now, we all know that there
never was and is not at present any responsibility on the part of the federal Government to pay for or take care of education.

NOVEMBER S, 1957
Honourable senators, I am simply pointing
out the trend of the times. I feel sure that
if I were to get up at a meeting now and
talk about the British North America Act
my listeners would say: "That's old stuff,
but what can you expect of a senator anyway? He is thinking of the past." But, as
I said, the tax agreement is the finest thing
politically for the provinces, and I want to
warn the dominion Government that if it is
not careful it will add greatly to its cares by
acceding to all these further requests.
The latest thing that the provinces are
suggesting is that the municipalities participate in the conference with the dominion
Government. Well, I know, as does everyone else who bas had some municipal
experience, that the municipal councils, the
mayors and reeves, function directly under
provincial legislation. The provincial Governments can see that if the municipalities
attend the conference they will support the
cry of the provinces, for the need of the
municipalities today is very keen. There is
no municipality but feels that it should have
more money and more assistance. So, if the
provinces can shift that kind of burden on to
the federal Government, they will be more
favourably placed indeed.
Honourable senators, I thought I would
just issue that warning today and ask
honourable senators and the Government to
note the trend.
I have heard it said since I came to the
Senate that the Senate was created to protect the rights of the provinces, but the
rights now are becoming the wrongs and
more and more the management of affairs is
gradually being placed on the shoulders of
the federal Governments.
I want now to say a few words about
trade, a question that is much to the fore
at present. I do not intend to deal with
that subject at great length, but as honourable senators know it is one of the most
complex problems facing Canada today. I
doubt very much if any drastic change could
be made without violent protests from established companies. The late Right Honourable
Mr. King in past days told us, his followers,
a great truth when he said, time and time
again, that everyone is a free trader except
as regards the goods produced in his own
constituency. On the prairies the farmers
are all for free trade, but they demand that
the doors be kept closed against the importation of wheat, oats and barley. The manufacturers of automobiles do not want any
cars imported. And the makers of clothing
are wailing to high heaven about the importation of woven goods from Japan,
96702-10

Germany and Great Britain. So, I see a
very great problem indeed for the present
Prime Minister, and I wish him well. Personally I doubt if very much can or will
be done. Certainly not much more will be
done than has been done in the past, owing
to the fact that vested interests in every
town and city in Canada want protection for
their own goods but are not opposed to other
goods coming into the country free of duty.
Just one further word regarding the trade
trend. I was surprised that the British
Columbia Young Liberals at their convention
last week advocated trade with China. They
should take warning as to where that might
lead. It is not just a matter of trade between
Canada and China. I believe that if the
United States and Canada started to trade
with China we could not very well prevent
China from securing a seat at the United
Nations; and to give China a seat at the
United Nations would be to add another
power to the Soviet Communist bloc that is
down around the United Nations headquarters. In that regard it would not surprise
me if before very long the Soviet, which has
certainly made very good use of the United
Nations, would increase her propaganda
machine. At the United Nations a lot of
people from this country and the United
States never seem to really understand or
get down to earth with the Russians, and so
the Russians put it all over them by their
propaganda and news.
I want now to refer briefly to the Royal
Commission on Energy which is to be set up
by the Government. First I will quote from
the terms of reference setting up the commission:
The commissioners are empowered to inquire
into and make recommendations concerning:
(a) the policies which will best serve the national
interest in relation to the export of energy and
sources of energy from Canada;
(b) the problems involved in, and the policies
which ought to be applied to, the regulation of the
transmission of oil and natural gas between
provinces or from Canada to another country,
including, but without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the regulation of prices or rates
to be charged or paid, the financial structure and
control of the pipe line corporations in relation
to the setting of proper prices or charges, and ail
such other matters as it is necessary to inquire
into and report upon, in order to ensure the
efficient and economical operation of pipe lines
in the national interest.

There is a special clause in the order in
council to ensure that the establishment of
the commission and the conduct of its inquiries shall not in any way delay negotiations relating to waters crossing the international boundary. I sincerely hope that a
definite agreement can be reached between
the United States and Canada for the development of the Columbia River. If, shortly,

SENATE
a satisfactory arrangement is arrived at it
will avoid the carrying out of the threat
made by General McNaughton to the Americans, in case no solution can be arrived
at between the two parties, namely, to divert
the waters of the Columbia River to the
Fraser. As Chairman of the International
Pacifie Salmon Fisheries Commission, I say
that were that proposal to be carried out it
would wipe out the entire salmon population of the Fraser River, because the diversion of the waters of the Columbia would
involve the building of ten dams on the
Fraser to retain water there during the
various dry periods of the year. There is no
doubt that, as the negotiations proceed, the
Government of British Columbia will be
drawn into the picture. Personally I would
rather that the British Columbia Power Commission had the handling and development
of power from the Columbia than that it be
undertaken by a private concern. I say so
because, as I look over the rates for electric
power in Canada, I cannot but conclude that
we in British Columbia are paying a heavy
price for our electricity. The cost of electric
light and power in, for instance, the city of
Ottawa, which is supplied by the HydroElectric Power Commission of Ontario, is
only one-third of what we have to pay in
Vancouver and the Fraser Valley.
I now come to what I have particularly
in mind apart from the development of the
Columbia River and the preservation of our
salmon. I am pleased that this commission
bas been set up; and one circumstance I
would like it to look into is the fact, having
reference to the natural gas line from Alberta
through British Columbia to the boundary,
that the United States firm which obtains
natural gas from this source is getting it far
cheaper than it is being supplied to us in
British Columbia. I dug into this matter
a little and was astonished to find that
someone, presumably some official, bas been
very derelict in his duty, because the regulations which were passed to control matters of
this kind have been ignored. By reference
to the Canada Gazette of July 13, 1955, it
will be seen that, "the price charged by a
licensee for power or gas exported by him
shall not be lower than the price at which
power or gas respectively is supplied by him
or his supplier in similar quantities and under
similar conditions of sale for consumption in
Canada". Yet we find that a United S'tates
company can buy gas from the West Coast
Transmission at something like 24 cents per
1,000 cubic feet, while the British Columbia
Electrie Company in the province of British
Columbia is paying 31.72 cents per 1,000
cubic feet. That arrangement may have even
greater advantages for the United States

company, as I understand it bas to meet
competition in the line of fuel, not only with
gas but with oil plus electrie power. But
with us in the Fraser Valley there is no
competition in either of the two fields. British
Columbia Electric controls all the electricity;
now it controls the natural gas, so there is
no competition there. The point I want the
commission to look into is why this American
company has been allowed to obtain gas
from Alberta passing through our province
at a far less rate than it is being supplied
to us in British Columbia. I repeat that to
my mind this is a violation of the regulation,
that someone bas not donc his duty, and
that the matter should be fully investigated.
I trust that the Government will put what
I have said before the recently appointed
Energy Commission.
Without going at length into this matter,
I would remark that in my opinion the
Government did right to stop the export of
natural gas until the whole subject has been
reviewed. Reliable authorities estimate that
inside of three years the demand in Canada
for natural gas will double. If that be so,
every assurance should be given that supplies
will be available to all our people. The fact
must not be overlooked that, once supplies
are made available to customers outside the
country, a serious international issue could
arise if later on it should become necessary
to deprive them of this service in order to
meet the needs of our own people.
My last reference will be to the subject
of narcotics, which is still very much to the
fore in our province, particularly in Vancouver. It will be remembered that the report
of a committee of the Senate was presented
in 1956, and in the following year we passed
a bill dealing with this matter. I say frankly,
without fear of contradiction and not because
I had the honour of being chairman of the
committee, that that committee did one of the
finest jobs which the Senate has ever done.
Although its work was completed within the
year, its studies were exhaustive, and I doubt
whether one iota of further evidence could
have been procured. The problem is still
serious in British Columbia, but while some
people claim there has been an increase in
drug addiction, the departmental officials feel
otherwise. The fact is that the greater number of convictions has been due solely to
the fact that since our report was published
the police and other authorities have been
more active in picking up narcotic users.
While we advocated and were successful in
having heavier penalties written into the bill,
we also recommended in our report certain
treatment for the addicts. Every member of
our committee fully realized that it was no

NOVEMBER 6, 1957

cure to sinply put drug addicts behind bars.
However, we realized that the question of
treatment was a provincial matter, and, so
we recommended that the provinces should
establish treatment centres for drug addicts.
I am pleased to note that, with some financial
assistance from the provincial Government, a
small centre has been started in Vancouver.
I believe it bas only eight beds, but it will
give assistance to drug addicts who voluntarily apply for treatment. I sincerely trust
that this experiment will prove successful.
Honourable senators, I want to seriously
warn certain people in British Columbiapeople who do not know what they are talking about-who are making irresponsible
statements and advocating the setting up of
a system whereby drug addicts could obtain
supplies at government clinics. Some of them
claim this system works in Great Britain. I
would point out to them that it is remarkably
strange that Great Britain, which is a member of a fifteen-country committee set up by
the United Nations Narcotic Commission, is
actually opposed to the establishment of
clinics where drug addicts could get free
drugs. In all the meetings held by this fifteencountry committee, Great Britain bas never
once advocated such a system. We maintain
that giving free drugs to addicts would be
similar to giving whisky to an alcoholic every
time he wanted it. If he wanted two bottles
you would give him two, and if he wanted
three you would give him three, and so on.
An opinion poll was conducted in Vancouver
and it is rather interesting to learn the number of people who favour the setting up of a
system which would give drug addicts free
supplies or drugs at cost. Sixty-six per cent
of the men and 75 per cent of the women
polled thought that this system would be a
cure-all. A minister of the gospel on Vancouver Island wrote quite an article advocating the giving of free d'ugs to addicts, "just
as," he said, "they do in Great Britain".
Hon. Mrs. Hodges: Would the honourable
senator mind repeating the figures he just
gave?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Perhaps I should read the
question that was contained in the poll. It
is as follows:
One suggestion to fight drug addiction, an addicts'
crime, is to take large profit out of the illegal
drug trade. To do this the Government would set
up clinics, supervised by doctors, at which addicts
could register and legally receive drugs at cost.
Do you favour this suggestion or not?

To this inquiry 66 per cent of the men
and 75 per cent of the women replied in the
affirmative.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Was this poll conducted
amongst drug addicts or the population
generally?
96702-10O

Hon. Mr. Reid: The population generally.
Honourable senators, in view of these statements which are leaving an erroneous impression, and in view of the seriousness of
the matter, I thought I would take a few
moments to place this matter before the
Senate and the Government. I wish to take
this opportunity to say to the Government
that I trust when they get time they will
examine the report made by the Senate's
Special Committee on the Traffie in Narcotic
Drugs in Canada. Some have said that that
report was the best document ever put out
on the subject. I know that representations
are being made to the new Minister of Health
and Welfare and to the new Minister of
Justice to supply free drugs to drug addicts
under some supervised system, but your
committee recommended very strongly against
such a thing.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to
say this afternoon.
Hon. Calveri
C. Prail:
Honourable
senators, I wish to speak for a short while
to the motion for an Address in reply
to the Speech from the Throne. But first I
should like to congratulate His Honour the
Speaker upon his appointment to the Chair of
this house. I hope, sir that you will find it
interesting and enjoyable to preside over the
deliberations in this chamber, and I am sure
your administration of your high office will
be completely satisfactory to the members of
this house.
I also want to offer my best wishes to the
mover (Hon. Mr. White), and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Méthot) of the Address in Reply.
They are new members of this house, and I
hope that they and the other new members
will have a long and useful career in the
Senate. May I take the liberty of personally
offering my congratulations and extending a
welcome to them. There is a lot of use, and
great use, for the Senate in the government
of Canada. This is a modest chamber, perhaps over-modest and retiring in its selfappraisement, and certainly so in its public
relations. In these days, when public opinion
is greatly influenced by headlines, TV panel
discussions and political shouting, such services as the Senate performs are not as widely
known as they should be. The sphere of
usefulness is here just the same, and it is
up to us all to do our part to develop it.
Honourable senators, the opening of Parliament this session bas been an event which
we shall all remember with great pride and
pleasure. For me, as for most of us no doubt,
it brought a revival of that feeling of emotion and loyalty which in my young days

138

SENATE

always prevailed in the family circle when
we were told of the Royal Family, and what
the King and Queen and the members of the
Royal Family meant to us. I well recall the
delight and pride in my own home, when I
was a very small boy, over the honour of
my father and mother being entertained at a
dinner in Newfoundland with the Duke and
Duchess of Cornwall and York, who were
later to become Their Majesties King George
V and Queen Mary. The only phase of it
that I can really remember is my mother's
recounting of the conversation between herself and the Duchess about the mutual feeling they shared with regard to their respective children. That is my outstanding
recollection of that memorable event. So it is,
honourable senators, to this day, and we have
grown into a deep regard and affection for
the Royal Family largely because, with all
the stress and strain of Court and official
life, they maintain the quality of greatest
mutual appeal, that is, a happy and devoted
family life.
Honourable senators, I arn sure it is a matter of general satisfaction that the Speech
from the Throne reveals that a concentrated
effort will be made toward greater development of Commonwealth trade. With that,
closer Commonwealth relations of a general
character should naturally follow. At this
time, with the Commonwealth being constantly enlarged by British colonies in all
parts of the world growing into self-governing dominions, such association becomes all
the more valuable to us. It is an outstanding feature of world progress that selfgovernment is developing rapidly, and particularly in areas where roots of British
colonial government were deeply planted.
While that development certainly has not
come along by a straight and direct road, it
is nevertheless a remarkable tribute to the
British colonial system that the foundation
for self-government has been well laid. I
have always felt that the people who most
freely use the word "colonialism" in a condemnatory manner are those who know the
least about what is going on outside of their
own villages and backyards. That, of course,
is a natural view for me to have, being a
resident of Newfoundland, and sharing with
all other Newfoundlanders the pride we
have in our country, which used to be
Britain's oldest colony. It is just over a hundred years ago that Newfoundland obtained
self-government, and so that movement has
gone on. Self-government did not mean any
weakening, but rather the strengthening, of
the ties with the Old Country. It helped develop with Great Britain and other members
of Empire and Commonwealth broader and
more useful associations.

The world needs now, more than ever
before, close relationships such as are found
in the Commonwealth; it also needs the
broader concepts of responsibility, one towards the other, for the development of
mutual interests that are found there. Having said that-and I mean it thoroughlyI would say further that we must not allow
ourselves to be blinded by idealisms or
choked by platitudes. The difficulties of growing together are very real. Self interest will
always be accepted as a first law of life. It
is in the gradual, and very gradual reconciling of self interest with mutual interest, and
thus broadening our points of view, that the
most beneficial progress can be made.
Honourable senators, I should like to take
this opportunity to refer to a most interesting
gathering that I was privileged to attend a
short time ago, under the auspices of Mount
Allison University,
at
Sackville,
New
Brunswick. Under the sponsorship of Dr.
Ross Flemington, the President, and other
officials of that university, a three-day
Canada-West India conference was held.
This followed a similar conference which took
place in the preceding week at Kingston,
Jamaica. At those gatherings the premiers
of the West India colonies, and some of our
provincial premiers, were in attendance. Many
of the high officials of government as well
as leaders in professions and industry were
there. Both Canada and the West Indies were
well represented. The main purpose was to
learn as much as possible of the conditions
as they might develop under the forthcoming
Federation of the West Indies, and to consider
how the relations between Canada and the
West Indies might be strengthened and improved. In those assemblies were representatives of six islands and groups of islands,
which under the guidance of Great Britain
are forming themselves into a Federation. It
is anticipated that' another unit of the
British Commonwealth of Nations will thus
come into being.
I am sure our colleague, the honourable
senator from Fredericton (Hon. Mrs. Fergusson), who took a prominent part in the
proceedings, will agree with me that these
gatherings were most useful from every point
of view. For myself, personally, I might
venture to say that the most outstanding impression I came away with was that the will
to get together for mutual benefit did not
seem to be weakened because of the difficulties and differences. I can tell you that
these difficulties and differences were certainly not underestimated and will call for
a tremendous amount of give and take and
mutual reconciliation to ensure the federation
working to full advantage. For example, those

NOVEMBER 6, 1957
islands have tariff walls between each other;
they have their immigration regulations, and
for very real reasons, which only a close study
of the conditions could reveal. There are circumstances whic 2 would make it appear on
the face that the difficulties are almost insurmountable; but as I have said, it was fully
demonstrated that the will to get together is
there, and I think they are certainly well
on the way in their thinking and acting toward
close associations within the Commonwealth.
I feel that the natural resources of those
Islands and of Canada offer an opportunity
for wider co-operation in trade and mutual
helpfulness than has been availed of in the
past. In these days when extreme nationalism
is asserting itself in so many parts of the
world, and in so many instances coming up
in violent and threatening ways, it is indeed
something to be proud of that we are part of
a world-wide community of nations as expressed in the British Commonwealth.
I look back with great satisfaction to my
good fortune in being in London in 1931,
and sitting in the House of Commons during
the whole of the closing day of the debate
on the Statute of Westminster Bill. That
historic occasion, and the bill itself, put into
legal form what had developed and been in
practice over the years. That momentous
debate was a stock-talting event which I
shall always remember. I like to think of
the Commonwealth as a starting off position
for us in international relations, and of
course it is just that. It is not a goal, and
never can be, in this world of constantly
changing conditions.
I shall now pass from the subject of
Commonwealth relations to another relationship which I feel strongly about, and
that is with the United States.
I was very pleased to hear the honourable
senator from Ottawa (Hon. Mr. Lambert)
put forward in his remarks yesterday a
suggestion that the Government of Canada
should endeavour to interest the Government at Washington to bring about a joint
North American wheat pool, which would
undertake the sale of the surplus grain of
this continent to the best advantage of both
countries. The acceptance of such a plan
would be a definite drawing together of
mutual interests, which could well establish
a pattern for the development of future
relations. I think the idea is an excellent
one.
The honourable senator from Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) has forecast in a notice
on our Order Paper a most interesting
discussion involving the enlargement of our
trading areas through the development of
trade with a large group of nations. If the

Senate, with the co-operation of the Government, can pursue a thorough discussion of
such a subject, it will have made a tremendous
contribution toward the development not only
of Canadian trade, but of the harmonizing of
various interests throughout the world.
It is always puzzling to me that so many
people in their public and personal expressions seem to think that a closer relationship
with our neighbour to the south is a contradiction of close relationship with the
Commonwealth. I know we have to face
difficulties and adverse trends of one form
or another, not only looking south from here,
but abroad in the Commonwealth, and even
with respect to some branches of trade in
looking across this country from province to
province. We run up against world trading
difficulties of the worst kind when matters
of foreign exchange are involved. That is
a difficulty which we do not have to meet on
the North American continent.
We have at this time, unfortunately, an
unbalanced trading position with the United
States, to which I shall refer in a moment.
Our economy must inevitably be tied in
more closely with the United States, with its
170 million people living, one may say, with
us in the same land, than with any other part
of the world. If our relationship with the
United States becomes bad in economic matters, we shall slide down hill so fast that we
shall be crushed at the bottom. Here we have
two populations with natural products running all the way from the northern areas
down to the near tropics. Such products
logically interlock one with the other for
common use. What would be the use of
our great forests, except for American purchases of our forest products amounting to
$14 billion? Eighty-two per cent of our total
exports of these products go to the United
States. Newsprint exports alone amount to
more than $600 million a year; iron ore
and iron products amount to a quarter-billion dollars; non-ferrous metals and products
amount to a half-billion dollars; agriculture
and animal products to $376 million.
Of our fresh and frozen fish 98J per cent
of our exports go to the United States, for
there is no other available country with
refrigeration distributing facilities to use that
product. That, I would say, is one of the
greatest sources of development, reaching
down to an immense number of people, which
can be accomplished by drawing the American
people toward us rather than driving them
away, as some seem to wish to do.
It is alarming to see such a question in the
headlines: "Whither Canada, Commonwealth
Nation or U.S. Protectorate?". I call that
sheer rubbish!

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Prait: Surely, honourable senators, we can be a loyal Commonwealth nation and a close Commonwealth trading partner, without feeling we are being pushed into
that position by such a frightening alternative
as a "United States Protectorate". We have to
use sense and work reasonably, and at times
firmly, with the United States, particularly
to improve our economie relationship. We
can have, and we should work toward, a practical and close working partnership in both
directions.
I am perfectly aware of the need for pushing for and urging upon the United States
Government a more liberal policy in tariffs.
When referring to this subject on a previous
occasion in this chamber, I stated that it
was ridiculous to talk complacently about the
longest undefended national boundary in the
world as if it epitomized the very essence of
good relations. At that time I used the
expression, and I repeat it now, that we have
a tariff shooting war constantly going on right
along the whole border between Canada and
the United States. It is lamentable how the
United States tariff swings against us in this
industry or that, without the least consideration for our whole trading relations.
As an example of that condition, and an
example of absurd practices, may I cite an
instance to the house? There has always
been a tariff on Canadian frozen fish going
into the United States. Three or four years
ago someone introduced into the trade a
pre-cooked, ready-for-the-table product called
"fish sticks". As soon as it began to sell
widely someone thought of the bright idea of
putting a prohibitive duty on it so as to protect cooking labour-and I can describe it in
no other way-in the United States. The
idea was channeled through official lines at
Washington, and who over there knew anything about it? Certainly the American public
did not know about it. In that country there
is an abysmal ignorance of Canadian problems and Canadian trade relations.
I have travelled a great deal in the United
States all my life, and even now when I visit
the areas outside the big cities I find the two
most talked of Canadian subjects are the
Mounties-that of course is because of our
tourist trade advertising-and the dome
railway cars which travel through the
Rockies-they being a feature of railway
advertising. Now, I do not criticize that
situation, but I say it illustrates the need for
sound Canadian publicity among the American people. I do not suggest for one
moment that we should blame them for
their lack of knowledge in this respect; indeed, the blame should be attached to ourselves for having failed to make then better

informed about us. The setting exists for a
close and practical relationship in trade
matters, but we do not develop it.

that country know that by reason of the
excess of imports by Canada from the United
States over our exports to that country last
year, we provided a full livelihood for large
numbers of their people? The United States
last year shipped to Canada $1,348 million
more in goods-and they were mostly manufactured goods-than Canada shipped to the
United States. The actual overall financial
deficit, including goods, services, interest
and so forth, was $1,640 million. Calculated
on the relation of the total population of the
United States to the value of their gross
national product, that deficit provided a full
living for more than 650,000 American
people.
I know it is easy to talk about what should
or should not be done to develop a fair
measure of understanding by the United
States people about Canada. My purpose in
bringing out these facts is to show how very
little we have done to make even a start on
a solution of our common problem. I would
like to suggest that as a beginning of organized effort, and I repeat just as a beginning,
all the Canadian consulates in the United
States-there are eight of them, apart from
Washington, and probably there will be more
very soon-should have specially appointed
and specially trained information officers
with adequate staff. Those officers should
operate in close relationship with our Department of Trade and Commerce and should
be amply financed to put over a wide publicity program of worth to Canada.
From the beginning there might grow a
useful and wide movement to make Canada
and Canadian problems better known to the
American people. The way to get fair and
favourable treatment from Government is
to have an understanding, as well as a favourable, public. I do not think that that would
be too hard a task if we just got busy and
applied ourselves. I have no doubt that under
the impetus of such a movement we should
have far more of our leading citizens in
many walks of life speaking of Canada and
Canadian interests in all parts of the United
States than we have at present.
It is true, of course, that the flow of capital
investment into Canada has been a balancing

NOVEMBER 6, 1957
factor in financing the excess of imports over
exports. Its main benefit is the extension of
industry throughout Canada. With that investment comes also a great measure of
benefit from the industrial research which
is part of modern industry. That is a phase
of this problem which is not very often
talked of, but it is a very real factor. In
1955 Canadian industry spent on research,
exclusive of Government research, $65 million. That amount is minor compared with
what was spent in the United States. I could
not get the exact comparative figures, but
the amount that industry has been spending
on industrial "research and development" in
the United States, apart from ordinary capital
investment, runs between $3 and $4 billion
a year.
Let us think for a moment not only of
motor cars, household appliances, radios, and
such like, but of hundreds of other things
which are ordinary necessities of life to us
and which are made in Canada by reason of
our mutual industrial interest with the
United States, the transfer of American
patents to Canada and also American capital.
I cannot see the need for the extreme
alarm that is expressed over the flow of
money into industry from across the border.
European capital built up American industry
and made America a debtor country for
over two centuries of its development. As a
matter of fact, outside capital was a predominant feature of American development
during the period when the population of the
United States was treble that of Canada,
and even greater. I think that a wider spread
of Canadian shareholders in American
financed enterprises here would be a good
thing. But on the other hand the need for
new money for development in such a country
as this is absolutely tremendous. We can
never progress by a shoestring effort, so why
should we try?
This outside capital when it comes into
Canada buries itself in the industry of
Canada; it is subject to Canadian laws;
corporate earnings are taxed and public
revenue is derived from the transfer of
profits.
I know that the present is a difficult time
to reconcile feelings. We have differences
with our neighbour over their wheat
disposal policy. We have a right to drive
hard for a better understanding on tariffs
and tariff applications. I want to say this,
that the time to drive hard for improvements such as I suggest and which are necessary to our economy is right at this time
when our neighbour has such a valuable
trading advantage.
It is up to us to be on our feet and do the
very best we can to follow along a policy

such as I have indicated, or any more farreaching policy that can reasonably be
developed. We should lose no time in making ourselves better known and our problems better understood by the American
people, right down the line.
I hope a lead-off in this, as I have suggested, under the guidance of the Department of Trade and Commerce, will be found
to have merit. I feel, as I intimated just
now, that one of the great advantages of such
an organized movement would be that it
would afford an opportunity for industry,
labour and professional organizations within
our dominion to actively co-operate.
While that is going on we should, of course,
cultivate our Commonwealth and general international relations, as I have suggested.
What we need for the development of
Canada is a properly balanced economie program, with a wide view of our outside relations, and not a throw-over of American
relations for those of the Commonwealth any
more than a throw-over of Commonwealth
interests for those of America.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Wall, the debate
was adjourned.

SENATE
OLD AGE SECURITY BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gustave Monette moved the second
reading of Bill 19, to amend the Old Age
Security Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I ask your
indulgence. This is the first time I have risen
to address you in support of an important
bill, and while I feel moved by what is for
me the gravity of the occasion, I am none
the less appreciative also of the good will
and dignity of this house.
I have been asked to give a few words of
explanation of the bill. I shall not occupy
you very long, because I suppose that every
honourable senator knows the content and
purpose of the bill. It may be sufficient to
mention that it contains three important
features. First, it provides for the increase
of the monthly pension from $46 to $55.
Second, it reduces from 20 to 10 years the
basic minimum period of residence which
entitles the applicant to a pension, but with
an accessory provision that if there has not
been continuity of residence for 10 years the
applicant may establish his eligibilty ,by
proof that he has been in Canada for double
the time of his total periods of absence
within the 10 years preceding the application. The third feature of the bill provides
for the extension from three months to six
months of the period which qualified pensioners are entitled, without loss of pension,
to spend outside Canada in any calendar
year.
This measure, honourable senators, evidences the desire of the Government to
honour a pledge which during the last election was solemnly given to the Canadian
people, and specifically to our senior citizens.
The principle of honouring a solemn promise
is one which, I believe, will be approved by
everyone concerned.
The bill amends the Old Age Security Act.
It has been said in some quarters that the
Government is not bringing in a new principle, but one which was embodied in the
act that it is now being sought to amend. That
is true. The amendments in no way violate
a principle which was made law as a result
of the work of an all-party committee which,
in 1950, was formed to study ways of improving existing legislation. This committee
presented
recommendations which were
adopted by the then administration. As I
have said, the proposals emanated from a
committee representative of all parties, and
they served as the basis of a law whereby
a citizen of Canada who has attained the age
of 70 years or more is entitled as a matter of
right to a pension. That was the principle.

I think honourable senators will agree that
this legislation does not go against the existing law. The purpose of the bill is to increase the pension from $46 to $55 per month,
and to reduce the residence requirement from
20 to 10 years, which I think is a reasonable
period in view of the fact that a person wishing to avail himself of old age security benefits need not be a Canadian citizen. As
honourable senators know, the present Old
Age Security Act does not contain the usual
requirement as to citizenship found in similar
legislation in other countries. The bill does
not amend that principle; it merely requires
that the old age pensioner should have attained the age of 70 years-which is a requirement under the present act-and have
resided in Canada for a total of 10 years.
It has been said that it will cost approximately $96 million per year to increase the
pension from $46 to $55 per month.
Honourable senators, I do not think I need
say anything further except that the legislation before us points out the insufficiency
or inadequacy of the present pension. Honourable senators may have different opinions as
to what the monthly pension payment should
be, but this is a security measure and the
pension goes as a matter of right to any
citizen who qualifies under the act. As it is
generally felt that the present pension rate
is not sufficient, I earnestly hope that honourable senators will agree to passage of the
bill. It would be an act of justice in the case
of people who immigrate to this country, some
of whom are perhaps loath to do so because
of existing pension rights in their native land.
Immigrants who reside here for 10 years
and remain good citizens will benefit under
the bill, which will no doubt enhance
Canada's reputation in other countries.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Did the honourable senator
state that a person need not be a Canadian
citizen to come under the act as it is now?
Hon. Mr. Croll: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Monette: A person need only
reside in this country a certain period of
time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Well, when the legislation
was first introduced a person had to be a
Canadian citizen in order to benefit.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No.
Hon. Mr. Moneite: The honourable senator
knows that similar legislation in other
countries requires that the pensioner be a
citizen of the country in which he is drawing
the pension. That is not the case under our
act. The bill simply reduces the residence
requirement from 20 to 10 years; it does not

NOVEMBER 6, 1957
alter the principle. I think I made this point
clear before and I do not need to elaborate
on it.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, at the outset I would like to congratulate the honouirable gentleman from
Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette) on the
splendid presentation which he has made of
the first bill he has undertaken to explain in
this chamber.

Hon. Mr. Croll: I was not here in 1925, so
I do not know.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Why did you answer my
question then? Keep quiet unless you know.
Hon. Mr. Croll: In 1950 a person was not
required to be a citizen. I was a member of
the committee handling this legislation and
I know.

the period of residence to less than ten years,
because that would mean a charge on the
Treasury and I am not saying that it should
be done, but I think it should receive the
consideration of the Government. If a person becomes naturalized in five years, why
should he not be eligible for the old age
pension then, if otherwise qualified? If a
person does not want to become naturalized,
it might be a different thing, but if he becomes naturalized and obtains every other

With regard to the other provisions of

in accord with them.
Honourable senators, unfortunately it will
not be possible for me to be present on
Monday next when the Old Age Assistance

I had
hoped that those bills would be discussed
today, but the senator who is to explain them
is unable to be here. I wish to say now that
having read the three bills, I am in favour
of their provisions, as indeed I am in
favour of the provisions of the bill now

will receive unanimous support in this house.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In view of the fact that
the honourable gentleman cannot be present

bills to which he has referred will not

The motion was agreed to, and the bill

INTERNAL ECONOMY
REPORT OF COMMITTEE-DEBATE ADJOURNED

The Senate proceeded to consideration of
the second report of the Standing Committee
on Internal
Economy
and Contingent
Accounts.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine, Chairman of the Committee, moved that the report be adopted.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I have a few remarks to make with
regard to this report, and I hope they will
be favourably considered by the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig). They are
about the char staff of the Senate. They do
their work very well, but I am always sorry
when a differentiation is made between the
employees of the Senate and the employees
of the House of Commons. These Senate
employees are doing a painstaking job very
well; they have to come here at all times,
and look after the Opening of Parliament,
and have to move all the furniture. We live
in the Senate. We are in a house of Parliament which is well kept, and we owe it to
them; at least, we count on them; and they
have to count on every dollar that they make.
There is a difference of $18 per year between
the amount that is paid to them and the
amount paid to similar employees of the
House of Commons. When a member of the
char staff has a large family and has to send
his children to school, he needs every cent
of his salary. The char staff of the House of
Commons receive a salary of $2,832, plus
$150, which makes a total of $2,982; in the
Senate the annual rate for char staff is
$2,964, or $18 less than that paid by the
House of Commons.
I submit this case to the honourable Leader
of the Government. He may think it a small
thing, but if it is small it is so much the
easier to grant. I hope my defence of the
members of the char staff on this side will
receive favourable consideration.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, is
there not some explanation or some reason
why there should be a difference between

NOVEMBER 6, 1957
the compensation of people in the Senate and
those in the House of Commons who do the
same work?
Hon. Mr. Haig: They are paid exactly the
same.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It has been said there is
a difference between the two salaries. It
seems to me these two staffs should be paid
the same amount, but it is said they are not.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is a difference
between the amount paid to members of the
House of Commons and that paid to honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Croll: That is hardly comparable.
These people do exactly the same work, some
at this end of the building, and others at the
opposite end. The question is, why do they
not receive the same compensation?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
may I say that since the last session of Parliament the Civil Service Commission and
the Treasury Board have made an intensive
study and review of the various rates of
compensation throughout the public service,
with the result that most members of that
service are now receiving higher rates of
pay. Among the few who perhaps have not
yet benefited are our own temporary and
sessional employees. As many of you undoubtedly know, they do not come under the
Civil Service Act; consequently, any change
in their remuneration must be authorized
by the Senate. For that purpose your committee examined salary improvements of
other similar services and, based upon wage
scales now in effect in the other branch of
Parliament, have submitted for your consideration revised rates for our temporary
and sessional employees consistent with the
revisions made by the other house. That is
all I know about it.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I thank my honourable
friend from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croil)
for having supported my request. I am sorry
that a discrimination exists. It is no encouragement for these men on the Senate
side to do more work than those on the
Commons side. I believe the Civil Service
Commission is not doing everything it could;
and the proof of it is that the commission
has placed before us for our approval a scale
of pay in which there is discrimination between the staffs of the two bouses. I hope
my honourable friend the Deputy Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) will see
that justice is done for the Senate staff.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators
I believe most of us concur in the sentiment

expressed by the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot). However, it is my understanding that, with the
adjustments that are made in this report, the
char staff in the Senate will be paid on the
same basis as the char staff in the House of
Commons.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: They will not.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is the information which was given to those senators who
attended the meeting of the Internal
Economy Committee the other day, and that
is what we understood to be the case.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I purposely made some inquiries about this
alleged discrimination between the two
staffs. The matter came before me officially
today and I had to take some action. Before
doing so I decided that it was better for me
first to learn the facts. As a result, I now
know that the salary rates here are exactly
the same as they are in the other bouse. I
trust our officials to give us the correct information, and I am told positively that the
rates of pay are exactly the same.
The question was raised in committee that
perhaps some employees in the House of
Commons had to work harder than comparable employees on the Senate side. The
official present said that that was not his
problem, that it was up to us to deal with it
-and he indicated the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and
myself. I am reliably informed, and I am
satisfied, that the rates of pay are the same
on both sides.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, the
senator who raised this question (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot) is, as we all know, a very painstaking gentleman, and I am sure he was careful in this instance. May I suggest that this
report be allowed to stand until my honourable friend can determine exactly whether
there is any difference between the two rates
of pay? I am sure this bouse would not want
to have a distinction made between two staffs
who are doing the same work, one at this
end of the building and the other at the
opposite end. May I suggest that the matter
be allowed to stand until tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Haig: We have to trust somebody.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I
move adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Croil, the debate
was adjourned.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow
at 3 p.m.

NOVEMBER 7, 1957
pressed by former speakers as we think back
to that heartwarming and memorable experience of welcoming in Canada Her Majesty
our Queen and her husband Prince Philip.
We deeply appreciate the meaning of the
historic circumstance that enabled us to hear
the Speech from the Throne delivered by
our most gracious and beloved sovereign in
person. We were all uplifted and ennobled
in our feelings of loyalty, of unity and of
common purpose on behalf of the democratic
goals and purposes for which we are now
here assembled.
(Translation):
I wish to offer you, Mr. Speaker, my sincere congratulations on your appointment to
the honourable and lofty position you now
occupy.
May I also express a hearty welcome to
the honourable senators who were appointed
to this chamber during the year.
(Text):
In expressing congratulations and welcome
to the new senators I wish to admit once
again that I am still warmed by my personal
recollection of the friendliness and hospitality
extended to me two years ago, which I then
termed as a minor miracle in the art of
human relations. To the honourable senator
from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White)
and the honourable senator from Shawinigan
(Hon. Mr. Méthot), the mover and seconder
of the Address in reply to the Speech from
the Throne, I extend my sincere congratulations on the worthy and challenging substance
of their remarks and on the sincerity of their
presentations.
With your kind indulgence, honourable
senators, I should like to make a few observations about each of the following four
problem areas:
1. Budgetary implications
of probable
federal expenditures.
2. The Dominion-Provincial Fiscal Conference.
3. The continuing crisis in education.
4. Submerged nationalities in the U.S.S.R.
vis-à-vis the 40th anniversary of the
great October revolution today, November 7, 1957.
I studied with great interest the contents
of the Speech from the Throne, which outlined in the usual traditional generalities the
legislative program of the present administration. So far most of the legislation, we
can foresee, implies the expenditure of additional sums of the federal tax money; in
fact, considerable sums of money. This cost
burden may be increased by the possible
implementation of the national health insurance plan and by probable changes in the
dominion-provincial tax distribution formulae.

May I make a rough estimate of the probable annual cost of projected legislation and
other changes? We have already dealt with
additional estimates No. 2, which added more
than $80 million to all former estimates. Let
us consider too the annual charges on the
federal treasury by reason of the additional
monthly payment of $9 for old age security
as well as pensions to blind and disabled
persons, which involve a total cost of
approximately $9 million per month, or an
estimated $109,232,000 a year. Yesterday this
house passed the Old Age Security bill, which
carries an estimated cost of $96 million, on
the principle of right and universality, motivated by arguments of need, with no attempt
to differentiate between those who really
need the extra $9 a month and those whose
needs may be less pressing. We may some
day have to face this problem of differentiation. Then there are going to be changes in
the Veterans Allowance Act and the Pension
Act. Details of the additional expenditures
are still on the secret list, but I am making
a very wild guess that they will be about
$25 million a year. Salary increases were
granted to the Civil Service, the Armed
Forces and the R.C.M.P., and they are going
to cost between $125 to $135 million.
Probable changes will take place in the
Dominion-Provincial
Tax Rental Agreements. All signs point to that, and those
changes will be upward revisions. A very
rough guess, scaled to permit an additional
$100 million to the province of Ontario on
what has been discussed as the 15-15-50
formula and to maintain the equalization
grants balance now existing, is that these
changes will probably cost $300 million.
The possible implementation of the national hospital insurance plan as provided
for in Bill 320 of last session, and not extended to cover depreciation costs or care of
T.B. patients or mental patients, has been
estimated at a total annual cost of $380 million; and the federal contribution, 50 per
cent of that, would be $190 million. If we
include the care of T.B. and mental patients,
which cost the Manitoba Government $4
million a year, then the federal share would
be $2 million; and for the whole of Canada,
if we calculate from that figure, we would
probably find that the cost of care of these
two classes of patients would amount to $30
million.
So a rough estimate of probable annual increase in federal expenditures in the early
foreseeable future could be placed at between $750 to $850 million.

SENATE
Whatever the amounts of the increases
may be, we must face the problem of reconciling potential expenditures with potential revenues, and this problem is of concern
to the average Canadian citizen.
We might search for clues regarding the
relationship of expenditures and revenues in
the last treasury statement. In September
proper, as I understand it, our revenues rose
by $21.5 million. We saved $20 million in
defence spending, and $30 million in a kind
of temporary technical saving in our transfer payments to provinces. Yet, because of
the previous increase in commitments and
the natural growth factors in expenditures,
such as the family allowances, which went
up by $4.6 million, and Veterans Affairs,
which went up by $4.8 million, the net result on balance was that we had a monthly
surplus of only $6.7 million, which, if continued for twelve months without other significant changes, would give us a probable
annual surplus of some $80 million.
Putting it another way, for the six months
from April to September 1957 total revenues
went up by $100 million to $2,476,100,000,
but the expenditures rose by $144,600,000.
That is, there was a differential of $44.5
million between the expenditures and the
revenues as far as increases are concerned.
So, what is the pattern? Our expenditures
are rising faster before the full yearly impact
of the last budget's changes and before the
impact of probable expenditure increases I
have tried to indicate.
What I am trying to say is that care and
caution are needed as we attempt to assess
all the financing implications of the legislation inferred from the Speech from the
Throne and now in the process of presentatien to Parliament.
Will this legislation and other probable
developments I have indicated increase still
more the rising curve of expenditures? Will
our

preparedness?
What about repayments on our national
indebtedness? Will the slowing down of the
rate of increase in our gross national income
bring a further relative differential between
the faster rising expenditures and the slower
rising revenues? Will the downward trend
in surplus during the first six months of the
current fiscal year, which dropped by
$41,300,000, be accelerated?
What, then, is
likely to happen to the $152 million surplus
estimated by the former administration for
1957-58?
In raising these budgetary problems I
would not like to leave the inference that I
am opposed to legislation which proposes to

make additional expenditures for worthy
national purposes, especially for those in
faveur of which there appears to be a majority concensus of Canadian public opinion.

When

budgetary procurement of the necessary
funds I am, however, mindful of the statement
in the Speech from the Throne which makes
reference to "changes in certain of the taxing
statutes". Will these taxation changes turn
out to be in fact substantial reductions in the
tax burden? It remains to be seen whether
taxation reductions will be a reasonably
prominent activity of the present Parliament.
I come now to the problem of dominionprovincial fiscal relations in the financial area.
All Canadians will follow with sympathetic
interest the deliberations of the planned
November conference of federal-provincial
representatives, hoping that new understandings of the problems involved may bring
realistic and still more satisfactory agreements involving the allocation of taxation
powers and revenues.
I believe that most Canadians find centralized tax collection efficient, equitable and
fair.
They do net favour interprovincial
differerces in tax rates or a multiplicity of
tax-collecting bodies.
They rccognize that
our commercial and inlustrial institutions
are at present concentrated in two provnces,
and they favcur the principle of eq alizing
interprovincial inequalities of per capita
income through redistributive public spending. I believe we have accepted the concepts of the average national standard of
public services and the average provincial
per capita tax burden, despite the fact that
we find both yardsticks hard to defiine and
difficult to equato. I believe that the average
Canadian wants the federal Government to
do
something
about
inter-class
income
redistribution
and
counter-cyclical
fiscal
policies, in order to dampen or level out
economic fluctuations. I believe that we do
want to provide for cyclical stability of
provincial income by arranging for a kind of
built-in stabilizer in any tax rental agreement. For us in Manitoba this stabilizing
factor is very important.
I have ventured to express these few
generalizations because I am a firm believer
in the basic principles of the present taxrental agreements as worked out by the
former
administration.
I
am
thinking
especially of the income corrective factor
which is part and parcel of the equalization
grant structure so important to the six less
financially-favoured provinces. The formula
for tax sharing tentatively suggested by
Ontario-the so-called 15-15-50 formula-

NOVEMBER 7, 1957
could bring relative financial advantages to
the four more wealthy Canadian provinces,
and would need-I emphasize this-to be
counterbalanced by sequential changes to
upgrade the effect of these corrective or
equalization grants. The six provinces that
at present are less-favoured financially regard
as crucial the equalization principle of the
present tax rental agreements and I believe
they would resist any attempts to dilute the
financial benefits flowing from this recognition of fiscal need.
A letter of Premier Campbell, reported on
page 592 of Hansard of the House of Commons, underscores the position that the
Manitoba Government plans to take at this
November fiscal conference.
I quote from
his letter, dated September 26:
I am sure that you and your colleagues are
familiar with the traditional position which the
province of Manitoba bas taken with respect to the
tax agreement system.
Our province bas consistently been a foremost advocate of the principle
of equalization-a principle which was fundamental
to the former tax rental agreements and which
bas continued to be recognized in the present
arrangements.
We will certainly not willingly
accept any abandonment of this principle, or the
adoption of any formula which failed to continue
to provide to the less wealthy provinces a position relative to that of the other provinces at
least as favourable as that which they hold under
the present arrangements.

technology. They focus our attention on the
relative status of the Western democracies
in the scientific, technological and military
fields. Sputnik 1 had something to do with
the conference between Prime Minister Macmillan and President Eisenhower and with
the plans now being evolved to pool the
scientific brain power and the creative
resources of the North Atlantic Alliance.
Perhaps these developments should focus our
attention on the increased urgency of the
continuing crisis in Canadian education generally. Although much has been spoken about
the developing crisis in education, and
although a greater awareness of these problems has brought many helpful advances, the
fact remains that still greater efforts are
needed.
How else are we to meet the challenge
of the breadth of horizons that are before us
in Canada? Permit me to quote from an
address delivered by the editor of the Winnipeg Free Press on October 19, 1957. It is
a challenging statement, and I want you to
share it with me:

At the forthcoming conference, therefore, we
will look forward to hearing proposals put forward
respecting revisions in the present tax-sharing
formula which will give greater recognition to this
principle of equalization and result in the provinces
obtaining a larger share of the tax resources
available to government in Canada.

Never have people had a better foundation on
which to build-in the strength and soundness of
our basic institutions, the richly diverse cultures
that have come to us from all over Europe, the
richness of our physical resources.
If there is
a country in the world that should be capable of
leading a great new Renaissance, of doing so
before the end of this century in the lifetime of
men and women now in their twenties and thirties,
surely that country is Canada.
Surely Canadians have more chance than people
anywhere to rise to new triumphs of the human
intellect, to lead the march of mankind to higher
standards of tolerance and kindness and understanding in the life of man with man.

One last point before I leave this problem
of dominion-provincial fiscal relations. I have
often wondered why we continue to make
such extensive use of conditional or matchinggrant payments to provinces. Why is it not
possible to evolve a comprehensive transfer
payment formula, recognizing the element of
our national obligation in such important
provincial responsibilities as health and welfare, highways, education and perhaps, municipalities? Why should this formula not be
fixed for a fairly long period and be selfadjusting with respect to population and
per capita income? And why should these
payments not be unconditional or outright
grants with no federal Government control
or supervision of how the spenders do the
spending?
I should like to turn now briefly-and I
think you will expect me to-to the problem
of the increased urgency in the developing
crisis in education at all levels.
Soviet satellites 1 and 2-Sputnik and
Novoputnik-can be regarded as symbols
of the tremendous advances made by the
U.S.S.R. in the fields of science and applied

The speaker drew political inferences from
this statement. I am more concerned with
its educational implications. I believe that a
basic key to the eventual realization of these
horizons is the education of our younger
generations-our most valuable national resource. This challenge to education is not
only internal, to meet adequately what we
may regard as purely internal purposes of
our national development; the challenge is
also external, for we must meet head-on the
challenge of the Communist world, whose
dictatorship, self-anointed, has decreed top
priority for massive and disciplined educational endeavours to train the available
brains needed to steer their vast Communistdirected, industrial, commercial, scientific
and military potential first to outstrip the
West-and then?
What are some signs of the crisis in education? We must examine this educational
challenge to us in the context of these disturbing realities:
1. There is a continuing shortage of scientists, engineers, technicians and other

And note the next paragraph:

SENATE
professionally-trained personnel. This problem has been raised over and over again in
the last few years.
2. There is a continuing scarcity of wellqualified teachers.
3. There is an ever more pressing need for
physical plant, equipment and staff, especially at secondary, college, and university
levels.
We must ask ourselves whether our shortages of highly trained personnel are not
direct results of the waste and neglect of
human abilities resulting from many
thousands of Canadian boys and girls dropping out of school and not completing their
education. After 26 years of teaching I must
tell you that hundreds of them passed
through my hands and it made my heart
sore to think of the contribution they could
have made to Canada had they stayed in
school; but their sights were not there.
Honourable senators, a great part of this
problem is a financial one. What are the
figures? Of ten thousand boys and girls in
Canada who enter elementary school, 6,800
get to Grade 8. We lose 3,200. Between
Grade 8 and Grade 9 we lose another 1,500
because only 5,300 enter Grade 9. Out of
that number 2,500 reach junior matriculation, but only 400 to 500 of them enter
university and 300 to 400 gain their first
degree.
According to the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, about 60 per cent of Canadian
boys and girls between 15 and 19 are not
attending school. The question is: How many
of these drop-outs are gifted children for
whose adequate educational development as
our potential leaders we have not done
enough?
The Russians have one student at university for every 150 of their population; we
have one in 250. Per 1,000 pupils enrolled,
the Americans graduate at university level
roughly 6 to 8 per cent, and the Canadians
graduate 3 to 4 per cent. The Russians are
apparently graduating more than the Americans. If these figures are indeed valid,
what conclusions must we draw?
There is evidence, honourable senators, to
indicate that over 50 per cent of our highereducation drop-outs are due to financial difficulties. Let us look at our overall financial
aid and scholarship programs for Canadian
students. In Canada we have 71,000 students
at university, with roughly 10,000 getting
financial aid in the form of scholarships or
bursaries. In other words, of these 71,000
students, 15 per cent receive financial aid.
In the United States 75 per cent of the university students receive financial aid, and in
the United Kingdom the figure is 72.9 per

cent. This means that compared with Canadian university students, almost five times
as many university students in the United
States and the United Kingdorn are getting
financial aid.
The Canada Council met recently in Ottawa
and announced that its first major effort to
advance Canadian culture would be through
the distribution of approximately 300 scholarships and fellowships to students, teachers,
artists, and members of other professions who
might be able to make a worthwhile contribution in the arts, humanities and social
sciences.
This is welcome news, but we must do
more, for what we need are more good students in our institutions of higher learning.
I believe we need to establish and to fund
thousands of new scholarships and bursaries
through governmental efforts and through
private enterprise efforts. Why indeed should
we not have comprehensive educational foundations in every province in Canada? These
could, would and should supplement our
national efforts.
Honourable senators, I want to bring to
your attention the campaign of the National
Federation of Canadian University Students
for an annual scholarship-bursary program
to cost $5 million in order to bring 10,000
scholarships of $500 each. Related to need
and to our overall financial ability, this
appears to be a necessary, worthy and attainable goal. However, it would raise to only
30 per cent the number of students receiving
aid as compared to the 75 per cent in the
United Kingdom and the United States
respectively.
An alternative federal scheme of 5,000
"Canada Scholarships" has been mooted and
discussed, which scholarships would pay
something to the student and something to
the university, for the need of the university
too is important. The plan would probably
call for a federal expenditure of $10 million
per annum. Can we afford this? Perhaps a
more pertinent question might be, "Can we
afford not to afford it?"
Honourable senators, before I leave this
topic I think it is important to keep in mind
the trends in the relationship between our
total educational expenditures and our gross
national product. This percentage relationship is a very useful yardstick in assessing
our total efforts on behalf of education. I am
told by the Dominion Bureau of Statistics
that related to gross national product-that
is, our ability to pay-the total educational
expenditures were about 4 per cent to our
credit during the depression years-1933, for
example-and that this percentage dropped
and is now slowly struggling up. In 1950 it
was 2.49 per cent, and I am informed that it

NOVEMBER 7, 1957
is 2.75 per cent at present. Recognizing the
current urgency of doing more for technical
and scientific education, surely the needs of
education generally could become one of the
key problems to be discussed at the DominionProvincial Conference in November.
Honourable senators, with your indulgence
I should likg to take a few minutes to discuss the problem of submerged people within
the U.S.S.R. Honourable members may have
been made increasingly aware lately that
October 1957 marks the Fortieth Anniversary
of the great October Socialistic Revolutionthe Russian Communist Revolution on the
territory of Russia proper.
Much propaganda will be directed to
Canadians and to other democratic peoples
telling us how the Soviet peoples are actively
preparing to celebrate the glorlous 40th
anniversary of the Soviet state with new and
important achievements to crown great successes in developing the socialistic economy
since the great October Revolution.
Ukrainian communist leaders will solemnly
reiterate how the Ukrainian people gained
their independence and freedom in struggle
and labour with the help of all the peoples of
the Soviet Union, and first of all with the
help of the great Russian peoples. But they
will fail to mention that Ukraine has been a
land of fear, of political straight-jacketing,
of concentration camps, of genocide, of artificial famine, of religious persecution, and of
persistent cultural russification. It is my
purpose to bring to your attention, honourable senators, the understanding and the
sequential hopes and aspirations of some
400,000 Ukrainian Canadians speaking, as it
were, on behalf of their Ukrainian kith and
kin, who we believe are presently denied
their liberties in their homeland.
As a matter of historical fact this particular October anniversary marks the
Bolshevik coup which actually took place on
November 7, 1917, or on October 25, 1917,
according to the old Julian Calendar, which
was then used. This coup which overthrew
the Provisional Government of Kerensky
eventually turned out to be a counter revolution by Russian Communists and their fifth
column adherents against Ukraine and other
non-Russian peoples, many of whom had by
this time declared for freedom and selfdetermination through their own national
revolutions. It is a matter of historical record
that the revolutionary break-up of Czarist
Russia began much earlier-in March of 1917
-for the Czar abdicated on March 15, 1917,
three days after the historic episode in
Petrograd when two garrison regiments, composed chiefly of Ukrainians, refused to fire on

a mass demonstration of workers and in
effect rebelled actively against the Tsarist
Government.
During these momentous revolutionary
years there were in fact two separate and
eventually divergent and opposing currents:
1. The Russian Revolution proper, on the
territory of Russia for a change of government--over which the Communists eventually
seized control, and
2. The Revolutions for national liberation
on the lands of Ukraine, Finland, Estonia,
Lithuania, Latvia, Byelo-Russia; among the
Poles in Russia and among the Caucasian
peoples and the Moslem peoples of Asiatic
Russia. The national liberation movements
were a natural consequence of a breakdown
in the initial confidence of the non-Russian
peoples in a Russian federal democracy, which
had prompted many of them to be satisfied
originally with a kind of limited national
autonomy in a federal relationship with
Russia. This idealistic coexistence was soon
disillusioned by the reappearance of historie
signs of Russian imperialism in somewhat
new forms and under the new communist
leadership.
Let me give you a resumé of key happenings in the Ukraine revolution for national
determination. I place them on record as
symbolic of similar events in the attempts of
other non-Russian peoples to gain national
freedom and full independence.
After nearly three centuries of political
partition and foreign domination; after long
decades of economic, social and cultural
deprivation-after the so-called dark ages
under Czarist Russia when it seemed that
there had been complete obliteration of the
Ukraine as a separate national entity-the
Ukrainians seized the first available opportunity to declare their independence and to
begin the building of a democratic and Christian nation.
On March 12, 1917 there was trouble in
Petrograd, when two regiments of the army
garrison, composed mainly of Ukranians,
revolted with demonstrating workmen. On
March 15 the Czar abdicated. On March 17,
two days later, the Ukrainians formed their
Ukraine Central Council, amidst huge public
manifestations of Ukrainian national consciousness and desire for independence. In
May 1917 the All Ukrainian National Congress
met in Kiev and proclaimed the Ukraine a
free nation within the Russian federation.
But on January 22, 1918 they had had enough,
and there followed the Ukraine's declaration
of national sovereignty-complete sovereignty,
total independence and separation from
Russia. On January 22, 1919 occurred the
political unification with Western Ukraine.

SENATE
These sample events portray, if you will,
the long awaited process of the then gradual
dissolution of the old Russia Empire into its
natural national component parts. This process was not completed in 1919, with consequences which have gradually forced the
Western democracies into a position of gravest
peril vis-à-vis the Communist Empire as it
now exists. It could be argued-and I hope
it is not argued again in like vein at some
future time to come-that in refusing to
extend President Wilson's doctrine of the self
determination of nations to the peoples of
the former Russian Empire who had declared
their independence, the Western democratic
world saved the communist October counter
revolution. It could be argued that the Western world, by supporting the adventures of
Denikin, Wrangle, Haller and others, so
weakened the democratie movements for national liberation of the nations of former
Czarist Russia, and that of Ukraine, that the
Western world really aided the Russian Communists to maintain the communist counter
revolution in Russia. Be that as it may, because of internal weaknesses and external
difficulties the Russian Communists were able
to reconquer the colonies of the former Czarist
Empire, and among these the largest and the
most promising, the Ukrainian National Republic, which ceased to exist on November
20, 1920.
This is the historical context of the problem of the submerged nations and oppressed
peoples within the U.S.S.R. Slowly but surely
their fate was submerged behind a cloak of
silence, sometimes naïve, sometimes platitudinous and pontifical, and sometimes conspiratorial. This problem is not a myth, nor
is it misguided chauvinism, or unrealistic
adventurism, or imperialist bourgeois intrigue, as the communists term it. The fact
is that the spirit of democratie Christianoriented nationalism has continually challenged and will continue to challenge the
Soviet system because its primary and central defect is the presence of subjection and
absence of freedom. I believe that this unsatisfied spirit of democratic nationalism and
Christian liberalism is the Achilles' heel of
the threatening Soviet "monolith".
I should like to remind honourable
senators at this point that just two weeks
ago, October 23, 1957, we had the first anniversary of the Hungarian nationalist uprising. It seems appropriate, timely and
significant to remember those momentous
events in Hungary at this particular point.
They bring to mind the fate of an additional
100 million non-Russians ensnared in what
we have justly described as the compulsory
satellite system of the so-called People's
Democracies.

During our special parliamentary session
of November 1956, when we assessed the
meaning of the tragic yet glorious events
which had occurred in heroic Hungary, and
when we asked ourselves what we as free,
liberal democrats could or would do, it was
my privilege to move the Address in reply to
the Speech from the Throne. A4 that time I
reminded honourable senators of the equally
significant and equally determined struggle
for a larger measure of individual freedom
and justice on the part of those peoples who
have been aptly termed the "submerged nations" within the U.S.S.R., those 100 millions
of minorities who have been oppressed longer
and therefore sublimated, decimated and
Sovietized more effectively.
At that time too I wondered how we in
fact interpreted our moral obligation to
help these submerged and effectively muzzled peoples-keying myself to a statement
by the Right Honourable Louis St. Laurent
on this principle in our foreign policy:
Our aim is that the people of Eastern Europe
should be free to choose their own form of government, a basic right they have not enjoyed for
many years.
Translating this moral obligation to the
people of Eastern Europe into constructive,
sober and realistic policies is not an easy
task. Our first obligation must be to build
our own democratie society so constructively
that it will remain free and imgregnable, as
we prepare to assist the victims of Soviet
tyranny when they regain their freedom.
However, we must keep in mind that the
communist
leaders
openly
and directly
preach their slogans of communist peace and
Soviet democracy and freedom, going over
the heads of freely-chosen leadership and
appealing directly to the so-called progressive elements in the population of any
country.
The July issue of International
Affairs, printed in Moscow, expresses this

continued

communist

challenge

in

these

words:
The great revolutionary teachings of MarxismLeninism will continue to chart the road of struggle
for the overthrow of imperialism, for peace,
democracy, and socialism for all the workers of the
capitalist world.

Surely,
honourable
senators, the
free
world should believe with as much vigour
that the future belongs to democracy, to
liberty and to justice. Surely the free world

should at least speak as often and as openly
that it is our wish and our determination to
bring to the submerged and enslaved peoples
the freedoms which we have won and in
which we believe so deeply. Is it not in
our interests to forge a more positive, more

constructive policy which will bring us the

friendship,

nay

the

gratitude-the

real,

NOVEMBER 7, 1957
warm, deep and abiding gratitude-of
democratically-minded, freedom-seeking allies
who are to be found in their millions everywhere?
I should like in conclusion, honourable
senators, to read just two sentences from
a book written by Louis Fischer entitled
Russia Revisited, which describes in a forceful and direct manner the conditions as they
exist in Russia at the present time:
Freedom must win. It is only a matter of time,
and the value of time depends on what we do with
it-and with ourselves.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

On motion of Hon. Mr. Beaubien, for Hon.
Mr. Robertson, the debate was adjourned.
CANADIAN VESSEL CONSTRUCTION
ASSISTANCE BILL
SECOND READING

The senate resumed from Tuesday, October
31, the adjourned debate on the motion of
Hon. Mr. Haig for the second reading of Bill
I, to amend the Canadian Vessel Construction
Act.
Honourable
Hon. John
J. Connolly:
senators, the Canadian Vessel Construction
Assistance Act is the type of legislation to
which I would think members of this chamber might well give special consideration.
The honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) is to be commended for
arranging that this measure be introduced
in the Senate, where it can get the careful
and detached type of consideration that this
chamber can give to bills of this character.
I may say by way of apology that my own
interest in the measure stems originally from
the fact that during the Second World War
I had an association with the Honourable
Angus Macdonald, when he was Minister of
National Defence for Naval Services. The
main concern of the Navy in those days was
the convoy system in the North Atlantic, a
system which was the lifeline for supplies
and food to the beleaguered sections of
Europe. I believe that the achievement of
the Canadian Navy in that period was one of
which even a great maritime power would
have been proud.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): There
was a close association during all that time
between the Navy with its fighting ships
and the Merchant Service with its freighters
and tankers. There was an association too,
and a mutual interest, in the work that was
done on behalf of both the Naval and Merchant services in the construction yards
where repairs and improvements were carried out, and as well in the very difficult

problems connected with the building of both
Naval service ships and Merchant Navy
ships. The wartime construction and repair
of ocean-going craft was a big industry in
Canada. The way it was handled and the
achievements it made were, I think, a tribute
to Canadian enterprise and management and
to the great skills developed by Canadian
workers in the yards.
Honourable senators perhaps may have
forgotten that in that period some 400 naval
vessels were built in Canada, and, as well,
some 400 merchant vessels, 10,000 tonnersocean-going craft. The industry employed
some 75,000 people; today there are still
15,000 working in and about Canadian shipThe operation of these wartime
yards.
merchant craft was the responsibility of a
special Crown company called Park Steamship Limited. At the war's end about one-half
of these 400 ships were sold abroad by War
Assets Disposal Corporation or its successor.
Some of these went to mutual aid, but many
of them were sold to be used on foreign register by foreign purchasers. About half of them,
or 200, were sold to Canadian operators in
Canada. I think I should mention that the
prices the Canadians paid for these ships were
the market prices which prevailed at that time.
In some cases there were favourable credit
terms: roughly 25 per cent down and 3.5
per cent interest per annum on the balance,
which was to be paid in seven years. It was
Government policy to employ this method of

trying to preserve a nucleus of a Canadian
merchant service.
At the present time some 26 ocean-going
craft are under the Canadian flag and on Canadian registry. There are some 70 craft on
United Kingdom registry, but owned by Canadians. I understand that of the 96 ships
which remain under Canadian ownership,
some 70 are still original wartime ships built
in Canada.
Honourable senators also are aware that
in the wartime operation of the merchant
service, economics were a rather secondary
consideration, because the important problem
at that time was survival. The problem was
to get the supplies to the places where they
were needed. But in the peacetime operation of a merchant service, economics are a
primary consideration, and of course the
operation and even the building and the
maintenance of these ships must meet the
world
the
in
encountered
competition
markets.
I think it is also understood that costs in
Canada for construction or conversion of
ships, or for their repair and operation, are
Shipyard
greater than they are abroad.
costs in Europe and Asia are much lower

SENATE
than in Canada. I understand, as a matter
of fact, that in Canada the cost for work in
a shipyard, for building or for repairing, is
approximately 1.5 times what it is in many
of the European yards, and perhaps the
United Kingdom yards are a good example.
I might also mention that the Japanese shipyards are in that class. When I speak about
European yards I mean yards in the United
Kingdom or in Holland, Germany, Norway,
Italy and France.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Do costs not vary to
some extent between shipyards in Germany,
Holland and Great Britain, let us say?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): Oh, yes,
there is a variation, but I use the United
Kingdom as a fairly good example. I think
that, as a matter of fact, the costs in Japanese yards are lower still.
As honourable senators know, the maintenance of a nucleus of a merchant service
for Canada is the main problem of the Canadian Maritime Commission, about which I
would like to say something in a moment.
There are two plans in the policy being
pursued by that commission.
I think we
should remind ourselves about both plans in
considering this measure.
The first plan is called the Replacement
plan. The purpose of that plan is to maintain
in the first place sorne semblance of an
efficient Canadian-owned merchant service.
The second purpose of the Replacement
plan is provide efficient ocean-going ships
for those which are growing obsolete.
The third purpose is to provide employment in Canadian yards and to preserve some
of the skills which were developed in this
country under wartime conditions and later.
In speaking about these skills, although I
step outside of the field of the discussion on
the merchant service when I do so, it is
worth while saying that there are some very
exceptional skills available in Canadian yards.
For example, in the yards of the Halifax
Shipyards Limited, in those of the Davie
Shipbuilding Company Limited in Levis, in
the Marine Industries yard at Sorel, in the
Canadian Vickers yard at Montreal, in the
Yarrows Limited and the Victoria Machinery
Depot Company's yards on the west coast,
some of the most efficient modern destroyerescort vessels have been built. These ships
for the most part have been built for the
Canadian Navy and, in their class, they are
second to none anywhere.
The other plan with which the Maritime
Commission is concerned is known as the
Transfer plan. It results from an understanding between the Governments of Canada and
the United Kingdom, or their officials, and it
permits the operation of Canadian-owned
ships under the United Kingdom flag, under

operating conditions more favourable than
those which prevail in Canada.
Perhaps I should say a little more about
these plans, because they are important to an
understanding of this measure.
The Replacement plan, I think, can be
described as the brain-child of the officials of
the Maritime Commission. It provides that no
sale of a Canadian-owned vessel off the
Canadian register can be made without the
approval of the Canadian authorities. That
consent is given only if the proceeds of the
sale are used for the replacement of that ship
in a Canadian yard. Funds are usually
deposited in an escrow account which is maintained for the purpose in one of the commercial banks. The result of this policy is that
more than 16 ocean-going ships have been
built or ordered or bought in Canada. Canadian shipyards have benefited from these escrow funds to the extent of about $62 million
since the end of the last war. Some $3 million
of escrow money has been spent abroad, in
foreign yards, under conditions which I am
afraid I do not know too much about. That
is something which might be inquired into
at the committec stage of the bill. There
are still some $12 million or $13 million
available in the escrow fund. Perhaps I
should say, because I know some honourable
gentlemen in the chamber are interested,
that, of the fund of $62 million, some $29
million was used for the replacement of lake
and coastal craft. But that branch of the
policy, I understand, has been discontinued.
Now, as to the Transfer plan. Apparently
the operators of Canadian vessels found, after
the war, that operation under the conditions
involved in operating under the Canadian flag
became too costly. So an agreement was
made with the United Kingdom authorities
to transfer to the U.K. register such Canadian
craft as it was desired to transfer, to be
operated under the U.K. flag. The important
consideration in this arrangement is that the
United Kingdom authorities agreed that the
profits which the shipping companies made
from the ships so transferred could be repatriated to Canada, in dollars, to be taxed
here. The ships are subject to recall to Canadian register at the instance of the Canadian
Government. Should a wartime emergency
arise, and if the ships are put in some type
of allied pool-as has happened beforethey are to count as a Canadian contribution to that pool.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Do I understand there are
transfers from the United Kingdom, or are
the transfers of our ships to the U.K. register?
Hon. Mr.
stand that
connection
in Canada

Connolly (Ottawa West): I underthe transfer plan works only in
with transfers from the register
to the U.K. register.

NOVEMBER 7, 1957
Honourable senators might ask how much
more expensive it is to operate a ship under
the Canadian register than under the U.K.
register. I am informed that the additional
cost is about 50 per cent per annum; or expressed in dollars, it amounts to about $100,000 per annum for each 10,000-tonner.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Is that because of labour
costs?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Labour
is one factor, perhaps the principal one.
May I say a word or two about the Commission. As honourable senators will remember, it was established in 1947. Its first
Chairman was J. V. Clyne, who was later
appointed to the Supreme Court of British
Columbia. He was a well-recognized expert
in the field of Maritime law.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Who appoints the
commissioners?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): The
Government. The next Chairman was Mr.
J. C. Lessard, who for a while was Deputy
Minister of Transport and later retired from
that post, and is now Vicc-President of the
St. Lawrence Seaway Authority. The third
and present Chairman is Mr. L. C. Audette,
Q.C., a member of the Montreal bar, who
has had a very distinguished naval career.
May I also mention Captain E. S. Brand, the
Executive Director of the Commission. It
was because of his work in the Canadian
Naval Service during the war that I developed
an interest in this field. Some years before
the war Captain Brand retired from the Royal
Navy and joined the Canadian Navy. He was
head of the Trade Division, so called, and in
that post it was his responsibility to see that
a proper liaison was worked out between the
merchant service and the naval ships engaged in the convoy system. To him I am
especially indebted for my introduction to
maritime matters when I was with the Navy
Minister. He certainly knew his business;
and he was one of the very fine staff
officers available to the Canadian Navy during
the last war.
In general, I think, it may be said that the
shipbuilding industry and the shipping industry acknowledge the value to Canada and
to the Canadian merchant service of the
Maritime Commission.
Now, as to the bill. As honourable senators know, it is a fairly technical measure.
It may almost be described as a method of
granting income tax relief; and anything connected with income tax is bound to be a little
too complicated for most of us, including
myself.
The great benefit to the Canadian merchant service under the Canadian Vessel
Construction Assistance Act is that, for new

ships built in Canadian yards, the depreciation rate is 33à per cent per year, straight
line. The other depreciation rate, the normal
depreciation rate under the Income Tax Act,
is 15 per cent on a diminishing balance. So
it is of great advantage to have the provisions
of the Canadian Vessel Construction Assistance Act available to encourage the replacement of old ships in Canadian yards.
As I understand this bill, the main difference between it and the measure introduced
at the last session of Parliament, and which
at that time had first reading, is that by
the new amendment-which I think is a good
one-it becomes possible for shipyards to
build a ship on speculation, to build for
inventory, to build for sale to a Canadian
owner. If that is done, and none of the
special depreciation is taken before the vessel is sold, the new Canadian owner gets full
advantage of the depreciation provided by
the Income Tax Act. I think that is a good
thing.
The second difference between the bill
introduced last session and this one arises out
of provisions of the Income Tax Act with
reference to the recapture of depreciation.
The Income Tax Act provides that when a
depreciable asset is sold, the excess of the
selling price over the depreciated value
becomes income which is taxable. In the
case of a ship the tax is usually applied at
the corporate rate because the ship is usually
owned by a corporation.
Let me give an example to illustrate that.
Let us say that the selling price of the ship
in question is $1 million and the ship has
been depreciated under the depreciation rules
in the Income Tax Act, to a value of $400,000
at the time of sale. Thus the excess over
the depreciated value at the time of sale
becomes $600,000. These are usually large
companies whose corporate rate is 49 per
cent; for practical purposes let us say 50
per cent. Fifty per cent of $600,000 would
be $300,000.
Under the present act this tax must be
paid in the year in which the sale is made.
If within a period of seven years after the
sale, the ship is replaced by a ship built in
a Canadian yard, the person who pays the
$300,000 tax is entitled to a refund. But
he must apply for it. There is delay. The
procedure is cumbersome; even though he
escapes the tax.
Let me give another practical example,
taking again the selling price of the ship at
$1 million. Let us suppose that the seller
does not desire to replace his ship. Incidentally, this happens perhaps more frequently than cases where the seller does
replace. The ship is sold abroad, let us say,

SENATE
and the $1 million goes into escrow. The
seller desires to assign his $1 million. Let
us say for the sake of argument that the
discount allowed is 20 per cent. The party
desiring to build a new ship wants to buy
the $1 million credit in the escrow fund. He
can get it for $800,000. Under the present
law he must find his $800,000 immediately to
pay off the owner of the escrow funds. Having done se, he gets the $1 million credit
for the replacement. The point is, however,
that he must find the $800,000 right away.
It may take two or three years before his
new ship can be delivered. During this time
he loses interest on the $800,000 he had paid
out. The amendment under discussion eases
that situation.
Honourable senators, going back to my
original illustration, the tax on the ship that
is sold for $1 million amounts to $300,000.
The eff ect of the amendment is that the
$300,000 tax can be segregated and paid by
the seller of the ship into the Consolidated
Revenue Fund as security for the tax due.
The $300,000 is under some control by the
Canadian Maritime Commission. The balance
of the $1 million, namely, $700,000 would go
into the escrow fund in a commercial bank
and also would be under the control of the
Canadian Maritime Commission. If the man
who has the $1 million credit now in two
funds does not desire to replace the ship
personally, he could assign his interest in
his $1 million and, again, say, for $800,000.
Let us say he assigns it to me and I am
going to replace that ship. I go to the Canadian Maritime Commission with a contract
from a Canadian yard to build me a ship for,
say, $1 million, which may be deliverable in
12, 24 or 36 months. I know of the credit of
$700,000 in the escrow fund. I know that the
$300,000 security for tax due on that $1 million sale is being held in the Consolidated
Revenue Fund. Under the amendment, the
Canadian Maritime Commission will say to
me, "You have a contract and you are
obligated to spend $1 million to build a ship
in Canada. On the strength of this contract,
which binds you, if you pay $100,000 to the
man who owns the $700,000 in the escrow
fund, we will release that $700,000." So the
fellow who sold the obsolete ship then has
his $800,000 and he goes home.
As the progress payments on the new ship
come due I will make my payments and do
my financing as I am required to do it. At the
same time the Canadian Maritime Commission will take the money in the Consolidated
Revenue Fund,-the $300,000 which is now
no longer payable as a tax. That is a benefit
by way of tax relief which comes out of this
act. The ship is replaced and there is no recapture, as I said earlier. So the Commission

will make progress payments out of the
$300,000 on my new ship as it is built, as I
make my payments on my remaining $700,000.
Finally the ship will get completely paid off.
I will not have the heavy onus of financing
$800,000 at the beginning of my contract. I
shall do my financing as my contract payments fall due.
Honourable senators, that is a very complicated explanation. But it is about the simplest type of explanation one could give. The
amendment is a relieving piece of legislation
in the interests of replacing Canadian-owned
obsolete ships by ships constructed in Canadian yards.
There are other improvements to the act.
Under the present act the 331 per cent of
straightline depreciation is available only to
ships now on the Canadian register. The
amendment proposes that this benefit will be
extended te ships which replace wartime
ships, even though these replacements may
themselves go on the U.K. register.
Hon. Mr. Reid: But the replacement ship
must be built in Canada?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ot±awa West): Yes.
Hon. Mr. Prail: To a person who wishes to
avail himself of the provisions of this act,
how long a period is allowed between the
time he sells a vessel and purchases another
to replace it?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Seven
years. Under the present act the freedom
from recapture, which I have discussed at
such length, is available to only two classes
of ships. I will not attempt to describe what
these classes are. By the amending bill,
these benefits are extended to every ship
and every individual ship.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why is there a tax of
$300,000? Is this not the case of the sale of
a capital asset?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): You are
discussing the $300,000 tax? The rule under
the Income Tax Act applicable in this case
is the rule I mentioned earlier on the recapture of depreciation. Perhaps I should go
over that example again, for obviously I did
not make myself clear. Let us say this wartime ship was originally purchased from War
Assets Disposal Corporation for, say, $750,000.
The Income Tax regulations allow 15 per
cent per annum depreciation on a reducing
balance. Let us say that at the time of sale
the ship has been depreciated down te
$400,000, and then the sale takes place. Say
the market is favourable and it is sold for
$1 million. The difference between the
$400,000 and the $1 million, under the present Income Tax Act-and this applies to all
depreciable assets-becomes income and is

NOVEMBER 7, 1957
taxable. In this case, because there is corporate ownership, the tax would be approximately 50 per cent. So the rule about the
sale of a capital asset does not apply completely in the case of the sale of a capital
asset which is a depreciable asset.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I interrupt for a
moment? I take it that the point the honourable senator made was that the principle
which was applicable to war assets applied
not only to ships but to everything else during the war. In other words, wartime depreciation was allowable annually on a foundry,
or a garage that was turned into a foundry,
as well as on ships. After the war, if there
were a transaction in connection with such
an in'dustry, then the measuring rod of
depreciation was adjusted. In other words,
the proprietor had credit for his depreciation
during wartime years, but after that if he
proposed to enter another field of enterprise
with his plant he had to pay back whatever
had been advanced to him by the Government. I understand the same principle applies
to ships.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): In
answer to the honourable senior senator
from Ottawa, I think I can say that generally
the policy was to allow special depreciation
during war time for assets that would be
depreciated during the wartime period, and
that the special rates which were allowed
at that time were altogether different from
the rates which would normally apply in
peacetime. There is a recognition of that
here, too, I think. The normal depreciation
rate on an ocean-going ship is 15 per cent
on a reducing balance. The special rate
allowed here, because of the special circumstances under which this industry operates,
is 33j per cent.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Would it be possible
for a man to advance $100,000 and, by arranging for the payment out of $700,000
from the escrow fund, build a ship which
in fact is worth $1 million?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I doubt
that, because in the example given, while he
has put up $100,000 and is going to get the
benefit of $300,000 tax credit, he must find
the other $700,000 to complete the payments
for his ship. What he does not have to do is
to pay out the $700,000 at the beginning of
the transaction. I think that is the only advantage that comes from it.
Honourable senators, the other change I
think noteworthy, and which perhaps should
be referred to, is that under the present act
the tax benefit is only available to an owner
if all the ships in a given class are replaced.
Under the amendment, and using the same

example, what is proposed is that he gets
these tax benefits as each individual ship
is replaced.
Those are the main changes made in the
Canadian Vessel Construction Assistance Act.
If I had a general conclusion to draw with
reference to this general problem, I would
say that in a country like ours, which is
dependent upon more and greater markets
abroad, we have to ensure that adequate
transportation facilities should be available
during peacetime. In the face of world competition-and that is what the shipping industry
is faced with-and in the face of foreign currency devaluation, as well as of our own high
living standards, particularly labour costs, the
economics of operating a Canadian merchant
service in this country are definitely all against
us. But I do not think that should necessarily
lead us to the conclusion that we should scrap
the whole merchant service. We are constructing, for instance, in the valley of the
St. Lawrence, a great seaway which has
been described as the eighth sea of the world.
Perhaps there will be maritime opportunities
for Canada in the future which we cannot
yet assess. It may be that the merchant
service will play a very important part in
that future.
But in wartime I think the situation is
altogether different. We are concerned, as
the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon.
Mr. Wall) said earlier, about new weapons,
the progress of Russian research, and the
question of the adequacy of our own defence,
not only in the Commonwealth, but in
NATO and in the west generally. I know
this is not the time to discuss ballistic missiles which apparently can be shot from one
continent to another, nor is it the time to
discuss the value of conventional arms, or
the usefulness of conventional armed forces.
We have to be very quiet and very reasoned
in our approach to that kind of problem.
Some time perhaps this chamber could discuss the Canadian Navy-perhaps all of the
Canadian armed services-in the light of
new developments. That is something that
we might usefully do. In the meantime, I
submit it is realistic to think that either in
a limited emergency, or even in a worldwide
emergency, the transportation of wartime
supplies and of civilian supplies will always
be necessary for a country like Canada. For
that, ships are needed.
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: May I ask the honourable senator a question to clear up one point?
I assume the Canadian Maritime Commission
has nothing to do with the building of naval
ships now?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wes±): No, it
never had.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
have listened with great interest to the able
presentation that the sponsor of the bill has
just made.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): I am
not the sponsor of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Then may I refer to
him simply as the honourable gentleman?
I am wondering if he has received any protests about this bill from persons who indulge
in trafficking in second-hand ships. Some
20 years ago I visited the shipyards of the
Clyde, where I saw the stern of the oncefamous Canadian icebreaker Mikula. Since
then I have realized that all those who traffic
in second-hand ships are highly patriotic
citizens who immolate themselves on the altar
of their country.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Like the honourable senator who has just spoken, I appreciate, as
we all do, the full background which the
honourable senator from Ottawa West has
given in explaining this bill. He has covered
the ground in a very comprehensive manner.
He answered many questions I had intended
asking him because of my interest in shipbuilding on the Atlantic coast.
I was wondering whether he could give
us some information on the second party to
the British Commonwealth Shipping Agreement. Could ho enlarge on how that agreement comes into the picture at the present
time? An explanation in that respect would
complete the very fine picture already given.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: -lonotirable senators, may
I also put a question to the honourable senator froin Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly)?
The depreciation on Canadian-built ships of
33, per cent in the first year is beneficial,
but does iy honourable friend know what the
depreciation is on ships which are purchased abroad and are brought into Canada?
The reason I raise that point is that,
although we all strongly favour the maintenance of the shipbuilding industry in Canada, because it is a very important and vital
industry, the movement of commodities and
the transportation of the products of Canada
are also very important. In fact, the development of the fisheries and the acquisition of
suitable boats, and also the economical movement of such goods, is more important than
any part that the shipbuilding industry can
have in this connection. With all due regard
to the protection of the shipbuilding industry,
there should undoubtedly be a liberal attitude
toward those people who are going to invest
their money in ships which, for one reason
or another, have to be purchased outside
Canada and brought in. There are many types
of ships. For instance, in relation te our

industries in Newfoundland, we have boats
built for special purposes, boats which are not
constructed in a shipbuilding yard as it is
envisaged here. Ample protection and encouragement should be extended to the industries
which need these ships.
I would take this opportunity of stating
that Newfoundland coastal transportation,
which is a fundamental feature of the inshore fishing industry, is facing up to a
critical position, with wooden freighters
being lost and no replacements being made
because of the high cost of construction.
Encouragement should be given to the procuring of these boats from whatever source
they can be economically obtained. It is
one thing to support an industry for the
building of ships, but it is quite another and
perhaps a more important thing to adequately support the industry which requires
the ships.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Honourable senators,
may I be allowed to put a question-on the
assumption, of course, that the honourable
senator from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) is going to reply to these observations?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa Wesi): I shall
endeavour to do so.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: What class of vessels do
the regulations discussed here apply to? Do
they apply to coastal vessels as well as
ocean-going vessels, or are there restrictions
as to tonnage, size and so forth?
Hon. Mr. Lamberi: Ilonourable senators,
may I put a further question? I presume it
is the intention of the sponsor of the bill to
have it referred to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If we ever get to that
stage.
Hon. Mr. Lambert. I certainly can congratulate the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) upon the excellent
uresentation from this side of the house of
the bill of which he is the sponsor, and I
extend to my honourable friend from Ottawa
West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) that compliment on
his lucid explanation of this bill. I followed
his remarks with a great deal of interest.
The point I should like to emphasize now,
and which I hope will be dealt with in committee, if not in the house, is this: Does the
economic demand for ships in the trade of
this country justify this legislation? And, in
that connection, does the bill cover the construction of ships for internal use on the
internal waterways of this country-viewing
that as a separate class of traffic-as distinct
and separate from trans-oceanic shipping?
I think those two points should be made
clear.

NOVEMBER 7, 1957
Hon. Norman McL. Paterson: Honourable
senators, as I am in the shipping business,
perhaps I can make a contribution to the
discussion on this bill.
I should like to point out the value of the
33J per cent depreciation. It is most
important to shipping in Canada to keep a
shipyard alive. If we did not have shipyards it would be impossible to dock a ship
when she strikes a rock; it would be impossible to dock her every four years for
inspection, which is absolutely necessary.
Some years ago-I think it was in the
time of Jim Conmee-the Port Arthur Shipyard was bonused so much a foot for keeping the water over the sills at the shipyard.
That arrangement went by the boards long
ago, because it became quite profitable to
build ships during the last war. However,
since the war it has been a hand-to-mouth
business to keep the shipyards alive. We
have found it is in the best interest to build
some ships.
About three years ago I built a ship at a
place called Newport, in Wales. Apropos of
what the senator from Ottawa West has said,
the ship built in Wales was a very well
built ship, but not built anywhere near the
specifications for delivery; further, the
builders were almost a year longer on the
construction than they said they would be.
The ship is 254 feet long, with 42 foot 6-inch
beam, and is the full size of the Lachine
Canal. In fact, she is built so close to the
size of the canal that to get her out when
the gates are open it is necessary to go full
steam ahead in order to push the water
around the sides. That ship was built at a
cost of $700,000.
The next ship I built was constructed in
Collingwood, at a cost of $900,000. It was a
ship of exactly the same size as the one built
in Wales, with a little different engine
equipment, but quite as satisfactory as the
one built to our own specifications for our
class of business.
I built a third ship at Collingwood, which
is now being tested out. Perhaps I should
apologize to this honourable house for having named her Senator of Canada. My son
asked me to suggest a name, and offhand I
said Senator. When he went to register the
ship he found there was a tug registered somewhere as Senator. Also an ore carrier for the
Columbia Steamship Company, in the United
States, which ship I think has since been
scrapped, was called Senator. We were told
that if we called our ship Senator of Canada
the registration would be accepted. So that
is her name, and she is on steam trials today.
She is quite a large ship, carrying 508,000
bushels of wheat and 16,000 tons of iron ore.
96702-11

This vessel was built in the light of the
requirements of the grain business and the
iron ore business.
These shipbuildings have kept the Collingwood shipyard pretty well alive; and it was
more satisfactory for us to build them in
Collingwood than to build them in my home
area, Port Arthur and Fort William. I will
not go into details of why that is so, because my remarks might be publicized. But
in any case I would like to say that this matter of depreciation has been of inestimable
value to afl shipyards in Canada. It has
kept them alive and kept men employed,
and the yards are so necessary to the lake
and river navigation that I welcome this bill
or any bill designed to help in the present
situation.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
may I ask the honourable senator from
Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr. Paterson) a question? I understand from the sponsor of the
bill (Hon. Mr. Haig) that in order to benefit
from this 'legislation a ship had to be built
in Canada. Now, you said this bill would be
of great assistance to the shipbuilding yards
here, and then you stated you had a ship
built in Wales. I would like to know how
this bill is going to help in your case.
Hon. Mr. Paterson: We do not get the
benefit of special depreciation on that ship
built in Wales. We take the ordinary 10 per
cent depreciation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then this bihl does not help
in that case at all?
Hon. Mr. Paterson: No, it does not help.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Honourable senators, I
have had some experience in shipping matters, and while listening to the questions my
mind has been directed to the question of
whether or not the economic situation in
Canada justifies this bill.
As far as I can see it, this bill does not
give anything except a remission of taxes,
and if a vessel does not make a profit I do
not see what good an allowance for depreciation is going to do. A vessel is expected to
operate at a profit, and if it does the owner
is entitled to write off depreciation and
thereby reduce his taxable income. But if,
owing to the economic situation, a vessel
incurs a loss in its operation, how will the
vessel owner benefit from this measure? I
would like to receive a few words of explanation on this point.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Oftawa West): Honourable senators, I must have unanimous
consent to speak again.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Honourable senators, I do feel this about questions
which have been asked,-they justify my belief expressed originally, that this is the kind
of measure which the Senate can discuss with
profit to the industry and to Canada's interests on the high seas. And again I would
say to the Leader of the Government in the
Senate that we are deeply indebted to him
for having had this bill brought here first for
consideration.
I am very pleased indeed that the honourable senator from Thunder Bay (Hon. Mr.
Paterson) spoke, because he took a great
deal of the load from my shoulders in his
very practical demonstration of what the
effect of this measure will be.
I think, if I may paraphrase him, the great
advantage is that it will encourage the shipbuilding industry in Canada. It is of importance not only to the companies which
might benefit from this legislation but to all
ships which come here. That is going to be
more important as we handle an increasing
volume of foreign trade.
The honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) spoke about people
who are trafficking in second-hand ships. I
should point out that this measure is not designed in any way to deal with passenger
craft. This measure is designed or at least
the policy of the Maritime Commission is
designed-to assist the operation and the
construction of Canadian-owned vessels. It
has nothing to do with passenger ships.
The honourable senator from HalifaxDartmouth (Hon. Mr. Isnor) asked a question
about the British Commonwealth Shipping
Agreement. The Leader of the Government
has indicated that this measure will be referred to a Standing Committee, and there is a
great deal to be said in favour of that, particularly as it will afford an opportunity to
deal with all the questions that were asked.
However, I will make this general statement
in reply to my honourable friend's question:
I understand that the British Commonwealth
Shipping Agreement has to do with arrangements for the operation of merchant vessels
registered in any country of the Commonwealth signatory to the agreement. It is part
of that arrangement which makes it possible
for ships of Canadian registry to be sent to
the United Kingdom to be operated there
under the United Kingdom flag and registry.
The honourable senator from St. John's
West (Hon. Mr. Pratt) asked about the rate
of depreciation allowed for ships that are
not built in Canadian yards under this plan.
The honourable senator from Thunder Bay
referred to a 10 per cent depreciation. I was

under the impression that it was a 15 per cent
depreciation on a reducing balance, but
perhaps there is some connection between 10
per cent straight-line and 15 per cent reducing balance.
Another honourable senator suggested that
this measure was for the protection of the
shipyards and the shipbuilding industry. I
would rather say it is for the encouragement
of the shipyards and the shipbuilding industry.
It is true that the use of escrow funds does
not extend to vessels engaged in the coasting
trade or in lake trade. Maybe it should.
Perhaps more extensive legislation should be
designed to give encouragement to that branch
of the industry, and if this debate has disclosed nothing more than an interest in the
problems, it may be justified.
Hon. Mr. Prait: Are we to understand
now that this legislation applies only to
foreign-going ships?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): Yes.
Hon. Mr. Prai±: And not to coasters or
lakers?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otiawa West): That is
right. I think perhaps that answers also the
question put by the honourable gentleman
from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr.
Burchill). He asked if this legislation applies
to ocean-going vessels only.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: It does not apply to
lake or coastal vessels?
Hon. Mr. Connolly (OI±awa West): No, it
does not apply to lakers or coasters.
Finally, the honourable senior senator from
Ottawa said he wondered whether there is
economic justification for a measure of this
kind.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: In trade, I said.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): In trade.
I suppose it would take a good deal of time
to discuss that point, and if I did it on the
floor of the chamber I would need to make
a different kind of preparation. But I hope
that the bill will go to committee, and perhaps
some of the officials of the commission may
be able to amplify that viewpoint.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, if I
speak I close the debate. I sincerely thank
the honourable senator from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) for his valuable contribution. He knows more about the subject matter of the bill than I do, and I know a lot
more about it than I did before he spoke. It
is my intention, if the bill receives second
reading, to propose that, as it deals with

NOVEMBER 7, 1957
financial matters, it be referred to the Committee on Banking and Commerce.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

me a written statement as to the salaries
paid. I have received it, and with the consent of the house, I will hand it to Hansard
to be included as part of my speech; otherwise I will read it. It gives, I believe, the
details required. We pay on an average $2 a
month more to the persons concerned than is
paid to similar employees in the House of
Commons. Apparently this was due to a mistake, but it is none the less the fact. There
are only two exceptions, and those two
House of Commons employees were paid some
time ago about $4 extra. But as I have said,
in every other case the payment is $2 less
than ours. I hope honourable senators wil
allow me to put the statement on record, so
that any honourable member who is interested in the facts may have them before him.

SALTED CODFISH EXPORTS TO
JAMAICA
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Mr. Pratt inquired of the Government, pursuant to notice:
1. If it has been brought to the attention of the
Minister of Trade and Commerce that the Government of the Island of Jamaica is refusing to
allow importations of. salted codfish from the
Atlantic provinces except at prices which the
officials of that Government dictate and that at
the present time and for some weeks past purchases
by Jamaican importers are forbidden because prices
offered do not meet with official approval.
2. If the Minister of Trade and Commerce is
aware of the fact that an official of the Government

SENATE
of Jamaica has served notice that unless shippers
from Newfoundland and the other provinces enter
into an immediate contract, which will guarantee
that there will be no advance over previous prices
for one year, that Canadian exporters will be prevented from selling any salted codfish to Jamaican
importers at any price for a year hence.

Hon. Mr. Haig: The following answer has
been received from the Department of Trade
and Commerce, under date of November 8:
1. On instructions from my Department, the Canadian Trade Commissioner in Jamaica had interviews
with both the Chief Minister and the Minister of
Trade and Industry in Jamaica, at which time a
full explanation of our desire to continue to trade
on a friendly and unrestricted basis was placed
before the Jamaican officials. The reasons why
increased prices were needed for salt codfish were
fully explained.
The Jamaican officials were
informed that the Canadian fishermen would suffer
if a satisfactory settlement was not reached and
that it was to be hoped that the threat to prohibit
imports from Canada would be removed.
2. In reply, the Jamaican Chief Minister denied
that imports of Canadian salt codfish are to be
prohibited. He further stated that the Government
of Jamaica planned to invite tenders from all
sources of supply for its requirements of 4,800
metric tons. The closing date for tenders is today,
November 8. Consequently, the Canadian salt fish
trade have tendered through our Trade Commissioner in Jamaica-and we are awaiting the result.

CANADIAN VESSEL CONSTRUCTION
ASSISTANCE BILL
On the Orders of the day:
Hon. John J. Connolly: Honourable senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with may I have permission to
make a correction in a statement I made on
Thursday last, when speaking on the Canadian Vessel Construction Assistance Bill? I
refer to page 160 of Hansard, second column.
I had been discussing the use of escrow funds
under the Replacement plan. Subsequently,
when I was asked by the honourable gentleman from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt)
and the honourable gentleman from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill) if the
legislation applied only to foreign-going ships
and if it did not apply to coasters and lakers,
I thought they were still talking about the
escrow funds and I gave a wrong answer.
I would like to make the correction by
saying, first of all, that the escrow funds
under the Replacement plan are not available
for the construction of lakers or of coasters,
but are available only for the construction of
foreign-going ships. In the second place, I
would point out that benefits of the Canadian
Vessel Construction Act apply not only to
foreign-going craft, but as well to lakers and
to coasters, when these ships are replaced in
Canadian yards; and all the benefits of that
act apply to all types of ships that are built
in Canadian yards. I think that makes the
point clear.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, November 7, consideration of Her Majesty the
Queen's Speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mr. White,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Méthot, for an
Address in reply thereto.
Hon. Wishar McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I would like to join with the other
speakers who have spoken with eloquence
and feeling of the visit of Her Majesty the
Queen to open the present Parliament. It was
most certainly a memorable day in the history
of Canada. I heard one honourable senator
say: "We hope she will come back often to
open the Parliament of Canada, but there
always had to be a first time". It was indeed
a memorable event, and I was honoured to
have been one of the participants.
I should like to join with the other honourable
senators
in
complimenting
the
mover (Hon. Mr. White) and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Méthot) of the motion for an
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne. They spoke with eloquence and good
humour.

NOVEMBER 11, 1957
May I say a few words of welcome to the
new senators? Like the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig), I wish
you well, and long life to participate in the
deliberations of this chamber.
Monsieur le Président, may I, as your predecessor in office, take this opportunity to
congratulate you on having attained your
high office, and to compliment you on the
grace and skill with which you attended the
trying duties which faced you on the very
day you were sworn into office. You are
blessed with grace, good humour and tact,
and you have our very best wishes.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I would be remiss if I did not at this time
say how personally pleased I was that the
Prime Minister of this country saw fit to
ask the present Leader of the Government
in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig) to become a
member of his cabinet and leader of this
house; I am pleased that the honourable
leader's health and good spirits made him
equal to the occasion.
I have had a very happy association with
the honourable leader. As the older senators
in this house will recall, I was for eight years
Government Leader in this chamber, during
most of which time the present Leader of the
Government was Leader of the Opposition.
Our relations were of the most friendly
nature; however, I am bound to say that in
the days when he had 29 or 30 Opposition
senators to support him, there was never a
time when Government legislation was not
given a serious going over by my honourable
friend and his colleagues. I would remind
the bouse that while his criticism of Government legislation was always fair, he lacked
nothing in vigour, and he made many sweeping attacks on Government legislation, asking
no quarter and giving none. If he overlooked
anything in the process of his criticism, the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake (Hon.
Mr. Horner) was always capable of supplying it.
May I say to the newer senators that the
honourable Leader of the Government is an
experienced parliamentarian: not only has
he great knowledge of all matters pertaining
to Canada, but he is at the same time a
shrewd leader. When I was Leader of the
Government in this house I used to watch
him from my vantage point and try to fathom
what particular ideas he had in his mind.
After eight years I felt quite capable of anticipating what he would say, and checkmating
him on certain points. But I must admit,
honourable senators, that the remarks which
he made a few days ago, during the debate
with respect to the Prairie Grain Advance

Payments Bill, have left me completely
puzzled and without any solution. The bill,
as far as I know, had almost unanimous support throughout the country and in both
branches of Parliament. In the other house
no opposition was given to it. In this house
the Deputy Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Aseltine) explained the measure in, I
thought, a very fair, reasonable and clear
manner, and I could think of no one here
who was disposed to oppose it in any way,
shape or f orm.
Then suddenly, without the slightest reason
that I could see for arriving at his conclusion,
the honourable Leader of the Government in
the Senate made a statement which fairly
took my breath away, and as yet I am hardly
able to regain it. It was so important, to me
at least-so amazing is a better term-that I
am not going to trust my memory, but will
quote from Hansard just what he said. I am
reading from page 114:
We want this bill passed in order to help the
farmers of this country. But I will be quite honest
with you. Nobody would welcome more than the
Prime Minister of Canada the Senate's defeat of
this bill. That is all he would want. Just do that
and he will do the rest. If the men and women on
the Opposition side of the house will just stand
up and vote solidly to kill this bill, that is all he
would ask them to do.

I must confess that the honourable Leader
of the Government in the Senate put an entirely different complexion and interpretation
on the ideas of the Prime Minister of Canada
than I did.
I have always had great respect for whoever occupies the position of Prime Minister
of Canada, and I have no less respect for the
right honourable gentleman who presently
occupies the position. I respect him for his
character and I respect him for his good
intentions. When this bill was brought into
the other house I thought it was with the
idea of its being passed in order that those
engaged in grain production would receive
the benefits of the legislation; so it came as a
surprise and shock to me that the whole idea
was that it might be opposed by the Senate
and that thereby a reason would be given for
doing something or other. My honourable
friend did not go on to elaborate or state
what that something was that might be done
if we had solidly opposed the legislation.
I think that the explanation-and it has
taken me a long time to arrive at it-is that
the honourable senator is not yet used to
the position he occupies as Leader of the
Government in the Senate, and does not yet
realize that he is in a different position, now
that he is a presenter of legislation and must
defend it. The sledge-hammer-like attacks
which he used to make on Government legislation are a thing of the past. He had 22 years

SENATE

of that. I think that his astuteness was such
that he thought he would change his ground
and was able to build up a straw man as a
figment of his imagination; and having
reached the conclusion be would like the
Senate to oppose the bill or something or
other, he would proceed to demolish the straw
man in the sane vigorous fashion as he had
done in days gone by as Leader of the
Opposition.
Before making a few observations with
regard to the Speech from the Throne, I
want to comment on a remark which, in
passing, the
honourable senator
from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies) made in what I
consider was one of the best of his many
excellent speeches in this chamber.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Each time I hear him
it gives me great pleasure. His observation
to which I would like to call attention, and
which honourable senators may remember,
was that "the Liberal Government may have
been too cautious with the taxpayers
money". He did not elaborate on that statement, but I think I know what he meant: if
I interpret him wrongly, I apologize. It was,
I believe, in accord with what I have heard
many other Liberals say, as well as our
political opponents, with whom I am not
now concerned-that the Liberal Government which was defeated on June 10 was
too cautious with the taxpayers' money. I
want to say that, far from criticizing the
late government on that account, I think it
is to their eternal credit. As a Liberal in
this house, I am proud that our Government
was over-cautious in regard to the taxpayers' money.
In the last sixty years the Liberal party
has been the dominant force in the political
life of this house, and if there is one reason
more than another why over that period it
has led Canada to great heights of economic
progress and success, it is that it has always
been careful of public finance. In the early
part of this century the surpluses of
Fielding and Robb were so regular as to
become traditional. During the Second
World War the administration of the finances
by the Liberal Government of the time was
a masterpiece. Half the total cost was borne
out of current revenue. As honourable
senators will recall, stringent controls kept
prices from getting out of hand. I remember
as though it were yesterday a cabinet meeting I attended in 1945, when we seemed to
face almost insoluble difficulties in bringing
the country from a wartime to a peacetime
economy and providing for the transfer of
over a million people to peacetime occupations, under conditions which we thought

would almost inevitably cause a violent
dislocation of the national economy.
At
that time an old and very wise man remarked
that our misgivings might be groundless, that
we had a sound governmental finance which
had given great confidence in the country's
administration, and that the dislocation
might not be as serious as was anticipated.
Nor was it. In the next twelve years, in a
post-war period of booms and great activity,
when almost all private individuals and
corporations, as well as many governments,
were adding to their bonded indebtedness,
the financial achievements of Liberal Governments were such that when, on June 10,
1957, a Liberal administration
suffered
defeat, the net national debt of this country
was $2 billion less than it was at the end of
the war; and this, in spite of many additional
expenditures. It was a magnificent record.
I affirm that it is to the lasting credit of the
ex-Minister of Finance, the Honourable Mr.
Harris, and the Government which supported
him that they maintained inviolate that
sound record of safe and sure governmental
finance. I personally am proud, as I think
all Liberals should be, of that achievement.
Of course I am quite willing to admit that,
if foresight had been equal to hindsight,
and the late Government had undertaken
to distribute on, say, old age and other
pensions, increased grants to the provinces,
and so on, a little of the surplus that was
set aside for a rainy day, the position of ourselves and my honourable friends opposite
might have been reversed. One can never
tell. But I do not think that such an outcome would have been desirable. After all,
the Liberal party had held office for 22 years,
and, difficult though it may have been for
some of us to recognize or to admit the fact,
that was a long enough period for a country
with a two-party system and an economic
organization such as ours. We went down
with a good record, with no attempts at the
last minute to buy support here, there, and
elsewhere. Had the Government been returned to office at the end of 22 years with
no more support than the party of our honourable friends received, it would simply
have been living under a suspended sentence.
The late Government, with an excellent
record, at a time of the greatest national
prosperity, has gone down to defeat; yet financially speaking, the only crime, if such
it can be called, of which it can be accused
is that it put something by for a rainy day.
The wisdom of that achievement may be
more evident in the future than at present.
To spend money is an easy matter. But I
repeat that it is in no way to its discredit
that the Government which I supported had
carefully husbanded the financial resources

NOVEMBER 11, 1957
of the country. Its successors came in, I
imagine, gloating over the fact that they have
a full treasury from which to spend, but to
my mind it is a greater accomplishment to
make and save money and to run the nation's
affairs on a sound basis than to adopt a
spending policy, and I believe that sooner or
later this elementary truth will dawn upon
the public as a whole.
I should like to say a word or two with
regard to the Speech from the Throne. In
the first paragraph I find this statement:
It will be the high purpose of my ministers not
only to preserve these qualities
Of parliamentary government.
but to take steps to make both houses of this
Parliament more effective in the discharge of their
responsibilities to the people of Canada.
Time is going by, and I assume that legislation is in preparation, and that my honourable friend the Leader of the Government in
the Senate (Honourable Mr. Haig) is being
consulted as to what effect the proposals may
or may not have on the Senate. When I was
Leader of the Government in the Senate, I
suggested-and I would have preferred to
see action taken along this line-that before
any government made any specific proposals
with reference to the Senate there should be
recommendations from this house itself. I
believe that that would be a more dignified
proceeding. Nevertheless it was not so to be,
and we shall have to trust to the good judgment and the effective influence of the honourable Leader of the Government in the
Senate. We all know from past experience
how warm a friend of the Senate he is.
I have two suggestions about the Senate
which the honourable Leader of the Government might pass on to the Government if
and when some far-reaching consideration
is being given to the future of this house.
First of all, I think means should be taken
to have this house supplied with more information in regard to Government legislation. In saying this I want to make it
perfectly clear that I am in no way criticizing
the present Leader of the Government or
the former Leader of the Government, who
is now the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
I do not refer to these
Mr. Macdonald).
gentlemen any more than to myself. I fully
realize the inadequacy of the information that
was supplied to the Senate during the eight
years that I was Leader of the Government
here.
Honourable senators, in the other branch
of Parliament there are now 21 or 22 ministers of the Crown and a number of parliamentary assistants-there is provision for 14.
These members are flanked by a whole army
of secretaries and other people who are in a
position to supply information on all phases
96702-12

of governmental activity. But the whole setup for presenting legislation in the Senate depends on one man. I am quite prepared to say
that I believe the Leader of the Government
in this house knows as much about legislation
as anyone, but it is simply impossible for
one person to be in a position to give us all
the information we need. The fact that
proceedings of the Committee of the Whole
in the Senate are unsatisfactory stems from
the lack of readily available information in
this chamber. A discussion in Committee of
the Whole cannot be successful when the
Leader of the Government has to say "I will
give the honourable senator an answer to
his question next week or the week after."
We need to have prompt answers. The leader
ought to ask the Prime Minister to choose
from the ranks of his supporters at least six
parliamentary assistants for the Senate. There
is more need for them here than there ever
was in the other house. These assistants
would be paid to keep abreast of Government business and to help look after the
handling of it in this chamber. They would
be in the confidence of the Government and
in a position to answer questions and supply
information with regard to the major departments of Government. Obviously they could
not keep fully abreast with activities in every
department, unless they doubled up, but our
major problems arise in connection with
seven or eight of the larger departments.
This house is certainly entitled to more information than it is getting. I might say
that when I was Leader of the Government
here I made a similar suggestion in this
house, but I made it rather hesitatingly
because it applied to ourselves. The lack of
information here is just as much the fault
of the ordinary rank and file members as
it is that of the party leaders. Each one of
us should have demanded it long ago.
My second suggestion is made with some
hesitation, but I am sure that I am right. As
I understand it, provision is being made to
give serious consideration to making both
houses of Parliament more effective in the
discharge of their responsibilities to the people
of Canada. I think it is therefore high time
that something be done in regard to the question of parliamentary divorces. I have the
utmost respect for the 15 or 20 members
of the Standing Committee on Divorce. Perhaps they are the most industrious members
of this house; they certainly give much of
their time and effort to their work. The
undesirability of our parliamentary divorce
system was brought home to me vividly the
other day when the Chairman of the Divorce
Committee (Hon. Mr. Roebuck), who is one
of our most industrious members, had to
admit frankly that he was unable to attend

SENATE
a committee hearing on a very important
piece of legislation because he was tied up
with divorce work. I think this is a preposterous situation. The volume of divorce
work has been increasing annually and nothing has been done to solve the problem. There
must be some other way to grant divorces
to people living in Quebec than by taking up
the time of the members and staff of the
Senate. Every day the corridors of our
basement are filled with witnesses and counsel. This situation cannot continue indefinitely, and I think now is the time to
seriously consider doing something to correct it. The honourable Leader of the Government should take it under consideration.
Honourable senators, I want to go on now
to discuss something else, a serious matter
that was not referred to at all in the Speech
from the Throne. I refer to inflation and
the ever rising cost of living. Practically
every country in the Western world is
wrestling with this problem, and every Canadian who gives serious thought to these
matters should be concerned about the situation in Canada. I wonder if the fact that
this problem was not referred to in the Speech
from the Throne means that the Government
is unaware that the problem exists. Is anything going to be done about it? The problem
becomes more serious all the time and with
each passing day it will become more difficult
to solve. This has been the experience in
the past.
Around the time that the Old Age Security
Bill passed through Parliament I read that
an old age pensioner claimed the increase of
$9 per month had come at the right time.
Apparently he had received notice that his
rent was to be raised by $5 per month starting on December 1. It is simply a crime to
give the impression that the social position
of this country is being greatly improved and
at the same time to utterly disregard the cost
of living standard which has been spiraling
upwards for seven consecutive months. Yet,
honourable senators, as I have said, the problem was not even considered important
enough to be referred to in the Throne
Speech. Governments in almost every country
in the world are taxing their wits over this
problem of inflation, and my honourable
friends should do something about the problem in Canada, because it affects our whole
economy. It is true that this is not apparent
everywhere yet. For instance, some people
can point to the rising cost of living and
demand that their salaries, wages or pensions
be increased. But there are literally hundreds
of thousands of Canadians who are unable to
appeal to anyone to increase their income to
correspond to the higher cost of living. These

people are being ground more and more between the uppermost and the nethermost millstone, and I want to suggest to my honourable
friends opposite that it may be a very dangerous factor in this country for the man or for
the government that ignores it. My honourable friends are not in a very happy position.
It is no excuse to say, "We did not know it
existed." They are not only taking the attitude that it is not worth bothering with, but
they are sitting aside, throwing fuel on the
flames. If within the next six months or so
the Government goes to the country, and
there continues to be a steady increase in the
cost of living in the meantime, and if my
honourable friends opposite do no more to
cope with it than they have done up to the
present moment, I can see an election issue
emerging right at this moment. I assure honourable senators that people who are constantly being placed in the difficult position I
referred to may be in a very ugly frame of
mind six months hence, unless my honourable
friends reverse their policy of doing nothing
in respect to this vital question.
Honourable senators, I have only one further observation to make, and I will draw my
remarks to a close. I must confess to a certain disappointment that the Speech from the
Throne gave no indication that the Government had a comprehensive program for meeting the position of Nova Scotia in Confederation. I think the people of Nova Scotia will be
bitterly disappointed if nothing more is
contemplated than a warmed-over program of
the power proposals made by the Liberal
Government nine months ago. I want to remind my honourable friends opposite that
there was a vigorous campaign prior to June
10 last in which sweeping promises were made
to improve the position of Nova Scotia in
Confederation. Those promises were accepted
at face value, but I warn my honourable
friends opposite that the electors of Nova
Scotia will as dramatically defeat their candidates for re-election as they recently dramatically elected them, if in due course,
between now and the next six months, they
realize that nothing more is forthcoming in
the way of governmental action than was
forthcoming from the Liberal Government
that went down to defeat.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Emerson, the debate
was adjourned.

of this house, third readings be given now,
in order to dispose of them?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My purpose in asking

of other bills tomorrow as well, and I want
to get them in the proper order; otherwise

Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Will the honourable
gentleman permit a question? It is necessary
for the Government to have an agreement
with a province before such a measure becomes law in that province. Does the honourable senator know if the Government has
already received agreements from some of
the provinces?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I can answer that question.
I think all the provinces, or at least a great
many of them, have indicated that they will
consent to the bill. I know that Manitoba
sent in word just the other day, and it is
expected that other provinces will do the
same. If necessary, I am sure the house will
postpone third reading of the bill until that
information is obtained.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask if it is the intention of the honourable leader to send this
bill to a committee?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, if it is desired. I
promised the Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) that this and two other bills
would be put over for third reading tomorrow, assuming they pass second reading
this evening. However, if anyone really
wants the bill to go to committee, it will be
sent, but I do not think it is necessary.
Would someone move the adjournment of
the debate, for the Leader of the Opposition?

SENATE

I rise to my feet
Hon. Mr. Emerson: -as
for the first time in this historic and honourable Senate chamber, I wish to convey
my heartfelt congratulations and very best
wishes to the Honourable the Speaker, to
the Honourable the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig), and to the
recently appointed senators, for their success and happiness in the discharge of their
new duties. I extend friendly greetings to

congratulations.
As one of the new senators, I am deeply
appreciative of the kindness and consideration shown to me by honourable senators
from both sides of this house. As I proceed
to speak to you at this time, with your kind
permission I will confine myself to my notes.
Honourable senators, to a citizen of New
Brunswick the past few weeks in this Parliament have been the most exciting and
encouraging since Confederation. This great
surge of hope and determination, which is
being felt not only in New Brunswick but
in the other Atlantic provinces as well, has
been directly caused by that portion of the
Speech from the Throne which announced
the establishment of a national development
policy in the following words:
. . . to enable all regions of Canada to share in the
benelits to be realized in developing the resources
of this great nation.

Practical and immediate action on the
National Development Policy was promised
in the following words in the speech:
As an immediate start upon a program of more
extensive development in the Atlantic provinces,
you will be asked to authorize, in joint action with
the provincial Governments, the creation of facilities for the production and transmission of cheaper
electric power in those provinces. You wili aiso
be asked to provide assistance in financing the
Beechwood project which has been under construction in New Brunswick.

As I listened to Her Majesty utter the
words I have just quoted I knew I was witnessing one of the great moments in
Canadian history, net only because for the
first time a reigning sovereign was opening
the Parliament of Canada, but also because
my own province of New Brunswick and the

other provinces in the Atlantic region-Nova
Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland-had been given new hope, new encouragement, a new charter as citizens of Canada.
Honourable senators, for generations we in
the Maritimes have worked in vain and
waited over many weary years for some message of encouragement such as we heard
from Her Majesty's own lips on Monday,
October 14, 1957. Those who have not lived
and hoped in those provinces by the sea cannot know what that message meant and what
it will mean in the days ahead.
Those are the thoughts which went through
my mind as I listened to the passages just
quoted.
Ways and means of securing cheaper electric power in New Brunswick have been the
basic problem faced by our provincial Government, by the business community and by
Our competitive
everyone in the province.
position with the rest of Canada has depended
upon our ability to attract industry. We had
difficulties of geography and of transportation
to face in any case, but of late years these
have been complicated still further by the
problem of cheap power for industrial
development.
As a result of our inability to overcome
these difficulties a large part of wartime and
post-war Canadian industrial development
passed us by. The new plants were established in centres where power was cheap,
although we, as Canadian taxpayers, paid
our fair share of such development, especially

his Government took office in New Brunswick, in 1952, he was determined that something should be done about the power

question.
development on the scale required would
need federal assistance-if not directly, certainly in securing a low rate of interest so
the cost of power could be reduced.
Constant efforts were made by Premier
Flemming from 1953 until the present time
in order to get some form of federal assistance in meeting the severe financial strain
upon a small province like New Brunswick.
However, these efforts met with no success
until lately. In 1955 the power situation in
New Brunswick made it necessary for the
province to undertake the work without aid
from Ottawa; and the large Beechwood
hydro-electric project was officially begun on
June 11, 1955. This project is now in the
final stage of completion, a testimony to the
courage and vision of the present Government of New Brunswick.
This gives a short sketch of the Beechwood
project. Without federal assistance it was

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
bound to be a heavy financial burden on New
Brunswick, although it was absolutely vital
that it be built. The words of Her Majesty
concerning Beechwood encouraged every
New Brunswicker, regardless of politics, and
I believe it is only fair to give credit where
credit is due-to the energetic and neverfaltering Premier of New Brunswick and to
the head of the national Government. Their
faith and their -courage have moved the
mountains of delay and neglect which have
stood in our way so long.
Our power problem in New Brunswick is
not merely a question of hydro and water
power. We have long decided upon what the
New Brunswick Government calls "an integrated power policy", using thermal power
as well as water power. Consequently we
have welcomed the announcement that subventions will be paid for coal used to generate electricity in Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, and we welcome the fact that
the federal authorities will meet the capital
cost of thermal power plants and transmission
lines in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
This new policy means that lower-cost power
will become an accomplished fact in Nova
Scotia and New Brunswick, which will place
us in a better position to develop industry
in the Maritimes and to compete with other
areas. Premier Flemming expressed the feeling of our citizens in these historic words,
delivered at the opening of Beechwood:
Your Government refuses to acknowldge that
New Brunswick must decline.
Your Government
refuses to accept a "wait-and-see" attitude. we
propose to take advantage, not only of our natural
resources, but of the new spirit animating our
people.

Only the other day, speaking in Montreal,
Premier Stanfield of Nova Scotia had this
to say:
Today there is a spirit of unity in the Atlantic
area that is unique in the history of that part of
Canada. We are beginning to find our strength by
uniting our forces.

Honourable senators, in closing may I say
that what the two Maritime premiers have
said is emphatically true. The whole Atlantic region is determined that changes in
national policy as outlined in the Speech
from the Throne are only the beginning of a
movement which will place us economically
in a better comparative situation with the
rest of Canada. The new federal administration has already created an unprecedented
community of interest with the people of
Atlantic Canada by its sympathy, its integrity with election commitments, and its
fair-minded approach to the problems of the
region.
It seems to me that the Senate is an appropriate place to discuss the welfare of
particular regions, because we are appointed

to represent regions and provinces; and the
British North America Act so specifies. Personally my heart will always be in New
Brunswick, my province, and in Saint John,
my city. I am proud to be a Canadian: never
prouder than when I have come to these
beautiful Houses of Parliament, have seen
the two great races of Canada working
happily together and have seen how many
things we share as Canadians. Yet, honourable senators, let us not forget the home
places-the responsibilities and duties we
owe to our fellow citizens in our provinces,
and in our towns and cities. Patriotism must
never overlook them because our vision gets
too far above the earth and too far away
from our friends and neighbours.
I specially bespeak careful thought and
consideration for improvements in Saint John
harbour. New fire-fighting equipment is
needed, and new facilities for transhipping
modern cargoes. Modern industrial products
require many kinds of new dock-side equipment. Some cargoes do not go through Maritime ports because the facilities for handling
them are missing. This needs to be corrected.
In Saint John we have one of the largest
drydocks in the British Empire, yet it has
not the business it could properly handle.
I also believe, with most New Brunswickers,
that a new and up-to-date survey of the
Chignecto Canal project should be carried out.
I understand that investigation is now being
made and I trust that it will produce the
necessary information.
Honourable senators, God has truly blessed
this Canada of ours. The challenge lies in
our ability to interpret these blessings as
custodians for the people in our cities, towns
and provinces. The sense of responsibility
begins with the individual. It has its fulfilment only when it is the will of the people.
May God bless our beloved dominion and
all those who minister unto it. God save the
Queen.
Honourable senators, thank you, merci
beaucoup.
(Translation):
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable
senators, I wish to express my appreciation
to our gracious Queen, who opened the
present Parliament with such dignity and
splendour. As I saw Her Majesty reading the
Speech from the Throne, I was reminded of
the day when, during an automobile ride, I
turned on the radio and heard the speech
which she gave to the members of the Commonwealth. During that speech, I was particularly struck by our Sovereign's explanation
of the family spirit which should prevail in
the Commonwealth just as it should in any
family. She said at that time that the absence of her husband, Prince Phillip, who for

174

SENATE

the first time was away from home for
Christmas, was sorely felt in the family, but
added that he was visiting the larger family
of the Commonwealth. She admitted in closing that it may happen that all the members
of a family may not see eye to eye, but in
the long run they manage to agree because
everyone wants harmony to prevail within
the family. The same applies to the Commonwealth. Each country may have its own
opinions, its own interpretation of events, but,
on the whole, all of us want the Commonwealth to grow and to prosper.
May I now be allowed to pay tribute to
our distinguished Speaker. Knowing his
ability, I am sure he will preside over the
discussions in this house wisely and calmly.
I would also like to congratulate the mover
and seconder of the Address. Not that I
entirely agree with their views, but although
we may differ on methods, I think we have
the same objective, which is the greatness
and prosperity of Canada.
I also congratulate our new colleagues,
whom I did not know but whom I have come
to know. If all the new senators are as
qualified as the honourable senator from
Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette), who is one
of our eminent jurists, I am sure that the
appointments recently made to the Senate
are good ones.
I would also like to pay tribute to the new
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig).
If he carries on the business of the Government in the same spirit which he displayed
while he was Leader of the Opposition, I am
convinced that he will get along beautifully.
And finally, I would congratulate my leader
on this side of the house (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). We are indeed happy to work for
him and with him.
In his speech yesterday, the senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) spoke of
inflation. For several years now we have
been considering the problem of inflation in
our credit unions (caisse populaires) and quite
recently, at our convention in Lévis, we gave
it a great deal of thought. Those who have
followed economie events throughout the
world during the last few years must have
noticed that the Russians are doing all they
can so that the Western peoples will be
crushed by inflation. Indeed, were inflation
to cause our ruin, the Russians would no
longer need to use their Sputniks or their
atomic bombs.
In a book on the Roman Empire I have
just read that, at the time of the birth of
Christ, when that empire was at the peak
of its glory, the people were clamouring for
"bread and games". At that time inflation
was rampant everywhere. Seeing that the
pursuit of pleasure had reached its climax,

the authorities decided to grant all familles
having at least one child a family allowance.
As you see, such a situation is nothing new.
And families, at the arrival of a second child,
would have been disorganized if they had
received only twice the amount of the first
family allowance; therefore the amount was
increased fivefold. But of what use is material security if moral security is absent from
the home?
The Speech from the Throne announced
that old age and disability pensions as well as
pensions to the blind are to be increased and
that the amount provided for agricultural
prices support is to be increased from 200
to 250 million dollars. I will certainly not
vote against these bills, provided our budget
is balanced; that is, provided our revenue
allows us to pay for these expenditures.
All these subsidies are granted in order to
ensure the material security of the beneficiaries; but of what use is such security if we
cannot at the same time ensure for each
family the moral security of the home?
Just look at the statistics for the last ten
years: juvenile delinquency, murder, burglary,
theft with violence, and rape have increased
to such an alarming extent that one wonders
whether, with such increasing delinquency
we shall, in ten more years, still be safe in
our own homes. What is the explanation of
such a rapid change? Among many others,
I find three main causes: the lack of supervision by the parents over their children,
the distribution throughout the country every
week of hundreds of thousands of copies of
indecent literature which teaches crime, kidnapping, theft and rape, and finally, the
gangster and detective stories offered by
movies, television and radio.
Too many parents are remiss in their
duties and neglect to bring up their children
during the years when a child should be
trained. When you plant a sapling, you tie
it to a stake to prevent the wind from carrying it away and to make sure that it does
not grow crooked. In the case of the child,
the parents must do that job. Some parents
find the task too difficult, too much of a
bother; they fail to educate their children
and are thereby guilty of serious neglect
toward them. I will go even further: parents
are often guilty of the crimes committed by
their children and should be judged more
severely than the youngsters themselves. In
such an atmosphere, what is disquieting is
that, not only do many young couples fail ta
bring up their children properly or to see ta
their moral education, but they also bring into
the home magazines where acts of murder,
violence, and lust which may be committed
all around are reported in detail, with picturcs. And this trash lies on the tables in

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
the home, for the children to read at will, so
that they come to believe, in the end, that
the whole world is like that.
In this indecent and morbid literature, of
which thousands of copies are distributed
each week in all our cities and throughout
the country, are offered,-as in Allo Police,
Flash and Hush-detailed and illustrated
reports of burglaries, murders, rapes, etc.
"We only relate what is said in police court"
is the claim. But are people brought to court
for acts of virtue? Is it not precisely because
they have violated the law in committing
what is wrong? And it is all these vices that
such newspapers expose to the public view.
Flash has just been condemned to pay a
$30,000 fine for libel; the trial has been going
on for two years; yet, each week, the same
trash continues to be distributed throughout
Canada. Here in Hull, the National News
Limited was fined $5,000.
Apart from the literature which teaches
openly how to kill and steal, there is also,
as I said a moment ago, television. There
is scarcely an evening where we are not
offered gangster and detective stories, and
love stories where love is mocked, not to
say betrayed: the eternal three-cornered love
story, when it is not five-cornered. What an
example for our young people! They are
given the impression that the true love our
fathers and mothers had for one another and
that we ourselves entertain for our wives
is a thing of the past.
It is heartbreaking to see the effect of
such movies on the minds of young people.
Would you like a case in point? Several
days ago, we were given over television a
cowboy film, complete with guns, murders
and kidnapping. The next day, when coming out of my office to return home, at about
5.30, I saw five or six urchins, 8, 10 and
11 years old, playing on the parking ground
behind the building and re-enacting the play
shown over television the day before. As
soon as I had passed the threshold, one of
them pointed his toy gun at me saying: "It's
a hold-up, sir" and the others closed in on
me. If those children have toy guns in their
hands, daggers at their belts as well as lassos,
they were given them by their parents.
A few months ago, not far from Lévis, some
One of

them, who had a 22 rifle, fired straight at the
forehead of one of his friends, aged 14, and
killed him. He did not think the gun was
loaded. How on earth can parents allow
their children to play with such toys? What
How can the next
terrible carelessness!
generation possibly be any better than the

last or the present one, with that kind of an
education and upbringing?

I could go on quoting by the dozen such
examples which show the harm that this
poisonous type of literature can do to young
minds. For a great many years now I have
been associated with the social work in my
area. In Lévis we have what is known as a
"Family Service". The number of parents
who come to us and say: "I can't do a thing
with my children!" is unbelievable. Upon investigation we discover what sort of papers
these young people read, week in and week
out. In fact these papers are quite often
brought home by the parents themselves, who
are therefore primarily responsible for this
delinquency.
A few short months ago some young men
of a little town not far distant from my home
had sought inspiration in photographs published by the notorious Allo Police. This
newspaper had published pictures of small
tools which can easily be made from a simple
steel blade and which can be used to pick
locks on cars or bouses, doing away with
the necessity of breaking before entering.
The gang leader, a lad of 16, upon being
questioned, told the Family Service: "I'm no
worse than anybody else, look . . ." He there-

upon opened a cupboard where we found
about a hundred back issues of Allo Police
and other salacious publications containing
instructions on how to rob. And the young
man added: "Since everybody is doing it,
why shouldn't I?"
In a parish of the county of Beauce the
local caisse populaire was held up at 7.30
in the evening by a young man who got
away with $3,000. A few hours later he was
picked up in the station at Lévis, reading out
of a pocket-book the details of a robbery of
which the one he had just committed was an
exact replica.
A few days ago the provincial Solicitor
General of Quebec, the Honourable Antoine
Rivard, addressing the French-speaking
weeklies congress, stated the following:
At the present time an altogether objectionable
type of publication is gaining a wide and alarming
popularity. What are we going to do about these
scandal-mongering, lewd, and pornographic sheets?
What are we going to do about certain weekly
publications which, of course, do not belong to
your association, but whose main objective is to
appeal to the morbid curiosity of the masses and
to the worst instincts of man? It would seem that
such repressive measures as are authorized by provincial legislation or the Criminal Code are at
present quite inadequate and that a case can
certainly be made for special legislative provision
in this regard.

A federal-provincial conference is to be
held at the end of November. Could not
advantage be taken of the opportunity to
prevent distribution of this literature which
saps the very roots of our national strength,
our family life?

SENATE
A special Senate committee-on the distribution and sale of salacious and indecent
literature-held an investigation in 1952-53.
Several witnesses were heard, one of the
principal ones being Mr. D. Fulton, then a
private member, but who has since become
Minister of Justice. Mr. Fulton took very
strong objection to the distribution of this
type of obscene and criminal literature. I do
not think be has changed his mind in this
regard, and as he stated recently in answer
to a question put to him by Mr. W. L. Houck,
a federal member of Parliament, he has been
giving the matter his whole attention. He
concluded his remarks by saying:
I can assure the hon. member that I am still
as interested and concerned over this matter as
ever, and as soon as it is possible to reach a
decision and make recommendations I will be happy
to do so.
I earnestly appeal to the Minister of Justice to find a solution as soon as possible,
because the situation is urgent.
As I said, one reason given to justify the
publication of a newspaper such as Allo
Police was that information on the vice practices, on what is said and done in the police
courts, is a public service, because people will
be shocked by such things. No, I rather share
the opinion of René Leyvraz of the Geneva
Courrier when, in connection with the Confidential, be wrote: "Far from being an undertaking of public service, Confidential is part
and parcel of the corruption it denounces and
from which it derives considerable profits".
It is a nefarious and demoralizing education because it proposes an easy-going life

to our youth, it would have us believe in the
necessity of indulging in sexual intercourse,
of living in abundance, of owning an automobile, a refrigerator, and, as stated by the
Honourable Mr. Pearson, our former Secretary of State for External Affairs, it claims
that we have invented everything, even kissproof lipstick. If we believe that lust, bread
and games are the ultimate purpose of life,
that the demagogue is the object of envy and
adulation, that a five-time and even ten-time
divorced dancer or actress from Hollywood
has reached the top in celebrity, that the
baseball player is a hero, while the professor
and the man of science are second to them,
then we may well wonder what we are heading for. Newspapers give more publicity to
the murder of a gangster than to the man of
science who, like Pasteur, discovers a serum
which will save millions of lives.
Let us launch a campaign of good public
morals. I appeal in particular to fathers and
mothers and I ask them to take in their own

hands their own defence and that of the
country. When we hear youths like the ones
who killed father Quirion admit at their trial

that they learned such gangsterism from reading morbid literature, when young nitwits
like the two who recently killed one of their
playmates in Nicolet say they wanted to stage
the cowboy and murder scenes they had seen
on television, we realize that it is high time
to do something about it.
It is absolutely necessary that the federal
and provincial Governments, the Minister of
Justice, the Postmaster General, the customs
officers and so on get together in order to
launch the battle for good and to organize
the moral security of each of our homes.
It should be possible, as the law provides
in the United States, to obtain an injunction
against the publishers of such filthy literature, and for that injunction to bu applicable
immediately and remain in force until the
court renders its decision, in order to prevent
the sale of this literature during all the time
of the trial, which may at times take years,
and thus prevent the continuation of this
evil. If the publishers are found guilty, let
such publications be destroyed for ever. It is
useless to proceed against three or ten dealers of these pulp magazines in a city like
Montreal or Toronto. The ones to bu stopped
are the publishers of such filth.
We try by all means at our disposal to
eliminate the dangers coming from outside.
What good will that be if greater dangers
from within threaten to crush the family
which is the very foundation of our nation?
For some time now, the entry into this
country of this filthy magazine called
Confßdential has been prohibited, but no later
than last week I found a copy of it on sale
among other magazines in a newsstand in
Montreal.
If Americans wish to continue to read such
trash, they are free to do so, but while such
obscenities are being read and the youth is
being corrupted, the Russians will construct
other satellites and develop other weapons
which, tomorrow perhaps, will destroy us.
While we are enjoying ourselves and playing
gangster here, they are educating themselves
and working hard over there. Quite recently,
I asked some people who have lived in
Russia, and more particularly young people
who attended the youth convention which
has just been held in that country, if they
had seen obscene publications or magazines
of gangsterism; they all answered that such
literature does not exist in Russia. In the
early stage of the Russian revolution, such
orgies were the order of the day; they had
free love, legal abortion, and so on but the
Russians soon realized that by following that
course they would arrive at the same end as
ancient Rome, their complete downfall.

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
May I be allowed to quote, in conclusion,
some remarks made by the correspondent
of l'Action Catholique, Mr. Lorenzo Paré, on
the occasion of an inquiry made by Mr. W.
L. Houck and of the answer given by Mr.
D. Fulton about this depraving literature:
It is impossible not to establish a relation between
the dangers which threaten us from outside and
situations which are a source of weakness inside.
Obsence literature is, in fact, an evil which prevails in the western world when freedom, liberated from all rules, degenerates into licence.
After a recent investigation on the moral and
intellectual attitudes of American youth, a distinguished educator in the United States said that
the state of mind and the behaviour of the younger
generation represent for our civilization a greater
danger than communist Russia.
Not only does this outburst of obscenity undermine the very root of our western society's forces
but that same corruption is being exported in bulk
to all the continents of the world.
while the
communists use every means to spread the woeful
fallacy of their doctrine, the western nations
display to the eyes of the masses in the whole
world the spectacle of a moral turpitude disseminated by literature, newspapers, and films.
If the present struggle is mainly waged for the
possession of the minds of men, should not the
western world offer to humanity something other
than a moral weakness which bas always been,
for all civilizations, the most unmistakable sign of
their decline?

I ask all fathers and mothers to do their
utmost to check the wave of immorality
spread by obscene literature, in order to protect not only their own homes but our whole
nation.

PRIVATE BILL
ALASKA-YUKON PIPELINES LTD.SECOND READING

Hon. Paul H. Bouffard. for Hon. Stanley S.
McKeen, moved the second reading of Bill
X-1, respecting Alaska-Yukon Pipelines Ltd.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill is
a very simple one. The company's act of
incorporation was passed in 1957 and is referred to as Chapter 50 of the 1957 Statutes.
Clause 1 of the new bill proposes to delete
the two words "and oil" from the proviso to
section 6 of the act. The bill is as simple as
that. I think it is so simple that it calls for
some explanation.

In 1957, when the incorporating bill was
passed, Alaska-Yukon Pipelines Ltd. was
authorized to build a pipe line from the
Yukon up to the seaboard of Alaska. The purpose of the pipe line was to transport oil,
whether refined or not, from the Alaska seaboard down to the Yukon. Section 6 of that
bill authorized the company to construct a
pipe line to transport gas and oil and other
liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons. There was
no limitation as to where the pipe line was
to be located, except in two cases. The company was authorized to build a pipe line in
the Yukon Territory, in the Northwest Territories, in the provinces of Alberta and
British Columbia, and outside Canada. When
it was a question of transporting oil or gas
the company could build anywhere in the
world except that the main pipe line had to
be wholly situated in Canada.
On that authorization the company made
out its plans to build the pipe line, and as
the main line had to be completely situated
in Canada it decided to build it in the Yukon
up to the Alaska border. But from the Alaska
border to seaboard a subsidiary company was
incorporated in the United States, or in
Alaska, which was supposed to build the
main pipe line from the Alaska-Yukon border
to the seaboard. That was decided and it
was, I suppose, approved by the legal minds
associated with the company.
When all that was done, application was
made to the Board of Transport Commissioners for authorization to build the pipe
line. The board was told the whole story.
The main pipe line was to be built by AlaskaYukon Pipelines Ltd. to the Yukon border,
and from the border of Alaska to the seaboard by the American company, which
was a wholly-owned subsidiary of AlaskaYukon Pipelines Ltd. The board, on a very
restrictive interpretation of the act, decided
that, whether the main pipe line was that
built in Canada or the pipe line built in
Alaska by the United States company which
was the wholly-owned subsidiary of AlaskaYukon Pipelines Ltd., it was the same pipe
line, and that consequently the company was
not authorized under the act to build the
main pipe line, whether under its own name
or in the name of an American subsidiary.
In other words, it was the main pipe line,
and consequently the company was barred
and prohibited from building the pipe line,
whether by itself in Canada or through the
subsidiary company in the United States.
Authorization to build, therefore, was dismissed.
So the company is in the position of having
been incorporated and of being, maybe, in a
position to render services and to transport
oil and gas-especially oil-from the seaboard

SENATE
of Alaska to the Yukon Territory, but of
being prohibited by this decision from doing
it. That is why it is asking that the act of
1957 be amended to give it authorization to
build an oil pipe line, whether in the United
States or in Canada, if the Board of Transport
comes to the conclusion that thereby service
can be rendered to the people of the Yukon.
The oil which is to be pumped through to
this area comes from the seaboard to the
Yukon Territory; it is not oil sent from
Canada to Alaska.
That, I think, explains the purpose of the
bill. The amendments removes any restrictions on the occasion of the pipe lines for
the transmission and transportation of oil.
I am not presenting the bill on my own
behalf, but for the honourable senator from
Vancouver (Hon. Mr. McKeen); and I do not
know anything more about the facts. What
I have stated is the point of law which was
explained to me by representatives of the
company.
If the bill receives second reading I shall
move that it be referred to the Standing
Committee on Transport and Communications, where representatives of the company
will be available to answer any questions.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Bouffard, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee
on Transport and Communications.

enlarged in the bill before us, the cost was
$90 million. In the present year and in
1958, following successive increases of $6 per
month and, if these measures are passed,
of $9, the total disbursements will run
somewhere between $500 million and $600
million per annum.
One feature of Bill 20 which takes it a little
beyond any provision in previous legislation relates to the residence clause. In 1926,
the year of the first Old Age Assistance Act,
the statement was made on behalf of the
Government, and was readily accepted by
ail Canadians, that those who had given the
best years of their lives to the upbuilding
of this country were entitled to participate
in our national wealth. Nobody took exception that that. But what are we now doing?
For quite a long time the qualifying period
of residence bas been 20 years; now it is
proposed to reduce it to 10 years. But I
wonder how many honourable senators have
looked closely at the bill. If they have, they
will find that a person having reached the
age of 70 need have been only seven years
continuously in Canada to enjoy old age
security. The relative clauses in both Bills
19 and 20 are the same.
Section 3, subparagraph (1) (i) of the Old
Age Security Act, as amended by Bill 19,
reads:
has been present in Canada prior to those ten
years for an aggregate period at least equal to
twice the aggregate periods of absences from
Canada during those ten years.

find there is quite a trend among individual
members to try to outbid each other in an
attempt to get votes. When they suggest that
the residence requirement be reduced to one
year or five years they are not doing this
entirely in the interests of the aged Canadian
citizens. I would commend honourable members to read some of these speeches to see
the direction, and the extent, in which we
may be heading in regard to social security
measures.
My biggest objection to Bill 20, as to Bill 19,
is that we are ready to provide pension assistance to other than strictly Canadian citizens.
I do not know of any other country on earth
which hands out assistance in this way. In
every country the recipients of this type of
assistance must be citizens of that country.
What is wrong with requiring that a man or
woman become a citizen of this country before he or she is entitled to draw a pension
from our heritage? If any honourable senator thinks differently I would like to hear his
arguments when I am through. I take some
exception to this sort of thing. When this
legislation first came out I was in court one
day when a man was applying for his citizenship papers after having lived in this country
for 40 years. The judge suggested openly
that the man would never have bothered applying except that he wanted to qualify
for an old age pension. The judge told the
applicant, "If I had my way I would not
grant you Canadian citizenship after you have
waited 40 years before applying for it."
Honourable senators, surely the first requirement under this legislation should be
that a person be a citizen of this land. I
wonder what Canadian-born old age pensioners think about this? They have given
the best years of their lives to this country,
but here we are ready to grant the same
financial assistance to people who come here
in their old age, people who have contributed
scarcely a thing to the development of this
country. They only have to live here seven
years to qualify. They don't even have to be
British subjects.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Could these newcomers
of 60 years of age not get jobs here?
Hon. Mr. Reid: No, I don't think so. Owing
to superannuation schemes in plants and
businesses throughout Canada, it is now difficult for a man of 50 to get a job here. What
is likely to happen? People will be bringing
their aged fathers and mothers out to this
country, and after seven years here they will
be entitled to receive the same old age assist-

ance as our own aged pioneers who were born
in this country or who came here at a very
early age and gave the best years of their
lives in helping to bring about the prosperity
we have in Canada. In my opinion this sort
of thing is all wrong. I do not waxit anybody outside misconstruing this speech as
showing I am against the measures, for I am
not, and I take second place to no one in my
interests and efforts on behalf of the aged
needy in Canada. I say this quite emphatically to those both inside and outside of
Parliament.
There is one weakness in Bill 20 which
will become more apparent as time goes on,
and that is the fact that many of the provinces may find themselves unable to meet
their share of the increased amounts. One
province already has not been able to meet
the $6 increase which was granted by the
previous Government.
One has only to look over the data presented in the other house to realize what a
load this legislation is going to place on some
of the provinces. It is as follows:

I notice in looking through the House of
Commons Hansard that no commitment has
yet been made by a number of the provinces
as to their intentions. I know, however, that
when a certain committee sat in 1951 dealing with this matter and it was suggested
that the residence requirement be reduced
from 20 to 15 years, the committee did not
decide in favour of the suggestion because
it was felt that the provinces would or could
not accept it.
The question arises again as to whether
the provinces can now accept the fifty-fifty
payment of financial assistance to the aged
between 65 and 70 years of age and yet at
the same time not agree to the residence
requirement provision.

Does the honourable senator not think that
the word "prior" means that if a person had
been absent during ten years he would have
to have passed additional time in this country
equal to the amount of his absence from this
country? In other words, he woùld have had
to be a resident for a minimum of 10 years.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Your question has to do
with one of the reasons why I asked that
this bill be referred to committee. Bill 19, to

amend the Old Age Security Act, was passed
through this house rather hurriedly without
questions being asked and I was wondering
if this Bill 20 would be rushed through in
the same way. I would like to see some of

Canadians they will not allow it. If we have
to give $55 a month to a man or woman over
70 who has an income of $5,000 a year, then
that is what we shall have to do. There has
been no objection raised in the other house,
so far as I know, and, anyway, that is the
law. I do not think this bill should be objected
to at all. I apologize to my honourable friend
if I rushed the previous bill through too
quickly; my purpose was not political, but I
felt that as we are getting on toward Christmas it would be wise for needy people to
receive this extra assistance, as many of them
are having quite a hard struggle on $40 a
month.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Bill 20, to amend the Old

I know something about the operation of this
legislation. I think in every city and town
in Canada there are people so feeble or sick
that they cannot do work of any kind. I have
visited such people. I do not want any publicity about this, but I may say that my
daughter got the idea of going out and visit-

or 66-year class could not get the $40 a

I do not think we as senators have the right
to say that there shall be a difference between
this, that, and the other class. The other
house did not do that, the representatives of
the people and their problems did not do that.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I wonder if my honour-

able friend will permit a question? Is he
suggesting to this house that at the present
time the old people are getting only $40 a
month? Is that what my honourable friend
is suggesting?

Hon. Mr. Haig: They have been getting $46
lately.
Hon. Mr. Golding: But you have been talking about $40.

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
Hon. Mr. Haig: They have been getting $46
for some time now. I was talking of when it
stood at $40, a year ago. It is not a question
of whether it is $46 or $40 or any other
amount. I do not know why the late Government did not raise the amount to $50 instead
of $40, but it didn't.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I suggest that we do not
send the bill to committee, or it would appear
that the senators were kicking about needy
old people getting $55, but agreeable to giving
well-off people $55 with no test at all. I do not
believe in that kind of thing, and do not want
to be associated with it, so even if I vote all
alone I am going to vote against the bill going
to committee, because I protest against
putting some people in a different class from
others.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
I rise to a point of order. It is simply beyond
the rules of this house to refer to what happened in the House of Commons in regard to
legislation; it has no bearing whatsoever here.

risen to his feet and may continue to speak.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you.
The Hon. the Speaker: Senator Reid?
Hon. Mr. Haig: In conclusion, I want to
say that I would like to see the bill passed
as it is, for I do not want to vote against a
bill which is different from the one we passed
the other day. It may be said that there
should be a difference, but I think the principles are exactly the same, that the conditions are just the same, and also that the
regulations are the same.

at last. If the Leader of the Government
tries to do again what he has done just now
I doubt if I will be as courteous. I had the

speech.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My friend has not the

Hon. Mr. Reid: I had the floor, and I was

Hon. Mr. Haig: No, you sat down.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I sat down to allow you to

The Hon. the Speaker: The Honourable
Senator Reid sat down because someone was
putting a question.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I was obeying the rules of
this house, but the honourable leader did not.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You sat down and finished,
and I waited for everybody else to finish.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I was not sitting down.
Honourable senators, the honourable Leader
of the Government made quite a speech about
the means test. May I tell him that I am
not in favour of a system of the kind known
as the means test, because I have seen too
many injustices result from it. I want to see
in this country a system whereby people who
reach 65 years of age will be able to draw
ample to live on, by right-along the lines
of the systems in operation in Great Britain
and the United States, where the people contribute as they go along-and by means of
which we could pay up to perhaps $200 or
more a month to married couples. Talk
about the means test! In Canada there are
today four provinces which give a supplementary allowance on a means test; one of
them is the province of Ontario, and they
tell me it is a pretty mean means test. There
are so few people getting the supplementary
allowance. I know that in British Columbia,
whereof I can speak, the Government there
boasts of giving those in need a supplementary allowance of $20, but when I looked into
the figures I found out that some were receiving as low as $2 a month, and not $20, and
that very, very few were receiving the total
supplementary allowance of $20. When the
means test was introduced, in 1926 and 1930,
I met people who said they would rather die
of starvation than submit to the questionnaire

SENATE
by the officials who went around to homes
before applicants could obtain assistance
from the Government. The applicants would
be asked if there was any money in the bank,
if they owned their furniture, if they owned
the house they lived in, and owned this thing
and the next thing. The series of questions
was so exhaustive that many people absolutely refused to avail themselves of the
allowance.
I want to make myself clear regarding a
means test-and the Leader of the Government need not hold up his hands in any
kind of holiness, and think that he is the
only one interested in the very poor people.
Statements have been made that under the
present system the cost of old age pensions
is paid for by everyone. Let me say, according to the figures I have-and I have
studied them-the millionaire only pays a
share of the pension under the 2 per cent
system. I checked up with the Income Tax
Department, and I find that a man on as
high a salary as $400,000 a year, who receives
old age security, still has a few dollars over
and above what he contributes towards the
tax. As we all know, the income tax collected for old age pension purposes is 2
per cent, but not more than $60. So, even
if in this case the recipient added a pension
of $660 to an income of $400,000 and paid
his tax of 2 per cent and the added income
tax on the $660 he would still be a few
dollars ahead.
I am sure, honourable senators, it was
never intended that we should have a system
under which we would hand out gratuities
regularly to the rich as well as the needy.
The old age pension scheme was at the beginning devised to help the early pioneers
who built up this country, and who needed
help. For myself, I am looking forward to
a system somewhat similar to that in use in
the United States and Great Britain, under
which all make personal contributions; a
system under which a married couple would
be able to get as much as $200 per month or
more. The present system bas brought about
one political party bidding against another.
Indeed, certain members of Parliament are
vying with each other in greater promises of
higher rates. It is now $55 a month; some
say it should be $70; the Social Credit
members say it should be $100.
I look forward with interest to the next
budget to be brought down, to see the total
of the increased expenditures we have undertaken on the understanding that our defence
program should not and must not be cut
down. At the same time one recalls the
statements made during the last election

campaign that personal income taxes would
be reduced. I do look forward to seeing the
next budget brought down, which I expect
will be before too long.
In conclusion, may I say a few words with
a view to the future. The present Government has said that its old age security
pensions will be increased as the cost of
living goes up. Well, it appears to me that
it will not go down-that is for sure! There
are some of us who would like to see the
cost of living go down instead of up. In
any event, the present Government has
assured us that these welfare pensions will
go up according to the cost of living, but it
has not yet outlined a precise system for
doing so.
May I call to the attention of the country,
and to honourable senators, that as time
goes on more and more men and women will
live longer and be vigorous well over the
age of 70 years than was the case in years
gone by. Modern medicines, better hospitalization, better food, better homes and adequate
sanitation systems have contributed to longer
life today. So much is this so that I hope
in my time I shall see the scheme for retiring
people at the age of 65 years completely
wiped out.
Some Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: We are today losing from
our labour force thousands of mechanics,
scientists, teachers and other skilled persons
because a superannuation system bas been
built up, which was largely forced on us by
labour, requiring that a man must retire at
the age of 65. I do not believe that any
honourable senator who is a member of the
medical profession would dispute my proposition that if people are allowed to continue
performing their regular work and skills until
they can no longer do so or wish to retire,
they would live much happier and more useful
lives than those who are forced to become
idle at the age of 65 years.
There is also another side to this picture:
We are encouraging the youth of our country
to stay at school until they are 20 years or
older, and at the same time we are shoving
everyone off our production list at the age
of 65. Thus we are drastically reducing our
producing class. So, I say to honourable
senators, in the light of the cloud that is
going around us, and speaking on behalf
of the people of Canada, it is high time some
steps were taken to regulate the situation
along the lines I have spoken.

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
Honourable senators, I make no apologies
for bringing these matters to your attention
at this time.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators,
may I be allowed an opportunity to explain
my views with respect to Bills 19, 20, 21 and
23? I believe that Bill 20 parallels Bill 19,
which provides that a pension be given to
all Canadians reaching the age of 70 years,
and to all other people of that age who are
able to meet the residence qualification.
Under Bill 19, which has now become law,
any citizen of Canada or any resident of
Canada for a period of ten years is entitled
as a matter of right to receive the pension
in the terms prescribed by the bill. As I say,
the qualification to receive that pension is
that of having attained the age of 70 years,
and meeting the residence requirements. The
principle of Bill 19 was not new; it was
embodied in the law before the present
administration came into power. Therefore,
this bill does not in any way attack or modify
the principle embodied in the law as it
previously existed. The only effect of the
bill was to increase the amount of the monthly
pension from $46 to $55 as a matter of right,
to all persons who have attained the age of
70 years, whether they need the pension
or not.
I am sympathetic with the views expressed
by the honourable senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid), to the effect that
perhaps there is a serious difference between
what the country owes to the needy and what
it owes to those who are not in need. But,
taking the law as it previously existed, this
type of legislation offered to all qualified
persons security against need, both present
and future. That has been our law for some
years. Then parallel action was taken to
provide pension benefits for needy, sick and
blind persons, in accordance with the terms
of the benefits given to those who were not
needy.
Now Bill 20, which has the same principle
as Bill 19, simply means that the present
Government is authorizing payment, not directly to needy persons but to the provinces
in which they live of a monthly sum in
accordance with the terms of this legislation.
Specifically, we are authorizing payment to
the province of half what it pays to needy
persons, provided it is to the maximum of
$55 a month per person. In other words,
the pension payable to the needy must tally
with the pension payable to those who are
not in need.
I do not wish to rely too much on the fact
that Bill 19 has already been passed. While
it is true the honourable Leader of the

Government indicated he wished the bill to
pass as soon as possible, all honourable senators appeared to approve of it. As I say,
the principle of that bill is the same as that
in the law as it existed previously. If there
is any merit, and I think there is, in the old
age security pension scheme, then I submit
to the honourable senator for New Westminster that there is much more merit in a
measure which provides a monthly increase
in pension of from $46 to $55 to the needy
and the sick.
If there is a serious desire on the part
of some members to do away with the
principle of paying a pension to all citizens
as a matter of right, which was introduced
by the party represented by honourable members on the other side of the house, as a
result of deliberations and recommendations
that came from an all-party committee at
the time, why not come out and say that
senior citizens should not receive any pension
unless they are sick, and make that the subject of legislation?
But, honourable senators, the only aim of
Bill 20 in letter and in spirit is to increase
the amount of pension payable to the needy
in proportion to the increase in pension that
was passed by this house a few days ago for
the benefit of the non-needy. I think that,
to be consistent with what we decided a few
days ago, and to be in accord with legislation
which this house has approved, we should
make these Bills 20, 21 and 23, which are
based on the same principle, agree in respect
of the amount of pension as well as of the
principle that is now part of the law.
I therefore would favour passing these
bills, which are subsequent and accessory to
the main bill, No. 19, which was passed the
other day.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I think it only fair to say at this stage that
the principle embodied in Bills 19, 20, 21 and
23-that is the Old Age Security Bill, the
Old Age Assistance Bill, the Blind Persons
Bill and the Disabled Persons Bill-has been
endorsed on this side of the house for 25
years. As a matter of fact we gave birth to
those principles and so none of us is challenging them. There has been a little discussion as to the amount, but the suggestion
in speeches from the Government side of the
house that someone on this side is opposed to
one or other of these bills is unfounded. We
endorse all the bills. Merely to discuss them
and to argue about them is a normal procedure in this house. The Senate is not a
rubber stamp.

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: May I say a word
or two on this bill? I do not propose to
discuss the details. Why should I? The
objective of the bill is thoroughly accepted
on both sides of the house, and has been for
a long time. Why should I defend it? It is
good Liberal legislation, with which I have
always been in accord; and in saying so I
refer not only to this bill, but to others of the
same general type which will come before
us. Nevertheless there are one or two things
I would like to say in this connection.
My friends across the aisle take credit to
themselves for having added $9 to the $6
increase provided by the late Government.
If credit is due them, certainly I do not
begrudge it. But let the situation be understood. It was, as the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Crohl) has
pointed out, a Liberal Government which
took the responsibility of embodying in law
the principle of old age security, and while
that legislation may have been approved by
the Opposition-I do not remember, and it
does not matter now-it was not without
some opposition in the country. At the
present time there is very little criticism:
few people would care to see old age assistance abolished.
But I should like to point out that, since
the ex-Minister of Finance at the last session
sponsored a bill to add $6 per month to pensions, there has been a very marked increase
in the cost of living. Over the weekend,
when I was engaged in some labour consultations, we figured out what it amounted to.
There is a formula, which has been commonly accepted for some time, that an
increase of seven-tenths of a point in the
index of living costs is equal to one cent per
hour. On that basis, according to our computation, the increase in the cost of living
during 1956 and thus far in 1957 is equal to
about $200 per year. Certainly it has been
very considerable since the last budget was
brought down; and let me tell my honourable
friends opposite that it is not to be assumed
that, if a Liberal Government were now in
office and bringing down the budget, it would
not go further in the direction of old age
assistance than it did in the last budget.
For at that time there was a considerable
body of opinion within the Liberal party
that the $6 supplement was not enough. With
that in mind, and the further facts I have
mentioned, namely, that the cost of living
more than justifies the increase which the
Conservative Government now proposes, it
cannot be taken for granted that a Liberal
Government would not have done at least as
much. So, while I give every credit to the
present Government for having done what

185

I heartily approve of, let it not take too much
credit to itself, nor assume that what credit
is due to it is a discredit to us. That is
not so.
One point I feel in duty bound to make.
I received a letter from quite a prominent
lawyer in my city. I do not know why I
should not give his name. An honourable
senator says, "Don't do it", but anybody is
free to know it. The writer says:
When the Liberal Government raised the pensions
to $46 a month some time ago, a number of
unscrupulous landlords who rent rooms to these
senior citizens immediately increased the rent
of the room occupied by such senior citizens by an
amount of $1.50 to $1.75 per week and thus deprived these poor old people of any benefit that
they might have from such increase.

The writer goes on to ask me to make a
public announcement to this effect:
This increase was not made or intended for the
benefit of these grasping and avaricious petty
landlords, but only for the benefit of these poor
elderly people.

Although, he says, we cannot legally do
anything at the moment to correct this condition, the warning may have a salutary effect
on certain landlords. I think we are all
agreed that these increases given to needy
people should benefit these people and not
be passed on to landlords. I have nothing
against landlords, and I do not adopt entirely
the language of my friend who wrote the
letter. But let it not be forgotten that in
the last few years the proportion of the produce of mankind which has gone to landlords has very much increased. I figured out
in the course of some labour work I was
doing that since 1949 rents in the city of
Toronto have advanced by 50.1 per cent: that
is, they are half as much again as they were
eight years ago. Indeed, it may be that by
now even those figures are conservative. Of
course at the moment we cannot do anything
about it; we are not in a position to pass
rent control measures; but I think it worthwhile to have an expression of opinion from
this house that landlords should not take
advantage of the slight increase in these
pensions to take the money away from these
poor people.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I do not intend to take any of the
time of this house in discussing this bill. I
stand by the statement I made the other day,
that I will support it. I also agree with the
statement of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Crol) that no one
on this side is opposed to the bill. One honourable senator did question, as I think all
honourable senators must do, the wisdom of
the system on which pensions are now paid.

SENATE
Whether men are millionaires, whether they
earn as much as $100,000 or $50,000 a year,
they are to receive this $55 per month. That
is a point which the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) wanted to
make, if I interpret his remarks correctly. I
ask honourable senators, does it seem reasonable that people with such large incomes
should receive from the state each month the
additional amount of $55?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, if men with large
incomes or medium incomes obtain something from the Government, do they not on
that account pay more to the Government?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: A person whose income is $100,000 a year pays in respect of
this pension a tax of $60 a year. That is the
maximum. If a person is in receipt of a pension he must add the payments to his annual
income and compute his income tax on the
overall amount.
Hon. Mr. Reid: He still has something left
from the pension payments.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Very little. I am in
favour of the Old Age Security Act and the
Old Age Assistance Act, and until we can
develop better systems we must maintain
the existing ones. But why should we not
have a contributory system established on a
sound actuarial basis?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Would the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) permit me to ask him a question?

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I would point out that if the honourable
senator from North York (Hon. Mr. Sullivan)
speaks now he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: This has been quite a
baptism of fire for me. Had I known that in
sponsoring this bill, as requested by my honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig), I was going
to be subjected to such a barrage-and I
thank the honourable members who took the
load off my back-I would have been prepared to spend 10 hours in the operating
room yesterday instead of five. Honourable
senators, that is all I have to say on the
motion for the second reading of this bill.

I am sure no one will object to the granting
of pensions to blind people. The best outline of the bill is to be found in the Blind

In 1955 the act was amended to include
Hon. Joseph A. Sullivan: Honourable as beneficiaries persons of 18 years of age
senators,and over. At the same time the amount of

187

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
permissible income was increased. By the
present amendment the monthly pension is
increased to $55, and the amount of permissible income is increased to the point that a
single person who is blind can receive up
to $1,200, including the pension, an unmarried
person with one child, up to $1,680; a married
person, · 1,980; and two married blind persons
$
$2,100.
There is some difficulty with regard to the
definition of a blind person. The regulations do not seem clear on the point. Only
specialists can give certificates, but the
trouble is that one specialist interprets the
act differently from another. I have known
of a person who had very poor eyesightone does not have to be absolutely blind to
qualify-being turned down by a specialist
in one city and going to a specialist in another
city and receiving a certificate.
Honourable senators, I would like to call
your attention to what I believe is an unfortunate aspect of this legislation. A blind
pensioner, after a means test has been applied, may start to receive payments of so
much per month. Later his status in life may
change. His property may become more
valuable or he may earn more money or
have fewer dependants. No matter what the
case is, he often goes on receiving the same
pension. Then he suddenly receives a notice
from the department informing him that he
has been overpaid by, say, $1,500 or $2,000
and that he will receive pension payments
of only $5 a month until his overpayments
have been recovered. That is a heartbreaking experience for any pensioner. The change
in his financial situation should be discovered
as early as possible.
The dominion Government pays the entire
cost of family allowances and old age security benefits. It pays 75 per cent of the cost
of pensions for blind persons, and 50 per cent
of the cost of pensions under the Old Age
Assistance Act and the Disabled Persons Act.
The Mothers' Allowance is paid entirely by
the provinces. Now, it just happens that all
these cheques are issued from the capital
cities of each province. In Alberta they are
issued from Edmonton and the people all
over the province say "By Jove, we are
getting social credit dividends in abundance
now." They do not understand that the federal Government makes the greatest contribution to these schemes. I might say that the
Alberta Government handed out some crisp
$20 bills a few weeks ago because the province had received some $33 million in oil
rentals and decided to give '$11 million of it,
that is, one-third, to the people. So in that
province we all have an extra $20 this year.

Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Honourable senators,
I take the liberty of thanking the honourable
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr.
Gershaw), who very kindly passed over some
notes to me last evening with regard to this
and other bills which I was asked to explain
to this august assembly. May I add that I

WAR VETERANS

ALLOWANCE BILL

MOTION FOR SECOND READINGDEBATE ADJOURNED

Hon. George S. White moved the second
reading of Bill 28, to amend the War Veterans
Allowance Act, 1952.
He said: Honourable senators, I wish to
make a brief explanation of this bill, which
is not very complicated, and at the end of my
remarks I shall be happy to give any information I can, or to answer any questions that
honourable senators might like to ask.
This bill contains amendments to seven
sections of the act, and also amends the two
schedules set forth at the end of the bill,
which govern the rate of allowance and the
amount of maximum permissible income of
the several groups for those who receive
benefits under the act.
By means of a vote in supplementary
estimates, effective July 1 of this year, the
married rate of allowance was increased from
$108 to $120 a month, but no change was
made in the amount payable to the single
veteran, which remained at the rate of $60
a month. The Government felt that not only
did this action discriminate against the single

SENATE
veteran, but also that the monthly rate of $60
was more or less out of line with present-day
costs. It is now proposed to raise the single
rate from $60 to $70, thus restoring the approximate balance between the single and
the married rate.
With respect to income ceilings, it is desirable to maintain a sufficient difference between them and the allowance rate to enable
the war veteran allowance recipient to benefit
from some of the other income that he may
have. Last July the difference between the
single rate and the ceiling was increased
from $10 to $20 a month, and this differential
is being maintained by the proposed increase
in the ceiling from $80 to $90 a month. In
respect of the married recipient, however,
the differential was increased last July from
$12 to $15 a month, and the proposal now is
to increase it to $25 by raising the income
ceiling to $145 a month.
May I point out that casual earnings continue to be exempt income; that is to say,
casual earnings are permitted over and above
the ceiling of permissible income and do not
have the effect of reducing that ceiling.
The proposed amendments to section 5 are
exactly in line with those that I have been
discussing. Section 5 permits continuance to a
widow of a war veterans allowance recipient
of the married rate for one year after the
veteran's death, and it permits continuance
to the veteran of his married rate for one
year after the death of his wife. This special
award is made to enable the bereaved person
to meet the period of adjustment following
the death of the spouse. The rates in section
5 are increased to conform with the normal
rate and ceiling.
The act further provides that a veteran of
the Canadian forces qualifies, from a service
point of view, for war veterans allowance by
having served in a theatre of actual war. A
former member of His Majesty's Forces, other
than Canadian, or of the forces of our allies,
qualifies in the same way, provided that he
was domiciled in Canada at the time of his
enlistment. If such a man who served in
World War I was not so domiciled in Canada,
he is required to have resided in Canada for
at least 20 years. This required period of
residence is reduced to 10 years by the proposed amendment to subsection 4 of section 30
of this act.
The bill proposes a similar reduction in
residence for a person who seeks to qualify
under subsection 6 of section 30 of the act.
These veterans did not serve in a theatre of
actual war, either in World War I or World
War II, but they did serve in both wars. In
World War II they served with the Canadian
forces. In World War I they served with another Commonwealth force or an allied force

but, because they were not domiciled in
Canada before their enlistment, they are at
present required to have 20 years' residence in
Canada as a condition of eligibility under the
act. This period is reduced to 10 years.
The widow of a veteran who has qualified
by any of the methods that I have just described is also eligible in her own right on
his death.
As many honourable senators are aware,
there has been much dissatisfaction throughout the country in recent years because the
widow of a veteran, whose eligibility depends
upon 20 years' residence in Canada, could not
become eligible unless he had lived here for
those 20 years, no matter how long she herself has resided in this country. I think every
honourable senator knows of cases where a
veteran has died, having lived in Canada for 18
or 19 years, and because he had not completed
the 20 year residence period his widow was
unable to secure the allowance. The proposed
amendment remedies this situation, and at the
same time changes the 20 years requirement
to 10 years to conform with the other changes
proposed under section 30. Under the amendment the widow will become eligible from a
residence point of view on the earliest date
upon which she has been resident in Canada
for 10 years and upon which ber husband,
had he lived, would also have had 10 years'
residence. It will be observed that, by requiring that the husband, had he lived, would
have had 10 years' residence, the proposal
conforms with the basic principle that the
eligibility of a widow shall flow from her husband's eligibility.
The present act provides that, where a
member of the Canadian forces on active
service assigns pay to a recipient of War Vetcrans Allowance, and where no dependents'
allowance is paid to the recipient or to the
recipient's spouse, the assigned pay is to be
regarded as exempt income. This provision
was enacted when "active service" meant, in
effect, service in wartime. Since then the entire Canadian regular forces have been placed
on active service and the original intent of
the exemption has been lost, and the bill proposes that the provision be revoked.
In determining the income of a War Veterans Allowance recipient from any interest
in real property, an exemption is permitted in
respect of the value of the house in which
be resides. This exemption was fixed at $6,000
in 1952, and I am sure honourable senators
will agree that since then the value of real
estate has gone up. Caiaadian housing statistics show that from 1952 up to the second
quarter of 1957 the estimated average cost of
a single family dwelling in Canada increased

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
by approximately 32 per cent. This percentage takes into consideration the cost of
land, labour and material.
The proposed amendment would increase
the exemption from $6,000 to $8,000, being
33j per cent. It should be noted that the
exemption is not the market value of the
property but the interest which the recipient
has in this property. This interest is either
the assessed value established by the municipality or the equity of the recipient in the
property, whichever is the greater.
The bill repeals section 8 of the act, which
reads:
No allowance shall be paid in respect of any
orphan who is in receipt of a pension under the
Pension Act.

Heretofore, when the father's death is attributable to military service, the maximum
monthly payment under the Pension Act to
or on behalf of one orphan is $40. Where
the father's death is not attributable to
service, the maximum monthly payment that
may be made to or on behalf of one orphan
under the War Veterans Allowance Act,
together with a payment from the Assistance
Fund, would be $60.
It is true that there is a means test for
the latter group, whereas the pension is
paid regardless of other income. However,
the cases in which an orphan has private
income are comparatively few and, generally
speaking, the child whose father's death is
not related to service receives more money
from public funds than the child whose
father died on the battlefield.
This is
undersirable, and the amendment provides
that the pensioned orphan whose entire
income is less than the War Veterans Allowance ceiling for orphans will be eligible for
an award of War Veterans Allowance.
Subsection 1 of section 14 of the present
act permits a recipient of War Veterans
Allowance to be absent from Canada without loss of allowance for a period of three
months in any calendar year, provided that
he returns to Canada within six months from
the time he left this country. The bill proposes two changes: It would permit the
recipient to be absent from Canada for six
months from the last day of the first month
in which he absented himself; and it would
also permit payment upon his return for
a total of six, instead of three months in any
calendar year.
In respect of salaries of the Chairman
and other members of the War Veterans
Allowance Board, the Government felt that
these were overdue for revision, in line with
salaries of senior civil servants. I believe
there will be general agreement on that
score. These salaries were last revised in

1955, and since then there have been two
general salary revisions for the civil
servants. As a result the relativity which
existed between the members of the board
and other senior officials has not been maintained. Civil servants whose salaries were
in the same bracket as members of the board
in 1955 have now had their salaries set at
a level much higher than the rates now
shown in the act, and it is felt that the
members of the board should benefit from a
comparable adjustment. The latest revision
shows that senior officers Grade I, whose
salaries ranged from $9,000 to $10,000 in
1955, are now paid from $11,500 to $12,500.
The revisions proposed in the bill are well
within the amounts granted to senior civil
servants with comparable responsibilities, and
I believe they will be acceptable to honourable senators. The effective date corresponds with increases to the civil servants.
Finally, the last amendment in the bill
offers a solution to a problem that has been
before every Veterans' Committee of the
other house of which I have been a member;
namely, the payment of War Veterans Allowance to soldiers in the First World War who
served only in England. During World War
II the United Kingdom was deemed to be a
theatre of actual war, whereas during World
War I the United Kingdom was not so
regarded.
A considerable number of men reached
England during World War I and were retained in that county in the interests of the
service. Senior officers will readily agree that
the individual man in the ranks, and even the
junior officer, had little to say as to the nature
of the service that they would be called upon
to give. Experienced instructional staff, men
with peculiar administrative ability, men
skilled in various occupations: many of
these were retained in the United Kingdom
against their wishes.
The Minister of National Defence has from
time to time drawn attention to the rigours
of the training camps on Salisbury Plainsconditions that were not encountered in the
well-housed training areas of World War II.
The bill extends eligibility for War
Veterans Allowance from a service point of
view to those who served in the United
Kingdom during World War I for at least
365 days prior to the date following the
Armistice. This minimum period of 365
days conforms with the more recent recommendation of the Canadian Legion, and it is
considered by the Government to be a fair
basis upon which to establish eligibility.
The entire bill, except the portion dealing with salaries, is intended to come into

SENATE

effect on the first day of November, 1957.
It will be noted that this date is also the
effective date of the bill which amends the
Old Age Security Act. The main reason for
selecting November 1 as the effective date of
the War Veterans Allowance bill is to bring
into effect as soon as possible the higher
income ceilings and the other improvements
that the bill covers.
Another important reason for choosing the
same effective date as that fixed for the Old
Age Security increase, is to ensure that the
higher income ceilings permit the War
Veterans Allowance recipient, who has
reached the age of 70, to obtain the maximum
benefit from the increase of Old Age Security
þensions.
Honourable

senators,

I

hope

that

these

remarks have been of assistance in clarifying
the amendments contained in this bill.
Some Hon. Senajors: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: I am sure all
honourable senators were pleased to hear
the honourable senator from HastingsFrontenac (Hon. Mr. White) give so full an
explanation of this bill. Over the years we
in this house have become accustomed to
receiving a full explanation on each bill
before giving it second reading. Honourable
senators will see the necessity for such an
explanation. When we give a bill second reading we are in effect approving it in principle,
and if we do not know fully what the bill is
about, how can we intelligently vote to
approve or disapprove of its principle? I am
glad, therefore, that the honourable senator
has given us such a full explanation of this

bill.
I rise at this time not to oppose the bill,
but rather to say that I approve of it in
principle. In my opinion, however, it can be
improved. In any event, there are certain
clauses which should be explained. I hope
that this is one bill which will go to a committee for further study. With respect to the
three welfare bills which we have recently
discussed, I hardly thought it necessary to
send them to a committee, but as it was the
wish of the house to do so we did not oppose
it from this side. However, this bill is more
involved and longer and I think it would be
well to have it referred to a committee.
I do not wish to discuss all the clauses of

this bill but I do wish to refer to clause No.
7, which enables Canadians who served in
England in the First World War to claim the
benefits of this act.
Honourable senators will recall that many

years ago we introduced into Parliament the
War Veterans Allowance Bill. It was for the
benefit of so-called burnt-out veterans, men

who were prematurely aged after having
served in the armed forces, men who had not
been wounded or did not have a hospital
record that would entitle them to a pension.
They had become pre-aged, and one just
could not point to anything about them and
say they were entitled to a pension. They
may have been broken in spirit to a certain
extent which affected them physically. The
War Veterans Allowance Act was brought
into force for their benefit. It was considered at that time that this pre-aging and
this burnt-out condition had been brought
about by service in the theatres of war. For
many years, in order to qualify for benefits
under this act, a member of the armed forces
had to have served in an actual theatre of
war. May I read the provisions of the act
which refer to those areas. Section 30, subsection 8:
(8) For the purpose of this section "theatre of
actual war" means
(a) in the case of the South African war, the
zone of the military operations in South Africa
(b) in the case of World War I,
(i) as applied to the army or air forces, the zone
of allied armies of the continents of Europe,
of Asia and of Africa
That is, anyone who had served in Europe,

Asia or Africa could claim the benefits of
this act. Continuing (i):
or wherever the veteran has sustained injury
or contracted disease directly by a hostile act
of the enemy.

That is, if he had been wounded in any
land or on sea he could claim the benefits of
this act. It might be imagined that in those
circumstances he would not need to claim
its benefits; but he might be receiving only
a very small pension and therefore he could
claim under this act as well.
I will go on. I will not refer to 8 (b) subclause (ii), which refers to naval forces. I
have already referred to the South African
War and the First World War-and a veteran
of the latter, generally speaking, would
qualify only if he had served in Europe,
Asia or Africa. But in connection with World
War II the following are the provisions:
30. (8) For the purposes of this section "theatre
of actual war" means
(c) in the case of World War II, any place
where the veteran has been on service involving duties performed outside the Western
Hemisphere, including service involving duties
performed outside of Canada, Newfoundland,
and the United States of America, and the
territorial waters thereof in aicraft or anywhere in a ship or other vessel, which service
is classed as "sea time" for the purpose of
advancement of naval rating . . .

So you see, honourable senators, one who
served in the armed forces in the Second
World War can claim the benefits of this act
if he served outside the Western Hemisphere

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
or in our territorial waters. Thus the provisions of the act have been enlarged considerably in so far as -Second World- War
veterans are concerned.
Another change was made in this act
whereby those who had served in any forces
of the Imperial Army or in our allied armies
could dlaimn the benefits of this act if they
had lived in Canada for 20 years. That was
quite an extensive change.
Well, honourable senators, we now propose
to change the act further. We are now proposing ta, enact a provision whereby anyone
who in the First World War served in the
arrned forces in the United Kingdom is
entitled to benefits under the act.
I said,'
"anyone". That is hardly correct.
The wording of the proposed change is as follows:
7. (3) A Canadian veteran of World War I or
World War II is any former member of His
Majesty's Canadian forces
(b) who served in the United Kingdom during
World War I for at least three hundred and
sixty-five days prior to the l2th day of
November, 1918.
Why 365 days? If a man who has become
pre-aged or burnt out had served in the
United Kingdom for 364 days, why shouldn't
he get the benefits of this act? If he had
extended his stay by a couple of days he
could have qualified under titis act.
Now, the honourable senator who introduced the bil stated that it provides what
the Canadian Legion suggested. I suppose
the Canadian Legion suggested that on the
basis that hall a loaf is better than none.
They probably thought that if the term of
365 days were specified now they could ask
for an arnendment later on, and that we
would see the unreasonableness of that term
and eliminate it. I do not see why we
should insert the restriction of 365 days. If
men have become pre-aged and burnt out
after having suif ered the rigours of warfare
in Britain-perhaps having been exposed ta
bombing attacks-I cannot see why they
should be denied the right to benefit under
this act simply because they were over there
for less than a year.
I realize that it would be difficult for this
house even in comrnittee ta arnend the bill,
but I think the honourable senator who
explained it (Hon. Mr. White) should
approach the minister and present our case
ta him, point out to him that a great many
veterans will suifer hardship if this bull
remains as it is.
Honourable senators, my remarks are not;
a criticism of this bill. As I said when I
rose, I think the bil can be improved. I
suggest therefore that we should give it
careful consideration in conmittee.
96702-13

Hon. C. G. Power: Honourable senators,
I entirely support the suggestion made by
the last speaker that this bill should be
referred to a committee of the house. It is
within rny recoilection that in Urnes gone
by the most searching examination and
criticism of bills introduced in the other
chamber on behalf and in support of
returned saldiers were brought before committees of this house and leaders of bath
palitical parties.
I recali that Senator
Meighen and the late Senator Dandurand
always made it a point to attend thase meetings of committees in order, I think, ta check
what they might consider to, be the excess
of generosity of members of the other bouse.
During xnany years in the other lieuse, bath
as a member and as chairman of a committee on soldiers' problems and, later, as
Minister cf Pensions and National Health, I
was subjected to. f ar mare difficuit questioning and examination by members of the
Senate than I ever experienced in the other
chamber. The man who could present a
glowing report and be sure of applause in
the other chamber becarne a very humble
suppliant when he came befare the Senate.
Se, if only for the sake of tradition, I suggest
that this bill be subrnitted ta the scrutiny of
honourable senators.
Tihis having been said, may I, on my own,
and without in any way involving my calleagues on titis side of the hause, make known
certain reservations which I have naw and
have had for many years with respect ta
sorne of this legisiation. In order ta do Sa,
perhaps, if time wiil permit, I could go back
ta the beginnings of these enactrnents.
I had the great privilege of sitting on the
first subcommittee appointed by the other
house ta draft pension laws. I was privileged
ta sit at the feet of twa of the most conscientious members of parliarnent I ever
met-Mr. Hume Cronyn, of London, Ontario,
who I believe died sorne years aga, and
Mr. Billy Nickle, of Kingston, Ontario. These
two gentlemen devoted very considerable
time during sessions of Parliament and in
the recesses ta the work of maulding a
pension bill. It was under the direction o!
another great man, cf whom I must say,
although I was and arn stiil opposed ta is
views on certain sacial matters, that lie gave
conscientiaus and hardworking service; I
mean the late Newton Wesley Rowell. These
gentlemen know that the business of looking
after returned soldiers was sornething new
as far as Canada was concerned.

vast numbers of men, returning wounded,
and dependents of the fallen. It was the
aim of our legislators to steer a clear course
between the somewhat parsimonious course
of action pursued by European governments,
including Britain, and the wide-open excessive generosity of our neighbours to the
south, where, as late as 1936, people were
drawing pensions which arose out of the
war of 1812.
It was this situation with which they were
faced when they evolved the original pensions act. They insisted on certain principles.
The first was that a man who had served
overseas was entitled upon his return to be
placed in the same position in civil life as be
would have had if the war had not occurred
and be had not gone overseas. That principle having been laid down, out of it came
others with respect to the payment of pensions or compensation for wounds for disability, for disease suffered in the course of
the soldier's service or attributable to something in his military career. That involved a
payment of pensions, and the principle was
followed in subsequent pension legislation.
By 1928 it had become fairly obvious to
many of those interested that attention must
be given to another class of persons, namely,
those who had returned from overseas without any apparent disability; who, having
served in an actual theatre of war, were unscathed in so far as any tangible evidence of
disability was concerned, but many of whom,
it was felt, had pre-aged. In this respect the
first proposai put forward was that the age
of eligibility for the old age pension should
be reduced and the pension made payable at
sixty. That concession was considered insufficient. It was felt that the hardships they
had suffered, the mental stress they had
undergone while serving in the trenches or
in an actual theatre of war for two or three
years, in the wet and the cold and the danger,
was enough to have deranged in some way
the mental and perhaps the physical capacity
of these men. So war veterans' allowances
were evolved in 1930 to cover people who
had no tangible disability and who could not
qualify for payment of pension by way of
compensation for wounds, disability or sickness. Some of these recipients of war veterans' allowances got a very low pension. One
of them who did reminded me of it in these
words, "What is the good of $5 a month when
it costs $6 per bottle?" Possibly some of these
returned men would not have been much use
to the community anyway, but it was felt
by Dr. King, the then Minister of Pensions
and National Health, that something should
be done for them in recognition of the fact
that they had worn the uniform and had suffered some intangible disability. It was not
a scheme for granting pensions to everybody.

The two requirements were: that there was
some mental or physical handicap to earning
a living, and that the applicant had served in
a field of actual war.
As time went on these qualifications were
changed, and more and more the original idea
was departed from. The last qualificationand I apologize in the most complete way for
quoting this jargon, because I wrote it myself, and frankly, quite a few years afterwards I have great difficulty in interpreting
it-was described in 1938 as follows:
A man, even if not qualified by age or disability,
who is incapable and is unlikely to become capable
of maintaining himself, because of economic handicaps, combined with physical or mental disability
or insufficiency.

Now, today a man can qualify for an
allowance under that language, provided it
is interpreted broadly and intelligently. But
bearing out our original thought-and then
I got myself into trouble-when veterans who
had served in armed forces other than
Canada's armed forces came and said they
also were entitled to qualify, I suggested-and
I think my suggestion met with general
accord at that time-that those who had
actually lived in Canada prior to the war and
had served as, say, French reservists, Polish
reservists, or in the Royal Flying Corps, the
Royal Navy or had gone to England and
obtained commissions in British regiments,
notwithstanding they had not served against
the enemy whilst wearing a Canadian uniform,
and were de facto Canadian citizens who had
gone overseas and served in other allied
forces, would be entitled to the benefits of
this act. In order to qualify they must have
served in some armed branch of the allied
forces and had been living in Canada prior
to the outbreak of war.
Then came an agitation by minority pressure groups, at the time I held office as
Minister of Pensions, to bring the veterans of
the Imperial forces under this act whether
or not they had lived in Canada prior to the
war. That, I am free to say, I opposed most
vigorously. Strangely enough I received support in the House of Commons from a man
who had no sympathy with either me personally or my politics. I refer to the late
Lord Bennett. He took the same view I did,
that in a great many cases these people who
in the 1930's were asking to be placed in the
same category as Canadian veterans who had
seen service in a theatre of actual war, were
men who had come here under, as I think it
was called, the Immigrants Assistance Act,

NOVEMBER 12, 1957
and were in a large number of cases-and I
think Lord Bennett mentioned it in the
house-people who had received pensions
from the British Government and had commuted their pensions and were now coming
to us for another kind of pension, the War
Veterans Allowance. That I resolutely refused
to agree to, for which I was reviled and
treated as a subversive and even as being
disloyal to the Empire. Some of this vituperation I accepted with becoming humility,
and at times with nonchalant equanimity.
However, with Christian forgiveness, on one
of my trips to England I took it upon myself
to call upon the British Minister of Pensions
to see if he would do anything about these
fellows. He listened to me very carefully and
politely, and eventually he said: "They
served their own country in their own uniform. They received the rates of pay which
were usual in this country, and in a good
many cases they received the statutory pension which they commuted. What more have
we got to do?" As he looked at me and
shrugged his shoulders a little bit, I almost
felt that, had he been a citizen of a neighbouring country, the expression forming on his
lips would have turned to something like
"sucker", but he did not say that. He was too
much a cultivated gentleman for that.
However, my representations to the British
Government were fruitless. Years after I left
the department an amendment was introduced
whereby persons who belonged to the category of allied forces would qualify if they
lived 20 years in this country.
Then came another category of persons
who called themselves non-pension widows.
'These were to a large extent, if I were to
judge from the many delegations who called
upon me, not widows of people who spoke in
the flat accent of Saskatchewan or the hard
accent of Ontario or even the soft Gaelic
accent of Quebec; these were people from
every part of Britain except perhaps North
Britain. They wanted pensions not because
their husbands had died as a result of war
services or from illnesses contracted on service, but because they had died of an ordinary
disability, which every man contracts as he
grows older and from which every man with
advancing age may suffer. Or they were
widows of men who had died as a result of
an accident in a street car or even a tavern
brawl. For these reasons these people who
were not Canadian citizens were asking that
they be given a pension, merely because their
husbands had at one time or another worn
the uniform of one of the allied countries;
that is to say, they would be getting an
advantage over Canadian citizens by receiving
a pension earlier in their life than Canadian
citizens who had spent all their lives in this
96702-13J

country and brought up their children here
and taken part in our economie struggle. I
refused that too, but I am sorry to say it was
granted afterwards by someone who succeeded me.
Honourable senators, my reservation with
respect to this bill is that by shortening the
period of residence to 10 years it means that
people who never wore a Canadian uniform
and never suffered a disability of any kind
during the war, but who came here 39 years
after the war-yesterday was the 39th anniversary of the Armistice-would be entitled
to get a pension from Canadian funds before
ordinary Canadian citizens would. We ought
to give this considerable and serious thought.
I do not want to oppose it particularly, although it is perfectly within my rights to
oppose it bitterly. I think the Senate ought
to understand what kind of legislation we
are passing.
In case there are some among us-and
there may be many-who would sympathize
with the poor unfortunate British on account
of the austerity and the difficulties they have
had to meet since the war, let me point out
who the persons covered by this bill are. I
quote:
Any former member of His Majesty's forces, or
of any of the forces of any of His Majesty's allies
or powers associated with His Majesty in any war
concluded on or before the 31st day of August,
1921, who served during any such war, and has
resided in Canada for a total period of at least
10 years.

Honourable senators, did you ever hear of
the Bolsheviks and the Russians? A great
many served in the Russian armies. They
were associated powers before 1921, or, if
you want to stretch a point, at least up to
the time of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which
I believe was signed by the Bolshevik Russian Government in March, 1918. If I am
not mistaken, the Russian revolution took
place in April, 1917. Well, those people who
served in the Russian army, and who in
excessive enthusiasm shot their officers in
mutiny, still were members of the forces of
an associated power up until the time when
Lenin made peace with the Germans in 1918.
Therefore, on the basis of this bill, as we
propose to pass it, perhaps if Mr. Bulganin
had been old enough to serve in the war of
1914-1918, or perhaps if Mr. Kruschev, for
all I know, had been old enough to serve in
the war-for they would have been conscripted, anyway, if they had been 15 or 16
years of age-and had come to Canada, there
would be nothing to prevent them from
getting a war veterans allowance, if they
were otherwise qualified.

SENATE
I think we should amend the act to cover
a situation of that kind, or at least we should
know. where we are going. We are covering
all those allied and associated powers. As
I interpret this act, any Frenchman who
had served only in France-and I am under
the impression, although I am speaking without any accurate information, any Frenchman who was a gendarme in a villagewould be part of the armed forces and
deemed to have served in a theatre of actual
war, and thus be entitled to a war veterans'
allowance here. He might not have suffered
any great hardship; he might have been at

Marseilles, or somewhere down on the coast
of Brittany, yet he would be entitled to
advantages which we do not give to ordinary
Canadian citizens.
Honourable senators, the suggestion I
make is that these matters should at least
be discussed and studied in committee, so
that we may find out where we are going.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,

Hon. Mr. Haig: It was a legal amendment.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Honourable senators,
the amendment was proposed by the Government, through the Chairman of the Canadian
Maritime Commission, and was intended solely
for purposes of clarification.
I refer honourable senators to section 1 of
the bill, which repeals section 3 of the act
and substitutes a new section 3. Paragraph
(c) of subsection (1) of the new section deals
with remedial situations and provides for
extension of the right of the owner of a ship
built in Canada to get a greater depreciation
deduction in a year than that provided under
the Income Tax Act, which is 15 per cent.
The benefit which already exists under this
statute, of 33à per cent, is extended to situations that are provided for in the bill, and
the amendment broadens and extends the

That makes it clear that the exclusion would
apply in a case where the allowance had been
made previously to any other taxpayer, but
would not exclude the owner after he had
taken depreciation at 33à per cent for one
year. I think the amendment is an excess
of caution, but possibly it is advisable in
the circumstances.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I wish to thank the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) for explaining the amendment. When a bill comes
back to this house from a committee with an

amendment until it has been explained.
Hon. Thomas Reid: It is the rule that it
should not be approved until it has been

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It should not be
approved until it has been explained, in any
event, in my opinion. I have no objection to
the bill being given third reading today, but
I would have objected if an explanation had
not been given.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I have just a remark to make about
this bill. Naturally, owners of ships complain
about the expenses necessary to keep their
service going, and whether they are right
or not I arn not in a position to tell, but I
have noticed that although we have Canadian
registry for shipping, so many Canadian ships
have been registered elsewhere that it
amounts to a depreciation of Canadian
shipping at large. The only comment I have
to make is that the leaders of the maritime
unions are very difficult to deal with, and
they may have killed the goose that laid
golden eggs. During the last war there was
discrimination against men who were engaged in maritime shipping: they were not
treated on a footing of equality with the
men who served on warships. Until I have
the opportunity to go deeper into the matter,
to bring it up on a future occasion, I would
only say that I believe that union leaders
have brought about the change of registration of so many Canadian ships, and it is
my deep conviction that they are more to
blame than the crews who compose their
membership, or even the owners of the
ships. This, I repeat, is my only comment
for today, but perhaps at the next session,
or possibly before, when I have had an
opportunity to peruse the files in my possession, which date back a long time, concerning the activities of leaders of maritime
unions, I shall have more to say.
The amendment was concurred in.

be able to operate successfully under Canadian registry and fly the Canadian ensign.

SUGGESTED

REDUCTION IN MEMBERSHIP
OF SUBCOMMITTEES

Hon. Jean-François Poulio±: Honourable
senators, I would be very much interested to

know the average of the membership of the
honourable senators who sit on the subcommittees on divorce. I hope that this will be
prepared indicating the number of honourable senators who have been sitting on each
committee of divorce since the beginning of

the session. The reason I ask that question
is obvious, or must be obvious, to everybody: it is that the honourable senators who
sit on those divorce committees are all persons whose time is very precious and valuable, and the divorce stories are about all the
same, and I was shocked when I saw that
eminent senators were sitting on one of those
subcommittees on divorce. It makes no sense.
It could be decided by one, two, or three
at the most. If the number of honourable
senators who sit on the subcommittees on
divorce were smaller it would mean less
work for the honourable senators who belong
to that committee, and it would mean also
that the work would be much more expeditiously done-I say that without offence to
anyone. A subcommittee on divorce cannot
be called an Areopagus-a court in Athens
before Christ, where the numbers of the
judges were just as large as the crowd that
was attending the case.
I hope that this suggestion to reduce sharply
the membership of the divorce subcommittee
and to form several subcommittees, instead
of having one that keeps all the members of
the committee busy at the same time and
prevents them from doing their other duties
as senators, will be followed. It is an urgent
reform, and I hope the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald), as well as the honourable
Chairman of the Committee on Divorce (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), will join together to make
progress in the right direction, by reducing
sharply, by cutting sharply, the membership
of the subcommittee on divorce.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
express my thanks to the senator who has
just spoken for his kind thought in this
connection. I assure him his suggestions
will be very carefully considered by myself,

NOVEMBER 13, 1957
and as well by all other members of the
committee and I hope by the Leader of the
Government in this house.
I should perhaps explain, although no
doubt it is well known, that each subcommittee has a quorum of three, and if a larger
number of senators sit, as sometimes happens,
it is because of the difficult and important
nature of the hearing in progress. But the
general rule is that a subcommittee is composed of only three members. My honourable friend has suggested that the membership
of the subcommittees be reduced to one or
two senators. I am not sure that I do not
at least partially agree with him. For instance, if one judge is sufficient to hear a
divorce trial in our courts, surely one senator is sufficient to hear a petition before our
committee. I say one senator is as good
as one judge, but whether it is necessary to
reduce our subcommittees to one member
is another matter.
I agree with my friend that honourable
senators who attend the Divorce Committee
are kept away from other important committees. I feel that is true in my own case.
Many important bills are discussed at meetings of other committees which I should
very much like to attend. But I feel my
special duty is that of the Divorce Committee, and that being so I try to carry it out.
My honourable friend made the observation that the divorce cases would be heard
more expeditiously if the subcommittees were
smaller. I cannot agree with that, because
our cases are now heard as expeditiously as
it is possible to hear them.
Hon. Mr. Pouliol: If my honourable friend
will permit me, I will qualify what I said.
If there were three committees with a small
membership the work could be done faster
than by one committee with a larger
membership.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, perhaps that appears so on the face of it. The actual fact
is that we now sit in three subcommittees,
and have done so throughout this session,
with the exception of yesterday and today,
when the committee has been hearing contested cases under the chairmanship of the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll). On these occasions the
membership of the committee was larger
than three, but only because there were
difficult points to be considered. Today I sat
through one case and partially through another, not as chairman, but because of the
difficulties involved and the interesting
questions of law which came up. As I say,
it has been only yesterday and today that
we have had committees composed of more
96702-14

than a maximum of four members, the
usual number being three. We have tried to
hear the cases expeditiously and we have
heard every case that was ready to be heard.
We have no sitting planned for Friday of this
week, for the specific reason that no case
was ready to be heard. As soon as further
cases are ready, and if the Senate is still
sitting, we will go on to hear them. I can
assure my honourable friend that the
cases that are ready are being heard as
expeditiously as possible.
If three subcommittees are not sufficient
to hear the number of cases that are brought
before us, we will sit in four subcommittees.
During, I believe, the past three sessions we
have sat in three subcommittees; there was
an earlier session at which we sat for a time
in four subcommittees, but there was some
difficulty, though not much, in getting accommodation. However, if it is necessary
for us to sit in four sections, we will get
the accommodation.
Incidental to these remarks, I would like
to say a few words with respect to the
accommodation given to the Divorce Committee. I have a feeling of regret each time
I pass along the corridor to the committee
rooms to see there a heterogeneous assembly
of men and women, detectives, petitioners,
lawyers and witnesses, all mixed up, standing
in the corridor waiting for the hearings to

regrets this situation. The honourable senator

conditions to exist which are positively not
decent. I hope that the Leader of the
Government will join with some of the rest
of us in trying to find better accommodation.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I am pleased that the Chairman of the
Divorce Committee (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) has
not pushed aside too lightly the suggestion
made by the honourable senator from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot). No one in
this house has more respect than I for the
work being done by that committee under the
distinguished chairmanship of our honourable
friend. Whether we are in favour of parliamentary divorces or not, as the law stands
at present we have a duty in this respect,
and we must do it.
The honourable senator from De la Durantaye suggested that the subcommittee should
be composed of fewer members than at
present. As the chairman has said, if divorce
cases in our courts can be heard by a single

judge, why can they not be heard in Parliament by a single senator? I can understand
that there may well be difficult cases which

Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

NOVEMBER 13, 1957
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Now, I want to talk
about New Brunswick and the Atlantic
provinces where, as honourable senators
know, we are concerned chiefly with agriculture, forest products industries and the
fishing industry.
While a number of honourable members of
this house, two of them especially, are more
competent to discuss New Brunswick and
Maritime agriculture than I am, I want to
place upon the record some figures which
appeared in a publication issued by the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics a few days
ago on agriculture in New Brunswick. I
think these figures will surely convince the
Senate, the Government, and the people of
Canada just where New Brunswick agriculture has drifted, and is still drifting.
In 1901 the area of farm lands in the
province of New Brunswick was 4,443,000
acres, or 25 per cent of the total area of the
province. Fifty-five years later, last year,
the area had shrunk to 2,981,000 acres or
only 17 per cent of the total area of the
province. The number of farms in that
period had decreased from 37,000 to 22,000.
On the basis of population, it is interesting
to note that in 1931, 25 years ago, 44.1 per
cent of the population lived on farms, while
today our agricultural population is only
23.3 per cent.
In 1911 there were 14,000 acres sown in
wheat; last year there were 2,121 acres. In
1911 the acreage sown in oats amounted to
207,618 acres; last year it was 129,694 acres.
Hay was grown on 635,281 acres in 1911,
but on only 399,403 acres last year,
Our cattle population decreased from 230,000 in 1921 to 183,000 in 1956.
Surely, honourable senators, this chamber
does not need any more impressive figures
than those to convince one that the farmers
of New Brunswick have travelled a rough
road, and are still having it tough.
Hon. W. D. Euler: May I ask my honourable friend a question? He has given us a
striking comparison of the decrease in acreage
sown to wheat and other products. Does
that indicate that the lands have been
abandoned altogether?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: In many cases they
have been abandoned altogether and in other
cases they have gone back into forest land.
Now, I come to forest products, the pulp
and paper industry and the long lumber
industry in which New Brunswick people are
so vitally interested. As honourable senators
know, in the last few months the demand for
pulp and paper has not been so active. Production has been curtailed. It is estimated that
there will be a considerably smaller cut of
96702-14J

pulpwood in the eastern provinces this year
than there was last year, and that from
15,000 to 18,000 fewer bush workers will
be employed there. I should mention that
"eastern Canada" includes the area from the
Rocky Mountains east. At the present time
there is no market in the Maritimes for pulpwood.
In addition to supplying the mills of the
eastern provinces, we ship, or have shipped,
considerable quantities of pulpwood to continental Europe and the United Kingdom.
Last year 110,000 cords were thus disposed
of, and they came from our farmer's woodlots and formed the bulk of the farmers'
cash product. This year, I am informed,
there is so large a surplus of pulpwood in
the United Kingdom that there will be no
demand for it from our shores in 1958.
As honourable senators who are familiar
with this business know, one of the factors
which adversely affect the pulp and paper
industry in the Atlantic provinces, as well
as in the rest of Canada, is the premium on
our Canadian dollar in terms of the American dollar. For instance, a company whose
sales total $100 million a year, of which 80
per cent is derived from deliveries to the
United States, has been obliged to take a discount averaging 4 per cent on its American
sales. As honourable senators know, the
difference in values has been as high as 5
per cent: somebody says 6. Five per cent
of $80 million is no small amount in any
man's book. It could mean the difference
between a profit and a loss. It also means
the loss of jobs for many Canadians.
I might add-and this has particular
reference to conditions in the central provinces of Ontario and Quebec-that the
premium on our dollar, besides being a
penalty on the export business, acts as a
subsidy to importers, because it allows
American goods purchased with cheaper
American money to compete with goods
manufactured in this country.
Pitprops is another product produced in
the Atlantic provinces which we ship to the
United Kingdom. During the war we did
an enormous amount of business in this
line, but it has been considerably reduced
of late, although the United Kingdom is still
using a large quantity of pitprops. Last year
she imported 500,000 cords, but only 63,000
cords came from New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia; the rest was imported from Sweden,
Finland and Russia, because of cheaper
freight rates from their ports to Britain,
plus the fact that as they belong to the sterling bloc, they accept payment in that
currency instead of dollars.

WAR VETERANS ALLOWANCE BILL
SECOND READING

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. White for
the second reading of Bill 28, to amend the
War Veterans Allowance Act, 1952.

Hon. Mr. Reid: Before the honourable senator speaks I wonder if lie would tell us if he
intends to refer the bill to committee.
Hon. Mr. White: Yes.
Honourable senators, I very much appreciate the contribution made by the various
speakers on behalf of those veterans who will
benefit under this legislation. I have listened
with deep interest to what the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and the honourable senator from
Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill) have said in regard to the restrictive
clause, if you may so call it, requiring service
of at least 365 days in the United Kingdom.
However, I would point out that when the
bill goes to committee they will be able to
get satisfactory explanations from Colonel
F. J. G. Garneau, of the War Veterans Allowance Board, and the Deputy Minister of
the Department of Veterans Affairs.
As honourable senators know, in veterans
legislation there usually is some restriction of
this type. For instance, there is a similar
sort of restriction in the Pension Act whereby it is provided that the wife of a veteran
who is in receipt of a pension of 50 per cent
or more is entitled to a pension on the death
of lier husband; but the unfortunate wife of
the veteran who is in receipt of a pension of
only 45 per cent or even 49j per cent, receives no allowance on the death of lier
husband. Another restrictive clause will be
found in the Veterans Land Act, which requires that in order to benefit under the act,
a veteran must have had at least one year's
service.
I am sure that when the bill is in committee honourable senators will receive a
satisfactory explanation of many points that
have been raised.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.

Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourable
senators, I heartily endorse this legislation,
but I want to support the plea made last night
by the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that something be
done about the latter part of section 7 of the
bill which restricts benefits in the case of
veterans of the First World War who served
in the United Kingdom for less than 365 days
prior to November 12, 1918.
In my constituency there is a very sad
case of a World War I veteran who has been
waiting three years for this legislation, hoping
that it would be of assistance to him. If the
honourable gentleman who sponsored this
bill (Hon. Mr. White) could have seen the joy
with which this old veteran, who sits
paralyzed in a wheel chair, greeted the news
that lie would receive assistance under this
legislation, I know he would join with me in
trying to find some formula to get around this
restrictive clause. Upon making inquiries I
found out to my absolute dismay that the
veteran spent just over eleven months in
England, and therefore lie will not qualify
under the bill. I have no doubt there are
similar cases all across the country.
I do not know how I am going to face this
old gentleman. Up to now we have not even
been able to get him into a hospital for
medical treatment. He just sits in his chair
day after day with an almost hopeless outlook. We thought that under this bill he
would be entitled to an allowance, but now
I shall have to inform him that he does not
qualify. I was very much in agreement with
what the honourable Leader of the Opposition
said last night about this section of the bill,

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of Her Majesty the Queen's Speech
at the opening of the session and the motion
of Hon. Mr. White, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Méthot, for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I am very pleased to have the opportunity to join in what has already been said
many times in this chamber-and each time
with sincerity and appreciation-by way of
extending congratulations to the mover (Hon.
Mr. White) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.
Méthot) of the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne. I congratulate them on
two grounds; first of all, on the qualities
of the speeches themselves. I listened with
appreciation and profit to the speech of the
mover. I am sorry to say I did not understand the speech of the seconder, but I got
a great deal of satisfaction from just listening to him. I liked his smile and the nice
way he presented what he said. I have no
doubt that his speech appealed strongly to
those honourable members who are fortunate
enough to understand the French language.
In the second place, I congratulate these two
honourable gentlemen on the great opportunity, the unique opportunity, which was
given to them. This session marked the first
time in the history of the Canadian Parliament that it was possible to move and second
an address in reply to a Speech from the
Throne made in person in the Senate chamber by a reigning sovereign. That was an
occasion that will be long remembered by
those two honourable gentlemen and by all
of us, and by our children and our children's
children. I think we can say without any
qualification that the visit of Her Most
Gracious Majesty to Canada and to the
United States of America was opportune and
will contribute much to that national unity
and international unity which are so essential
in these times of tragic conditions in world
affairs.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, it
gives me great pleasure to join with others
in addressing some remarks to His Honour
the Speaker. I have been in the Senate for
21 years and I have seen many Speakers.
They have all been friends of mine, I am
proud to say, and I regard it a great privilege
to extend to you, sir, the same high esteem
that I have had for your predecessors.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I want to say a word to
the new senators. I am glad to see them

SENATE
here. I did not know many of them before
their appointment to this chamber, but I
have found them very easy to become
acquainted with.
My acquaintance with
them has been one of personal satisfaction
to me. I think we all should derive real
satisfaction from the fact that the presence
of these new senators means that the balance
of membership between the two great parties
of this country is being restored in this house.
I cannot see altogether a great many benefits
resulting from the change of Government,
but I do believe that one of them is the
necessary restoration of this balance that I
speak of. There will be brought in here
some new ideas, in direct conflict I hope with
some of my own and of those of my honourable deskmate (Hon. Mr. Howard), and they
will be beneficial for that very reason.
Diversity of opinion in a well-balanced house,
diversity of opinion that bas its basis not
in prejudiced or hidebound politics but in an
intelligent appreciation of public affairs, is
one of the most desirable things in this
chamber, and I welcome the fact that the
danger of the disappearance of that diversity
has now been removed.
Honourable senators, being a lawyer I try
to stick reasonably to my text, and I am
going to go back a little. I find that one of
the things suggested by the Speech from the
Throne comes very close to us. It was
indicated in that Speech, as I have it here
in our Minutes of the Proceedings on page 16,
that:

the immediate past Speaker of the Senate,
and for a number of years before that the
Leader of the Government-the Liberal Government-in this house (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
He made two proposals which I wish to mention for a moment. One was that some change
be made in our present method of dealing
with divorce petitions from Quebec and Newfoundland. Honourable senators who were
here last year will recall that a bill was introduced by the honourable senator from
Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), which I supported, providing that divorce petitions from
those provinces be dealt with by a court. The
bill was defeated in this chamber, and I think
it was largely defeated by the speech of my
honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Roebuck), the Chairman of the Divorce
Committee. He is in a powerful position in
that connection, for everybody regards most
highly the duties, well done, that he has
carried out as chairman of that committee.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Farris: He assured this house that
he was prepared to carry on those duties, and
I believe that was the determining factor in
the vote on the bill. But I did not then, and I
do not now, agree with my honourable friend.
I agree absolutely that his duties have been
well done, but I think that in his heart, with
all modesty on his part, he will agree with
me that if he had spent an equal amount of
time, nervous energy, thought and study on
the public affairs that come up in the Senate
he would have contributed more than any one

NOVEMBER 14, 1957
minority in the bouse. Senator Arthur
Meighen was Leader of the Opposition. Two
abler men for those positions have never
existed in Canada, but I always felt that their
very ability and energy detracted from the
Senate's effectiveness.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Senator Dandurand had a
capacity that no other man I have ever
known had, of explaining a bill about which
he knew nothing and proving to everybody
that it was all right. Senator Meighen, who
was a very close friend of his, enjoyed baiting
him just to watch how he would respond. I
used to sit almost opposite Senator Meighen,
and could watch the smile that came over his
face as Senator Dandurand dealt so adroitly
with every question that arose. The difficulty
with that situation was that the rest of us
sat around cooling our heels, for very seldom
did we get a chance to participate in debate.
I recall that one time, when I could no longer
resist the temptation, I got up on my feetit was quite a daring thing for a young
senator to do-and criticized Mr. Meighen as
strongly as I could. I was sitting right behind my leader, Senator Dandurand, and was
very conscious of the way in which be
looked around and glared at me. It was not
a popular thing for me to do; however, I
got away with it. When Senator Meighen
rose and attempted to reply to me, I will say
this for Senator Dandurand, he objected on
a point of order, because the leader had
already spoken.
Honourable senators, all this background
leads me to this: when subsequent leaders
came into the Senate they changed that
policy, and delegated the duty of explaining
a considerable number of bills to other
honourable senators. This practice has been
carried on ever since, and I am pleased to see
that the present leader has adopted it. I
believe it is a mighty good system. At this
session the sponsorship of bills has been
given to new senators, who perhaps do not
quite know the ropes yet. But I have no
doubt of their ability and capacity, and I am
sure that for as long as the Government
continues as it now is and this work is delegated to these gentlemen by my honourable
friend the leader, they will carry out their
duties in this house most effectively, and
that in consequence we shail be well informed on all legislative measures that come
before us.
This session is not a fair test of how this
system will work in other sessions to come,
if they do come. I do, however, suggest to
the leader, particularly if the dearth of
senatorial appointments continues and vacancies are not filled, that should he at any

time need help there are a good many volunteers on this side who will be glad to support
measures which the Government brings in.
My honourable friend from Ottawa West
(Hon. Mr. Connolly) bas already demonstrated how successful that sort of assistance
can be.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: My honourable friend
from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson), much
to my surprise, omitted to mention what I
thought, and what I used to think he thought,
was the most important remedy for conditions in the Senate, namely, that more legislation be introduced in this bouse by
ministers sponsoring the legislation. When I
first came here it used to be said that
ministers would not send their bills to this
house because they wanted to father them
or champion them themselves-that they did
not like to trust them to anyone else, even
to one of their own colleagues. I had a good
deal to do with changing that situation. My
honourable friend from Shelburne co-operated with me, and together we were able to
get the Rules of the Senate amended, by the
insertion of a new paragraph 18A, which
reads as follows:
When a bill or other matter relating to any
subject administered by a department of the Government of Canada bas originated in and is being
considered by the Senate or in Committee of the
Whole, a minister representing the department,
not being a member of the Senate, may enter the
Senate chamber, and, subject to the Rules, Orders,
Forms of Proceedings, and usages of the Senate,
take part in the debate.

From the date when that amendment was
approved, which was quite a few years ago,
any minister who wished to introduce a bill
in Parliament could introduce it in the
Senate. He could present his bill here just
as freely as if he were a member of the
Senate, and just as freely as if be were
introducing it in the House of Commons.
No longer could it be said that a minister
did not choose to introduce his bill in the
Senate because be did not want to trust it
to other hands. He could come here with
his bill and explain it himself.
Honourable senators, how many times
during the régime of the past Government
was that amendment taken advantage of?
The Honourable Mr. Chevrier came here a
couple of times, but I think he came more
out of curiosity than for any other reason.
Nevertheless, as I remember, he introduced
at least two bills here, made his explanation
of them, took part in the committee, and
everything went very well. I believe some
other ministers may have come.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Honourable Mr.
Garson was one of them.
Hon. Mr. Farris: In any event, the number
was small, and the record is not to the credit
of the Liberal Government.
What is the matter with the Senate? Before I answer that question, may I point out
that this house is rather different from the
ordinary house, and in this session a great
many more bills have been introduced here
than is normally the case in the early stages
of a session. But in years gone by we have
sat here twiddling our thumbs and kicking
our heels while the debate on the Speech
from the Throne was going on in the other
house, long after we had intelligently and
completely finished our discussion on it, and
no legislation was coming before this house.
Does that involve a reflection on the Senate,
or a reflection on the Government? Some
persons may ask why we do not bring in
measures of our own. Well, anyone who
knows anything at all about parliamentary
practice knows how useless and futile it
would be to do that. Under the modern
parliamentary system no bills-outside of
private bills-no public bills get anywhere
unless brought in by the Government.
Private members in the House of Commons
who bring in public bills never feel that
they are going to pass. So why bring them
in? Well, the answer is that in the next
election campaign they want to be able to
say to their electors, "See what we tried to
do, and see what this iniquitous Government
did-it would not let our bill go through."
Therefore, being practical and realistic, it
is necessary for us to understand clearly that
the only bills that are effectively dealt with
are Government bills.
But some people say, "Why don't you,
for the sake of argument, bring in other
bills and discuss public questions?" However,
honourable senators, that abstract way of
dealing with questions does not land you
anywhere. In the first place, the press would
not even bother reporting what we did about
these matters; it is only interested in reporting on issues which are before the public,
issues which are contentious and need to be
dealt with, issues which have effect on the
country. They are the only issues that the
press considers it worth while to bother
with. And whether in the Senate or in the
House of Commons, those are the only issues
that can be effectively and intelligently dealt
with.
The reason they are not dealt with better
here is not the fault of this house; it is the
difficulty that existed through the Liberal
régime, and I am afraid it may exist during

this one, of not originating more legislation
in this house and letting us deal with it
while long-winded speeches on the Speech
from the Throne are being made in the other
house. Perhaps that is a bad thing for me
to say, because I am going to make a longwinded speech today. The sequel to that
state of affairs has been the firing in here
of legislation, bill after bill, at the very
last minute of every session, and we have
had the unpleasant choice of either crowding
that legislation through or holding up Parliament-and one can appreciate what a howl
there would be if those old grey-headed
fellows in the Senate held up the members
of the House of Commons when their work
was finished and they were ready to go
home.
I said to my honourable friend opposite
on one occasion when he made a speech
dealing with this situation: "I would like to
back up your challenge, but it is too late
this session. However, if you will at the
start of next session declare that the Senate
will hold up legislation until it is fully discussed, no matter how near prorogation we
are, J, for one, and I think many others,
will be glad to support you in it." But, we are
all human, honourable senators, and nobody has ever yet done that. I would not
like to start it now, being in opposition, but
I would like to see my honourable friend the
Leader of the Government in the Senate start
it, and some of us support him in it-not
necessarily this session, because this is a
special one. But next session, assuming there
is going to be one, if there is the same
practice of bringing in new legislation at the
last minute, let us resolve to delay it until
it has been fully considered. In this way we
can get back at the House of Commons and
perhaps keep honourable members of that
house away from home just a little longer.
The next matter that I wish to deal with
is the question of old age pensions.
I am sorry that my honourable friend
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) is
here, because I know how he can glare at
me if I don't agree with him. He and I
have been friends for many years, so any
time that he does glare at me, honourable
senators, you will know that he does not
really mean it.
When the honourable senator from Mille
Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette), who is not here
today, moved the second reading of the
Old Age Security Bill, I think I correctly
understood him to say that the principle
of the old age security legislation was not
involved, that the purpose of the bill was
to increase the amount of pension. I agree
with him, and for that reason I would not

members of our society; to enable provincial
Governments to increase the payments to be
made under the Old Age Assistance Act, the
Blind Persons Act, and the Disabled Persons
Act; to authorize cash advances to permit
farmers to receive an advance payment for
their grain; to secure additional markets for
the products of our fisheries; to assist in
creating facilities for the production and
transmission of cheaper electric power in the
Atlantic provinces, to press for a favourable
settlement of problems in connection with
the Columbia River,-with all respect, this
last statement does not mean much, if anything-and to provide annual vacations with
pay for Government employees.
Practically the entire policy outlined in
the Speech from the Throne, and to be implemented by legislation, entails additional
expenditures and demands from the public
treasury. I want to analyse this program
with some little care, because-to repeatif the Government's program can be carried
out, and taxation simultaneously reduced, we
ought to keep this Government in power for
ever. I do not seem to get much audible
support for this proposition, but I believe
that, if they think it over, even my Conservative friends will agree with me.
Take, first, the increase in the old age pension. Unfortunately I was absent from the
meeting of the Senate Banking and Commerce
Committee, but my deskmate, the honourable
senator from Wellington (Hon. Mr. Howard)
was there, and I am indebted to him for
this information. Under the rate of allowance which prevailed until recently, when
the pension was $40 per month, the estimated
annual expenditure was $390 million. The
provision in the bill which we have just
passed will raise this total to $564 million.
On that item alone, therefore, the expected
increase is $174 million-which used to be
considered quite a lot of money. As regards
other legislation introduced about the same
time, providing for assistance to the provinces,
to the blind, and the disabled, there will be
further expenditures running into millions.
I do not know what the total will be, but I
think Parliament should have been informed
by this time. Maybe the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) can give
us the figures. I confess I don't know, except
that it is a large sum of money.
But it is not merely the cost involved in
these pieces of existing legislation which must
give us concern. We must be concerned in the
same way that a man is concerned when his
wife and children tell him they need more
money. He wants to give the money to them
but he is likely to be concerned about where
it will come from.

Mr. Diefenbaker has told us there is enough
money available to carry out all these projects and at the same time to reduce taxation. We should have some assurance of this.
He said he was going to call a session in September to do this very thing, but September
has gone by.
What are some of these items? I do not
know the amounts involved but I know they
are large. I listened with a great deal of
pleasure to the speech delivered by my honourable friend from Saint John-Albert (Hon.
Mr. Emerson). I was born and brought up in
the country at Grand Lake, New Brunswick,
located on a tributary of the Saint John River.
I recall that as a boy I sometimes travelled
on the old steamer May Queen to Saint John,
and I always thought of it as "going to
town". I have never gotten over the feeling
that in going to Saint John I was going to
the greatest place in the world. I had the
pleasure of revisiting Saint John some three
weeks ago. Later my wife and I drove from
there up through Gagetown and Queenstown
to Fredericton, and in my opinion the colour
and beauty along the Saint John River cannot
be excelled anywhere in the world. Despite
the gloomy statistics presented by the honourable senator from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchil) on the agricultural
industry of New Brunswick, the charm, glory
and inspiration of the beauty of that province
cannot be surpassed, even in Nova Scotia.
It is interesting to know that there is
some hope for New Brunswick because of
the report that the federal Government is
going to assist the province in harnessing
the tides of the Bay of Fundy to produce
a new source of hydro-electric power for
industrial development.
As an old New
Brunswicker who still has fond memories
of his native province, I rejoice that this
project is to be carried out. However, like
a provident father, I wonder just how much
it is going to cost. I do not believe the
hanourable gentleman from Saint JohnAlbert knows this, and I doubt if even the
Government does. We are told, though, that
it is going to cost so much that the province
of New Brunswick, even with its frugal
and careful Conservative Premier, cannot
afford to pay the whole cost, and that half
of it, which will be a tidy sum of money, is
going to be borne by the federal Government.
The Speech from the Throne stated that
the federal Government would initiate "new
discussions with the Government of Saskatchewan in order to make possible the early
commencement of construction of the dam on
the South Saskatchewan River". I have some
quotations from remarks made by the Prime
Minister with respect to this dam. My ties

NOVEMBER 14. 1957
are not as close to Saskatchewan as they
are to New Brunswick, although when I left
my native province I went to Regina where,
I think before some members of this Senate
were born, I was admitted to the Bar. That

on to Vancouver.
Although times were
mighty dull in the coast city at that time,
I did not have the price of a return ticket,
so I stayed there.
Let us see what Mr. Diefenbaker has had
to say about the South Saskatchewan River
Dam project. I have here an extract from
the Regina Leader Post, under date of May
18, 1957, which refers to comments made by
Mr. Diefenbaker. It reads:
Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent had once
refused to consider it on the grounds that the
federal Government would not assist any project
involved with power development but since the
federal Government's offer of power assistance in
the Maritimes and British Columbia "that argument's gone for ever.
"The dam is necessary for the future development of this province and the economy of the
nation and there is no further excuse for the
federal Government delaying it, much as the
Liberals may try to follow that course.
"We in this party are behind this project and
give it our entire support", he said to an outbreak
of applause.

word "machine" offensively, for my understanding of a machine in a political sense is
that it is the "Organization of your opponents".
Some Hon. Senalors: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Up until the last election
it did not seem that the wheels of the provincial machine were turning very much in
support of the federal Conservatives. I suppose I am not qualified to speak on this, but
that is the very thing I have been told by
some Conservatives, so it must be right. A
great change came about and Mr. Frost became very indignant, I have no doubt with
cause, at Mr. Harris, who, he claimed, did
not give him a big enough share of the spoils
of income tax revenue. I think the amount
he wanted was a minimum of $100 million
more. I should like to know why Mr. Harris
refused that $100 million. It was not out of
pure cussedness, you know; it was not that
the money was coming out of his pocket, or
coming out of the pockets of Liberals. It could
have been for only one reason, that, in his
opinion, by the formula that he devised,
Ontario was not entitled to that extra $100
million. And the chances are that the
Liberals lost the election because of that
refusal, for there is no doubt in the world
that it was that refusal which brought Mr.
Frost and Mr. Diefenbaker together on that
platform on April 25 of this very year. We
had assurances from Mr. Diefenbaker that he
would make no promises. Well, there are
promises and no promises, and other kinds
of promises. I have been in politics for a great
many years, as have a great many senators
here, and I wonder why Mr. Frost was on that
platform that night. I will read an excerpt
from the Globe and Mail of April 26:

He certainly would get an outbreak of
applause in Regina on that speech, and
naturally it would be followed by an outbreak of votes.
Now, honourable senators, it would be in
mighty bad taste for a far-westerner and a
one-time far-easterner to criticize the expenditure of this money in the province of
Saskatchewan, but again I wonder how many

"The primary issue facing the people of Canada
today is how we are going to meet in a realistic
way . . . the needs of our people and the provinces and the municipalities which are without
question the right arm of development.
The Liberal administration's attitude to these
problems, Mr. Frost said, was one of "centralization,
born in wartime and ingrained into governmental
thinking".
The 10 per cent of personal income tax and 9
per cent of corporate income tax offered the
provinces was a "division thrown to us in the
rather smug anticipation that it will meet our
requirements".
This conclusion is at complete variance with
evidence available to everybody, he said, adding
that the evidence had been produced not only at
the federal-provincial conference but before the
Gordon Commission.
"The most elementary study would show that
it is inadequate. We have pointed this out time
and again. It will not be sufficient to meet more
than a portion of the increased cost of education,
to say nothing of other requirements I have
mentioned."
(The new agreements give Ontario
an extra $40,000,000).
"We cannot face complacently the fact that

Hon. Mr. Isnor: A good paper!
Hon. Mr. Farris: I would presume so. In
my earlier days they were separate papers,
and one was a good one! An observation
in the report attributes to Mr. Diefenbaker
the following:
Municipalities were being pauperized "while the
federal Government wallows in surpluses the like
of which have not been seen in Canada's history".

I think Mr. Diefenbaker is pretty careful
in this choice of words. I looked up the
definition of "wallow" in my pocket dietionary, and this is what it says: "roll about;
flounder: the pigs wallowed in the mud."
"act of wallowing". Well, there would be
Liberals wallowing like pigs in the mire, with
all these ungodly government surpluses to

There will be no surpluses when we get inand we are going to spread this mud like

I now quote from the Toronto Daily Star
of May 16, 1957. It refers to a speech made
by Mr. Diefenbaker in Manitoba, and I
presume it is a correct report:
No province in Canada will get less tax money
from Ottawa if a Conservative Government is
elected June 10, John Diefenbaker pledged here
last night.
The national Conservative leader promised a fair
share of tax revenues for ail provinces, with more
for the poorer provinces but not at the expense
of the richer provinces.
"I make this statement unequivocally tonight,"
he said. "There will be no reduction in the amount
now paid to any province through dominionprovincial tax-rental agreements."
The larger provincial shares, he indicated, would
come from tax money now retained in the federal
treasury.

Well, I happened to have the privilege of
being chairman at the meeting when Mr.
Harris unqualifiedly disputed that assertion.
Now we come to Mr. Diefenbaker, and I
got this report of that same meeting from
the Canadian Press. This is from the Winnipeg Free Press, and while I believe that
paper is more or less a Liberal publication,
May I quote from another Canadian Press
I do not think it would unduly expand the report in the Ottawa Journal of June 4, 1957,
promises of Mr. Diefenbaker. This is dated referring to a speech Mr. Diefenbaker made
April 25, and it says:
in Kentville, Nova Scotia:
Mr. Diefenbaker pledged to work out new taxsharing arrangements with the provinces which
would strengthen Canada's federal system and
give provinces and municipalities the funds to
carry their responsibilities.

Where are they going to get it? Nowhere
but out of the revenues of Canada. The
report continues:
He said a Conservative Government, if elected,
would immediately call a federal-provincial conference to settle existing problems.
The federal
system was threatened by "the centralization complex of the St. Laurent Government" and a healthy
balance of revenues between federal and provincial governments must be assured.

Honourable senators, there is no question
about what that means.
I have another quotation from a speech
made in St. Stephen, New Brunswick, on
May 3, 1957. This is from a Canadian Press
report in the Halifax Chronicle Herald of
May 4, 1957.

In Kentville too, Mr. Diefenbaker said the Canadian people have been fooled for a long time by
Liberal promises. He pledged special adjustment
grants to equalize the economic positions of all the
provinces if a Conservative Government is elected
June 10.

I will give you only one more news item:
This one is dated Three Rivers, P.Q., June 4,
and appeared in the Montreal Gazette. It
says:

Mr. Diefenbaker told the audience that one of
the main planks of the Conservative platform was
the preservation
of provincial and municipal
autonomy.
The Conservative party will restore the true
meaning of the British North America Act which
guarantees the provinces freedom to carry out
various spheres of activity allotted them under the
constitution.
We will not only make sure that the Constitution is respected but we will also make sure that
the provinces and the municipalities have sufficient
money to do the job they are supposed to do.

NOVEMBER 14, 1957
Now, honourable senators, you may not
think it, but there is some method in my
madness, in the way in which I am developing my remarks. First, I have indicated to
you the known costs that are going to be
incurred, then the inevitable costs, and lastly
the problematie costs.
There is soon to be a meeting of the
premiers of the provinces with the federal
Government, at which the rights under the
Constitution are going to be restored; principles that have not been recognized are
going to be recognized; and out of that meeting will come peace, harmony and more
money for everybody. I do not know how
much this new deal with the provinces is
going to cost. Mr. Pickersgill bas estimated
-and I saw his speech reported with approval in the Globe and Mail as being one
of the best-that on the basis of the $100
million demanded by Frost, and on the basis
of the present Harris formula, the total cost
of the new deal with the provinces would
be $295 million. But the Harris formula is
going to be kicked out; that is not good
enough. So, the cost will be $295 million,
plus as much more as your imagination and
mine, and our senses, will permit us to
estimate.
I have not had the time, but I think somebody should take the time, to put together
all these items that are involved in new
legislation being introduced-items such as
the harnessing of the tides of the Bay of
Fundy, and the building of the Saskatchewan
River dam, and all the other prospective
forms of assistance-and figure out how much
the total cost is going to be.
I have before me some very interesting
newspaper clippings. For instance, in last
night's Ottawa Journal there were big headlines-and they also appeared in this
morning's Montreal and Toronto papersabout the Speech from the Throne at the
opening of the Quebec Legislature. Mr.
Duplessis has seen to it that prior to this
conference a demand is made for more
money for the province of Quebec.
Honourable senators, in a few minutes I
will come back to this topic, but at the
moment I will leave it, to refer to a speech
made by Mr. Balcer, the Solicitor General. I
shall come back to complete this picture of
Mr. Duplessis and the Speech from the Throne
in the Quebec Legislature, and Mr. Frost
sitting on a platforr in Massey Hall, and then
these two gentlemen coming to this chamber
or somewhere nearby to put forward their
cases, and afterwards going back for a future
election in each of these two great provinces.
This brings me to the question which has
given me the most concern. It might well be

said: "Why are you not patient? Rome was
not built in a day. We have been in office
only a few months, while you Liberals were
here for 22 years. How can you expect us to
do all of these things right away?"
I agree with that statement 100 per cent.
In reply, as far as I, as a senator in this
country, am permitted to reply, I would say:
"You are quite right. If you want more time
to carry out this policy and then go to the
country on an appeal after you have shown
both sides of the ledger, we are all for it".
But, honourable senators, we are hearing
some strange rumours these days; indeed,
some of the things we are hearing are probably more than rumours. We hear it said,
and it is almost taken for granted, that there
is going to be an election; the only speculation is, will the election be before or at the
conclusion of another session? I say that
raises some very important constitutional and
political questions.
I am sorry, but I must again disagree with
my honourable friend from Shelburne (Hon.
Mr. Robertson). He referred to the address
in this house by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) in which he told us
where we got off at. My honourable friend
from Shelburne, out of the goodness of his
heart, undertook to smooth al that out and
gave reasons for it, which I cannot accept.
In effect my honourable friend said, "Well,
Senator Haig has been Leader of the Opposition for so long that he has forgotten where
he now is, and therefore he made this faux
pas." Let me say to this house, there is no
man in the Government of Canada who more
fully appreciates, or is more aware of, where
he is than my honourable friend the Leader
of the Government. I say further, no man
is more entitled than he to be where he is,
as long as the present Government is in
power.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Farris: When Her Majesty the
Queen appeared in this house, on her right
stood the Right Honourable Mr. Diefenbaker,
and on her left stood the Honourable Leader
of the Conservative party in this bouse. We
were proud of our colleague. He appeared
then as a co-representative of the Parliament
of Canada, a co-leader of the great Conservative party. Now, can my honourable
friend from Shelburne tell me that in those
circumstances the Leader of the Government
in this house does not know what he is talking about? I cannot agree with my friend
from Shelburne. I have more respect for
the Leader of the Government.
Let me read the words of the leader as
quoted by the member from Shelburne, at

in keeping on and implementing its promises,
and not only the one to spread the seeds
around so freely, but also the promise to
husband the seeds and make sure that no
seeds will be squandered, although there are
lots there to spread around.
The Ottawa Journal continues:
Speaking to more than 1,000 delegates to the
annual convention of the party's Ontario body,
Mr. Balcer indicated that a major effort to expand
house membership would be made in Quebec.

Now, that speech was made on the 5th of
November. And yesterday, at the opening
of the Quebec Legislature, the Speech from
the Throne forecast that the premier of that
province, the Honourable Mr. Duplessis,
would be demanding more money for his
province from the dominion. Does anyone
think the Conservatives can win their 40
seats in Quebec unless they play ball with
Duplessis?
Well, honourable senators, I put that question to you. There are senators in this house
who know the answer to that better than I
do. But my guess is that the synchronizing
of the two things-the indication by the Honourable Mr. Balcer, the member for Three
Rivers, Quebec, that a major effort to elect
additional Conservatives would be made in
Quebec, and the Honourable Mr. Duplessis'
Speech from the Throne-shows where the
Treasury of Canada is going to get off in
regard to the province of Quebec if we have
an election now. This must be coupled with
what I have already said about the province
of Ontario, and Premier Frost at Massey Hall.
I think this poses a serious constitutional
problem. I shall not discuss it as a problem
for the Governor General. I remind honourable senators that the British North America
Act, section 50, provides that the Parliament
of Canada shall continue after a general election for five years unless it is sooner dissolved by the Governor General. That section
does not mean, honourable senators, that the
Governor General can capriciously, from some
whim or notion of his own, decide whether
or not there shall be a general election. But
the decison when the next election shall be
held will be made by the Governor General
on its merits. I make no prediction as to
when, or upon what grounds. I have the
utmost confidence in the great man who has
held the office of Governor General for a
number of years, and I compliment the
present Government on having extended his
term of office another year.
This, perhaps, is not the time nor the place
for me to presume to lay down the law on
what seems to me to be the constitutional
problem before the Government. But may I
say that, so far as I have been able to ascertain from law and precedent, Mr. Diefenbaker

should not be granted dissolution before he
has been defeated in the house. I concede,
of course, that, should he come before Parliament with some important problem on
which there is a difference between the two
major parties, and the issue is fought out,
he would be entitled to dissolution. But I
know of no instance wherein a Prime Minister, presenting legislation requiring expenditures of public money, and not being
defeated, has asked for dissolution within a
year of the previous general election.
I have not had time to study the matter,
and I am not presuming to spread my wings
in the realm of constitutional law. I am a
lawyer of sorts, and I took the trouble to
look at Dr. Eugene Forsey's book on the
dissolution of Parliament, which was written
as a result of the controversy between Lord
Byng and Mr. Mackenzie King in 1926. I do
not agree with the conclusions at which Dr.
Forsey arrives with regard to that issue, but
I have a great deal of confidence in and
respect for him, and I am satisfied that in
his book he has carefully and accurately
recorded all instances of problems of dissolution which have arisen in Canada, in Great
Britain, and in other Empire countries. I repeat that, so far as my search went, I was
unable to find any precedent for a situation
in which a Prime Minister, in office less than
a year after a general election, and not having been defeated, assumed the right to go
to the Governor General and demand an
election, and when asked for what purpose,
replied, "Because I do not like the complexion of the support I am getting now; I
want all my supporters to be good Progressive Conservatives".
One thing more. Two or three weeks ago
I read an editorial which, I am almost sure
-my Montreal friends may correct me if I
am wrong-appeared in the Gazette. It was
to the effect that Mr. Mackenzie King solved,
in 1926, the problem of the right to dissolution.
This pronouncement indicates that the Gazette
is a little worried about the question, and
finds it necessary to boost editorially the
case for the right to dissolution. But what
the article really proves is that there is no
comparison between the present situationassuming that Mr. Diefenbaker should go to
His Excellency and ask for dissolution without having been defeated-and the events of
31 years ago. What happened then? Mr.
King, after the previous election, came back,
not with the largest group but with the
largest measure of support in the House of
Commons, and for some months continued
in office. He was then defeated. He asked
for dissolution, but it was refused. I could

provinces in recent years.
New ground was broken early this year,
in a field hitherto considered to be one of
provincial responsibîlity, when the former
Government announced ifs decision to assist
in the development of cheaper power in the
Maritimes, using coal as the source of
thermal power. This was a most encouraging
step, and particularly in an area where the

It is haped that the importance af the proposais of the former Government, with whatever ninor amendments were announced
today, will not become lost in the present
shuffie to saivage the Beechwood Hydro project in New Brunswick. Many qualifled

Honourable senators, this house has already
approved some of the legisiation wbhh was
forecast in the Speech from. the Throne, for
increasing the rates of pensions and praviding
interest-free advances for the western grain
grawers. These are relatively simple measuires for a new Government ta bring iorward.
These are measures of immediate popuiarity
to those who will receive their share af the
taxpayers' money and, of course, a new
Goverunent, which may cansider itself on
the eve of another election, above ail things
desires ta be as popular as possible.
What many Canadians are expecting from
a Government that merits their support is
the clevelopment of imaginative and effective
policies providing for a betterment af opportuxiity for ail primary praducers-whether
they work in the fields, in the mines, in the

forests or on the sea-so that they may 'have
a more satisfactary and secure standard of
living. The work of these people is the
source of ail weaith, and their production
must be kept at a high level in order that
their fellaw Canadians may continue to
prosper.
Canadians were told by the Conservative
party during the iast Parliament, and certainly in most emphatic terms during the
election campaign, that mast of the economic
ilis of Canada were directly due ta the pursuance of a tight money policy by the Bank
of Canada, with the approvai of the Government. Hard-pressed municipalities, the smal
businessman, the potential hameowner, the
lumber operators and ail other classes in the
country were advised that this policy would
be quickiy changed with a change ai
Governmnent.
Weil, I am informed that ta make such a
change requires oniy a scratch ai a pen i
order ta abtain a more plentiful supply of
credit together with iower interest rates.
That simple step has not been taken.

Hon. Mr. Smith: Nat at all. In fact, we
flnd there bas been a substantial increase in
interest rates since the new Government took
office, indicating a further tightening ai the
money supply. I am sure the housebuiiding

greatiy disappointed ta iearn that credif is
even tighter and interest rates higher. They
must certainiy have been disappointed ta
learn ai the recent increase in interest rates
supplied by the Central Mortgage and Hausing Corporation, under sections 16 and 17 ai
the act. The diverting of $150 million for
housing by the Gavernmnent is not providing
additionai credit, and the resuits ai that
feebie effort have been disappainting. Some
attention shouid be given ta the views now
held by the Chairman ai the Board af the
Canadian Bank ai Commerce, wha was
reported in recent weeks as saying that the
time for fear ai inflation had passed.
It is indeed unfortunate that the judgment
of those responsible for holding ta a tightmoney policy Is s0 clouded by the bogy ai
inflation that is disappearing aver the horizon. They appear ta be blinded by the compiexities af administerlng national aifairs,
with the resuit that they are unable ta see
the rapidly changing Canadian ecanamy.

and cannot continue to develop the oil and
gas industry under present circumstances.
The pulp and paper market is shrinking in
relation to its present capacity, and further
expansion in this uncertain situation is questionable. The automobile industry, with its
many subsidiary and far-reaching supply industries, is facing sales difficulties. The lumber industry has not for many years been
faced with such marketing problems and had
so many unemployed woods workers. The
fishing industry is at its lowest point in many
years, with market development falling far
behind production and most companies in
the business operating at a loss.
Isn't it time to do something about the
tight money situation, especially in the Atlantic region of Canada, where there are no
scarcities of labour and materials such as
existed a short time ago in a few sections of
the country and which would be responsible
for additional inflationary pressures?
Isn't it time now to prime the carburetor
of the Canadian economy?
I am sure the present Government is aware
of the views of the Conservative Premier of
New Brunswick who, at a public session of
the meeting of the Atlantic Premiers in
Charlottetown in September this year, referred to the tight-money policy. At this
meeting he declared that the tight-money
policy had not been successful in checking
the rising prices. He also said:

There is growing evidence across this country
that the need for the tight money policy applied
by the Bank of Canada with the support of the
federal Government one year ago has run its
course and that, if the monetary brakes are not
soon released, Canada will move into a difficult
winter.

A new government cannot be expected to
do everything at once. Supporters of the
opposition parties in the Houses of Parliament have undertaken to provide every
opportunity for the Government to reveal its
plans and policies in a reasonable length of
time. But may I suggest that the present
economic situation in Canada, and in the
Atlantic provinces particularly, calls for
emergency action, with unemployment rising

has never been felt, and from whence littIe,
if any, contribution has been made in the past
to the pressures of inflation. The people
of that part of Canada are surely not unaware
that a policy which allows the extension of
credit to a British firm for the purchase of
its greatest industry should not permit a
situation to continue in which governments,
both municipal and provincial, small businesses and individuals are restricted as to
the amounts which they would reasonably
be expected to borrow and, owing to the
scarcity of credit, be obliged to pay almost
prohibitive rates of interest.
There are other fields in which the people
of the Maritimes expect government action
to be taken at once and are awaiting with
great interest the immediate implementation
of those campaign promises which appear
to have been of great influence on the result
of the last election.
The announcement that has been made with
regard to subventions on coal used in thermal
power plants is far short of the commitments
made by the present Prime Minister to assist
in the cost of transporting coal to points
within the Maritime provinces. As a matter
of fact, the estimated total of this proposal is
merely one-eighth of the assistance promised,
since at present 400,000 tons of coal are used
for thermal power purposes, compared with
a total use of coal in the Atlantic provinces
of about 3 million tons.
These proposals are less than the warmedover proposals of the former Government.
And what do these proposals mean in terms
of dollar-wide assistance?
It has been announced that the additional
subvention will equalize the cost of Nova
Scotia coal used in thermal power plants
in the Maritimes with the cost of American
coal used in power plants in Ontario. Since
this difference in cost will vary with the
B.T.U. content of the coal used, the additional amount of subvention will therefore
vary from plant to plant. But I believe the
meagreness of the assistance can be illustrated
when I tell you that I have been informed
that in some presently established thermal
power plants-for example, in Amherstthe additional subvention will be something
less than $1.10 per ton. The users of power
and the coal-mining industry must always be
reminding themselves of the pledge of the
Prime Minister made in New Glasgow on
April 30, when he said:
There will be subventions for coal in these
provinces, according to your request and to the
demands of the people.

To deal with this matter in the manner
promised requires no further consideration
than was given before the present policy was
announced a few weeks ago.

The people of Canada have heard and read
so much concerning the wheat marketing
problems of the west that perhaps they have
not yet been generally made aware of problems associated with the marketing of other
products, inasmuch as some of these problems are of more or less recent origin.
I wonder if the people of Canada-or even
their present Government-are aware of the
depressed state of the lumber and pulpwood
market? I wonder whether they are aware
of the marketing difficulties of the fisheries
industry?
The quickest way for this Government to
have indicated that it meant business when
it went up and down the Maritime provinces
flourishing its so-called National Development Policy, would have been to have met
the proposal of the British Government for
free trade with enthusiasm rather than with
the shocked silence of Canada's Minister of
Finance. This could have been the first step
in the development of a much wider freetrade area to include the United States and
other countries. No greater market opportunities could have been presented to the
lumber industry and to the fishing industry
of the Atlantic provinces. By the latter, such
a policy would have been hailed as a saviour
of the industry. At the present time an
important part of our fish exports have to
meet a moderate tariff barrier, and only a
Presidential veto has prevented that barrier
from being substantially raised in recent
years.
Should the trade policies of this Government develop in a direction opposite to that
of free trade the people will be made conscious, in a very painful way, of the difference between Conservative and Liberal
thinking concerning this subject; and no
amount of debate on other issues will prevent them from letting the Government know
in an effective way which party is to be
trusted with their confidence in the future.
It has been said and written that those
who point out the facts in connection with
present economic conditions are to be considered gloom spreaders, and that they do a
disservice to the people they represent. May
I submit that no greater contribution to the
present lack of confidence in the immediate
future of this country is possible than is at
present being made by the Government of
the country in failing to let the people know
just what they intend to do about the
economic ills which have continued to grow
day by day since the Government took office.
There is little doubt in anyone's mind
about the long-term future of this country,
having in mind her immense resources,
material and human. Her place in Destiny
is a high place, but one must express regret

INTERNATIONAL TRADE
DESIRABILITY OF ENLARGING CANADA'S
TRADING AREA

Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson rose in
accordance with the following notice:
That he will draw the attention of the Senate
to the desirability of Canada following the example
of other nations of the Western world in seeking
to enlarge her trading area to those countries
whose governments are prepared to wholeheartedly
co-operate in achieving the maximum economic
benefits to all concerned, as a means to:
(1) Combating inflation, reducing cost of living,
reducing costs of production, and thereby increasing the marketing opportunities for the products
of our primary and secondary industries.
(2) Providing at long last an opportunity for the
so-callel "Have Not" areas of Canada to attain
a degree of economic development comparable to
that presently enjoyed by the "Have" areas.

He said: Honourable senators, I welcome
the opportunity to draw the attention of the
Senate to a matter in which, for a considerable period, I have had a very active interest.
I do so not because I possess any special
knowledge of the subject, but because I

SENATE
believe it is one which is of vital importance
to Canada; and I think this is a proper
theatre in which to bring it up for consideration, since honourable senators not only
represent all parts of Canada and all interests
in Canada, but many of them also have a
very active interest in the subject and are
well informed on matters pertaining thereto.
I want to suggest that Canada needs a
new trade policy to enable her increased
production to find adequate export markets.
Surplus production is already beginning to
appear, and changing conditions at home and
abroad are presenting entirely new problems.
I believe our present policies are hopelessly
out of date.
I would remind honourable senators that
85 to 95 per cent of Canada's export trade,
with which we pay our bills, is comprised of
the products of our farms, forests, fisheries
and mines. Our secondary industries are,
generally speaking, such high-cost producers
that they cannot successfully export, and
therefore they contribute very little to the
total of our export trade.
Canada's exports are sold in highly competitive markets, which may be even more
highly competitive in the future; therefore,
the cost of production is vital to success. Cost
of living is steadily mounting, bringing new
demands by labour for higher wages, both
in export industries and in the great transportation industries as well. Such increases,
if, as and when granted, may further affect
our costs.
A new and serious challenge may well
come from a new quarter. Soviet Russia,
whose area is three times ours, and presumably has three times our resources,
may become, sooner or later, a very
serious competitor. She has always been a
competitor in forest products, and may be
more so in the future. Recently she has
offered aluminum in London markets at less
than world prices. In the course of time
she will probably produce anything we do,
and she is in a position to sell it at whatever
price she sees fit.
Entirely new conditions are arising in
many of our export markets. The United
Kingdom and Western Europe are moving
to create a huge trading area, comprising
285 millions of people; they intend, over a
period of from 12 to 15 years, to remove the
existing restrictions on the free flow of
trade until it becomes one entire trading
area, as free of trading restrictions as circumstances may make possible.
Their
object is to create an area approximating or
exceeding that of the United States of
America, with the advantage of cheaper
costs for their own consumers, and to
increase their ability to compete in world

markets. What effect it may have on our
export markets is problematical, but while
the opportunity to sell may be greater
because of increased volume, prices obtainable may well be lower.
Our other major market is the United
States. She is, of course, by far our best
customer, yet there are unsatisfactory
features in respect to our markets there. In
recent years governments of both political
parties have been co-operative and kindly
disposed. Her tremendous purchasing power
and rapidly growing population offer a
favourable opportunity for us as a market
for what we have to sell; yet, because of
her Constitution, members of Congress
responsible to pressure from their constituency interests can create situations leading to great uncertainty. Isolationist elements
in Congress are quick to seize on anything
that will aid them in their fight for increased
restriction on imports. Recently the Government of Canada has embarked on a largely
advertised program of diverting $600 million
of our imports from the United States to
the United Kingdom. There are rumours
that some of our secondary industries are
seeking higher tariffs against United States
imports. What may become of both of these
projects remains to be seen, but I shall be
surprised if it has escaped the notice of
protectionist interests in Congress, particularly as they too are currently suffering
from the recession.
Honourable senators, apparently as matters
now stand the Western world is to be divided
into three main trading areas-the United
Kingdom and Western Europe, with 285 millions of people; the United States, with 175
millions, and Canada, with 17 millions.
Frankly, I do not like the look of it-it looks
too much as if we might find ourselves out on
a limb.
I had always hoped that our problems in
a larger way in respect to trade would be
solved by the implementation of Article 2
of the North Atlantic Treaty, which called
for economic co-operation among its members,
Canada and the United States included. I
would remind honourable senators that
Article 2 is supposed to have been placed in
the North Atlantic Treaty not by Canada, but
at her insistence, or at least with ber active cooperation. We felt, and it was a view shared
by all political parties in Canada, that this
new organization which we were entering,
and in which we were assuming tremendous
obligations, should give serious consideration
to economic as well as military co-operation,
as a basis for the solidifying of the organization itself.

NOVEMBER 19, 1957

About four years ago various members of
the Canadian Parliament, representing all
four political parties, formed an organization
known as the Canadian NATO Parliamentary
Association. I do not know that they always
agreed in respect to details, but they had one
common idea in view. They felt that, as the,
fifteen countries of NATO had bound themselves together for each other's defence for a
period which in effect was for perpetuity,
it was a most natural area in which to find
the element of inter-dependence which existed
between them and that this made it a most
likely area in which to accomplish economic
co-operation.
These members of the Canadian Parliament felt that way, and in due course they
met, formed an organization and communicated with like-minded members of all the
other fourteen partners of NATO. They
found a responsive cord in each country, and
three years ago the Canadian delegation, along
with delegations from the other fourteen
members of NATO, met in Paris to consider
various matters of mutual interest in this
connection with NATO, and the one common
object was the possibilities of increased economic .co-operation. There were distinguished
representatives at that gathering, including
no less a personage than the present Prime
Minister of Canada, who led the Conservative
delegation. The Minister of Trade and Commerce was not on that particular delegation
but he was a very active member of the
committee. The present Minister of Fisheries
attended the meeting, the present Secretary
of State, and during the week's negotiations
which took place in Paris there was a pretty
definite and common idea that in some way or
other something of mutual interest in economic co-operation might exist among the
various members of the fifteen countries of
NATO.
By the time the next meeting was held,
in the following year, there was still the
underlying feeling in respect to economic cooperation, but I sensed a very marked difference of viewpoint. One felt there was,
perhaps, envy of the prosperity of the North
American continent, and while they would
desire to co-operate in every way, shape and
form there seemed to be, first on the part
of the members of the Western European
group, a desire to get together in some sort
of a comon trading area which would approximate the area of the United States.
Originally Britain was not considered as
likely to be interested. In due course, as
honourable senators know, that has taken
on a very great importance, and the United
Kingdom is seriously entering into the arrangement. It includes, I think, all but one
of the European partners of NATO, together
96702-152

with other countries that are not members
of NATO, such as Sweden and some other
countries which, though not actually members
of NATO, are very closely associated.
What I mean to indicate by that, honourable
senators, is that I should have thought cooperation would have been easiest among
those fifteen countries that have so much in
common, and which bound themselves
together for mutual interest. I think it will
come inevitably, but at the present moment
it seems that it will come on a piecemeal
basis. In view of the dramatic events of
recent weeks, it may be that at the meeting
of the heads of states of the fifteen countries
in Paris early in December some proposals
may be made along the lines of economic
co-operation which I, of course, know nothing
of, but there is nothing in the newspapers to
indicate that those matters will be considered.
It would appear that the meeting will be confined, as other meetings have been in the
past, almost exclusively to military co-operation, plus the new co-operation in scientific
matters.
Perhaps, as I said, the December conference of heads of the NATO states will do
something about this phase of co-operation,
but I have my doubts. Certainly, if it does not,
we should move to prevent ourselves from
being isolated.
Recently the United Kingdom made Canada
a proposal that should be seriously considered. The details have never been made public, but, as I understood them, the essence
was that while, on one hand, the United
Kingdom would join Western Europe in a
large trading area, on the other hand she
offered to enter into much the same arrangement with Canada. The proposal met with
mixed reception, and understandably so. On
the one hand many felt that it had distinct
possibilities, while others were fearful of the
repercussions it might have on our north
and south trade with the United States. For
my part I think there is a fair chance to
meet both viewpoints. I believe we should
seriously explore the United Kingdom proposals, but on this condition: that we at the
same time seek to enter into a similar arrangement with the United States of America.
To me we would form a trading area of 250
million people.
If this were done we would be entering
into agreement with the United Kingdom on
the one hand, and the United States on the
other, to progressively remove trade restrictions over a period of 12 to 15 years, subject
to whatever conditions might be mutually
agreed to, to prevent undue dislocation of
existing conditions. What, then, are the probable effects on the Canadian economy?

SENATE
Let us take first the position of the producers of products based on the resources of
our farms, fisheries, forests and mines. I can
see nothing but advantage to them. They
would have preferred markets, free from
passing threats and day-to-day worries. This
would undoubtedly be a definite advantage.
And the lower costs of production from lower
costs of living would improve profit margins.
The success of our primary producers would
bring great additional benefits to our transportation and service industries, again with
the added advantages of lower costs of living.
However, because of existing circumstances
it may well be that our secondary industries,
largely located in Ontario and Quebec, would
be the greatest beneficiaries of such a change
in policy. At the present time they are lowvolume, high-cost producers, and their
markets are almost entirely confined to
Canada's 17 million people. Their production
costs are so high that they can exist only by
the aid of tariff protection and by charging
the Canadian consumer prices much higher
than those of the United States, their greatest
competitor. These higher selling prices probably vary in amount, but a year ago a
prominent Canadian, Mr. H. R. MacMillan,
of Vancouver, in a speech at Toronto, gave
some information on this point. He gave
figures to indicate that eight typical items in
the pulp mill construction in British Columbia
cost on the average about 30 per cent more
than in the Northwestern States. A list of
14 items of consumer goods averages even
higher than this figure. Despite these prices
the secondary industries are finding it difficult to meet outside competition, and are
organizing to ask for additional tariff protection. They will probably meet even keener
competition in the future, because the very
essence of the arrangements between the
United Kingdom and Western Europe is to
enlarge their areas so that they will have
the advantage of mass production. But there
is bound to be great opposition in Canada to
any attempts to raise tariffs. The basic difficulty of our manufacturers is that they have
a small market of only 17 million people,
whereas European countries, such as Western
Germany, Britain and France, each with
about 50 million people, are moving into
larger trading areas to solve their production
cost problems. Arrangements with both the
United States and the United Kingdom for
progressive removal of trade restrictions offer
the se;ondary industries of Canada an opportunity to gradually change from low-volume,
high-cost producers to high-volume, low-cost
producers. They have cheap power, strategic
locations, and, given the volume market,
should successfully compete with any industries elsewhere on the continent. This change
of policy may afford them an opportunity to

get out of the increasing difficulties with
which they now seem to be faced and which,
I believe, they will have to meet on an everincreasing scale in the future.
I want now to say a word with reference
to the so-called "have-not" areas in Canada.
But I am going to confine myself specifically
and entirely to the province of Nova Scotia,
which I know best and of which, of course, I
am one of the representatives. I would hope
that honourable senators from other areas
whose populations are not as prosperous as
those of some other provinces may rise to
assess the impact on their respective communities of such a policy as I am suggesting.
I read an editorial in the Toronto Globe and
Mail of Saturday last which clearly and succinctly states the exact situation. The writer
is referring particularly to the Maritimes,
and I adopt his remarks as illustrative of
the position of Nova Scotia:
For generations they have been lagging behind
the rest of Canada in progress and in prosperity:
last year, for instance, Nova Scotia's per caita
income was $1,000 and New Brunswick's $923
against a national average of $1,350.

I take no exception to that statement,
though I would qualify it a little in one
respect. I should like to correct the impression, if such impression exists, that in
recent years the Maritimes-and I speak
especially of Nova Scotia, for I know that
New Brunswick is ably represented by
eloquent speakers and can look after itself
-have
not made important advances. In
fact there has been a very great degree of
progress. Because of my legislative duties,
in the last ten or twelve years I have not
lived in the province of Nova Scotia as continuously as I did before. But every time
I go back home I am amazed at the progress
which has taken place in some areas. Generally speaking, our primary producers have
shared in the general prosperity, with, as
well, some of the handicaps experienced by
primary producers in other parts of Canada.
The steel industry in Cape Breton and eastern Nova Scotia bas been successful. The
coal industry, perhaps, is not in quite so
happy a position.
The city of Halifax bas shown tremendous
development, spurred by increased ocean
shipping, sizeable defence expenditures and
the growth of service industries. Anyone
who has not visited Halifax for 10 years
would hardly believe the development that
has taken place. I make this statement to
help correct any impression that Nova
Scotia has not enjoyed some of the great
prosperity enjoyed by Canada over the past
10 years. Perhaps the difficulty is relative.
The people of Nova Sceotia feel that the
general tide of capital which has flown into

NOVEMBER 19, 1957
Canada by billions of dollars in recent years
has almost entirely passed them by. While
they welcome the money that has come from
increased defence expenditures, they feel
the time might come when these expenditures
will be discontinued. They are essentially
a proud people and they feel Nova Scotia is
not enjoying the same degree of prosperity
that is being enjoyed by other parts of
Canada, and they want something to be done
about it.
This is nothing new, of course, and
this relative position I have referred to
has existed for a long time and bas
been a lively political issue. Governments
have been blamed for sins of commission or
omission, but my own judgment, based on
some years of experience, is that this practice
of blaming governments has been overemphasized.
Then there has been a tendency to unfairly
criticize Nova Scotians themselves. As an
illustration of this tendency I would read
further from the same editorial:
Previous dominion Governments have treated this
condition with handouts; possibly alleviating it,
certainly perpetuating it, and encouraging a passive,
pessimistic frame of mind among the recipients.

I do not believe that statement is accurate,
that there is a passive or pessimistic frame of
mind among the people of Nova Scotia. They
feel they are entitled to a larger share of the
world's goods and the general prosperity
that has been flowing into Canada, and
many of them cannot understand why something is not done about it. Based on my
observations, particularly as a member of the
former Government for eight years, I would
say that federal Governments have always
been disposed to rendering any possible
assistance they could. This statement applies
to the colleagues of the Government of
which I was a member, and I think it applies
to the present Government. There has been
no lack of good will. The difficulty has
always been to decide upon the most practical thing to do under the circumstances. The
editorial from which I have read reflects on
Nova Scotians and suggests they themselves
should do something to improve their position. Human nature being what it is, I suppose people possess certain qualities in
varying degrees, but in my judgment the
Nova Scotia businessman is just as able, farsighted and energetic as any businessman in
Canada, and I might venture to say even in
larger territories.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: It may be that on the
average the Nova Scotia businessman is even
superior, for he has to do business in a harder
school. Certainly the Nova Scotia businessman

does not lack the ability to size up a good
business opportunity.
Honourable senators, during the long period
of years from Confederation to the present
time there has not been great economic and
industrial growth in Nova Scotia. The hard-

headed businessmen who have run the industries there, which rely on the products of
natural resources-and these are outside the
major industries of Canada-have been successful and have accumulated a considerable
amount of capital in the process. If they
had believed there were further opportunities
in the industrial growth of Nova Scotia,
having as a primary objective the selling of
goods in the markets of Canada, they would
have seized upon those opportunities long ago.
Their test has always been that of any good
businessman, the probability of profitable
markets. Wherever they have seen an opportunity for profitable markets they have
taken advantage of it. They did not embark
on anything which they did not feel would
be a profitable venture.
It is difficult to generalize, but I feel that
the production and transportation costs that
have to be met by businessmen in Nova
Scotia, as compared with those that have to be
met by businessmen in the densely populated
area of the St. Lawrence valley in central
Canada, are such that they make the production in Nova Scotia of consumer goods for the
Canadian market very difficult. There have
been exceptions, of course, as far as Nova
Scotia is concerned; but, generally speaking,
Nova Scotia is too far away from the centre
of Canada's population. The various branches
of secondary industries which have come into
Canada during the last quarter-century have
for the most part gone to Ontario and Quebec
-really
to a geographical area that is
bounded by the city of Quebec on the east
and perhaps by Sault Ste. Marie on the west.
Because of transportation facilities, and so on,
industries have a tendency to congregate. I
think any area located far from those east and
west boundaries has a great difficulty in producing primarily for the market of 17 million
people located in Canada.
That has nothing to do with the acts of
the Government, or of grasping characteristics
of the provinces of Ontario and Quebec; it is
simply that the law of economics governs.
The United States itself is an illustration of
that fact. Farther west, of course, is an area
of great natural resources, and geographical
distance provides them with a certain protection, so that to a certain extent the secondary
industry may prosper. On the other hand,
Nova Scotia is making a very concerted
effort on its own behalf, and anything I say
should not be taken to mean that I am discouraging the idea. In Nova Scotia, as well

SENATE
as in the other Maritime provinces, there is
a group of active energetic businessmen,
forming the Atlantic Provinces Economic
Council; they are enthusiastic, and give their
time and services to accomplishing something
along the lines of industrial development in
Nova Scotia. Provincial Governments have
organized themselves-that of Nova Scotia
prior to the one now in power did, as has
the present one,-to provide capital by way
of loans to any prospective manufacturer or
for any industrial operation in Nova Scotia,
and entered upon a very energetic campaign
of visiting various countries which might be
interested in our development.
Last, but not least, as honourable senators
know, very recently the federal Government
made a very generous offer in respect to
generation of electric power, to which my
honourable friend from Saint John-Albert
(Hon. Mr. Emerson) referred the other day.
While the details are not before us, it has
been intimated from Halifax that the project
is designed to give cheaper power to the
Maritime provinces, and in this case, in Nova
Scotia at least, it will not be for either
domestic or commercial users, but will be
concentrated entirely on providing very much
lower costs of power for industrial users. The
object is to reduce costs practically to the
present costs in the province of Ontario of
thermal power generated by imported American coal. This will effect a marked decrease
in costs for industrial users. When I say
this, I do not wish in any way to discourage
or to say anything that might interfere with
the energetic efforts of the businessmen of the
province of Nova Scotia, and the assistance
being rendered. Certainly they have made a
major effort to accomplish industrial development in the province with the idea of getting
a part or a share of the Canadian market.
Having said that, I come back to the
same viewpoint that I have always held in
regard to Nova Scotia. Since I was first
elected to the Legislature, in 1928, I have
not seen anything to change my mind in
respect to the position of that province. Yet
Nova Scotia suffers a major handicap by
reason of her distance from the larger centres
of Canada and is, so to speak, on the circumference. Her relative prosperity in the
old days was founded upon her maritime
position. In the Canada in which we live
today her maritime position presents no
advantages, but I have always hoped that
sooner or later her maritime position would
again be utilized. It is perhaps part and
parcel of my make-up to feel that way,
because I was brought up in a Maritime

household. My maternai grandfather came
to Nova Scotia over 100 years ago. Pounds,
shillings and pence were the currency in
those days, and I doubt if he had 100 pounds
to his name when he landed. Yet, within
fifteen years, without any favour or assistance
from anyone, he built up a fleet of oceangoing vessels which travelled around the
world. It was during that period that the
relative degree of prosperity in the Maritime
provinces was higher than in any other part
of British North America. It is therefore
naturally embedded in the minds of Nova
Scotians, or Maritimers, that somehow, somewhere they will again have the opportunity
to utilize to the full the asset of their maritime position. And the experience of 50
years has shown that it simply cannot be
done by living on the fringe.
Honourable senators, I feel that if there
were economic co-operation by the members
of NATO, and if Canada participated in it,
a trading area might be created as large as
the NATO countries. I do not think that is
feasible at the moment, although, as I said
before, I believe it will come. However, I
feel that we could enter into a long-term
trading arrangement with the United Kingdom, on the one hand, and with the United
States, on the other, and I see no reason
why we should not do so. It would place
the province of Nova Scotia virtually in the
centre of a trading area of over 250 million
people, and as a result the Maritimes would
have an opportunity to utilize their maritime
position as an asset, for their relative position would change and their trade expand.
I recall that the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), in speaking in
Antigonish, many more years ago than I
care to think of, said that "the present trading policies had taken the smell of the sea
from the nostrils of the Nova Scotians".
That was a picturesque way of describing
the exact situation; and the other day when
practically the last Canadian ship's registry
was transferred to Trinidad, I felt it was a
sort of end to the story. I do not blame the
Government at all for what bas been done,
for the attendant circumstances may have
made it necessary, but it drove us off the sea,
which had been our greatest source of wealth.
I am as convinced as I am that I am standing
here that it would be to the mutual advantage
of Canada if we entered into a long term trading relationship with the United Kingdom,
on the one hand, and with the United States,
on the other, and that this would provide a
fair opportunity of gradually getting back
the great advantages that our maritime position gave us in the years gone by.

NOVEMBER 19. 1957
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend 'a
question with regard to his final remark?
Does he in effect suggest that there should
be free trade between these three countries,
Great Britain, the United States and Canada?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
used the words "in effect". I have in mind
that while Great Britain is on the one hand
offering to go into a trading area with Western Europe, she is on the other hand offering
to make the same arrangement with Canada.
I am suggesting that we should consider the
offer from the United Kingdom, and at the
same time enter into the same arrangement
with the United States.
Hon. Mr. Euler: That is the answer to my
question.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: As to the details of the
arrangement, I understand that, particularly
with respect to the European countries, it
is hedged about by a great many qualifications, as indeed one would expect in an arrangement between countries which have
been fiercely nationalistie and for many years
have been at each other's throats. I say if
countries with that historical backgroundcountries varying from Luxembourg, with
300,000 people, to Western Germany, with
50 million-can drop their differences for the
common advantage of all, how much simpler
it is for three countries like Canada, the
United Kingdom and the United States, which
have so much in common, to enter into such
an arrangement.
Honourable senators, I leave these suggestions with you for your careful and, if
need be, your prayerful consideration.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Do I understand that my
friend is advocating that Canada and the
United States enter into an agreement for
free trade in our natural products, wheat,
livestock and lumber?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I said in everything.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would my honourable
friend make that proposal in spite of the fact
that the administration in the United States is
today doing nothing but conducting fire sales
on wheat, and would dump it in on us?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: We will mingle with
them to reform them.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Do you think that 17
million people can reform 175 million
people?

Hon. Mr. Robertson: If the conscience is
clear.
Hon. Mr. Smith (Queens-Shelburne): One
man did a great deal more than that.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I repeat, if the conscience is clear it can be done.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, may I take this opportunity of congratulating the honourable senator from
Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) on the
magnificent speech he has just delivered. He
said that any lack of prosperity in the province of Nova Scotia was not due to any lack
of progressiveness on the part of the people
of that province. Judging from the Nova
Scotians whom I know, I would say that is
a true statement. Nevertheless I believe that
if all the people of Nova Scotia had the
ability and courage of thought which the
honourable gentleman from Shelburne has
demonstrated in his speech tonight, that province would not be as backward as it is at
present.
The honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) asked the honourable
senator from Shelburne whether he was in
favour of free trade between the three great
trading divisions, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States. I thought my
friend hesitated a little too long in his answer to that question. It is true that free
trade measures would have to be introduced
slowly and carefully, so as not to disturb
unduly the present arrangements that have
grown up over a number of years under
protective conditions. I think the honourable
gentleman from Shelburne should have answered-and I answer for myself-with a
firm "Yes". I am in favour of free trade
over this great area, and I say it without
any hesitation whatsoever, subject of course
to a common-sense introduction of the
appropriate measures.
I come from a great manufacturing city,
Toronto, and I am convinced that were we
to sweep the border clean of tariffs, and
allow goods to pass freely between that city
and the populated country to the south, those
very people who talk protection most glibly
in my town would receive the greatest
benefit. Indeed, if we abolished the restrictions between ourselves and the people to
the south, the city of Toronto would become
another Chicago.
Now, nobody with any common sense
believes that we should make such changes
too rapidly. The honourable member from
Shelburne has suggested that we enter into
reciprocal agreements with United States and
the United Kingdom to bring about this

SENATE
change in the course of 10 or 15 years. May
I tell him, with my compliments, that I am
entirely in favour of such measures.
We in Canada, with our small population,
have endeavoured to make ourselves selfsufficient, but of course we have not done so.
We must sell our natural products abroad in
order to maintain the high standard of living
which we have enjoyed, not always, but in
the recent past. My memory goes back to the
time when Canada was a very poor country,
largely because of the protectionist philosophy
adopted by ourselves and our neighbours to
the south, which prevented the exporting of
our products. I recall that when I was a boy
on the farm we were unable to sell our sheep
and lambs, or our wheat and oats, across the
border because of a then recently adopted
restrictive policy of the United States. That
policy was a disaster not only for us but for
them. The maintenance of high tariffs has
been equally
disadvantageous to both
countries.
The prosperity of the United States has in
my judgment been due very largely, though
not entirely, to the free trade she has enjoyed
among her several states in a total population
which now numbers 175 million people,
stretching from our border at the 49th parallel
to the Gulf of Mexico. It is a very large
area, populated by a most progressive people,
who trade with absolute freedom among
themselves. Had we had the courage to make
some economic arrangement with the United
States-I have no desire to join that country
politically-to throw down our tariff walls
and so give our manufacturers a chance to
compete with the people of the United States
in their market, we would have been a much
bigger nation today. It is often argued that
we cannot let down our tariff walls while
others maintain theirs against us. The humble
thought I offer to honourable senators is this:
If the United States maintained the restrictions it has now imposed on its business
people, and we freed ourselves and allowed
our people to buy in the cheapest markets
and sell in the dearest, we would undersell
the Americans in foreign markets, we would
beat their heads off in foreign competition.
There are those who cannot see beyond their
own brick walls. They very honestly feel
that were tariffs reduced on the goods they
sell, while tariffs were maintained on the
things they buy, they could not compete in
our own market or abroad with other trading
countries. Such people think only of our
present trading conditions. A reduction in
price would follow a reduction in tariff; and
they see nothing but disaster as the result. If
they would consider the whole matter carefully they would appreciate that a reduction
in the tariff on the articles they make and
sell would be offset by a similar reduction on

the goods they buy. In that way they could
expect greater profits and faster expansion.
I know there is a very strong protectionist
feeling in the cities of Canada-not in the
rural areas but in the cities-but I speak
from a city viewpoint with, it is true, a rural
upbringing, and I am convinced that if what
the honourable senator frorn Shelburne has
told us tonight were actually put into effect
Canada would be a much greater country,
that if Canada took some leads in this respect
it would set an example probably to the whole
world. If the Western countries are to compete with the great Soviet Union, where there
is a free exchange of products among something like 200 million people, the West must
abolish the artificial restrictions of tariffs and
quotas and other means of discouraging trade
and adopt with regard to trade the same
principles that they adopt with regard to
transportation. At the present moment we are
spending millions of dollars to deepen, widen
and make more useful the canals of the St.
Lawrence River and the Great Lakes in order
that trade may be more free and cheaper, and
at the same time, illogically we have of our
own volition imposed tariffs that will make
trade less free and more costly.
When we become logical in that regard
and take every step that we know of to make
trade free and to facilitate it, make it less
costly and increase it in amount, the greater
will Canada grow and the better will be our
example to the other peoples of this world.
So, honourable senators, let me again congratulate my honourable friend from Shelburne. He has taken a courageous, a thoughtful and a very beneficial stand in the speech
he has just made, and I hope that it will be
widely read.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators, I
also come from a district which is very
heavily industrialized. When I was a member of the House of Commons I was sometimes called a high protectionist, which, of
course, I never was and am not today. But
I believe our market should not be free to
those who close their markets against us.
When I asked the question of the sponsor
of the discussion (Hon. Mr. Robertson)-who
has spoken so well, and whom I congratulate
was asking merely for purposes of
-I
clarification. I think we indeed understand
that what he suggested and recommended is
that there should be, in time, complete free
trade between Britain, the United States and
Canada. Now, in theory, free trade is sound,
but you could not possibly bring it into
effect in a very short period because there

would be such a dislocation of manufacturing
businesses in Canada that they simply would
not be able to survive.

Some years ago in my city a manufacturer
of shoes to whom I spoke about the matter
of tariffs between Canada and the United
States said to me: "If I could be sure that I
would have the American market permanently
I would welcome free trade between the
two countries. As it is now, with my small
production and the immense distances I have
to send my travelling salesmen, extending
two thousand miles to a small western Canadian market, my selling costs are very high.
If I could be assured of permanent free trade
with the United States I would have within
a distance of two hundred miles a market of
some 50 million people. "However," he said,
"I do not know"-and I think that is the
position of a good many Canadian manufacturers-"that any free trade agreement
with the United States would be permanent.
If one were made and the United States
found that it was not in its interest to keep
the contract, it would abrogate the contract
and our manufacturers would be left high
and dry after adapting themselves to that
large market." I think that was a fair
argument.
But my friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon.
Mr. Robeuck), who is a philosopher with
regard to free trade-and I have no quarrel
with him about that either-and my friend
from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson), said
that there should be an agreement for free
trade among the three countries, Canada,
Britain and the United States. I have no
desire that it should go any further than
that, but I venture to say that if free trade
did exist between these three countries it
would ultimately result in political union.

merce, presented the report of the committee
on Bill 28.

The report was read by the
follows:

Clerk as

The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the Bill (28) intituled:
"An Act to amend the War Veterans Allowance Act,
1952", have in obedience to the order of reference
of 13th November, 1957, examined the said bill,
and now report the same without any amendment.

The Hon.

the Speaker: Honourable sen-

ators, when shall this report be taken into
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I move that the report
be considered now.
The motion was agreed to.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the report be adopted?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I move that the report
be adopted now.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, before this report is adopted I want
once again to make a reference to clause 7.

First let me say that I hope the bill will be

passed today and given Royal Assent as soon
as possible, but I do think we should fully
realize what we are doing. Although I ap-

prove of the purpose of the bill I think its
provisions could be wider, and I have in mind
especially clause 7, relating to a veteran's
period of service in the United Kingdom during the First World War. This clause extends
the provisions of the act to not only those who
served in an actual theatre of war, during
World War I, but also to those who served
in the United Kingdom for a period of at least
365 days prior to November 12, 1918. It will

be seen that two groups of veterans who
served overseas in World War I come under
this clause: those who served in an actuai
theatre of war-say in France-and those
who served for at least 365 days in the
United Kingdom prior to November 12, 1918.
Those groups will receive the benefits under
the act. However, veterans who left Canada
but did not get to France, or who did not

stay in England for more than one year,
will not receive the benefits under the act.
Honourable senators, this means that a soldier who arrived in England on November
11, 1917 and stayed there until November 12,
1918 would be entitled to those benefitsand we were told this morning in committee
that conditions in England for members of
the Armed Forces who resided thére during
the last year of the First World War were
very favourable for them, that they lived
under very comfortable circumstances. Such
veterans, I repeat, can claim benefits under
the provisions of the act. But those who
volunteered in the early days of the war,
who left Canada in the fall of 1914 and
served in England throughout the winter of
1914-15, living under terrible conditions on
Salisbury Plain, but did not remain in
England for a year, cannot benefit under the
act.
I am sure some of us here will recall the
early days of the First World War and the
conditions under which our soldiers lived
on Salisbury Plain, so I do not need to
recount them. Many of them could not stay
in England for the year. Someone may say,
"Oh, yes, but they receive pensions".
Honourable senators, many of them do not
receive pensions. In order to qualify for a
pension they had to relate their condition
directly to army service. Anyone who served
in that war, or had relatives who served,
know how difficult it is to get military
records of the men who served.
It was brought to my attention when I was
reading the bill that, to be eligible for an
allowance, a soldier must have served in
England for a year immediately preceding
November 12, 1918. But, honourable senators,
in the next clause of the bill it will be observed that for all official purposes World
War I ended on August 31, 1921, almost three
years later. This means that under the provisions of this bill a man could have left Canada
after the war was over-that is, after November 11, 1918-arrived in England, gone to
France and, without having heard a shot fired
or seen any service whatsoever, spent Christmas day in Paris, suffering all the hardships
of Christmas Day in that city, and still claim
benefits under this bill; whereas, a man who
went to England in the early days of the
war, spent a winter on Salisbury Plain, and
then was returned to Canada, cannot claim
benefits.
Hon. Mr. Baird: Excuse me for interrupting
the honourable senator, but Paris was out of
bounds during those years.

NOVEMBER 20, 1957
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable
friend may know more about that than I do,
but with all respect I doubt that Paris was
out of bounds on Christmas day of 1918.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: If it was out of bounds,
it did not look like it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am told that it
certainly did not look as if it was out of
bounds, with the number of Canadian soldiers
who were there.
One hears it said that not many soldiers
left Canada after November 11, 1918, and
not many men went to France between that
date and Christmas of that year. That question was raised this morning in committee,
and it was stated that at least 14,000 Canadian
soldiers, maybe more, went to France in that
six-week period. And under the provisions
of this legislation a soldier who served in
France for even one day is entitled to benefit.
It matters not what he was doing there; the
mere fact that he was in France for at least
one day between the commencement of the
war and August 31, 1921, is sufficient to
qualify him to benefit under this legislation;
whereas a man such as the one whom the
honourable senator from NorthumberlandMiramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchill) referred to
the other day, a veteran who served for 11J
months in England and is now in a feeble
and helpless condition, cannot benefit.
Honourable senators, I refer to these matters not with a view to preventing passage
of this bill, for as already stated, I think we
should pass it today. However, I ask the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig) to bring the points I have raised
to the attention of the new minister. He
himself served in both World Wars, and he
is facing up to the veterans' problems with
a sympathetic understanding. I am sure some
features of the bill have not been brought
fully to his attention.
Hon. George S. White: Honourable senators,
may I say a word in answer to the remarks
made by the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)? The honourable senator was present in the Banking
and Commerce Committee this morning and
heard a thorough and exhaustive explanation
of the bill by the Deputy Minister of the
Department of Veterans Affairs, who pointed
out clearly that the actual wording of the act
describing the theatre of war in the First
World War is not being changed: England is
not classified as a theatre of war in World
War I. An exception has been made with
respect to veterans who served in both wars
and are classed for dual pension. All that is
being done under the section referred to by
the honourable Leader of the Opposition is

that the Government has decided the time
bas arrived when a further group of deserving
war veterans should be brought within the
benefits of the act of 1952. Every honourable
member who has served in the forces and who
is familiar with the legislation now on the
statute books can readily recall many instances in other acts where there are cut-off
dates, where there are restrictions, where
certain percentages apply, and other matters
of that nature.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
mentioned, both in the committee and in this
chamber, the unfortunate case, cited by the
honourable senator from NorthumberlandMiramichi (Hon. Mr. Burchil), of a veteran
who had served only 11j months and therefore would not be eligible for benefits under
this measure. If the condition of that veteran
is as the honourable senator described it,
surely before now he would have been
entitled to benefits under the Disabled Persons Act.
The honourable leader opposite also referred
to the fact that two dates-November 12,
1918, and August 31, 1921-are mentioned in
the legislation, but he now knows, from the
explanation given this morning, why those
dates are included. It may be true that some
veterans left England for France after November 11, 1918. However, I am sure the
honourable senator will agree that the number within this category, and who will be
qualified to receive an allowance under the
provisions of this bill, is very small; and I
suggest that no serious attention need be paid
to that particular representation.
It was my experience during the years I
sat in the other place that members of
Parliament who are war veterans, in dealing
with veterans affairs, have no regard to party
affiliations. It has always been the aim and
ambition of them al to do the very best they
can for their former comrades. While some
may contend that the bill is imperfect in that
it does not go far enough, that some deserving persons are excluded, and so forth, I
would point out that the amendments it contains will be of the greatest assistance to
many thousands of veterans or widows of
veterans. The figures which were mentioned
this morning indicate that the additional cost
to the treasury will be $9,061,000 a year,
and that at least 3,000 to 4,000 persons,
veterans as well as widows, will be brought
under the provisions by reason of their services in England; as will many ex-Imperials
and widows of ex-Imperials who could not
qualify hitherto under the 20-year residence
qualification.
I have no desire to comment on the veterans
legislation which was passed in the first
session of this year, but I would point out

SENATE

that the amendments contained in the bill
before us go a great deal farther to assist the
veterans than anything which was done
earlier in the year. At that time, although
an increase was granted to married veterans,
no provision was made for single men. Under
Bill 28 the residence period is shortened.
There are provisions for a new valuation of
the home of the veteran which may favourably affect his position in respect of the
means test. It is provided he may be absent
from Canada for six months. There is also
a provision for orphans, and various other
items.
While I appreciate very much what the
honourable Leader of the Opposition has said,
I repeat that in my opinion the bill bas gone
a long way to meet many of the objections
which veterans' associations have made. In
particular I would point out that, as the
Deputy Minister stated this morning, section
7 of the bill complies precisely with the
recommendation which was made by the
Canadian Legion. I do not need to add that
the Legion contains by far the largest number of veterans of any Canadian organization, and when it makes a recommendation
which is accepted, that action, I am sure,
will have the approval of a very large number of returned men.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
the subject-matter of this bill has been so
ably discussed by the honourable senator
from Hastings-Frontenac (Hon. Mr. White)
and the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that I do not intend
to enlarge on it. Those of us who attended
the Banking and Commerce Committee this
morning will agree, I am sure, that the
Deputy Minister of Veterans Affairs gave us
a very able explanation of the bill and went
out of his way to answer all questions asked
of him; indeed some of us thought he answered too many. However, it was all very
satisfactory. It was, I believe, the sentiment
of all members of the committee whether or
not there was agreement on all details, that
the bill represents a great advance over
existing legislation. The Deputy Minister
pointed out that, no matter what the legislation on veterans affairs, or where the line
is drawn, there will be some difficulties. For
instance, when you provide that a man must
have served, say, 20 years, some will be
found to have served only 19 years and 9
months. Such cases arise from time to time,
and it is quite understandable that they do.
Since lunch I took the opportunity of talking
over some of these matters with the Minister
of Veterans Affairs, and I agree with the
statement of the honourable Leader of the
Opposition that the minister is most earnestly
concerned with the problems of the returned

soldier. He himself is a veteran, and a very
distinguished one, of the First World War;
he has been a member of the other place
since 1935; and he is determined that veterans shall receive a fair deal from the Canadian people as some compensation for what
they did on behalf of Canada.
I appreciate the attitude of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition to the bill. While
he does not agree with a part of section 7,
he believes that under the circumstances
the bill should be passed. He knows, as we
all do, that whatever inconsistencies this
legislation may contain, the next two or three
years will bring them to light. The present
Deputy Minister is so earnestly interested in
the welfare and rights of veterans that you
can be sure he will see to it that proper
amendments are made to this legislation
from time to time. While some of us may
think that the arguments presented by the
Leader of the Opposition were satisfactorily
explained away, the thought in my mind is
that some problem does exist. The Deputy
Minister admitted this and said the only
thing to do is to let it work itself out. I
agree with him entirely. This bill will increase Government expenditures on behalf of
war veterans by over $9 million a year, which
is a pretty substantial contribution by the
taxpayers of this country. Even at that it
may not be enough. Those who served in
the First World War, or who had boys serving in the last war, appreciate what veterans
have gone through. I think we all agree that
Canada is determined to do the right thing
by her veterans, and this bill goes a long way
in improving the present legislation. As a
lawyer, I say that while there may be defects in the bill and the legal terminology may
lead to appeals before the War Veterans
Allowance Board, I know from personal experience that the members of the board will
advise the Minister and his officials on whatever difficulties they may encounter, and as
a result amending legislation will be brought
down.
The Deputy Minister was asked in committee when he thought the summit of
expenditures on behalf of war veterans would
be reached. I threw in a comment, which I
do sometimes when I really shouldn't, and
said, "Provided there are no more world
wars". The Deputy Minister replied that, in
the event there is not another war, the summit of expenditures on behalf of war veterans
should be reached within five years, and that
from that point on there should be a slight
annual decrease. That seemed to be a valuable piece of information. Between now and
then deserving cases on behalf of such people
as the Leader of the Opposition referred to
can be taken care of. I appreciate what he

NOVEMBER 20, 1957
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, November 14, consideration of Her Majesty
the Queen's Speech at the opening of the session and the motion of Hon. Mr. White,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Méthot, for an Address
in reply thereto.
Hon. W. D. Euler: Honourable senators,
may I join at once those of my colleagues
who have extended their congratulations to
you, Mr. Speaker, to the Leader of the
Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig),
and to the mover (Hon. Mr. White) and the
seconder (Hon. Mr. Méthot) of the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Thone.
As one who has been in Parliament for
many years-more years than perhaps I like
to contemplate-and in which I believe the
senator from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) and I
hold the record, may I extend a warm welcome to the new senators who were recently
appointed to this chamber. In saying that, I
might add that in a manner of speaking they
have had a narrow escape in entering the
Senate.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is in my mind may
not be what some of you think. Most members
of this house will remember that two or three
sessions ago I introduced here a bill to amend
the British North America Act by requiring
that every vacancy in the Senate shall be
filled within six months from the date on
which it occurs. I did that because there had
grown up through the years, under both
Liberal and Conservative governments, a reprehensible practice of allowing a great number of vacancies to accumulate in the Senate.
I thought that was not fair either to the
Senate, or to the people of Canada who, if
they want a Senate at all-which I sometimes
doubt-are at least entitled to have a full
representation for the entire country. At the
time I introduced the bill at least one-fifth of
the seats in the Senate were vacant; some had
been vacant for a year, some for two years,
and one had actually been vacant for seven
years. However, the Government of the day
did not like my bill-and I must admit that
they did not like some other bills I
introduced.
Hon. Mr. Howard: And they defeated it.

Hon. Mr. Euler: Which he had a perfect
right to do. But while I still believe that the
principle of that bill was thoroughly sound,
the defeat had its compensations, because as
a result of the recent election it has been
made possible for the new Government to correct to some extent, at least, the imbalance
between the parties in this body. I hope that
the practice which has grown up through
the years will not be continued by the present
Government, but I am just a little suspicious
that it might be, for there are still nine
vacancies in the Senate.
My congratulations to my friend the Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) are on
his appointment to that position and to the
Cabinet. While he was Leader of the Opposition he was always fair in his comments, and
I believe he will continue so to be. I was
just a bit disappointed a few days ago when,
in replying to a speech made by the Leader
of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) on
the Prairie Grain Advance Payments Bill,
who said he was in favour of the bill, my
friend the Leader of the Government accused
him of being opposed to the bill. I think the
leader said-although I do not want to attribute to him any unfair motive-that he
wanted a reason for issuing a rousing, ringing challenge to those of us who are not
supporters of the Government, to defeat the
bill so that the Government could go to the
country on that issue. But there was no issue,
because we were not opposed to the bill.
Now, honourable senators, I did not rise
to make a political speech, and I am sure when
I am through you will agree that I have not
talked party politics. The Leader of the
Government was merely following the
example of his leader, the present Prime
Minister who, when speaking at Charlottetown a few weeks before the session opened,
was reported in the Toronto Globe and Mail
as saying to the opposition parties-the
Liberals, the C.C.F'ers and the Social
Crediters-that they had better behave themselves or else. He said he was not going to
be pushed around, because he was the Goverrnent of Canada; if they pushed him
around, they would have an election thrust
upon them.
When I read that news item I immediately
recalled the words of Brutus in ·the play
Julius Caesar:
Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
he is grown so great?

I wondered whether in the flush of a very
doubtful victory the Prime Minister had forgotten that, after all, in the House of ComHon. Mr. Euler: As a matter of course, they mons his party is in a minority of more than

million votes. Perhaps the Prime Minister
would do well to follow in a modified way
the advice given by President Theodore Roosevelt: "Speak softly, and carry a big stick."
I would suggest to the Prime Minister, if I
may, that be speak softly and do not use the
big stick too often, because it might break
in his hands.
Those of us who have been transplanted to
this side of the house found a little difficulty
in the first few days of the session in orienting
ourselves. For many years some of us who
sat on the other side of the house had looked
at the depressing paintings on this side, paintings of scenes of desolation and war, which
were not cheering in their effect. Now that
we have come to this side of the house, we
find that while the scenes on the opposite
walls are different, they are about as bad as
those on this side. If I had my way I would
replace them with paintings of more cheerful
and more appropriate scenes.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Hear, hear.

We could, of course, effect a reduction in
taxes if the Government decided to use the
surplus that was left to them. Perhaps they
could do that, but I would hope they at least
would not reduce taxes by increasing the debt
of this country. Such a move would not be
very popular. So, in my opinion we are left
with one method only for the reduction of
taxes, namely, the reduction of expenditures.
May I take a moment to look at our present
financial situation? I remember very well
that before the First World War our budget
of annual expenditures was about $133 million. But at present they exceed $5,000
million. Indeed, we now spend about $14
million a day. Before the First World War
we spent only $370,000 a day. Our debt at
that time was $335 million, and today it is
more than $11,000 million.
Those are startling figures, when you look
at them in that way. I cite them only to
show that there is a real need for us to begin
reducing our expenditures.
You may ask, how are we going to reduce
our expenditures? I am going to make a
statement which probably will be challenged: I think we are spending entirely too
much money on our so-called defence.
Since the discovery of the guided missile,
which the Russians claim can be sent to
any point in the world, we are now, according to the Minister of Defence, going to enter
upon heavily increased expenditures to
develop something to meet that new attack.
May I say that we have been taking ourselves a bit too seriously: we have been trying to play a bigger part than we have any
right to play. We are just a little bit too
big for our clothes. We cannot hope to compete with a country that has the population
and strength of the United States.
I should like to refer to a newspaper
report of a speech by Mr. Stuart Armour, a
prominent official of the Steel Company of
Canada, having to do with the reducing of
taxation, especially in the Department of
National Defence. First, may I point out that
Canada now has in uniform about 120,000 persons, distributed among the three services as
follows: Army, 50,000; Air Force, 50,000; and
Navy, 20,000. I agree with Mr. Armour's
views, which he expresses better than I can.
The news item reads:

Hon. Mr. Euler: I intend this afternoon to
discuss three topics, one domestic and the
other two international in their nature. I
shall speak on the domestic topic first.
During the recent campaign the Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition in
the other house, made a good many promises,
some of which be has carried out; but one of
the most important ones, and of which I have
seen no evidence of his bringing it into effect,
was that there would be a reduction of taxes.
He said that be would call a fall session for
that purpose.
I do not know what is in the mind of the
Prime Minister, but so far practically all the
legislation brought before Parliament has
involved the spending of more money, but no
reduction. I have not calculated the total
increase in the proposed expenditures, but it
must run into several hundred millions of
dollars.
There are, of course, only three ways in
which taxes can be reduced. One is by collecting larger revenues. I do not see where
we are going to get an increase in revenues
through present rates of taxation. As is well
known, the great source of revenue is from
individual income and corporation taxes. It is
a well-known fact that there has recently been

keeping involved.

NOVEMBER 20, 1957
I remember a meeting of the Banking and
Commerce Committee where we were discussing our expenditures. I brought out the
fact that for every two men in uniform we
had one office employee to take care of the
administration of those two men. That is
something like saying that if a manufacturer
employs 100 men in his factory, he needs
about 50 persons to look after the office work.
Mr. Armour went on to say:

year, there are bnly two possible courses of

forward a little too far, slipped and fell to
the bottom. We sat and watched that wasp
as it tried and tried again and again to
climb up the inside of the bottle to the top.
I suppose it failed ten or twelve times; and
we were getting ready to leave when I said
to a friend of mine-though I am not a betting man-"I'll bet you 10 rubles that the
wasp will not be able to climb out". After
what we had seen he would not take my
offer. So then I said, "I will bet you 10
rubles that it will crawl out". My companion,
being a canny Scot, took the bet at once.
Almost as promptly the wasp crawled out of
the bottle and I collected the 10 rubles. The
story is a trivial one, but I am trying to
make this point, that the wasp, like Robert
Bruce's spider, tried and tried and tried,
and finally succeeded; and my counsel to
this bouse is that, even though we should
not succeed the first time in getting together
with the Russians, we should try again and
again.
For what is the alternative? I will tell
you what the alternative is. We shall continue the cold war or have a suicidal world
war. I did not get much backing for the
speech I made last year, but I have pretty
good backing for it now. Almost immediately
after President Eisenhower and the British
Foreign Secretary refused the invitation of
Mr. Khrushchev, statements were issued
around the world. Here is one from Canberra, Australia, quoting Prime Minister
Robert Menzies as saying:
We ought to be willing to discuss matters with
the Soviet Union, as suggested Wednesday by
Communist Party Secretary Khrushchev.

That statement comes from the Prime
Minister of a sister member of the Commonwealth. It is quite unmistakable. Then there
was a statement made by Mr. Pearson, who
until recently was Canada's Secretary of State
for External Affairs. This is datelined from
Minneapolis, November 3, and reads:

That is what I was speaking about. We
get on a new plateau of expenditure to meet
new conditions of warfare. General Bradley
is quoted further:
If I am sometimes discouraged it is not because
of the magnitude of the problem, but by our
colossal indifference to it. I am unable to understand why-if we are willing to trust in reason as
a restraint on the use of the ready-made, ready-tofire bomb-we do not make greater, more diligent
and more imaginative use of reason and intelligence
in seeking an accord and compromise which will
make it possible for mankind to control the atom
and banish it as an instrument of war.

The Washington Post, in commenting on the
subject, said:
There is no acceptable alternative to some kind
of workable agreement. The race to match sputniks
can only lead to war unless an agreement can be
negotiated.

I have just one more reference. This comes
from the Financial Post of last week, and
probably many honourable senators have
read it. It is headed "Let's Meet Soviets On
This Plan" and it goes on to say:
Every sensible person knows that there are only
two possible endings for the nightmarish "twoworld" system that bedevils this generation.
It
can blow up in the dreadful cataclysm of a third
world war that might kill off the human race. Or
it can somehow be resolved into peaceful cooperation and peaceful competition.
The second alternative, which would get 100 per
cent of the popular vote in all countries, needs
mutual trust. Parties to the great quarrel must
have confidence in each other's good intentions
before they can stop glowering and begin getting
somewhere with disarmament and other disputed
questions.
What is to be done to create trust and confidence?

Then the paper conveys a suggestion made
by two leading members of the Soviet
Academy of Science, calling for:
A broad international conference of scientists to
discuss the dangers of thermonuclear war.

I will not read the full message. That is
the purport of it, and that is what the
Financial Post is advocating in this article.

suggestions will be that you cannot trust the

NOVEMBER 20, 1957
I recently read a book written by a wellknown author in South Africa, and I will
attempt to give a brief resumé. The locale
of the story is Melbourne, Australia, after
World War III. An American submarine
had escaped and was at Melbourne. This
was an atomie war and life in Europe, Asia
and North America had been completely
destroyed. The submarine took occasional
trips out into the Pacific and on one of these
trips it went as far north as Seattle. On the
way the crew could observe that cities were
stilI standing but there was no life in them.
The moving part of the story is that the
people in Melbourne knew that poisonous
gases were spreading toward them and that
they had only a few months to live. When
they learned that the people north of them
in Queensland had perished they knew that
their own time was very limited. Before
long they all died and the earth became a
dead planet.
Perhaps that picture is a little too dismal,
but.from what we hear there are just two
courses open to us: we have got to live with
these people or destroy them and be
destroyed ourselves. My thought is that this
Government should do what it can to bring
about a meeting such as bas been suggested,
even if this suggestion does come from Russia.
I will conclude my remarks by quoting
from what I said last year in this bouse:

also the Queen of the Comonwealth countries,
and the Commonwealth countries are far flung
on the surface of the globe. Among them
there are many diversities. For instance,
there is little in common between South Africa
and Canada; perhaps there is less in common
between the new dominion of Ghana and New
Zealand. Yet through this mystic symbol of
the Crown there is a measure of unity, not
only in parliamentary practice, but in the
higher ideals of our civilization. Consequently,
it was an important occasion.
Honourable senators, I must come to the
part of my address where I desire to pay some
compliments.
My first compliment, Mr.
Speaker, is to yourself. You have been
appointed to the important office of presiding
over our deliberations. Those of us who have
met you since your appointment and who have
watched your care over the proceedings of
this assembly have no doubt that you will continue to discharge your duties with dignity
and with honour in this house.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I also wish to mention my
honourable friend the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig). We are
old personal friends. No one was more
delighted than I when I saw him attain to
the high honour of membership in the Privy
Council of Canada, for that is one of the
highest honours in our Canadian way of life.

SENATE
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Honourable senators, it is
less than eight months since this house came
to the close of the previous session. Since that
time there has been a sort of a political convulsion in Canada. We who were supporters
of the Government of that day no longer sit
to the right of His Honour: we occupy the
seats of Opposition. Perhaps in the long run
this might be a good thing for us. However,
there are a few things I should like to say.
The election campaign was a strenuous one,
which of course by-passed the placidity of
this house.
In a few moments I shall deal with some
of the promises made by the present Prime
Minister at a time when, I suspect, he had
no expectation that he would be called upon
to discharge the high duties of the Prime
Ministership after the election. First, however, J wish to say a word or two about two
old colleagues of mine, namely, the former
Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Mr. St.
Laurent, and my old friend of more than
forty years' standing, Mr. Howe. I do this
because I believe there was a great deal of
misrepresentation of the motives of these two
gentlemen during the election. No one will
ever convince me that the late Prime
Minister, now the Leader of the Opposition
in the other place, had in his make-up a
vestige of dictatorship. He had nothing of the
kind. He may have been somewhat inexperienced in the rough ways of the partisan
side roads, but no finer, no more honourable
man, ever held the high office of Prime
Minister of this country than the Right
Honourable Louis St. Laurent.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: As to my old friend Mr.
Howe, his difficulty was that he was not what
is popularly called a politician; but likewise
there was not the remotest shred of the spirit
of dictatorship in C. D. Howe.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Not the remotest shred.
He was a man who wanted to get things done,
and perhaps be was too impatient with the
ordinary parliamentary processes.
I am not here defending some of the things
that happened in the last year or two of the
old administration; things happened that
should not have happened. Mr. Howe got the
blame for a large number of these things,
and perhaps superficially some of the criticism
was coming to him. But I would remind this
house that Canada never had a more faithful
public servant in the discharge of his duties
than Mr. Howe.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: These two men were my
colleagues for five years, and I know them.
From the outbreak of the last war, and for
the next five or six years, there passed over
the desk of Mr. Howe some tens of billions
of dollars' worth of expenditures in Canada;
and there never has been anywhere in this
country, in the press or elsewhere, the slightest taint of suspicion raised against the
spending of that money.
Well, honourable senators, I do not know
what you think of that record, but I think
it is a superb one. I say further: no other
allied country in the war made a more effective contribution, having regard to its population and resources, than did Canada. The
fact that Canada's whole economic system
was quickly geared to war, and produced the
sinews necessary to win that war, was due
more to Mr. Howe than to any other man.
Notwithstanding the fact that be may at
times have been impatient, that at times he
may not have had due regard for parliamentary processes, I pay my tribute of respect to
him for the great work he did in the war.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: That brings me to the
Speech from the Throne, and some comments
I wish to make upon it. The Prime Minister
ascended his Mount Sinai and brought down
the speech which was read by Her Gracious
Majesty. Unlike Moses of old, who brought
down the tablets of the Law from another
Mount Sinai, the Prime Minister brought
down a speech that is really a combination
of platitudes and promises. There is not in
this whole speech one single, solitary word
concerning the importance of economy in the
day to day life of the Government of our
country. There is in it not a single word on
the importance of savings. And yet, if this
danger of inflation-and it is a real dangeris to be met, we must have more economy
in public spending and more savings in our
personal relationships. But one does not find
a word about economy in the Speech from
the Throne. Indeed, it is a fulfilment of
some of the promises made during the election campaign which, I think I may charitably
say, would not have been made in the way
they were made if the present Prime Minister
had expected that within a few months he
would be head of the Government of this
country.
I now come to a discussion of some of the
things contained in the Speech from the
Throne. The first to which I wish to allude
is that paragraph which tells us the Government proposes to hold a conference with the
provinces about fiscal matters. That conference takes place in this chamber next Monday
and Tuesday.

NOVEMBER 20, 1957
During the election campaign the Prime
Minister was rather critical of the old administration because of its parsimony in dealing
with the provinces. One of the most vexing
and perplexing problems which face governments today is that of finding the essential
revenues to carry on the activities which they
think should be carried on. Under the present
arrangement, which I believe expires within a
year, the federal Government pays large
amounts to the various provinces in lieu of
personal and corporation income taxes.
It is a well-known fact that Mr. Frost, the
Premier of Ontario, is far from satisfied with
the existing arrangement. At present Ontario
is allowed to levy an income tax of 10 per
cent on personal incomes and 9 per cent on
corporation incomes-I believe those figures
are correct-and that amount is deducted
from the collections made by Ottawa and paid
to Mr. Frost's Government. Now Mr. Frost
wants 15 per cent of the personal income taxes
and 15 per cent of the corporation income
taxes, and a continuation of the present arrangement under which his Government receives 50 per cent of succession duties. I
believe that Mr. Duplessis, without surrendering his position that the federal Government
should not be in certain taxation fields, which
he believes should be left to the provinces,
is going to ask for the same arrangement. We
shall see.
The point I wish to make is this: If these
requests are acceded to in accordance with
the implied promise of the Prime Minister
during the election campaign, and the equalization principle in the distribution of revenue
to the provinces is also maintained, the burden on the federal treasury will be increased
by almost $300 million a year. I do not know
what may come out of this conference, but
the distribution of revenues is I believe one
of the most dangerous and vexing questions
affecting the unity of Canada.
Many years ago, when I was a political
sophomore, I joined Sir Robert Borden's
Union Government; as a matter of fact, I
was a member of a government before I had
ever been elected to Parliament. One of my
colleagues was the late Honourable Arthur
Sifton, who had been Premier of Alberta.
Shortly after the election in 1917 and the
return of the Union Government, Mr. Sifton
presented me with a bound copy of the
British North America Act, with these words:
"I am giving you this because I hope your
career in public life will be long and successful; but whether it be long or not, there is
nothing more important for the unity of
Canada than the maintenance of proper, sound
relationships between the federal authorities

and the provincial Governments." That incident made a profound impression on me at
the time, and I still hold as strongly as ever
to the view Mr. Sifton expressed.
A good deal of bickering, of criticism back
and forth, is being heard. In other words,
as I said on another occasion, we are like
jealous heirs who are quarrelling over the
distribution of an estate; and that spirit is
not good enough if this country is to go ahead
in the spirit of unity which certainly was
the dream and hope of the founders of
Confederation.
Honourable senators, I am now going to
say something on the matter of old age
security; and here I quite expect I shall find
myself at variance with a good many of my
colleagues in this house. On this matter I
am neither a doctrinaire nor a bigot. However, I should like to give the house some
information.
In accordance with a promise which was
made during the election, the Old Age
Security Act has been amended to increase
the amount of pension to $55 per month
from the $46 at which it was left by the late
Liberal administration. Honourable senators
will recall that provision for old age security
was made by an act passed in 1950, operative
on January 1, 1951. If we throw our minds
back to those days, not so far away, we
shall remember that the $40 per month was
given as a contribution, an aid, to elderly
people to maintain reasonable comfort in
their declining years. The method of computing the cost of living index was changed
in 1949, so that by 1951, the Korean war
having meanwhile intervened, this index
stood at 107.7. By March, 1957 the figure
had risen to 120.5, and I mention the month
because that was when legislation was passed
to increase the pension by $6 per month.
Had Mr. Harris provided for $48 instead of
$46, the $8 total increase would have
balanced to a fraction of a point the rise
meanwhile in the cost of living. But by 1957
a new theory respecting old age pensions
had developed. It was, not that a pension is
an aid to elderly people to sustain themselves
in comfort, but that they are entitled as of
right to an amount sufficient to maintain
them in comfort even though they have no
resources of their own. It was largely upon
this theory that the Prime Minister and his
present colleagues campaigned in the recent
election. I want to examine this idea for a
few moments.
In the first place, if it is a social obligation
of the state to maintain elderly people with
little or no resources of their own in the
degree of comfort and decency to which
some of our sociologists claim to be their

SENATE
due, I say that $55 per month is not enough.
Further, if we accept this principle, and if
we are to base old age security payments
not on need of the older folk, nor as an aid,
but on the assumption that they are entitled
to it as of right, where ultimately will this
principle lead us? Because it seems obvious
to me that if we accept the theory that a
Government must or should pay pensions
adequate to maintain people over 70, or even
of 65 years of age, in decency and comfort,
the incentive of people to work and save for
themselves during their working years will
be in large measure destroyed. That, I think,
is incontrovertible.
Furthermore, society does not owe a debt to
our old people. Take a boy, or a young man:
society pays its debt to him as he lives. It
educates him and gives him the protection
of law and order for his person and his
property during his entire life. He is free to
work and save or waste his substance. If a
man starts to work at 20 years of age and
retires at 65, he has had 45 years in which
to earn and save.
The problem as I see it is that we are
steadily eroding away the desire on the part
of individual citizens to make provision for
their old age. That is a very unfortunate state
of affairs. I have some estimates here given
by the Minister of National Health and Welfare in the House of Commons with respect
to social security measures which we passed
through this house recently. He estimated
that during the next fiscal year the increased
expenditures on old age security payments
will be paid to 855,000 persons and the
amount required will be $564 million. There
is no doubt that the reduction in the residence requirement period from 20 to 10 years
has added substantially to the cost. It is
worth while noting that in 1951, when the
old age security scheme was introduced, the
total payments amounted to about $250 million. They have more than doubled since that
time. We are also increasing pensions for the
disabled, the blind and those who come under
the Old Age Assistance Act. The Minister
was unable to say how much all these increases, including old age security, will come
to, but they will amount to over $100 million
a year.
Let me give you some other figures. The
Government paid out $245 million in family
allowances in 1946, and $398 million in 1956.
That is a progression away beyond any increase in our gross national product.
I would remind honourable senators that
payments by the federal Government are not
the only ones made in the field of social
security. I have a statement here issued by
the Bureau of Statistics. We used to assemble
these figures when our Finance Committee

was operating, but we have not had them for
a few years. According to this information,
which I have no doubt is reliable, the federal
Government spent over $910 million in 1955
under the heading of "General health and
social welfare expenditures". During the
same period the provinces spent over $380
million, and the municipalities, mainly the
larger cities, over $95 million. That made
under this heading a total spending across
Canada, at all levels of government, of almost
$1,400 million. I venture to say that this year
the amount will total $1,700 milhon-there is
no doubt that it will be well over $1,500
million.
Let me draw the attention of honourable
senators to another fact. We have never had
so full employment as during the past few
years. It is true that employment is tending
to diminish now. The question of employment
is of real concern, for a reason which I will
give in a moment. I submit it is important
to do everything possible to encourage savings and to encourage people to look after
themselves. There are many members in this
honourable house who started with very humble beginnings and they made their way in
life because they saved their money and
invested it wisely. I have a theory that at
least 75 per cent of the Canadian people are
good, decent, honest, hard-working citizens
who desire, above everything else, good,
honest economical government. I do not think
I am wrong. These are the people who in the
past year have established an increase in home
Statistics clearly indicate this.
ownership.
They are the people who contribute to bank
savings. Just look at the figures of bank savings and see how they have increased year by
year. They are also the people who have
purchased savings bonds to the extent of
hundreds of millions of dollars.
An incident occurred a few weeks ago that
was very interesting to me. I happened to
be in a bank in one of the smaller towns in
Manitoba, waiting to see the manager. It was
not a very large room, and I noticed a lady
come in, who I judged, from her appearance,
was probably a workman's wife. She went
over to the accountant and took from her
handbag some Government bonds. I observed
the accountant clip coupons of three different
bonds-I was not eavesdropping or inquisitive,
but I was so near that I could not fail to
observe it-which this lady wanted credited
to the proper account. Honourable senators,
is that a desirable thing? I think it is. Is it
not something to be encouraged? I think
it is.
The danger of these mounting expenditures
of Government is very evident to me. Professor Deutsch, who is now Professor of Political
Economy at the University of British
Columbia, gave not long ago an address in

NOVEMBER 20, 1957
which he stated that at all levels of government we were taking from the taxpayers a
total of over 27 per cent of the gross national
product. If it were put on the basis of the
net national income, which is probably a
better basis, that would run well over 30 per
cent; in other words, we are probably taking
pretty close to a third of our net national
income in taxes today. And the spending
goes on.
Honourable senators, what does all this
mean? May I be permitted a personal reference? In 1939 I had an insurance policy
which matured, and I left it where it was.
Some day it will go to my estate. At present
the proceeds of that insurance policy would
buy less than half of what it would have
bought in 1939. The point I wish to make is
that there has been a steady erosion of the
savings that hundreds of thousands of our
people have made over the years, and that
fact is embarrassing a great many people
today. Is this process to go on, or are we
going to be courageous enough to try to stop
it? Inflation is a deadly menace. Probably
25 per cent of our population never save;
they are thriftless-lazy, if you like-and it
is this 25 per cent to whom our public men
have been paying the most attention in the
last 10 or 15 years. I suggest, honourable
senators, that it is time we paid a little attention to the 75 per cent, the good and
worthy citizens of this country, who are its
backbone and its mainstay, not only in
matters of federal government, but in provincial and municipal work, and in school districts and the like. That is an important
consideration. If we go on with these heavy
expenditures and run into deficits, as we are
almost certain to do, the Minister of Finance
will have to show these when he brings down
another budget. At all costs we should avoid
feeding the fires of inflation. Nothing is more
important than maintaining the integrity of
our money. It may be a nice thing to give a
pension on the theory that, well, we are helping the old people, but it is not going to be
of any great value within two or three years
if the pension is worn and eroded away by
the inflationary process.
Honourable senators, I have spoken longer
than I had intended. I am quite certain that
some of the views I have expressed will not
find a warm reception in the minds of some
honourable members, but I felt that I should
express them because I think this is a matter
of profound importance.
My concluding thought is this, that so far
as I know there never has been in history a
revolution that was not preceded by inflation.
Take France. She is a great country, a mother
of much of the culture of the world, but she
has been faced with a steady depreciating

value of the franc for years past, and today
her Government, notwithstanding the natural
riches of the country, is compelled to borrow
money where it can, compelled to levy heavy
additional taxation in order to try to maintain
solvency. I think that is a warning worth
heeding. I make no bones about my conviction that the greatest thing, for me, at least,
is the preservation of freedom and liberty. I
have always belonged to the Liberal party
because I believe that in the philosophy of
that party is the very core of freedom and
liberty. If these are lost, all else does not
matter, for the most precious things in life
will have disappeared into the limbo of forgotten things.

occasion which we who were privileged to
be present will never forget, and one that
we would all be delighted to have repeated
from time to time.
I wish also to extend my congratulations
and best wishes to His Honour the Speaker,
to the Leader of the Government in the
Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig); and to the mover
(Hon. Mr. White) and the seconder (Hon. Mr.

account of themselves by their excellent
speeches.
To the new senators in this chamber, it is
a pleasure to say a very warm welcome. I
hope they will enjoy their sojourn among
these friendly and distinguished colleagues
as much as I have enjoyed mine since becoming a member of the Senate.
I now turn for a few minutes to the more
mundane things of life which occupy our
attention at this session of Parliamentpotatoes, for instance. From the early days
of the pioneeers to the present time potatoes
have played a most important role in my
province. Almost the first thing a settler
did, as soon as he found some shelter for
his family, was to clear a piece of ground
and plant potatoes, sometimes even planting
the sets among the tree stumps. To those
first arrivals in a new country, potatoes
constituted the staff of life; with fish from
the sea and potatoes from their land they
could live.

SENATE
The soil and climate of our Island are
particularly adapted to the production of
potatoes, and the quality of Prince Edward
Island seed and table stock is well recognized
over most of North America, the West Indies,
and as far as Argentina in South America.
Potato production today presents of course
a very different problem from that of the
early years in Prince Edward Island, owing
to changes in cultural methods, such as the
use of commercial fertilizers necessary in
higher yielding varieties; increased harvesting costs, which amount to from $3 to $4 a
day for pickers, even for children ten years
old; the cost of grading, transporting and
packaging; the scientific control of disease
and insect pests. All these things add greatly
to the financial investment of the grower. As
it costs at least $1 to grow a bushel of potatoes, a farmer who cultivates a large acreage
takes chances with a considerable sum of
money, which he could very well lose completely and even find himself heavily in debt,
should the crop be a failure or the market
bad.
The growing of potatoes is to the farmers
of Prince Edward Island what the growing
of wheat is to the farmers of the midwest, a
cash crop; but whereas wheat can be kept
and stored for a long period of time, potatoes
are perishable and can be stored for a maximum period of only about eight months. As
they are susceptible to frost, storage cellars
must be frostproof and watertight, and every
so often the potatoes must be culled so as to
eliminate rot.
We are all pleased that the wheat growers
are to have some further financial assistance;
wheat is a very necessary commodity. However, at the same time I do believe our potato
growers are also entitled to be looked after.
For several years past the pit-prop and
pulpwood industry has contributed very considerably to the income of those engaged in
that activity in our province. That business
has now gone, or has almost gone, and with
it has gone the added income, which will
make it more difficult for many of our citizens to make ends meet. This will also add
to our unemployment situation this winter,
for many of our farmers spend the winter
months at this work. We Islanders would be
pleased to see some monetary support given
to this business.
Fox farming was at one time a thriving
industry in Prince Edward Island, especially
in the Prince County and Summerside area,
"the home of the silver fox". But that industry has faded away and that source of income
has disappeared. Next to farming, fishing is
the big business with us, especially the lobster and oyster fisheries. To the fishermen

the lobster business alone is worth $2,688,000,
and the oyster business, $195,000. I may add
that Malpeque oysters are the finest in the
world and command high market prices.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mrs. Inman: We have three large fish
processing plants and numerous canning
plants; but, with the exception of lobsters and
oysters, the fishermen have had poor catches
and low markets this past season. That situation constitutes a hardship for many. Fish
can be kept in salted form for some time, it
is true, but not for more than a year; after
that time it deteriorates very quickly: salted
and smoked fish becomes extremely dry and
hard, and pickled fish becomes rusty. Fish
may be canned but, except for canned lobsters,
that market is limited. So the loss of markets
for fresh, pickled, dry and frozen fish means
a great drop in the economy of our Island.
I feel strongly that the federal government
should do more for this industry in my province than is at present being done.
Now, honourable senators, so that you will
never forget the wonders of Prince Edward
Island, I am going to speak for a short while
about the tourist industry in the Atlantic
provinces, and particularly in the province
from which I come. The importance of
tourism as an industry to Prince Edward
Island cannot be too strongly stressed. In a
province which has such a limited range of
industry, it is necessary to expand as much
as possible those industries which we have in
order to ensure the welfare and prosperity of
our citizens.
The closer we look at the past, the closer
we must look at the present and ask ourselves what the future holds for Canada's
hospitality industry in those provinces where
tourism can be big business. To those who
like to spend their vacations in a sequestered,
quiet, restful spot, undisturbed by the rush
and roar of the big vacation resorts, Prince
Edward Island has peculiar charms: its well
kept, cultivated farms, its rolling seas and
magnificent white beaches are an attraction
to any tourist. It is the romantic land portrayed by Lucy Maud Montgomery, our
beloved authoress. There is hardly a square
mile but affords a view of the sea, with its
invigorating breeze. For pure air, beauty of
scenery and general appearance of comfort
and independence the Island is without rival.
Nature has been very generous with us.
Prince Edward Island has everything one
requires for a restful happy vacation: warm
sun, fresh salt sea air, perfect swimming and
bathing, secluded streams and ponds, teeming
with speckled trout just asking to be caught,
and deep sea fishing with a sure catch on
every trip.

NOVEMBER 20, 1957
Visitors to our province find a complete
change from anything they have ever seen;
it is almost like being in another world. It is
perhaps a unique spot in Canada, this Garden
province, this Eden, unspoiled, memorable
because of its glorious scenery, natural beauty
and sweet-scented fields and groves. Here in
this Island, the birthplace of Confederation,
is the fellowship of peace, and the hospitality
of a people who welcome visitors with genuine warmth and good will, and beauty all
around.
But in the province of Prince Edward
Island one of the greatest problems facing the
tourist industry is transportation. We make
a great effort to attract visitors to our province, and then they are very often left
stranded for hours at the ferry terminals. Our
means of transportation are very inadequate.
We have on the Caribou-Wood Islands service
two boats, one with a capacity of about 14
cars and trucks, and the other somewhat
larger. Still another larger boat is being built,
but it will not be sufficient to look after the
traffic at this end of our Island. On the
Borden-Tormentine route, some 65 to 80 automobiles can be carried on each crossing. But
again, many times during July and August
more than 100 cars are left at each side waiting for transportation. I may say from personal experience that this is a very annoying
situation. On one occasion I sat in a car at
Tormentine for six hours before getting on
the boat. A car dare not leave the line-up,
because it would lose its priority, and it is
impossible to get food at the pier.
In comparison with the huge sums of money
that are being spent these days, the amount
required to improve facilities-whether by
way of the construction of a causeway, which
we hope to have before too long, or by providing more and larger boats-to expedite
transportation to and from our province,
should not be considered out of reason. Perhaps a large automobile ferry would meet
the need until we get the causeway. Something should be done to aid the promoting
and developing of the tourist business, one
of the few industries which could bring a
high economic return to our province.

At the present time tourist spending in
Prince Edward Island amounts to more than
$5 million, and with greater and more convenient transportation facilities, and increased
accommodation in hotels, motels, tourist
homes and cottages, that amount would very
quickly be doubled-a very significant factor
in the economy of a small province. Apart
from Summerside, Charlottetown and the
National Park, our tourist accommodation is
very limited. An extension of our National
Park to take in a portion of Prince and Kings
counties would also be of great benefit to the
industry. Accessibility and accommodation
are our greatest needs at the present time
with respect to tourism in Prince Edward
Island. We have something to sell to the
tourists in scenery, historic attractions, and
recreational facilities, but we need the means
to promote the sale. To foster the tourist
industry would indeed be a sound investment
for any government.
This little province, set in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence, has a small population-less than
100,000 people when the last census was
taken. We have been modest in our demands.
We do not ask for much, and we have never
received much, from the federal Government,
but I do think the time has come when we
should ask for and receive some financial
consideration to help our primary producers,
when assistance is being given to others in
this way.
Honourable senators, these are not days for
brashness or for guessing contests, but days
when knowledge and experience are very
necessary indeed to weigh and consider most
carefully the affairs of our country in order
to give the best legislation possible. The
problems of each province require a good
deal of study and consideration by those in
authority, in order to provide the legislation
that will contribute most to the welfare of
our citizens and the development of our
resources, not only for our own good, but for
the ultimate good of our great heritage, this
vast and rich land of Canada.

CRIMINAL LAW
REPORT OF ROYAL COMMISSION ON INSANITY
AS A DEFENCE

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, yesterday I spoke to the Leader of
the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Haig) and asked him if he would table a
copy of the report of the Royal Commission
on the law of insanity as a defence in
criminal cases. May I inquire of my honourable friend now if he has had an opportunity to obtain a copy? I know he has been
engaged in Cabinet most of the day, so perhaps he was too busy to attend to this.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I was busy all morning at a Cabinet meeting
and could not find time to obtain a copy of
the report requested. As a matter of fact, I
was busy also in trying to arrange to have
Royal Assent given to bills this afternoon,
in order that we would not need to sit
tomorrow. It took a great deal of time to
arrange things, as everybody else had a better idea than I had, so they thought. I
apologize for not having a copy of the report
to table this afternoon, and I shall have one
here at our next sitting.
SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday consideration of Her Majesty the Queen's speech
at the opening of the session and the motion
of Hon. Mr. White, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Méthot, for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
those of you who are old-timers here will
find nothing unusual in my attempt to have
something to say in the debate on the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne.
At the outset I would like to say how
thankful I was to a kind Providence for
being privileged to be present on the historic
occasion when Her Majesty, accompanied by
Prince Philip, opened the present session of
Parliament. It was an occasion that we will
all long remember.
I wish to congratulate your Honour on
your appointment to the high office of presiding officer of this chamber, and on the

manner in which you have carried out your
duties. I also wish to congratulate my deskmate (Hon. Mr. White), the mover of the
motion for an Address, and the seconder
(Hon. Mr. Méthot).
We have had a number of excellent
speeches in the chamber recently. I was
particularly taken with the speech of the
honourable senator from Waterloo (Hon. Mr.
Euler). Surely it is an honourable effort for
anyone to advocate, as he did, the maintenance of peace at this time and in the
present state of the world.
May I offer congratulations also to the
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Wall). He has had a long experience as a
teacher, and he delivered a well prepared
and splendid speech.
I am sorry that the honourable senator
from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson), former
Leader of the Government in the Senate and
former Speaker, is not in the chamber at
present, for I intended to pay my respects
to him. He has had, through means of his
inquiry in regard to international trade, an
opportunity of making two speeches on the
Address. I am somewhat concerned lest I
find myself in a similar position. It seems
to me that he is so much better on Your
Honour's left than he was when he sat on
Your Honour's right. Also, the thought has
occurred to me that I may be totally useless
as a supporter of the Government, whereas
I may have been useful in Opposition. I
believe in recalling and thinking seriously
about the advice I have given the Government down through the years, and it rather
alarms me to think that, had they taken my
advice, I might still have been sitting to
Your Honour's left.
Let me mention some of the things which
have troubled me. The honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), drawing
on his many years' experience and his
knowledge of almost the whole of Canada,
always gives us an interesting talk. But
the question arises in my mind, why do
honourable senators on the Opposition side
demand that so much be done immediately
which they had the opportunity to do, and
did not do, in the last 22 years? The honourable senator from Shelburne gave us a
great story of Nova Scotia and its needs.
Surely the Government which he has supported for over 20 years could have made
some start to remedy these conditions. It is
not necessary for him to tell us that Nova
Scotians are a very fine people: we have
many of them in western Canada, and they
are first-class citizens. I thought he was
getting on rather thin ice, however, when
he brought up the subject of reform of this
chamber. The only attempt he made at

SENATE
reform was of great benefit to himself and
one other honourable senator, and it placed
all the rest of us in a different condition.
However, I had the temerity to oppose the
proposal, and for that reason, no doubt, I am
never to be found away from this chamber
on trips to NATO or other official business:
because of my remarks in this connection I
am thoroughly well grounded here.
I have with me some clippings which, I
believe, justify my view that some serious
mistakes were made, although there were few
who agreed with me when I said so. I
objected to the allotment of $100 million to
the Canada Council; I do not believe in
"culture-buying". I notice in the Ottawa
Citizen a suggestion by Dr. A. W. Trueman,
director of the council, that members of the
Lord's Day Alliance "need their heads read".
When the Reverend Harold Allen, president
of the Alliance, objected to the remark, Dr.
Trueman said he would like to make it clear
that he was speaking for himself and not for
the Canada Council. I do not know how it
is possible to separate the two. He and his
associates are the men who are supposed to
purchase for us $100 million worth of culture.
I objected and I still object to the idea. I
also criticized the terms of the wheat agreement with Great Britain. Now we have it on
no less an authority than the honourable senator from Churchill that that arrangement
has cost the Western farmers $500 million.
I must say that I am somewhat tired of
listening to men of the legal profession trying to explain the problems of farmers in
Saskatchewan. These legal people wouldn't
know what to do if you showed them a sick
animal, and if you asked them to strike a
straight furrow down a mile they would be
all over the place. But the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) proceeds
to tell us what he knows about Saskatchewan
as well as Manitoba.
Speaking of losses suffered by western
farmers, I recently read an interesting article
about economic difficulties in the various sections of the country: Alberta, British Columbia, the two central provinces and the
have-not areas of the east. The writer, a
professor of economics, particularly stressed
how the tight-money policy of the former
Government hit the have-not areas. He did
not mention Saskatchewan at all. As one
who comes from that province I feel it is
my duty to point out that we grow more
wheat there than is grown in all the other
provinces of Canada combined. In a normal
year Manitoba produces something like 50
million bushels, Saskatchewan about 350 million bushels, and Alberta about 100 million
bushels. So Saskatchewan was the chief loser
under the wheat agreement, and she is the
chief loser through freight rates. The Leader

of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) said
in this debate that the former Government
had been in power for 22 years and he referred
to them as "twenty-two glorious years".
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I was not surprised at
his remark and I would expect him to make
it; but I am bound to say that they were
glorious years not because of the Liberal
Government but in spite of the Liberal
Government. They were good years throughout practically the whole world. Look at
the progress that some of the war-devastated
countries have made. Take Germany, for
instance. She was torn by war, and even
after the end of hostilities there was senseless destruction of many of her fine plants,
much of her machinery and equipment having been shipped to Russia and other countries. But look how Germany has come back.
She now has on hand a gold balance of
$5,400 million, a fact which is embarrassing
to her neighbouring countries. How did
Germany accomplish this? By hard work,
not by any five-day work week. The German
people have worked hard to build up their
country, and now she is able to export many
products.
I am concerned about Canada's exports
generally, and I am sure many of them are
going to face difficulties. We feel relatively
secure in Saskatchewan, because grain is
a product that is consumed every day, but
such items as aluminum products, for instance, may last a hundred years. What about
iron and pulpwood? During those glorious
years that have been referred to several
hundred million dollars were spent in Quebec
on construction of pulp mills. This development produced revenue, but in what position
do these mills find themselves today? They
are doing the same thing as we in Saskatchewan are doing with wheat-over-producing.
And so it goes all down the line. The iron
and steel industries may find themselves in
the same position unless they are able to
curtail production costs.
Recourse to labour strikes has been an
alarming factor in connection with freight
rate costs, and I believe this has affected
Saskatchewan more than any other province.
I pleaded with the former Government to
try to find some method whereby labour and
management could settle disputes without
strikes. Whenever there is a strike it usually
means that some people are put out of
work through no fault of their own, and they
have to go on picket lines, and so on. Labour
organizations are so strong they can employ
highly paid counsel to fight their cases in
court. A few years ago we had a countrywide railway strike that lasted ten days.

NOVEMBER 21, 1957
This meant an enormous cost to the country
as a whole, and in particular to the railroads and railroad labour. I know that
during that period a lot of people started
transporting their goods by truck and they
have never gone back to the railroads. For
instances, in spite of the fact there are railroad lines leading from Saskatoon to
Winnipeg, huge truck trailers carrying
almost a carload of cattle are busy all the
time transporting cattle between these two
points. In other words, railroad men have
deprived themselves of this revenue. They
gave the truckers an opportunity to demonstrate what they could do with trucks, and the
railroads have never got the business back.
There is another matter about which not
much has been said, but from which the
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan suffered immensely. A foot and mouth disease
broke out among cattle in Mexico, and as a
result beef started to sell on the United
States market at 34 and 35 cents a pound
live weight. To keep the cost of beef down
in Canada the federal Government placed an
embargo against our cattle, and for nearly
two years we were prevented from taking
advantage of the high prices offered for
beef in the United States. Alberta and
Saskatchewan ranchers asked the federal
Government to do something about this, but
they had no success. The United States
would have been very glad to buy our
cattle. They were paying 34 cents a pound
for finished cattle but we were getting
only 10 to 11 cents here. I remember that
very well. A number of ranchers asked me
for information but I could not give them
any. I said that the purpose of the embargo
must be to keep the cost of beef down in the
rest of Canada.
The ranchers suffered
because of this and a lot of them went into
the winter months without sufficient feed for
their cattle. They were hoping that the
embargo would be lifted and that they would
be able to sell their cattle, but that did not
happen, and thousands of cattle died for
lack of food.
That embargo cost the
province of Saskatchewan a great deal of
money.
Honourable senators, the St. Lawrence
Seaway may be a wonderful undertaking, but
what hope have we in Saskatchewan of
benefiting from it in any way? I have said
this before and I say it again: I am convinced that Saskatchewan farmers will pay
a higher freight rate on grain shipped through
the St. Lawrence than they pay now.
Hon. Mr. Euler: We are going to build you
a dam in Saskatchewan.

Hon. Mr. Horner: There are going to be
tol charges on the St. Lawrence Seaway,
so the Saskatchewan wheat shipped through
the seaway over the years will pay a great
deal of the cost of that undertaking. That
may be the intention. The honourable senator from Kennebec (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt)
stated that he was in favour of these things,
and that they were of great benefit to the
people of Canada.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), in speaking yesterday
about election promises, said be did not believe the present Prime Minister thought he
would be elected to that office. Of course
he expected to be elected. The great disappointment was that he did not have an
overall majority.
May I remind the honourable senator from
New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) that when
we voted on the Trans-Canada Pipe Line
question-I am not sure whether he was
present at the time-I voted against it for
the simple reason that the gas was to be
carried from Emerson and delivered in the
United States at one-third of what it would
cost the people of Winnipeg. The honourable
senator had no complaint then to offer against
a higher price. He reminds me of a story. In
the early days when people travelled on
horseback-there was no other way, of getting about then-a fine old Presbyterian lady
saw an Anglican clergyman ride by, and his
horse was worn. She said to herself, "Such
a merciful man, but not so merciful to his
beast." Later a Presbyterian clergyman rode
by on his horse, which also was worn, and
the lady said, "He is a fair, good man; he
is paid to work, and he is eager to be at it."
I think that story fits the honourable
gentleman.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Some time I will tell you
another one.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I am reminded of another
story that I like telling. In the Old Country,
many, many years ago, at a funeral the
corpse was carried; and the mourners, who
were hired, used to wear big black hats, and
sometimes they were given a toddy or two
before starting off in the procession. On one
occasion two old boys who were following
along respectfully, with their heads down,
missed the funeral procession and found
themselves up a back lane. One of the fellows started to sniff, and said, "They kept
him too long." I think the people of Canada
now realize that they kept the former
Government in power too long.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: Does that also apply
to the senator from New Westminster?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Horner: Oh, no, I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You cannot tack that on to
me.
Hon. Mr. Horner: On the question of inflation, which we hear so much about, I will
read an editorial from the Globe and Mail,
under the caption "Look at the Record":
A Canadian Press dispatch from Moose Jaw
quotes Mr. Lester Pearson as saying that "inflation
had not got out of hand when the Liberal Government left office last June".
It is as well to look at the record. During the
five and a half years of the Second World War,
Canada's cost of living index rose from 100 (the
1939 base) to 118.1. During the next seven years, it
roared up to 183.5. At this point (October, 1952) the
Liberal Government made things look better by
shifting to a new cost of living index, which took
1949 as the base year. On that basis, the old-style
figure of 183.5 gave way to a new-style 116.
Yet this index, too, steadily rose, reaching 121.6
last June. During 22 years of Liberal administration, the Canadian dollar had lost a good half of its
value. And as the above figures show, only a
small part of the loss took place during the war.
Most of it took place following the war.
Other nations have had worse, and faster,
inflation than Canada. But let it not be suggested
that our inflation was kept prudently in hand. Any
Canadian who bought bonds during the war, any
Canadian trying to live on a fixed income, knows
better.

The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) said something to the
effect that a man starting out to work at
age 20 should be able to provide for himself at 65. Perhaps he has overlooked the
fact that the income tax rate has steadily
risen in Canada, and that if the ordinary man
lives according to the generally accepted
standard he has nothing left in the later years
to provide for old age, or to invest in Canadian industry. I think that is a serious
matter, and I hope this Government will
carry out its promise to reduce taxes considerably, both for single and married people
to enable them to share in the investments
and developments of this country. That is
the policy of the Government that I have the
honour to support. I am not at all concerned,
as the honourable senator from Kennebec
appears to be, that we balance the budget.
We have an immense country, with all that
we need. What worries me most is the possibility of people losing their desire to work,
and therefore their inability to keep up a
proper type of home.
In that connection, may I say that I am
annoyed at this talk about an economic farm
unit. Economic for whom? Who are advocating this-the machinery companies, the
oil companies, or the mortgage companies that
are interested in deriving revenue from farm
mortgages? Honourable senators, I can tell
you that the happiest families are raised on
small farms, where horses, rather than
machinery, are used. The man who farms

with horses in western Canada does not need
a cash advance, and has no debts. Not long
ago I met a westerner who farms with horses,
and I asked him how he was getting along.
He said: "I am on my way to take my boy
to the university. All my grain is in the
granary, fresh and dry; I have no gas bills
to be paid, no bills for repairs to a tractor; in
fact, all my debts are paid." I said, "That
is fine, and if there were more people like you
the country would be better off."
Of course, if everyone decided to feed all
their grain to beef cattle, the cattle would
become a drug on the market. One hears a
good deal of talk about economic farm units.
I do not believe that is really farmers' talk;
it is the talk of people who are interested in
seeing individual farmers operate larger
farms and have to buy expensive machinery
to do so. Let me say, honourable senators,
that if a man is not a success on a small
farm, you are surely running a risk if you
advance him money to go into a large farming operation. If he is not efficient on a small
farm, there is much less chance that he will
be efficient on a large farm. Furthermore, if
he is an efficient operator he will make his
own arrangements for getting money to
operate the bigger farm.
This past autumn a man of only 54 years of
age, who lived near my home, died suddenly
in his truck. I was speaking to his brother
with a view to getting him to do some work
on my car, and he said that he was having
a lot of trouble over his brother's estate,
because pending the settlement of succession
duties the Government would allow him only
$500 to take the crop off. I asked him how
much land his late brother had, and he said
that he operated seven sections and had
about 80,000 bushels of wheat. Let me say
this: if he had been going a little slower he
might have been living today.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? Would he give
us the comparable cost of producing grain by
the older method of using horses and the
modern method of machine operations?
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is a pretty difficult
question to answer, but I can tell you what
my practice was when I used horses: I used to
figure on producing a thousand bushels of
wheat per horse. It must be remembered, of
course, that some men are skilful in handling
horses and know nothing about machinery,
while others are good mechanics and have no
ability for handling horses.
The great trouble with us today seems to
be that the only criterion is whether we can
make money or not. Perhaps we do make
money, only to die in a truck beside our
property. There seems to be little thought

NOVEMBER 21, 1957

given to what I regard as our primary purpose, that of raising good Canadian citizens;
and, to my mind, there is no better place to
raise them than on the farm. So much of what
we do takes away from our people their
ability and willingness to work; when we
discourage their desire to work, we take away
something that money cannot replace. The
most valuable asset of any nation is its people
and their homes.
We hear and read much today about the
amount of delinquency among young people.
Even when money and work are plentiful,
crime does not seem to let up. To my way of
thinking, we are perhaps setting a bad example for our young people. The honourable
senator from Medicine Hat (Hon. Mr. Gershaw) spoke with feeling about the terrible
loss of life through traffie accidents on the
highway. He pointed to the very good record
of the city of Medicine Hat in that respect.
I believe Saskatoon and Prince Albert also
have good accident records.
In this connection I should like to read an
article entitled "Cheated out of Life", which
appeared in the Montreal Gazette of November 14 last. Before doing so, may I remind
honourable senators of the bad example set
by a father who breaks traffic laws, and the
effect it may have on young people riding
with him. This is the article:
Since the beginning of this year, 115 persons have
lost their lives in traffic accidents on the streets
of Montreal. It is a painfully large number. And
it is all the worse when it is compared with last
year. In the same nine months of 1956 the total
was 97.
Perhaps there are always a certain number of
true accidents-accidents in which no one is to
blame. But it would seem likely that in most
cases "accidents do not happen. they are caused".
And most of them are caused by the cheaters.
A cheater, in anything, is the person who breaks
the rules. It is regarded as a very contemptible
thing if a person cheats when playing a card game,
or in a golf match. And yet the cheaters driving
their cars on the streets are always trying to
break the rules. Though the rules are laid down
for everyone's real benefit and safety, they are
-always being regarded as something to get the
better of.
At almost any intersection you can see cars
breaking the law by crossing in front of the
up-going traffic. Lanes that are reserved for the
use of motorists turning left or right on green
arrows are usurped by people going ahead, as
thereby they can beat the motorists holding their
place in line.

One can, well appreciate what effect this
course of conduct would have on a child who
is watching his parents closely. The article
continues:
Many motorists have only one idea and that is
to beat the car in front, even if it means exceeding
the speed limit, or breaking some other traffic
Jaw. Then there are those who cheat again and
again when it 'comes to switching from one lane
,f~traffic to another, throwing a whole stream of
'raffic into confusion.

96702-17

Not all the cheating is done by those in cars.
Pedestrians can cheat, too.
The . jaywalker is
risking other lives than his own; for a motorist,
trying to avoid hitting him, may cause a collision.
Perhaps. it is time when people ought to get their
values right. It seems odd that there should be
more moral censure against the person who cheats
at cards or on the golf course than for the
person who cheats on the highways. Yet it is
these traffie cheaters who run the risk of killing
By their cheating the greater
and maiming.
number of those 115 fatal accidents may have
been caused in the first nine months of this year.
The traffic cheater thinks it is all right if you
can get away with it. But it is a terrible thought
for anyone to have, that he was the means of
cheating someone else of his life.

I agree wholeheartedly with that article,
because I think it explains much of the general picture of carelessness among car
drivers.
Speaking of men and women, their character and stability, I am reminded of the
heroic escape two years ago of 9 Eskimos who
were marooned on an ice-floe. They were
given up for lost by the search planes. But
17 days later they walked into their own
village none the worse for their experience.
To me, that is a more heroic deed than putting a Sputnik into outer space.
On the subject of education, I would like
to point to our loss from Canada of many
trained persons. The point is well made in
an article entitled "3,000 Engineers quit
Canada in Five Years", which reads:
More than 3,000 engineers left Canada between
1951 and 1956, a figure equivalent to almost onethird of the graduating classes of that period and
10 per cent of all the professional engineers in
Canada. Eight hundred other scientists also left
Canada in those years.
These figures are contained in the annual report
of the Technical Service Council, released by the
chairman, Dr. Robert A. Bryce. The council is a
non-profit organization , which attempts to keep
engineers and scientists In Canada by finding them
jobs.
"The largest missile centre in the western world
could be set up with the Canadian scientists who
have emigrated to the United States recently,"
Dr. Bryce said.
"This depletion of our greatest
natural resource has been Increasing steadily. It
is likely to expand further now that young immigrants are in less danger of being drafted into
the U.S. armed forces."
In 1951 the graduate engineers who left for the
United States amounted to 11 per cent of the total
of the classes. By 1956 the figure had soared to 46
per cent. Last year more chemists emigrated than
were graduated.
"Many of these men, trained at great expense to
the taxpayers, are research workers with postgraduate degrees," Dr. Bryce said. "They leave
Canada because they cannot get positions in their
field of interest."
Higher salaries and the greater recognition given
In the.United States to postgraduate training, also
attract Canadians.
Terming this emigration a serious waste of the

SENATE
I want to say a special word of congratulation to honourable senators opposite and to
mention how pleased I am with the manner
in which they have acted since the change of
Government. Most if not all of them have
expressed satisfaction, and an attitude of that
kind is in the best interests of our two-party
system of Government. A very pleasant
atmosphere exists indeed. I may say that I
did not approve of the manner or the tone
of voice adopted by my Leader (Hon. Mr.
Haig) when he snapped a defiance at the
Opposition in this house to vote down the
Prairie Grain Advance Payments Bill. I did
not approve of that, in view of the fact
that we had been shown nothing but kindness.
Many of you have probably been reading
the articles in the Saturday Evening Post by
Bernard Baruch. He is known as an astute
operator in financial circles and has acted
as adviser to several Presidents. He says that
the market is the people, meaning that confidence on the part of the people is refiected
in the state of the market. I have not noticed
any honourable senator predicting blue ruin
for this country; but rather, honourable
senators have been talking the other way.
However, some would-be prominent members
of the other chamber have been going about
the country suggesting that depression faces
Canada now that the Conservative Party is
in power. That is one of the greatest disservices that can be rendered to this country
of ours, and I am happy to say I do not recollect any honourable senators being guilty
of this practice.
I myself believe what Bernard Baruch says,
that the market is the people. I would like to
apply that to our own aff airs with a minority
Government in power. Many honourable
senators probably believe that this Government lacks the stability and go-ahead that
perhaps Canadian businessmen and Canadian
investors would like to see in a Government
with an overall majority. So let me say, in
the kindest way I possibly can, honourable
senators, that you might be doing Canada a
service if you were to ask the Government
to go further with social legislation, and perhaps oppose it, the result of which would be
an early election in the best interests of
everyone in Canada. In speaking these words
I am speaking for myself alone, and I do so
with the kindest thoughts possible.
Honourable senators, I have talked longer
than I had intended. You have been very
patient, and I thank you.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Honourable senators, I
would like to ask a question of the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake, (Hon. Mr. Horner).
As everyone knows, for the past five or six
years large wheat crops have been harvested

in the west and there is a big surplus. Can
the honourable senator tell the house how
much it costs to grow a bushel of wheat in
Saskatchewan?
Hon. Mr. Horner: That is a very difficult
question to answer. I may say to the
honourable senator that he could drive from
village to village in the west and perhaps
receive a different answer, though given
honestly, from every farmer of whom he
asked that question.
Hon. L. M. Gouin: Honourable senators,
first of all, I wish to thank our senator from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner), for his remark
promising us an early election because, as he
understands it, it might be desirable to have
an early election. By way of introduction,
I wish to remark quite frankly that our attitude to some extent might be explained by
the fact that we are going to have a national
Liberal convention in the middle of January,
to choose a new leader.
Last year my honourable friend's party
was in practically the same situation as the
Liberal party is in now, and at that time
Mr. St. Laurent promised that we would
give to the Conservative party all the time
required to hold its convention and to prepare for the next campaign. This we did.
The Conservative party chose an excellent
leader, I have no doubt about that, and I say
that it is a matter of fair play to give to us
an opportunity to do the same thing, if our
democracy is to survive and operate properly.
Honourable senators, I wish to record
what an extraordinary privilege it was to
attend the opening of the present session of
Parliament by Her Majesty the Queen. That
she acted and spoke then as the Queen of
Canada is made clear beyond any doubt by
the first words of the Speech from the
Throne:
I greet you as your Queen. Together we constitute the Parliament of Canada. For the first
time the representatives of the people of Canada
and their sovereign are here assembled on the
occasion of the opening of Parliament. This is for
ail of us a moment to remember.

Yes, honourable senators, throughout our
lives we shall cherish, as a most precious
memory, the remembrance of that great day
which marked the beginning of a new chapter
in our national history. With great emotion,
at the end of her speech, we heard Her
Gracious Majesty express the wish that she
might count the glory of her crown to reign
in Canada with our loves and so to be remembered in the days to come. That wish is
already accomplished. A beloved monarch
is the living incarnation of the unity of our

NOVEMBER 21, 1957
Commonwealth. Her throne is based upon
the rock of freedom, not of compulsion. Our
free and voluntary association of sovereign
nations is strong because we are bound together, not by force, but by a common
heritage of parliamentary institutions and of
democratic traditions. Our loyalty to the
Crown is the result of our love, our admiration and respect for our radiant sovereign,
Elizabeth II.
It is my very pleasant task to offer congratulations to some honourable members of
this house.
(Translation):
Mr. Speaker, I would, first of all, offer you
my most heartfelt congratulations. From the
very first day you have fulfilled your delicate
and important functions with the greatest tact
and dignity. In appointing you, the Government has followed a well-established tradition in this bouse, whereby the Chair in the
Senate is occupied alternately by a Frenchspeaking and an English-speaking senator.
(Text):
I wish also to congratulate most sincerely-I hope he will allow me to call
him my friend-the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig). He is a parliamentarian of outstanding experience. I have
for him a great respect and friendship.
I welcome to this house all the newly appointed senators. I congratulate especially
the mover and seconder of the Address upon
their excellent speeches. Several of our new
members have contributed to our debates,
and in a very interesting and constructive
way. May I offer my sincere personal congratulations to my distinguished confrère, our
senator from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette).
Now I wish to discuss, as briefly as possible, some questions relating to international
affairs which were mentioned in the Speech
from the Throne. First of all I, although an
opponent of the Government, agree completely with the statement that our Commonwealth association is "a pervasive force for
good in an unquiet world". I am glad also to
note that this new Government will continue
to support the Colombo Plan. Some politicians
in Quebec during the last campaign blamed
the Liberal party for spending money to assist
underdeveloped countries, for des dons aux
étrangers-making gifts to foreigners. I am
glad to see that the Governnent paid no
attention to such criticism, and that, on the
contrary, larger amounts will be voted to this
very noble cause. Such assistance is as a
matter of fact the best means to combat
Communism.
I am also in full agreement with this Government's declaration thatCanada's active participation in NATO is essential
for the preservation of peace.
96702-17J

But, honourable senators, in recent times
our Atlantic unity has been faced with a
series of critical situations. Great Britain and
France decided alone to intervene in Egypt;
for some years Cyprus has been a crucial
problem in our relations with Greece; and
today France is indignant because Great
Britain and the United States have shipped
arms to Tunisia. Paris feels that some of
these arms might fall into the hands of
Algerian rebels; and Frenchmen say, "Our
sons will be killed with American and British
bullets." I do not pass judgment on anybody,
but I wish to call the attention of this house
to the seriousness of the present crisis, which
follows many others. Yesterday, in his address at the McGill Conference on World
Affairs, Mr. Pearson said:
In my opinion the dispute will be settled before
France withdraws.

That is from NATO.
It must be settled for the sake of Western unity.

Mr. Pearson added:
It is my hope that all NATO nations will have
access to atomic weapons.

But I ask the question, what are armaments
worth without a common policy, without
unity among our allies? May I repeat here
the words of the Right Honourable Louis
St. Laurent, spoken at Bonn on February 10,
1954:
Perhaps the time has now corne to consider
whether some of the steps toward closer integration which we must take if our concept of
civilization is not to perish should be taken within
the larger framework of the North Atlantic
community.

At all events, there is no conflict between
our allegiance to NATO and our adherence
to the United Nations. As stated in the
Speech from the Throne:
We continue to hope that through the United
Nations the aspirations of men and women for
peace and security will be fuIllled.

From the order of my quotations from the
Speech from the Throne and from various
addresses delivered outside this house, it
seems that the Government wants to put
emphasis on our Commonwealth relationship. Honourable senators are aware of my
loyalty to the Commonwealth, but from a
practical point of view we cannot ignore the
realities of geography and our national economy. I am convinced that our exports to the
United Kingdom and to the various parts of
the Commonwealth cannot be very much increased. It is desirable to seek new markets,
but such a process will require prolonged
efforts and will, I am convinced, achieve
at the best only a relative degree of success.
I realize the problems created by what I
would call our economic dependence upon

SENATE

policy on foreign affairs, and indeed our very
survival.
Honourable senators, Canada has acquired
in an outstanding way at the United Nations
the reputation of serving the cause of peace.
I trust that we will maintain that tradition.
What was achieved in the way of peace by
our former Secretary of State for External
Affairs, Mr. Pearson, won for him the Nobel
Peace Prize. That speaks for itself. Mr.
Pearson has become a legendary figure at

We may try to revise to some extent the

I come now to the vital question of our
national defence. On November 13, at Oklahoma City, President Eisenhower warned all
the world:

NOVEMBER 21, 1957
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
shall be only too pleased to commence my
remarks, on the understanding that I may
complete them when sittings are resumed
next week.
The presence of Her Majesty at the Opening of Parliament was a remarkable event.
She spoke with regal dignity and proverbial
tact, and personal charm and grace. What she
said so well in both official languages was
appreciated by all Canadians. What is much
more important is that she herself said that
she was here as Queen of Canada. She followed in the footsteps of her father, King
George VI, who sat previously in this chamber
as King of his Realm of Canada. Her Majesty
the Queen added something more, which
shall not be forgotten. And it was one of the
happy events of this session, which started
so well, and it has to be mentioned, that
Your Honour was appointed Speaker and now
occupies the Chair. It is a great honour, but
your task is easier than that of your colleague
in the House of Commons, who had to restore
the dignity of the House of Commons, while
you followed the tradition of the Senate,
which is very good; and in that line you are
true to the tradition established by the great
Speakers of both bouses, your able predecessors, and including the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), who
left his mark as an able and fair Speaker in
the House of Commons.
I would like, Mr. Speaker, to mention to
your colleagues of this bouse a very fine
article published a little while ago by Mr.
Marcel Gingras, in Le Droit, as correspondent
of that paper. The article is about yourself;
it contains no exaggeration, and it is a credit
to the Senate to see you in the Chair. Fine
tributes have been paid to you by all those
who have taken part in this debate, and they
have done so earnestly. For my part, I would
be pleased to put on record this article by
Mr. Marcel Gingras as part of my speech.
I think it would be more convenient for
English-speaking honourable members to
read it in the text of Hansard, if it is their
pleasure that it should be included.
(Translation):
The Speaker of the Senate is a credit to his
fellow-countrymen
Although it was to interview the Speaker of the
Senate that I entered the office of Hon. Mark
Drouin, I had, upon leaving it, obtained much more
information concerning the president of the
Théâtre du Nouveau-Monde than about the Upper
Chamber's young Speaker.
Chairman of the T.N.M.
An expert corporation lawyer as well as a very
successful criminologist. the Speaker of the Senate,
who was vice-president of the National Conservative
Association and party organizer in the Quebec
district from 1949 to 1956, bas, for the last few
months, been a governor of the National Drama

Festival.
First, and probably foremost, Hon.
Senator Mark Drouin is the founder of the Théâtre
du Nouveau-Monde and president of that drama
organization.
In 1951, having, quite by chance, met Jean
Gascon, Jean Louis Roux and Guy Hoffman, he
found twenty of his friends who, by promissory
notes, committed themselves to give financial help
to a group of arists. The now famous Théâtre du
Nouveau-Monde was founded.
From success to success
Far beyond the most optimistic forecasts, the
T.N.M., from its very first season, was a real
artistic
and financial success.
Such was its
financial success, indeed, that it bas not yet been
necessary to draw upon the $10,000 in promissory
notes put up by the patrons recruited by Mr.
Drouin. The artistic triumph of that first year, as
everyone knows, was Molière's L'avare.
Since then, the same artists have scored one
success after another. Two years ago they took
part in the Paris festival, and last year they
appeared at the Edinburgh festival. Next spring
they are going to Brussels, where they Intend to
put on three plays during the International Fair.
After their stay in Brussels, the players go to
Paris, where they propose to stay for three weeks
before visiting several French towns.
South America and Canada
Following their visit to France, the players will
journey to South America where, beginning with
Brazil, they are going on a scheduled tour. From
there they go to Vancouver, and thence to Montreal,
after playing before audiences throughout the
provinces. Their travels over, their regular season
opens at the beginning of November.
And they are already busy. For the past two
weeks they have been giving L'œil du peuple, a
play by André Langevin which received first prize
in the T.N.M. competition where 82 manuscripts
were considered.
Building of a theatre
Their renewed success this year at the Orpheum,
which bas a seating capacity of 1,200, encourages
the artists to build their own theatre as soon as
possible.
The 1,000-seat theatre they have in mind would
cost $400,000, the stage itself, with all necessary
facilities, involving an expenditure of $75,000. To
finance this large project, the T.N.M. proposes in
the spring to launch a public subscription. Funds
are already coming in, with the Quebec Government, the city of Montreal and Arts Council contributing $10,000 each.
The Speaker of the Senate
The cultural activities of the Speaker of the
Senate do not prevent him from fulfilling the
duties of his high office with all the required
dignity. Called to the Senate by Her Majesty
nine days before the opening of Parliament,
Senator Drouin is most grateful to the Senate staff
and to his colleagues who, by their kind advice,
have facilitated his work.
The duties of the Speaker are not over when
the meeting adjourns. The Speaker is also the
head of the Senate and, as such, directs its
internal economy. Jointly with the Speaker of the
House of Commons, he also presides over the
administration of the Parliamentary Library and
Restaurant.
The cordial atmosphere which prevails in the
Senate and throughout the city of Ottawa have
won over the new Speaker. Born of a Frenchspeaking father and a Scottish mother, Hon. Mark
Drouin expresses himself perfectly in the two
official languages of Canada. He bas friends both
among the French-speaking and the Englishspeaking groups.

SENATE
Sports
At the beginning of this article, attention was
drawn to the Speaker's interest in sports. Without
going into this subject to any undue length, it
might be pointed out that from 1936 to 1954, he
was First Vice-president and Governor of the senior
hockey league.
In 1954 he retired from that function in protest
against the hockey magnates' decision to enter
on the draft list the names of young players
without, beforehand, having consulted their parents.
Shortly afterwards, a bill sponsored in the House
of Commons by Mr. Bona Arsenault, proposed,
although it was later defeated, to put an end to
Ever since then, their parents'
this practice.
signature is required before young players can
be taken on by the major clubs.

(Text):
When something good happens to the
Senate I appreciate it very highly, and what
is remarkable is the fine co-operation that
exists between all members of the Senate.
Now, I congratulate the honourable Leader
(Hon. Mr. Haig). He has been in politics for
quite a long time; he knows politics from the
inside; he is a gentleman who has acquired
a great experience, and his leadership will, I
am sure, be as good as that of his immediate
predecessor (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), which is
no mean compliment.
I am glad to follow along the lines of the
speeches of the two honourable senators who
spoke before me, in welcoming the new honourable senators to this chamber. Not only
are they welcome, but they are more fortunate
than we were when we came here two years
ago. They have the opportunity to hear what
is said in the Senate, and they do not have to
breathe drowsy and thick air that puts one
to sleep. Also, the lighting is better. That is a
great improvement, and we no longer see a
shadow around or above us. What is more
important is that the walls are clean-everything is clean and brilliant in the Senate, just
as brilliant as my honourable colleagues
themselves. Well, that is something. But you
do not owe these improvements to any single
senator, you owe them to the good co-operation that has existed between all the members of the Senate to accomplish this reform.
It is more pleasant to work at desks in a
room that is worthy of you, and that was
worthy of Her Majesty. There are still some
other improvements to be made in due course,
and I am sure thatHon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask if the honourable gentleman intends to speak of the
galleries?
Hon Mr. Pouliot: I was just coming to that.
I hope that with regard to the gallery and the
ugly pictures on the wall we will have the
same co-operation from the junior senators as
there was between their admirable brethren

for the first reform. The reform is not complete. I thank the honourable senator froin
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) for his
suggestion. He has been interested in this
for a long time, and so have the honourable
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)
and others. The new galleries would not be
a huge undertaking; we could start with a
gallery at one side, and honourable senators
would see the difference it would make when
listening to debates. There have been improvements because of the installations of the
Bell Telephone Company for better hearing
in this chamber. Of course, the system is not
perfect, and if we have new galleries it
would not be much better. However, honourable senators, if you desire some more information about this, why do you not go to
see Mr. Armstrong, Chief Clerk of Committees,
who has the plans that were made some time
ago and left on the shelf? The plans will
explain to you what would be an important
improvement for the Senate chamber.
Repairs were made in order that the
Senate chamber might be in decent condition when Her Majesty came. Are we not
all pleased with what has been accomplished?
Once again, it was the result of co-operation.
Honourable senators, I would not express
my personal feelings if I did not congratulate
very warmly the mover of the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne (Hon.
Mr. White), whom I had the pleasure to
meet and sit with in the House of Commons
for many years, and who has had a remarkable career as a member of Parliament. Also,
it gives me pleasure to welcome and congratulate the honourable seconder (Hon. Mr.
Méthot), who made a most interesting speech.
I was delighted to listen to him.
I would like to mention another happy
event, which has not been mentioned here
yet, but which reflects honour upon the
Senate. I refer to the election of one of our
colleagues as mayor of the metropolis of
Canada: I mean the election of the Honourable
Sarto Fournier as Mayor of Montreal, the
largest city in Canada. It is a signal honour,
and he deserves our warmest congratulations.
I think highly of the Prime Minister of
each province. Each is the first citizen in his
province. First there is the Prime Minister
of Canada, then each of the provincial Prime
Ministers, and in my view the gentleman who
comes next is the Mayor of Montreal. Toronto
is pretty big but it is not as large as Montreal.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My friend has reversed
the order; other than that he is right.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I am always pleased
when my honourable friend is here; he is an
inspiration to me, with his friendly smile
and pleasant remarks.

NOVEMBER 21, 1957
Honourable senators, the topie on which I
want to say a few words to you is one of
great importance, and one which was mentioned in a Canadian Press dispatch of October 15 last. The item is entitled "Plan to
establish Bill of Rights studied at Ottawa",
and it reads as follows:
The Justice Department is giving earnest consideration to legislation embodying a bill of rights
for Canada, Prime Minister Diefenbaker said today.
He was replying in the Commons to Alistair
Stewart (C.C.F., Winnipeg North) who asked when
legislation establishing a bill of rights might be
introduced.
The Prime Minister said the Justice Department
is looking into the possibility of establishing a bill
of rights. Before this could be done, the department had to study it carefully in order to "bring
together all the questions that must be given
consideration".

This is a matter of considerable importance
to all Canadians; there are so many who say,
we need a Bill of Rights in Canada. Many
honourable senators will be surprised when I
tell them that we have such a Bill of Rights
in one of our provinces and that it dates
back before Confederation; and if the province of Ontario also does not have one, it is
because that province has dropped it from
its Statute Book.
If we go back more than a hundred years
ago, to the time of the LaFontaine-Baldwin
Government, we will see in the statutes, which
one will find in the library, a very important
statute which contains the Bill for the
abolition of the Clergy Reserves. What you
may find particularly interesting is that the
law for the freedom of religion is found in
the preamble of the Act for abolition of the
Clergy Reserves. It reads as follows:
Whereas the recognition of legal equality among
all Religious Denominations is an admitted principle
of Colonial Legislation; And whereas in the state
and condition of this Province, to which such a
principle is peculiarly applicable, it is desirable
that the same should receive the sanction of direct
Legislative Authority recognizing and declaring the
same as a fundamental principle of our civil
polity: . . .
And it is hereby declared and enacted by the
authority of the same, That the free exercise and
enjoyment of Religious Profession and Worship.
without discrimination or preference, so as the
same be not made an excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of practices inconsistent
with the peace and safety of the Province, is by the
constitution and laws of this Province allowed to
all Her Majesty's subjects within the same.

This is to be found in (1851) 14 and 15
Vict., Ch. 175, sec. 1. It is also to be
found in the Revised Statutes of United Canada (1859)-which was eight years before
Confederation-Ch. 74; and in the Revised
Statutes of Quebec (1888)-the first revised
statutes published after Confederation-sec.
3439; in the Revised Statutes of Quebec
(1909), sec. 4387; in the Revised Statutes
of Quebec (1925) ch. 198; and in the last
Revised Statutes of Quebec (1941), ch. 307.

Those are the titles of nobility of this
statute, which has been jealously kept by
the Province of Quebec in its statute books.
The same was done twice by the Province
of Ontario, and it appeared in the Consolidated Statutes of 1877 and 1887. For your
information, honourable senators, I will read
you the text of the law of Ontario, which
was similar to that of 1852, and which has
been preserved as a treasure by the Province of Quebec:
The free exercise and enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or

preference, provided the same be not made an
excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification
of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety
of the Province, is by the constitution and laws
of this Province assured to al Her Majesty's
subjects within the same.

That is from the Consolidated Statutes of
Ontario 1877, ch. 215, sec. 1. That same
section was also in the Consolidated Statutes
of Ontario 1887, Volume 2, page 236, at
the time when Sir Oliver Mowat was Prime
Minister of Ontario, but in the following
Consolidation it was, unfortunately, dropped.
My point is that the continuation and
preservation of the same legislation in the
Statute Book of the province of Quebec
shows that it has been considered as provincial legislation from the start and that it
has remained such.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask the honourable senator a question? He said it was
dropped from the Consolidated Statutes of
Ontario. Was it repealed by the Legislature?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I cannot answer that
question of the honourable gentleman, but
what I must tell him is that I have not found
it in any editions of the Consolidated Statutes
of Ontario after those of 1887. If we look at
the Consolidated Statutes of Ontario that
are now in force we do not flnd it there.
It was dropped in the editions that followed
that of 1887 and it was not placed on the
Statute Book thereafter.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: But did you find an
act repealing it?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No. It was probably just
dropped by those who were doing the consolidation of the statutes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask my honourable friend whether he is aware of another
important statute, prier to the one of which
he has spoken? I think the very first statute
placed on the Statute Book of the Legislature
of the Province of Upper Canada provided for
the abolition of slavery.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Oh, yes. But I am not
discussing that for the time being; I am
speaking of freedom of religion only.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would the honourable
gentleman allow me to interrupt him for a
moment? I would like to call his attention,
as well as that of others, Mr. Speaker, to the
fact that we have present just one senator
more than a quorum. If the house fails to
hold a quorum we shall have to sit tomorrow.
I certainly will not get caught like this again.
I think we will have to send out and see if
any other members can be brought in, because if we lose a quorum we automatically
go over till tomorrow.
The Hon. the Speaker: I was watching that
very closely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think we ought to take
some action to see that no one else leaves
the house.
Hon. Thomas Reid: I wanted to leave, but I
realized there was just a bare quorum here.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Once a quorum is lost we
automatically go over till the next day.
The Hon. the Speaker: I suggest that the
two Whips see that the attendance is kept
above a quorum.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The trouble is that
if the two Whips leave we won't have a
quorum.
The Hon. the Speaker: One at a time.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: I would request those
who are present not to leave the chamber.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
am in your hands. If you want me to continue I can do so, or if it is your pleasure I
will adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. Quinn: Continue.

by the Parliament of Canada, were then
alive, yet they did not suggest putting that
legislation in the Revised Statutes of Canada.
Now, honourable senators, let us look at
section 129 of the British North America Act.
I am trying to make a very serious argument in order that no one may miss the point
which was unfortunately overlooked by the
Supreme Court of Canada in a recent case.
That is why I would like to adjourn the debate to next week, in order to give more
precise information about the matter. Section
129 of the British North America Act, 1867
is as follows:

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I hope that everybody
understands my point, which is that that
legislation dates back a long time, to the
time of the Union régime which existed
before Confederation; and my argument for
the Province of Quebec is good also for the
Province of Ontario.
The Province of Quebec has kept its
statute, and so did the Province Ontario
after Confederation, but we do not find that
legislation in the Statute Book of the Dominion of Canada at all. The Canadian Government did not touch this legislation, and this is
the more remarkable because at the time of the
first revision of consolidations of the Statutes
of both Ontario and Quebec many Fathers
of Confederation were still alive. They were
also in Parliament at the time of the first
consolidation of the Dominion Statutes after
Confederation. These gentlemen, who were
familiar with the legislation of 1851, which
was kept in force at first by both Ontario
and Quebec and which was left untouched

At the time that the Act of Confederation
was passed, the Civil Code of the Province
of Quebec had been in force one year-from
1866. But the Civil Code did not comprise
all the civil laws of the Province of Quebec:
there were many other civil enactments
which were not included, and one of them was
the act concerning the freedom of religion.
Religion is a highly personal right, and a
civil right. No one can deny that statement.
But some judges have done so; they have contended that, because the act had not been
amended or repealed by the Parliament of
Canada, it followed-strange to say-that it
was a dominion statute, a civil right which
belongs to the jurisdiction of Parliament.
What an absurdity! In virtue of section 129
of the British North America Act, 1867, al]
the body of laws that existed in Canada,
which comprised those of the provinces of
Ontario and Quebec as well as Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick, together formed the
respective corpus juris of the provinces. But

129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act,
all Laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New
Brunswick at the Union, and all Courts of Civil
and Criminal Jurisdiction, and all legal Commissions, Powers, and Authorities, and all Officers,
Judicial, Administrative, and Ministerial, existing
therein at the Union, shall continue in Ontario,
Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick respectively, as if the Union had not been made;
subject nevertheless-

I omit a few lines, which refer to Imperial
statutesto be repealed, abolished, or altered by the
Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the
respective Province, according to the Authority of
the Parliament or of that Legislature under this
Act.

Now, having read practically the whole
article, may I quote from it only that which
concerns my argument. It is as follows:
129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act,
all Laws in force in Canada . . . shall continue in
Ontario, Quebec . . . respectively, as if the
Union had not been made; subject nevertheless
. . . to be repealed, abolished or altered by the
Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature of the
respective Province, according to the Authority
of the Parliament or of that Legislature under this
Act.

NOVEMBER 21, 1957
some of the legislation which had been left
until then to the provinces was, by the Act
of Confederation, transferred to the Parliâment of Canada. Therefore one cannot do
other than understand the spirit and the letter
of section 129 of the British North America
Act to mean that the acts which had been
under the authority of the provinces until
the time of Confederation were of two kinds,
namely, those which were transferred to the
jurisdiction of Ottawa and those which remained within the jurisdiction of the respective provinces. That is as clear as spring
water.
Having made this explanation, I shall read
again the part of section 129 which relates
to my argument; and all of you will see that
there was some legislation which belonged to
the federal jurisdiction and could be repealed
or amended only by Parliament, and some
other legislation which belonged to the provinces, as being under their jurisdiction, and
could be repealed or amended only by the
provinces themselves.
129. Except as otherwise provided by this Act,
ail Laws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia . . . at
the Union . . . shall continue in Ontario and
Quebec respectively, as if the Union had not been
made; subject nevertheless . . . to be repealed,
abolished or altered by Parliament of Canada, or

I repeat, "or".
by the Legislature of the respective Province,
according to the Authority of the Parliament or of
that LegisIature under this Act.

This section is very clear. There is no
clouded issue. Parliament can abolish or
alter only legislation which has been
expressly transferred to its jurisdiction from
the body of provincial laws which were then
in force, but the remainder evidently belongs
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces,
which alone can repeal or amend it. Therefore I cannot understand how it is that the
Suprerne Court decided, quite recently, that
freedom of religion is a federal issue, and
comes under the jurisdiction of Parliament.
It could not be so. It is not. I hope my
views are not judged otherwise than as I
express them, but I regret to a certain extent
the abolition of the Privy Council, which
would have been like the sword of Damocles
over the Supreme Court of Canada. I say
this, not because the decisions of the Privy
Council are always right, but it would have
forced the Supreme Court judges to be more
careful in their rulings.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask my honourable friend to what cases he is referring?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I am referring to the
case of the Witnesses of Jehovah, and I am
sure that my honourable friend knows it
very well. En passant, may I say I regret very
much that we have more opinions than
96702-18

judgments in the reports of the Supreme
Court, and it is very difficult to find the
meaning of a judgment among the heterogeneous opinions contained in the notes of
the judges.
Honourable senators, that is the foundation
of what I intend to discuss briefly when the
house resumes next week. I wanted to lay a
foundation today for my argument, on a
subject which is of great importance. How
many people say "We are for the freedom
of religion"? We are all for it. Freedom of
religion is accepted in this country, but it
is a matter of provincial jurisdiction. If
the Province of Ontario wants certain legislation concerning freedom of religion, then let
the Ontario Government pass such legislation. It is under their jurisdiction. The
Parliament of Canada has no jurisdiction
whatever in the matter. It would be absurd
to deprive the Province of Quebec of the
rights that it has cherished and kept for so
long.
I shall take the house in my confidence
before adjourning the debate and tell honourable senators why I suggested in this
house recently that the ten provincial Prime
Ministers be appointed to the Privy Council.
A Prime Minister of a province is the first
citizen of his province, and if the ten provincial Prime Ministers were Privy Councillors,
they would come here as the accredited
representatives of their provinces on an equal
footing with the Prime Minister of Canada.
This would be for the very good and obvious
reason that the federal Parliament has
exclusive jurisdiction in certain matters and
the provincial Legislatures have exclusive
jurisdiction in other matters. Each province
has authority in its domain, and the federal
Parliament has authority in its domain. I
think it would be wise to follow my. suggestion. However, I am not going to repeat
what I have already said in this connection.
I appreciate the interest that my honourable colleagues have shown in my
presentation of this matter, which is of the
utmost importance to all Canadians. I must
tell them now that, whatever may be said,
if they want to go to a part of Canada which
is a land of liberty, they have only to go to
the province of Quebec.
Honourable senators, I move the adjournment of the debate.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the Honourable Senator Pouliot, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Veniot, for the adjournment of the debate. Is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Haig: On division.

PRIVATE BILL
ST. MARY'S RIVER BRIDGE COMPANYSECOND READING

Hon. William H. Golding moved the second
reading of Bill 0-5, respecting St. Mary's
River Bridge Company.
He said: Honourable senators, I am moving the second reading of this bill on behalf
of my colleague and room-mate, the honourable senator from Algoma (Hon. Mr.
Farquhar), who is unavoidably absent as a
result of a serious operation. I am glad to
report that the honourble senator is making
good progress toward recovery.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Golding: The St. Mary's River
Bridge Company was incorporated by an
act of the Parliament of Canada passed on
May 4, 1955. The act authorized the company to construct, maintain and operate a
bridge or tunnel across or under the St.
Mary's River at or near the city of Sault Ste.
Marie, Ontario. The act was passed on the
instigation of the Council of the City of
Sault Ste. Marie, which, for a number of
years prior to the passing of the act, had
maintained a committee to take steps towards
securing a bridge or tunnel, and to study
and advise the Council in regard to the possibility of so doing.
One hundred and forty-one shares of the
capital stock consisting of a total of 150
shares of the company are owned by the
Corporation of the City of Sault Ste. Marie,
Canada. At the time the act was passed in
1955 it had the support of many civic and
political groups in the area to be served by
the bridge or tunnel.
Section 18 of the act provided that if
approval of the Governor in Council to the
bridging or tunnelling had not been obtained
within three years of the passing of the act,
the powers granted for the construction would
cease and be null and void. The purpose
of the bill now before the house is to amend
that section in order to grant an extension of
a further three years to obtain such approval.
Any bridge or tunnel to be constructed
must, of course, have the approval and cooperation of United States authorities. In
accordance with the terms of the act of incorporation, the rights and powers of the
company were transferred to the International
Bridge Authority of Michigan to enable it to
proceed with the financing and construction
of the project. There have been some unavoidable delays in connection with arranging

for the financing of the project, and the
necessity of amending legislation of the State
of Michigan, and it may not be possible for
the company to obtain approval of the Governor in Council as required by section 18
within the three-year limit. For the reasons
stated, Parliament is being asked to amend
the incorporating act to extend the time for
obtaining the approval of the Governor in
Council from three to six years.
Honourable senators, if this bill receives
second reading, I shall move that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications, the committee
which dealt with the original bill that was
passed in 1955.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Agreed.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Golding, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday,
November 21, consideration of Her Majesty
the Queen's Speech at the opening of the
session and the motion of Hon. Mr. White,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Méthot, for an Address
in reply thereto.

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, at the outset of my remarks on the
Address on Thursday last I paid compliments to the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald); and, as
happens often, I find myself penalized for
the good that I say about someone. It is unfortunate, but it happens at times. I was
very much surprised when the honourable
gentleman opposite said "On division" when
I moved the adjournment of the debate at
the conclusion of my remarks. During my
long experience in Parliament I never before
knew a leader of any party to call out "On
division" when a member moved the adjournment of a debate.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not recall having
said that the other day.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: No, it was the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig). I paid
him a great compliment by comparing him
to the present Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald). My compliment would have
been even greater, for I would have compared him to his two predecessors, if he had
not handled the old age legislation in the
manner he did. But I thought it was very
complimentary to compare him to the Leader
of the Opposition. I have too much regard
for the Leader of the Government to withdrawn what I said about him. I only express
my regret at what was done on that occasion.
I hope it will not constitute a precedent, and
that in future when a debate is adjourned,
according to the good will of my honourable
colleagues, there will be no expression of
division.
Another regret I have is that the Government has paid no attention to my suggestion
for the appointment of the ten provincial
Prime Ministers as Privy Councillors. My
suggestion was the only one made which, if
carried out, would have cost nothing, except
the price of a Bible for each Prime Minister.
It would have honoured them and put them
on a footing of equality with the cabinet
ministers who form the Government of
Canada, and if the provincial Prime Ministers
are not to get any more from the Government it would have at least shown what the
late Mr. Mackenzie King called good will.
The third remark I wish to make, before
I continue with my argument concerning a
very important constitutional issue, is a
reference to the fact that some eminent
speakers claim that a distinctive Canadian
flag should not carry the emblem of any
other nation. This is not satisfactory. It
seems to me that one should be more precise
and say exactly the kind of flag that one
wants to have, because, as it is described
by some people, it is just an abstractiort In

SENATE
order that people might understand what is
meant by those who advocate a national flag,
a complete description should be given. For
instance, with regard to the Canadian flag,
if you say you do not want on that flag
the emblem of any other nation or country,
that does not indicate what you do wish to
have on the flag. Somebody might like to
have on the flag a picture of a nice big
pumpkin, a vegetable that is grown by many
people in Canada, and it could be described
as our national emblem. I favour the maple
leaf, which I find more noble than the
pumpkin. That shows that the question of
the flag should be discussed in more precise
manner, in order to be better understood by
the people; but as we are not to have a
national flag for quite a long time I will
come back to my legal argument.
What I am discussing now means much
more to the people of Canada than all the
promises of the Government together, and
more than the promises made by all the
candidates in any election, because it refers
to spiritual values, to the freedom of religion,
to the right to exercise one's religious duty
as one thinks fit. It is a very serious matter,
and my contention is that according to the
Constitution of this country it is evident that
jurisdiction in this matter belongs unmistakably to Legislatures and not to Parliament.
If we go back to the Address that was
voted by the Legislature of Canada in 1866
we see the first draft of the British North
America Act. It is particularly interesting,
and it appears at the end of that book with
which all honourable senators are very
familiar, that is the Debates on Confederation
of the British North American Provinces,
Third Session, Eighth Parliament, 1865.
There is the list of the powers of Parliament,
which is called the General Parliament. But
that list refers, in particular, to trade and
commerce, customs, excise duties, postal
service, ships, railways, telegraph communications, census, militia, navigation and
shipping, quarantine, currency and coinage,
and
weights
banks,
savings
banking,
measures, bills of exchange, bankruptcy and
insolvency, copyrights, naturalization and
aliens, criminal law etc. All of that at the
time of the union of the government of
United Canada of 1840 to 1867 was under the
jurisdiction of the provinces. That address
was brought before the Parliament at Westminster and was amended, and the unfortunate part is that we have not the Votes and
Proceedings of the House of Lords and of
the House of Commons at Westminster, but
only a few of the amendments which were
made by the Commons and by the House of
Lords. We have not all the amendments,

but we have the British North America Act
as it came into force in 1867, and it is enough
to prove our argument.
Well, there have been some very important
amendments passed by both Houses of
Parliament in London, England, for instance,
with regard to paragraph 45 of that address.
At the time of the coming into force of
the B.N.A. Act, there were two distinct
categories of laws in the Statute Book of
United Canada: those which remained under
provincial jurisdiction, and those which were
transferred
to
federal
jurisdiction, in
accordance with the new Constitution. The
second part of section 129 of the B.N.A. Act,
from "subject nevertheless", granted to the
Parliament of Canada the power "to repeal,
abolish, or alter" the formerly provincial
laws which were turned over to the authority
of Parliament, and, on the other hand, to the
Legislatures of the provinces the power "to
repeal, abolish or alter" the provincial acts
which had remained under the authority of
the Legislatures under the B.N.A. Act.
There is no other possible interpretation
than that the powers of Parliament and those
of the Legislatures are absolutely and
positively distinct. Parliament has no more
authority to repeal, abolish, or alter the
provincial laws which were remaining under
provincial jurisdiction than had any province
to repeal, abolish, or alter the laws which
had been previously under provincial jurisdiction and were transferred to Parliament
by the B.N.A. Act. Section 129 of that act
had surely its raison d'être in making a
distinction which was imperative and which
allowed Parliament and the Legislatures to
function normally within the limits of their
respectively exclusive jurisdictions.
Upper and Lower Canada were on a footing
of equality; both had the same legislative
powers and the same statutes. It is evident
that there was then no question, as there is
today, of conflicting jurisdictions, nor of
making any distinction between the legislative jurisdiction of the provinces, which was
in force at the time, and the federal jurisdiction, which did not yet exist. Therefore, the
legislation adopted by the united provinces
before Confederation could only be provincial, whatever were its subject-matter and
its scope. With the only exception of that
part which has been transferred to dominion
jurisdiction by virtue of section 91 of the
British North America Act, which deals with
the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament, all
the legislation of Upper and Lower Canada
which was in force at the time of Confederation has remained exclusively provincial. It
has not been affected by the change of the

NOVEMBER 27, 1957
Constitution; it has stayed in the provincial
statute books exactly "as if the union had not
been made".
The demarcation between provincial and
federal legislation by the Confederation Act
has necessitated such a division of the provincial acts which were then in force. Some
have kept their purely provincial character
and have remained in the corpus juris of the
provinces by virtue of section 129 of the
British North America Act, while others have
by section 91 been transferred to the jurisdiction of Parliament.
All the provincial acts have not ceased to
remain provincial legislation. The intention of the Fathers of Confederation was unmistakable. The forty-third paragraph of
the first Address which was voted in March
18, 1865, to demand federal union, read thus:
43. The Local Legislatures shall have power to
make laws respecting the following subjects:
15. Property and Civil Rights, excepting those portions thereof assigned to the General Parliament.

The forty-fifth paragraph read as follows:
In regard to all subjects over which jurisdiction
belongs to both the General and Local Legislatures,
the laws of the General Parliament shall control
and supersede those made by the Local Legislature,
and the latter shall be void sa far as they are
repugnant to, or inconsistent with, the former.

That was the principle which was strongly
objected to by the provinces; and part of the
Address was removed, and substituted therefor was section 129 of the British North
America Act, which I put on Hansard last
Thursday. I read the full text. It was
drafted hastily; nevertheless, the letter and
the spirit of the law are clear. I hope
honourable senators will have time to check
the quotation in the act itself. It should
read as follows:
Except as otherwise provided by this act, all
laws in force in Canada, . . . shall continue in
Ontario, Quebec . . . respectively, as if the
union had not been made;

This is the first part of the new section
129, which is entirely different from what we
find in the first draft of the Address of 1865.
The second part makes a condition:

repealed,

abollshed or altered by the Parliament of Canada,
according to the authority of the Parliament under
this Act, or by the Legislature of the respective
Province, according to the authority of the

Legislature under this Act.

This is how section 129 of the British North
America Act should read, had it been drafted
in a better way; but in spite of the manner
in which it was drafted, it is easy to understand that such was the intent of the law
makers-I mean the Fathers of Confederation.
It is clear, after having read sections 91
and 92 concerning the exclusive rights of
Parliament and on the other hand the

exclusive rights of the Legislatures, that the
Imperial Parliament was not to pass another
section that would destroy the meaning of
what had been enacted in previous sections
91 and 92. It would be illogical to contend
that the power to repeal, abolish or alter
under section 129 of the British North
America Act could be exercised indiscriminately by Parliament and the Legislatures in
the federal domain and as well in the provincial domain.
To fix the bounds of the respective jurisdictions of Parliament and of the Legislatures,
section 129 of the British North America Act
has as much importance as sections 91 and
92, and section 129 should even have preceded
the other two sections in the act, because
it deals with legislation that was already
existing and in force at the time of the
coming into force of the British North
America Act, while sections 91 and 92 enumerate a power which Parliament and the
Legislatures could exercise in the future, in
subsequent sessions of Parliament and the
Legislatures. Therefore, sections 91 and 92
are complementary to section 129.
What has to be recalled is that the legislation concerning freedom of religion has been
preserved by the Provinces of Ontario and
Quebec. In Ontario that legislation remained
on the Statute Book as long as Sir Oliver
Mowat was in power. Sir Oliver Mowat was
one of the keenest legal minds of the time,
and he had a most distinguished career. He
studied law with Sir John A. Macdonald. He
was a commissioner for consolidating the
Public General Statutes for Canada and
Upper Canada in 1856. He was a member of
the Quebec Conference, held in 1864, to discuss the union of the provinces. He was Provincial Secretary in the Brown-Dorion administration; then Postmaster General in two
other administrations, from May 1863 until
November 14, 1864. He was Premier and
Attorney General of the province of Ontario
from October 31, 1872 to July 9, 1896. He was
summoned to the Senate and appointed
Minister of Justice in the Laurier administration in July 1896. Sir Oliver Mowat had
great experience in statutory matters. He had
contributed to the consolidation of the statutes.
He knew what it was all about. As long as
he was head of the Government of the province of Ontario the legislation concerning
freedom of religion remained in the Statute
Book of that province.
. The Province of Quebec has kept the legislation as a treasure. I am not going to repeat
the titles of nobility or the statutory references I mentioned the other day, which show
that the Province of Quebec has kept the
statute about freedom of religion in its Revised Statutes. It is still there and its terminology has not been changed at all.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask the honourable gentleman a question? I understood him
to say that the Ontario act bas been dropped
from the Revised Statutes of that province,
but does he know whether it has been
repealed? My understanding is that an act
can be dropped from the Revised Statutes but
still remain in effect.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: If my honourable friend
will permit me, I never said that it was not
in effect in the province of Ontario; I said
that it was dropped from the consolidation.
What I say is that as long as Sir Oliver
Mowat was Premier of Ontario it remained
in the Statute Book of Ontario, but we do
not find it in the consolidation of 1897,
which was completed in 1902, although it
might still be in force according to the law
of that province. I am not in a position to
discuss that point now; it does not come into
my argument, which is that a man like Sir
Oliver Mowat, who was familiar with all the
details pertaining to Confederation, kept that
statute in the Statute Book of the province
of Ontario. The fact that the Fathers of
Confederation from the province of Quebec
did likewise shows that these men, who were
legislators of the time, considered that legislation as provincial, and the more so because
the Government of Canada did not incorporate it in the dominion Statute Book. It has
never been there; it has never been considered
a dominion statute.
Honourable senators, both the provinces of
Saskatchewan and Alberta have passed Bills
of Rights in virtue of section 92 the British
North America Act, but the case of the
province of Quebec is entirely different. Quebec has had that statute in its Statute Book
since 1851, when it was passed, and 1852,
when it came into force on sanction of the
late Queen Victoria in person. It was considered a provincial act, and there is a
reference to it even in the statutes, not only
in the Statutes of United Canada, 1859, but
in the Statutes of Lower Canada, where it is
marked with a (C) in the index, which means
that it belongs to Lower Canada; and it
refers to the full text, which is to be found
in the Statutes of the United Provinces of
Canada for 1859.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Would
the honourable senator permit a question?
Would he give the citation for that legislation in the Revised Statutes of Quebec? It
might be useful to have that on the record.
And would he also say when it was dropped
from the Revised Statutes of Ontario? Was it
ever in the Revised Statutes of Ontario after
1867?

Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Yes, surely. I mentioned
it last Thursday. For the sake of the argument I will read from the text of the statute
which is in the Ontario consolidation of 1877:
The free exercise and enjoyment of religious
profession and worship, without discrimination or
preference, provided the same be not made an
excuse for acts of licentiousness, or a justification
of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety
of the Province, is by the constitution and laws
of this Province assured to all Her Majesty's subjects within the same.

That is from the Consolidated Statutes of
Ontario, 1877, Ch. 215, sec. 1. That same
section was also in the Consolidated Statutes
of Ontario. 1887. volume 2. Ch. 236.
This is the same text and the same kind
of legislation as is now in force in the
province of Quebec. As I stated to the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), subsequent to 1887, in the consolidation which, as the honourable senator
from Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly)
knows, was begun in 1897 and completed in
1902, no one can find this enactment, nor does
it appear in the subsequent consolidations.
This fact does not constitute a reflection on
those who made the consolidation of the
Statutes of Ontario. My purpose in mentioning it is to establish that from the beginning
both the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec
regarded that legislation as provincial legislation; and the Government of Canada never
raised a finger either to include it in the
dominion statutes or to intervene in any case
under it.
This enactment had been in force as a provincial statute of Quebec for more than a
century when, in 1953, a case was brought
by the Witnesses of Jehovah before the
Superior Court. It is Saumur versus the City
of Quebec, and is reported in Canada Supreme Court Reports (1953), pages 299 to 389.
There was an intervention in that case from
the Attorney General of Quebec but none
on behalf of the Government of Canada. It
was deemed to be a private affair between
Mr. Saumur and the City of Quebec. What
happened will, I hope, interest my colleagues.
Distribution was made of some pamphlets
which contained gross insults against those
professing the Catholic faith. These circulars
were confiscated by the Chief of Police of the
City of Quebec. I hate to read the summary
of the evidence given by Mr. Covington, who
is vice-president of the Witnesses of Jehovah.
We hear so much about freedom of this and
freedom of that, that I want to put squarely
and honestly before the Senate the question
of where we stand with regard to freedom,
and whether, if there is to be continual abuse
and insult by some who declare themselves
against all religions, including the Jewish
faith, those who act in this fashion can be

quotations from pamphlets which it was in- to the effect that federal legislation could be
tended to distribute in the City of Quebec, amended by Parliament and that provincial
and which are an insult to the belief of the legislation could be amended by the provinces. Then he goes on to say, at page 321:
large majority of Quebecers:
. . . Religion is the adulteress and idolatress
that befriends and commits religious fornication
with the political and commercial elements. She
is the lover of this world and blesses the world
from the balcony of the Vatican and in the pulpits.
Religion, whose most powerful representative has
ruled from Rome for sixteen centuries, traces
her origin all the way back to Babylon of Nimrod's
founding, and organized religion deservedly bears
the name Babylon . . .

By virtue of this section that part of the preConfederation statute extracted above continued
to operate in the Province of Quebec at the time
of the coming into force of the British North
America Act.

I have too much respect for my honourable
colleagues to go on reading this, but I will
read just one question that was put to the
witness Covington, and his answer:

The Quebec Legislature at that time, which
was a long time ago, did not enact "legislation practically in the same words, and
certainly to the same effect".

Q. Do you consider necessary for your organization to attack the other religions, in fact, the
Catholic, the Protestant and the Jews?

which legislation bas been continued from time
to time and is now found in section 2 of R.S.Q.
1941, chapter 307, The Freedom of Worship Act.

All religions without exception.

That statement is wrong. The Quebec
Legislature did not enact legislation "practically in the same words". It kept the same
legislation, which is entirely different. It was
not new legislation adopted in virtue of any
section of the B.N.A. Act. It was the same
legislation, kept in virtue of section 129, and
not section 92 of the B.N.A. Act.
I continue to read from page 321:

A. Indeed. The reason for that is because the
Almighty God commands that error shall be exposed and not persons or nations.

It goes on like that. I presume honourable
senators have heard enough to realize that
if any one of you had been the Chief of
Police of the city of Quebec you would have
confiscated those pamphlets. They go beyond bounds. What was the reaction of the
courts about it? The Superior Court rejected
the action and its judgment was maintained
by the Court of Appeal. In the Supreme
Court of Canada there was a division of 4
to 5. Two justices were in favour of maintaining the judgment of the Court of Appeal,
and two others did not express themselves
about that point. They spoke about the

That is true.
Since then the Quebec Legislature enacted legislation practically in the same words, and certainly
to the same effect,

a question of superseding any statute. It was

no statutes such as the Quebec City Charter, In
the general terms in which they are expressed,
and whenever originally enacted, have the effect
of abrogating the specific terms of the enactment
providing for freedom of worship.

SENATE
There was a charter of the City of Quebec
which was a pre-Confederation statute, but
it had nothing to do with the Freedom of
Worship Act, although both were preConfederation statutes. The question of freedom of religion was brought in very cleverly
by the solicitor for Saumur in order to disturb the minds of the judges. By using that
statute on behalf of his own client he prevented the other side from using it against
him. This is why the minds of the judges
were so confused. It was a very clever move.
Then the judgment goes on:
It appears from the material filed on behalf of
the appellant that Jehovah's Witnesses not only
do not consider themselves as belonging to a
religion but vehemently attack anything that may
ordinarily be so termed but in my view they are
entitled to "the free exercise and enjoyment of
(their) Religious Profession and Worship".

They deny all religion, they insult everybody. Are they entitled to the privileges of
those who worship? I wonder if there is
anyone in this chamber who can explain it
to me.
The Witnesses attempt to spread their views by
way of the printed and written word as well as
orally and state that such attempts are part of
their belief. Their attacks on religion generally,
or on one in particular, do not bring them within

attempt to spread their beliefs, as I think they have,
the expressions used by them in so doing, as
exemplified in the exhibits filed, do not fall within
the first part of the exception. Nor in my opinion
are their attacks "inconsistent with the peace and
safety of the province" even where they are
directed particularly against the religion of most
of the province's residents.

It was a strange way to consider the
evidence in that case. But there was another
judge who spoke in a manner that cannot
be understood. It was very strange, but I
will not insist very much about it; however,
his language was unusual. What strikes me
is that some judges take for granted that

the law is such-and-such, and then they go
back to precedents and try to prove to themselves that they are right. They should proceed otherwise, in a more philosophical manner. This is not a comparison between
common law and civil law, but it is a statement that shows that anyone who has a
sound legal formation shall proceed otherwise
in arguing or explaining a case.
There is more. It is that professional deformation

superimposition of hypotheses without foundation naturally creates confusion in the interpretation of laws. But I hope that in due
course the Supreme Court will have an
opportunity to reconsider its jurisprudence
in relation to provincial matters, although
more recent judgments with regard to other
matters give little hope for any improvement.
I have put that case before Parliament
to establish that the freedom of religion is
a highly personal and civil right which
belongs exclusively to provincial jurisdiction.
The Province of Quebec bas kept it for a
long number of years.
The province of
Ontario still bas it, as has been said, although
it is no longer in its statutes. The western
provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan have
adopted a Bill of Rights in virtue of section

92 of the Act of Confederation. That matter
is strictly provincial, and that is the argument
that I intended to make on the floor of the
Senate. The Justices of the Supreme Court
should be very careful to respect the letter
and the spirit of the Constitution, which they
had better read twice rather than the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Halsbury, and all the
other books of reference. Their first duty is
to post themselves well on the law which
governs this country. The B.N.A. Act is the
governing principle in this country. It should
be interpreted with knowledge and fairness.
I have done my best to be careful about
individuals.
But the time has now come
when the opinions of judges should be given
less importance than the judgments of the
court. The court should give judgments, as
the Privy Council did, instead of opinions,
which are useful only to the parties in the
case.
Before closing my remarks, may I express
my thanks to the honourable senator from
Kingston (Hon. Mr. Davies), who did a real
service to the Senate by introducing us to
each other. It is something I myself wanted
to do for a long time, but I did not have an
opportunity to do it. What he bas done is
highly appreciated, because it was se well
done.

yet reduced to what is whirling through

Bismarck's great discovery consisted in a
device for making political capital out of
poverty and human suffering. Who was his
star pupil? None other than Lenin. Of all
totalitarians who have written their names
in the book of medical economics and politics,
Lenin's will have to be printed in the largest
capital letters. His was-in 1917-the first
complete cradle-to-grave plan, the first plan
embodying complete nationalization of medicine. His influence on the West did not
make itself directly felt until World War II.
Since then, wherever Russian bayonets take
over, the Soviet blueprint of social security
follows. His ideological influence has spread
world-wide.
Bismarck's fundamentally significant role in
modern history is rarely understood. His
middle of the road socialism was the connecting link between the old autocrats and
the coming totalitarians. He thought he could
overcome Marxism by his own brand of
state socialism just as Fabian socialists, Keynesians, New Dealers and Bevanites profess
that their middle of the road statism keeps
the totalitarian wolf from the door. In
democracies the Welfare State is the beginning and the Police State the end. The
two merge sooner or later, in all experience
and for obvious reasons.
I wonder how many honourable senators
have pondered this thought: Just why were
such ruthless men as Bismarck, Hitler and
Stalin so profoundly interested in the physical well being of their subjects-and in high
birth-rates!-while totally indifferent, nay,
inimical to their mental integrity? Evidently,
more than humanitarianism was at stake. All
modern dictators-communist, facist or disguised-have at least one thing in common.
They all believe in social security, especially
in coercing people into governmentalized
medicine.
A selected list of men who have claimed
credit for, or have been credited with introducing or strengthening and expanding governmentalized medical care reads like an

extraordinary Who's Who. I have three pages
of names, which include: Bismarck, the
Kaiser, the Czar of Russia (1911), Lenin,
Stalin, Salazar, Mussolini, Vargas, Peron,
Hitler, Laval, Dimitrov-Premier of sovietized Bulgaria, 1948-Tito, Klement Gottwald, and, last but not least, Aneurin Bevan.
This list of power dynamos, or symbols of
power, with bleeding hearts for human suffering is by no means complete. Complete data
on some of the satellite and Latin American
bosses are not available. Some others are
missing because they do not qualify technically for membership in the club of recognized full and semi-dictators and of paternalistic rulers-"by the Grace of God" or
otherwise, having been elected in ordinary
democratic procedures and still exposed to
new elections. But who would have foreseen that an easy-going, money-grabbing
politician like Laval was to become a sort of
second-hand Mussolini? Most certainly Laval
claimed and wielded, about 1930, less than a
fraction of the discretionary and arbitrary
power that the British Health Minister
wielded in 1948. And there are more Pierre
Lavals and Aneurin Bevans around in what
we call the democratic world than the unsophisticated might assume.
Indeed, out of the ashes of the Welfare
States that went down unsung in the tumultuous depression, new and much more imposing ones have risen since. It seems that
history is running in cycles, progressing
from what is known as National Socialism to
what is recognized as Socialist Nationalism.
Ever since Bismarck, great dictators and
little demagogues compete with one another
and with the humanitarians in courting the
favour of the ailing, the lame, the blind,
the poor and the underprivileged. In World
War I, Ludendorff used Germany's social
insurance, then Europe's most "progressive",
for propagandizing Teutonic social and cultural superiority. Today British and French
propagandists vie with each other in eulogizing the respective security plans. But Stalin
outdid all of them, and his successors likewise. Trud, the organ of the Soviet trade
unions, said in 1937:
Government insurance in the U.S.S.R. is a source
of pride of the Soviet workers before the whole
world. It is one of the jewels in the colossal
edifice of Socialism. It is one of the testimonials to
Stalin's deep solicitude for his fellow men by which
we are all warmed and heartened.

The great French visionary Alexis de Tocqueville warned more than a century ago in
De la Démocratie en Amérique, 1840 that
democracies like ours may succumb to a new
and soft technique of governmental benevolence that subdues all individuality. The
suspicion that the solicitude of notorious

NOVEMBER 27, 1957

tyrants for the welfare of their subjects
must have something to do with the political
nature of the medical security systems was
one consideration which inspired me to make
a detailed study of this whole set-up.
A totally centralized type of organization
obtained under the British National Health
Service Act of 1946. The panels, which were
the backbone of the Lloyd George system,
were abolished altogether, and the Minister
of Health had all executive power, with no
appeal from his decisions. Representatives
of the professions stand by in an advisory
capacity, but the minister does not even have
to publish their reports. Local Executive
Councils, 138 in England and Wales, were
responsible for the routine of low-level administration and for the policing of the general
practitioner, the pharmacies and the ophthalmic services. County and Country Borough
Councils handle, supposedly, maternity and
child welfare, the after-care of the sick,
health visiting and home nursing.
Responsibility for hospitals, specialists and blood
transfusion services rests in England and
Wales alone with 146 Local Health Authorities, 14 Regional Hospital Boards, 376
Hospital Management Committees and 36
Boards of Governors of Teaching Hospitals.
The latter alone retain a relative measure of
legal independence. But the minister has to
confirm all major medical appointments.
One outstanding and unique feature of the
British scheme is the virtually complete
absence of controls over the patients.
Elaborate machinery is available for their
complaints against doctors and pharmacies
but not for checking their own demands.
Dentists have to submit their proposals for
appliances to a special board that is supposed
to clamp down on "luxuries".
Some 3,426 "voluntary" and "teaching"
hospitals (clinics) are nationalized, their endowment funds taken over by the Government, leaving only Catholic hospitals and
private nursing homes outside the official
orbit. Except in Soviet Russia, medical
nationalization nowhere has gone that far,
not even in some of the satellite countries,
as yet.
The widening of coverage to more and
more people often has little to do with the
actual need of the insured. More often, it
has political implications. Each move on
the road of "medical imperialism" is greeted
as a victory of an ideal, and is being sold to
labour, in particular, as a step in the direction
of "economic democracy".
What has provided, and provides, a pretext
for using the sickness schemes as playgrounds of very expansive-and equally expensive-patronage is the unrelenting advance

of medical research in the last fifty years.
Indeed, the prophylactic, diagnostic and
curative practices all are in a continuous,
self-revolutionizing
evolution.
Once the
principle is accepted that the compulsory
scheme should provide proper care, what
else but the best and latest, and therefore
often the most costly, should be provided?
So long as a genuine voluntary insurance is
in operation, the cost of which is borne by
members, these members have an incentive
to keep their demands within bounds. But
in the compulsory schemes the individual
knows of little or no responsibility for the
functioning of the whole. On top of that,
certain people have every interest in advertising the schemes by procuring the most
spectacular and the most modern services.
The doctors, too, have such an interest,
especially the young ones, who want to make
a reputation and to amortize as fast as possible their investment in education, in
technical equipment, and so on.
The medical expert tends to be-nay, has
to be-"one-sided". He must devote his time,
his energy and even his emotions. He is inclined to look at the world from the point
of view of his intellectual and professional
goal. The doctor's ideal is to detect every
sickness at the onset, and to "cure" it in
the most thoroughgoing fashion. Sickness is
his enemy; to fight it he would mobilize all
resources and utilize the best devices. His
pecuniary interest drives him in the same
direction. This natural and logical expansiveness of the profession tends to grow into
imperialistic delusions when the technical
tools fall into the hands that wield power.
The medical dream becomes the object of
exploitation by ambitious individuals. The
outcome is something which the taxpayers
-and
the patients-should be concerned
about.
Bevan's "free medicine" to all, even to
visiting foreigners, had entered the scene
at a jump, accompanied by the greatest
drum-beating any scheme has enjoyed since
Bismarck's. It started on July 5, 1948, with
total cost, including the nationalized hospital,
set at $800 million, at the then valid rate
of $4 to the pound, for the first nine months
of operation. By February 1949 the sights
had to be raised to over $1,100 million, well
over $20 per capita for the total population.
The parliamentary debate over the supplementary estimate brought out that the
minister had underestimated in an irresponsible fashion the demand for medical services
when available free of charge-or maybe be
did so intentionally to overcome the initial
resistance against his pet project. In the
first year of operation, while the potential

SENATE
patients had just about doubled from 47 per
cent of the population under the old scheme
to 95 per cent under the new, the number
of prescriptions had almost trebled, and
their average cost had risen from over 20
to more than 31 pence. Compared with the
annual demand previous to July, 1948, the
number of eye glasses requested has risen
fourfold. The number of people appealing
for dental care has grown suddenly from
8 per cent of those entitled under the old
scheme to 20 per cent under the new. The
unit cost of ophthalmic, dental and hospital
services went up spectacularly too. At a
time when commodity prices were practically
stabilized, the price of a pair of spectacles
was found to have risen by 50 per cent,
from 40-45 shillings to 65 shillings 6 pence,
while the weekly hospital ward rates jumped
from £4 per bed to £8, £10 and more.
For the fiscal year 1949-50, $1,410 million
was the budgeted cost of the new health
scheme, just about 75 per cent more than
what the brilliant minister had figured nine
months earlier, and a good third over what
the Beveridge Plan estimated-for 1955.
The provision of health care is the most
unruly, least controllable element in public
spending for the "security" of the individual
leaving aside the fact that virtually everywhere the sickness schemes are bolstered
by charity and voluntary, unpaid efforts.
Significantly, and obviously referring to the
Bevan scheme, Sir Stafford Cripps found it
necessary to warn his own party in his last
(1949) budget day message:
We have to face our economie and financial
problems with realism, and must not allow ourselves to be carried away by the quite understandable desire to court electoral popularity.
When I hear people speaking of reducing taxation
and at the same time see the cost of social services
rising rapidly, very often in response to the demands of the same people, I wonder whether they
appreciate to the full the old adage that we cannot
have our cake and eat it. We must recognize the
unpleasant fact that these services must be paid
for and they must be paid for by taxation, direct
or indirect . . . There is not much further immediate possibility of the redistribution of the
this
national income by way of taxation in
country . . . We must, therefore, moderate the
speed of our advance in the extended application
of the existing social services to our progressive
ability to pay for them by an increase in our
national income. Otherwise, we shall not be able
to avoid encroaching, to an extent, upon the liberty
of spending by the private individual for his own
purposes.

The abolishment altogether of a compulsory
sickness scheme once established, even if
bankrupt and unsatisfactory, is beyond
imagination. It never has happened. The
difficulty of raising additional contributions
and subsidies puts the schemes in a tight
spot, an ever-tightening one. It necessitates
economies, which in turn negate the very

purpose of the schemes. Invariably the
doctors are the first victims in this conflict
between political objectives and financial
realities.
The doctors are, of course, the key figures
of governmentalized medicine. The prime
purpose is to procure their services and all
that goes with them. Their honoraria alone,
disregarding those of the dentists, constitute
anywhere between nearly 50 per cent, in
Switzerland, and little more than 15 per cent,
in Britain, of the total cost. But far more
is at stake. Being the focal point of medical
procedures, the state directs the course. It
decides who is sick and for how long, and
thereby determines the trend of cash benefits,
the quality and quantity of pharmaceutical
products, the need for hospitalization, X-ray,
laboratory and hydrotherapeutical services,
etc. Even the cost of administration is dependent in part upon the degree of control
over the profession.
Governmentalized health services sooner or
later run into the iron curtain of mountainous costs. The easiest way out is to curtail
doctors as
the
denouncing
honoraria,
profiteers; this is very popular.
Crude extra-legality and open illegality are
a minor though disquieting angle of a fundamental issue. The real problem is one of
basic ethics as well as public finance and of
individual health care. It should not be surprising to find that these are three aspects of
one and the same problem; of human nature
pressed into an institutional set-up that
ignores, or pretends to reform, elementary
tenets of human psychology.
The dire fact is, to put it bluntly, that
governmentalized medicine tends to bring
about a conflict between the natural, perhaps even the subconscious interests or
instincts, of the persons directly affected and
the schemes themselves. These conflicts undermine the functioning and negate the
objectives of compulsory medicine.
The crux is what the insurance experts
call the subjective risk. Sickness depends on
objective causes beyond the control of the
the afflicted person. But it also depends on
little known processes of a mental and
emotional nature. To be sick is, to an undefinable but very substantial extent, a
matter of psychology. To become a patient
or claiming helplessness-is
-admitting
another process regulated by purely mental
as much as by factual happenings.
The honourable senator from Gulf (Hon.
Mr. Power) brought this matter before the
chamber very vividly in discussing the War
Veterans Allowance Bill. And the honourable

NOVEMBER 27, 1957
senator from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid) has a most comprehensive understanding of the drug traffic in this country and
throughout the world. What he said on
this matter was quite revealing and true.
The adage "people who get everything
for next to nothing think next to nothing of
everything they get" epitomizes a human
reaction so automatic that it is scarcely
even conscious. Given the meagerness of
our pocketbooks, we cannot help but be
rational to the extent of economizing with
things which are expensive. But that which
is cheap is "cheap as dirt" and need not be
treated with care and consideration.
The new apostle of social security, Sir
William Beveridge, himself, has warned that:
The danger of providing benefits, which are both
adequate and indefinite in duration, is that men,
as creatures that adapt themselves to circumstances,
may settle down to them.

They settle down, indeed, and "smarten
up" to them. What is done, at first surreptitiously by uninhibited persons only, tends
to become common practice.
The real problem is rooted in the semiconscious twilight in which the behaviour
of the individual is determined by the interplay of conventional ethics and traditional
habits, of rational will power, economic
interests, emotional strains, objective ani
subjective symptoms of illness, and manifold
circumstances. If the factory workers of
the Rhone Valley year after year are "sick"
for a week or two just at the time the
peach crops of their little gardens ripen,
is it or is it not to draw sick benefits and
to reap other advantages as well? Or did
they merely postpone for a convenient occasion a treatment they needed sooner or
later? Similar questions could be raised with
respect to the seasonal ailment notoriously
displayed by seasonal workers, to the chagrin
of all sickness schemes. Their query is how
to stop what they regard as unfair exploitation of their resources without hurting the
justified claims of the bona ftde patients.
In the summer of 1949 I surveyed the
situation in London and found that it took
four weeks and more to get a tooth extracted, six weeks for a barium meal X-ray,
two to four months' wait for a hospital bed,
up to six months for eye glasses, and so
forth. But all were available on short notice
if paid for in cash. The number of incidents
reported involving serious damage to people
who had to wait too long was growing. At
the same time, sorely needed hospital wards
had to be closed owing to the lack of nurses,
and ward patients even - had to perform
menial services.
Scheme administrations and their following argue that we should be patient and

let the system develop its potentialities. Of
course, the same admonishment for patience
may be invoked in favour of the free medical
market, too.
But the objective student is faced with an
even more serious question, the discussion of
which is blurred usually by emotions. Is it
not preferable to provide the "needy"-who
need to be defined-with some medical service, be it one that is admittedly far from
satisfactory, rather than to let them drift
"helplessly"-whatever
that means? Undoubtedly, the compulsory systems imply
that in terms of doctors-per-minute, of
drugs-per-ounce, of appliances-per-piece, of
teeth-pulled-per-person, et cetera, more is
being put at the public's disposal than would
have been offered in the same country and
at the same time if all those services had to
be acquired at their market value. If so,
comparison of a free versus a compulsory
medical market should result in favour of
the latter, in purely quantitave terms. If it
were possible to measure those services by
reducing them to multiples of a homogeneous
unit of energy-let us call it an "erg med."the compulsory systems should be found
producing a much larger number of such
units per capita than the free systems do
under the same or similar circumstances.
But it is equally certain that the unit of
service procurable and actually procured
under a free system must be of higher quality. The evidence is overwhelming. For
one thing, a doctor who sees 20 patients a
day is likely to do better with each of them
than one who sees 80 or 100. That leaves us
in a quandary. What kind of medicine do
we consider desirable: one that produces the
maximum number of per capita "ergs med.",
or the other that gives the highest quality of
service under the given conditions of the
respective country?
What I am trying to say is that not all is
light on the one side and darkness on the
other. The free medical market may produce marvels, but they may or may not be
accessible to the submarginal patient. Governmentalization is supposed to take care of
that. On the other hand, the quantitave
progress achieved in compulsory systems
should be weighed in the light of the qualitative deterioration that accompanies it. Such
weighing can take place, however, only in
the spirit of cold-blooded realistic discussion,
not in the atmosphere of political oratory
under which the controversy labours in
virtually every country. To promise adequate
health care, as the proponents of compulsion
do, means to use the words in an irresponsible careless fashion. All they can promise
honestly and knowingly is some care for
everyone, including those who have none or

SENATE

too little, but accompanied by a qualitative
lowering of the level of medical service for
the vast majority.
From Bismarck to Bevan, free health advocates realize that only a system that does
not charge the patient is a full-fledged
political asset to its promoters. Especially
so when the beneficiaries share in the payroll
taxes which finance the scheme, when they
feel that they have paid in advance. That
leaves physical controls as the way out, just
as rationing is the logical sequel to price
fixing.
The eighteenth century proudly called itself
the Century of Reason. The nineteenth
boasted of being the Century of Progress. In
the same fashion, the twentieth deserves one
of two titles: the Century of Marxiam
Totalitarianism or of Bismarckian Social
Security. That the two movements for governmentalizing the security of the individual
and toward unrestrained absolution coincide,
is far from accidental. Both have the same
deep psychological root: the longing in the
heart of the masses-on which unscrupulous
individuals can capitalize-for protection
against hazards of life, cost what the protection may. Both need vast controls by the
state to replace the responsibilities of the
individual. Both belong in the same chapter
of the history book: The Welfare State.
Until after the turn of the century, the
appeal to humanitarianism provided the
Number One argument for governmentalized
medicine. Poor people cannot afford to take
care of their own health. To leave them to
charity, public or private-and both were
highly developed long before Bismarckwould bo humiliating. Why, the poor may be
so proud that they might not take the alms
and would rather suffer or even die, so the
argument implied. Then, there are the semipoor who could get along normally, but who
might be wrecked by major sickness in the
family.
After World War I more rationalization
was needed to justify the horizontal expansion of the schemes to ever higher income
brackets. It easily was found in the Bismarckian armoury of ideas: people must be
insured against sickness in a compulsory
fashion because they do not take care of
themselves. They do not know how to use
their money rationally; the G-overnment has
to step in and teach them to make sound use
of their incomes. The paternalistic image
supplements the humanitarian vistas. The
implication is that people "lack the insight
and the moral strength to provide spontaneously for their own future". But then it
is not easy to silence the voices of those who
ask whether it is not paradoxical to entrust
the nation's welfare to the decisions of voters

whom the law itself considers incapable of
managing their own affairs; whether it is not
absurd to make those people supreme in the
conduct of Government who are manifestly
in need of a guardian to prevent them from
spending their own income foolishly. Is it
reasonable to assign to wards the right to
elect their guardians? Also, substituting by
authority for the private propensity to save
tends to undermine the saving habit which
it is supposed to inculcate and to supplement.
Note in passing that the most effective
argument for compulsory medicine still is:
to provide for people in the low income
brackets who cannot provide for themselves.
But in practice, and from the outset, the
schemes always include a majority of members who could very well take care of themselves. And almost always they leave out a
minority, especially the lowest income group,
that still has to fall back on poor relief or
private charity.
"You know, Lord Horder, as I do, that one
doctor is as good as another doctor," said
Aneurin Bevan to the spokesman of the
British profession. The tendency of authoritarian medicine to level the differences within the profession may be even more
significant, perhaps, than the tendency to
level the profession as a whole. The second
pressure could be corrected by raising the
doctors' honoraria, if that were financially
possible and politically expedient. But the
tirst is inherent in the very nature of the
system. How should the bureaucracy distinguish between one surgeon and another
in terms of respective ability? It has to pay
both on the basis of well-defined, uniform
standards, lest purely arbitrary judgments
and corruption should prevail.
The effect on medical practice would be
similar to that on a business which had
ceased to distinguish between the shipping
clerk and the executive vice-president,
except in terms of seniority and stop-watch
records.
The new generation of doctors whose
future lies in the compulsory system does
not even need the training the old used to
acquire. Characteristically, from England
comes the suggestion that, in view of the
urgent demand for more doctors to relieve
the shortage caused by the onrush of nonpaying patients, the rank and file of young
doctors should be permitted to pass with a
training less comprehensive than required at
present. According to a certain man in London, a four-year vocational course would do,
while future consultants, specialists and
scientists should be the only ones to receive

SENATE
The fundamental fact remains that no
country can provide more in sickness care
than its economic production permits. Ultimately, the status of health care depends on
the level of wealth, not on schemes of one
kind or another.
The most dangerous delusion entertained
by the public is that one can get something
for nothing from the Government.
Honourable senators, I wish to bring to
your attention the following publications,
which I commend for your perusal. A publication called Health Insurance, produced
by the Canadian Welfare Council, 1956. A
pamphlet issued by the Canadian Medical
Association in June 1955 on "Health Insurance". A Statement of Policy by the Canadian Medical Association produced, and
published as far back as 1949, and, finally,
an excellent publication called Underwriting
Canadian Health, an economic view of the
Welfare Program, produced by William
Lougheed and Associate, 1957. This gives
an excellent background to the situation as
it is developing in Canada today.
The medical profession has nothing but
admiration for Bill 320, to provide hospital
insurance, which was passed at the previous
session of Parliament and given the Royal
Assent on April 12, 1957. This bill was well
received, and had been ably propounded by
the then Minister of National Health and
Welfare for whom I have the highest
admiration.
In addition, a comparable bill was put
through the provincial Legislature of Ontario
about the same time, and is to go into effect
in the near future. Briefly, the medical
profession subscribes to that legislation, provided that men of a particularly high caliber
are going to be in power to see that it functions in its correct and proper manner. The
significance of that statement, I am sure, is
all too apparent.
The trouble with present-day medical care
is not to be found in the quality or numbers
or distribution of doctors. The trouble does
not lie with the doctors' methods. At the base
of the difficulties there is only one error.
Here I am not by any means speaking of the
men who have constituted the Governments
in this country for the past fifty years; but
what does concern me and men of my thinking in the profession is the fact that the cults
that have been formulated overseas and
throughout South America could spread. I
refer to the appropriation, by unscrupulous
people in these countries, of a fundamental
area of human emotion for use as a platform
from which they may launch their campaigns
for the further subjugation of their citizens.
Doctors are familiar with the sad, omnipresent yearning for complete happiness. It

is a matter of daily occurrence in the lives
of our patients. We are familiar with grief,
loneliness and the aimless boredom that
follow illness or death. We have no material
solution for these problems, and we venture
to think that no solution is available by act
of any government.
Continuing excellence in medical care depends upon inequality. Doctors are forced to
excel, first, because without such excellence
they cannot even be admitted to a medical
school. Again, they must excel or they will
fail of graduation. In their years as interns
they must excel again, for those selected to
remain for further postgraduate training in
hospitals are picked from among the better
interns. The doctor, should he desire to
remain in medical school work, must excel
as a teacher or research man; when he gets
into practice he must excel or do without
patients.
We may, therefore, draw a curve of excellence on which we may place each member
of the profession-among the few, at one end,
who are outstanding, or among the majority
who constitute the ascent and descent of the
curve. Such -a curve may of course be drawn
for any group of men of any talent, trait or
quality. Such variation is the product of
divine creation; doctors cannot reverse it,
nor may it be reversed by law or ýdecree.
Appeal is made, therefore, to sheer emotion
by playing upon the symbols of sickness and
death. Medical care is equated with merchandising operations.
Now, in spite of a ruthless selective process
in the education of physicians, which promotes inequality among them, those who survive it are pledged to make their performance
as equal in quality as is humanly possible.
They strive, by work and study, to further
its excellence, and by deep professional instinct shy away from the idea that the
standard of medical care should be lowered
to a static equality in order to equalize its
cost. Medical care, in a word, has always
been based upon the idea of excellence, without specific regard to the cost, if any, to the
patient.
As matters now stand, some of the finest
medical care available is provided in charity
wards of the great teaching hospitals. I have
been on this service for 27 years, and I know
whereof I speak. I refer you to what was
said by Professor Hendry, Director of the
School of Social Work of the University, who
wrote an excellent article which appeared in
the Toronto Globe and Mail.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Professor Hendry of the
University of Toronto?
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: Yes.

NOVEMBER 27, 1957
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is not the only
university.
Hon. Mr. Sullivan: To a patient, his doctor
is the best-if not in the world, at least the
best available.
Inequality among doctors, then, is compounded by education, by experience, and by
the necessity to augment the excellence of
the treatment offered, partly, of course, with
an eye to reputation. How equalize reputation? The older we get, and the more we
study, the greater becomes our judgment,
and our humility. If mediocrity is to be cherished, if human illness is to be approached
by the pedestrian equalitarianism of all government projects, we have surely lost our
case. Moreover, if you conceive doctors to be
equal, then surely it is only accurate to assume that your own children are no better
and no worse than other children. If we
actually believe in equality, then we must go
ail the way. Inequality in the promotion of
equality would defeat the purposes of
equality.
Our profound and increasing appreciation
Df the complexity of life should itself put us
an guard against submitting ourselves and
Dur patients to an ever-increasing attack on
inflexible rules. No patient asks for illness
Dr enjoys it, and no patient enjoys paying
for his illness. Perhaps the result of his treatment is unsatisfactory to him. If so, you may
be sure that it is not satisfactory to the
doctor either.
If your doctors are not as good as you
would wish, you may also be assured that
they are not as good as they would wish.
Our peril as a nation, and our individual
peril as patients and physicians, is not that
physicians will give inadequate care to those
who are ill. The true peril is from false
teachers who would persuade us that the day
of jubilee, when individuals who are "honest
in the dark", and "vertuous without a witness", may be mass-produced, by vote of
the majority, on earth, and no later than tomorrow morning.
The direct responsibility for controlling
welfare expenditures rests with governments
and, beyond the influence of constructive
leadership, with the electorate. To achieve
welfare, one must first have wealth, and any
attempt to reverse unduly this historical sequence is to invite trouble. The posing of farsighted choices on welfare policy places a
heavy burden of responsibility on ail our
governments in an area where much more
research and informai discussion is required.
Honourable senators, if more public action
is deemed necessary in the field of public
health care, serious consideration should be

given to a comprehensive nation-wide plan
for catastrophic coverage. This could well
embrace medical and dental care, and it
could be administered with or without the
participation of the voluntary agencies, preferably with their assistance. By rooting out
the first-dollar-on approach to financing
health care, the plan would do much to forestall the complete socialization of the medical
and dental professions which prevailing plans
seem to foreshadow.
It is my firm conviction that future financial assistance by the federal Government
should be directed only to the areas in which
the individual is generally unable to help
himself, to the indigent, the aged, the chronically ill, and to those who suffer catastrophic
medical expenses.
Looking back over the history of this great
country of ours to the wisdom and foresight
of our Fathers of Confederation, it is evident
that when they constituted these two houses
of Parliament they saw in the foreseeable
future the events that would occur. Each
one of you, honourable senators, a distinguished member of your profession or calling, gives what you have for the good of
this country, this beloved Canada of ours.
Let us stand on guard for Canada. These
schemes of which I have spoken are coming,
and it is only by conscientious devotion by
all of us to our duty that we will forestall
here what has happened throughout a great
part of the world today.
With your permission, honourable senators,
and in spite of the acrimonious debate that
sometimes takes place in this venerable
chamber, I would like to conclude my
remarks with these words: Ecce quam bonum,
quamque jucundum, habitare fratres in unum
-Behold
how good and joyous it is for
brothers to dwell together in unity.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, I
move the adjournment of the debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I object to the debate being
adjourned. I say quite candidly to the bouse
that legislation is coming before us which
makes it impossible for us to continue this
debate. If my honourable friend wants to
speak, we have time from now until 10
o'clock tonight to listen to him. Otherwise,
he will put me in a position where I cannot
get my legislation through. I want to say
quite candidly that I am not going to take
a licking. We are prepared to sit tomorrow,
we will sit Friday, and we will sit Monday,
and every day-if we only sit and call the

plenty of opportunities to speak. There was
occasion after occasion when we adjourned
here at 4 o'clock.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, I am speaking on the motion to adjourn the debate.
It is for those reasons that I object to the
adjournment and I suggest, I urge, that the
honourable member go on with his speech
right now-there is plenty of time. He is
well qualified to do so. Otherwise, I will
be compelled to ask for a vote on it, and if
I am voted down-well, I will be voted
down, but the house has got to do it.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Honourable senators, when
I look at the routine proceedings I note that
there is nothing before us at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Oh, yes, there is.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Yes, there is the Address
in reply to the Speech from the Throne, and
there are some inquiries and a resolution that
can wait from one day to another day. It
does not make much difference when they are
proceeded with; no one is pressing. I think
it would be rank discourtesy on my part to
stand up immediately after the honourable
senator from North York (Hon. Mr. Sullivan)
has delivered his speech and to differ with
him as severely as I would like to differ. He
is an old friend of mine, he is a new member
of the house, he was a constituent of mine.
I have not the heart to do it. That is the
reason I moved the adjournment.
And I will say to the honourable Leader
(Hon. Mr. Haig) that I will not be here tomorrow to carry on; in fact, I won't be here
again until Monday. But if my motion is
in the way of business, I will leave it to
the honourable Leader of the Government
to make the way clear, if there is business
to be done, whether I am here or not. I
will leave it up to him to decide.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I have a word? I understand there is
legislation coming from the Commons, and
other legislation, which will be initiated here.
The Leader of the Government presented
a bill today, and we shall proceed with it
tomorrow. That bill was initiated in this
house.
Would it meet with the approval of all
honourable senators if we agreed to give
legislation priority each day?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Let the Address in
reply to the Speech from the Throne stand
until there is no further legislation before
the house. In that way we would not impede the progress of any legislation which
is initiated here or which comes from the
other house. I would agree to the adjournment only on condition that we give legislation priority from day to day.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I suppose somebody will
object to my speaking in a minute or two,
but as leader of the house I have the right
to speak.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to say this, that I
am very greatly disturbed. The bill which I
presented today has been set down for second
reading tomorrow; also a bill dealing with
unemployment relief will be coming before
us tomorrow; and next day an amendment
to the Insurance Act, quite an important bill,
is coming in. The bill respecting the St.
Mary's River Bridge Company will come
before a committee tomorrow, and another
bill is to be before another committee tomorrow. These measures will all be coming
into the house very shortly. I suggested to
the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) that we might adjourn on Thursday night, but if all these bills come in I am
afraid I could not agree to that.
There is nothing to prevent the honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina from going on
today. The only way that I shall be able to
know where I am going is by getting the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne out of the way. I want the Government to know that this blocking is not my
fault, that I am not responsible for this jam,
but that the Opposition is holding me up in
refusing to go on. That is what I want the
Government to know.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it is my duty as Speaker of this house to
reject the objection, to overrule it, because I
consider it the absolute right of a member
of the Senate to move adjournrment of a
debate. We cannot simply put aside the debate on the Speech from the Throne-it is
too important for that. I think we shall
follow the suggestion of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), that every day from now on, until
the Address is adopted, all legislation
brought in should be given priority. For the
time being, I reject the objection to the
motion to adjourn the debate. Therefore I
put the question to the house. It is moved by

Speaker:

Honourable

senators, when shall this bill be read the
second time?
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
move, seconded by the honourable Senator
Monette, that the bill be read the second
time now.
It took a little time to pass this legislation
through the resolution stage in the other
house, but, when the bill was introduced,
just three minutes were spent on giving it
first, second and third readings.
This legislation deals with an amendment
to the Unemployment Insurance Act. To
explain the bill I have drafted a memorandum, not so much for the purpose of informing honourable senators as to inform people
who may read Hansard and may want to
know what the legislation accomplishes. Its
interpretation is rather easy if one is a lawyer
familiar with legal matters.
Honourable senators, during the past few
weeks several honourable members have
asked whether or not the Government intended to amend the Unemployment Insurance Act this session. These questions are,
I think, a reflection of the concern that all
of us feel about the present situation with
regard to unemployment.
Before explaining the bill, which proposes
to amend the seasonal benefit provisions of
the act, I would like to describe the present
situation in what I believe to be its true
perspective.
Honourable members will recall that the
last period during which the state of unemployment gave rise to serious misgivings was
the winter of 1954-55. Let us look at the
figures for two of the months that led up
to that time and compare them with the same
two months of this year.

In August 1954 the number of people who
were without jobs and seeking work comprised 3.1 per cent of the labour force. In
August 1957 those without jobs and seeking
work comprised 2.8 per cent of the labour
force.
In September 1954 those without jobs and
seeking work were again 3.1 per cent of the
labour force, while in September 1957 those
without jobs and seeking work were 3.2 per
cent of the labour force.
Now, in October 1954 those without jobs
and seeking work were 3.3 per cent of the
labour force; while in October 1957 those
without jobs and seeking work were 3.5
per cent of the labour force.
I think it is important to note that the
number of persons gainfully employed in this
country increased by almost half a million
between October 1954 and October 1957, while
the number without work increased by only
about 28,000 in that same period.
In view of these figures, and without
attempting to minimize our problems, I think
it is fair to say that we have already come
through situations that were potentially as
difficult as is the present one. Furthermore, a
favourable factor now is that this Government has no intention of sitting back and
letting this thing run its course.
Earlier in the session I noted that, by curtailing the influx of immigrants for the balance of the year, by channelling $150 million
into our economy for the construction of
houses, by accenting the job-finding facilities
of our National Employment Service, and by
stepping up our winter employment campaign
activities, we indicated our preoccupation with
this problem. Now we are proposing to amend
the Unemployment Insurance Act to increase
the amount of benefit available to insured
persons who are unemployed during the
winter season, when employment is most difficult to obtain. We estimate that the changes
proposed would result in close to an additional $13 million of purchasing power being
paid out to those who need it most and who
can spend it to the best advantage.
At present the act provides that seasonal
benefit may be paid for the period from the
week in which January 1 falls to the week
in which April 15 falls; that is, for 16 weeks.
However, even before January 1 a substantial
number of persons are unemployed and unable to qualify for regular benefit, and also
many are still unemployed when the present
seasonal benefit period ends on April 15.
The intent of this bill is to lengthen the seasonal benefit period by one month at each
end, so that it will run from December 1
until May 15; that is, for 24 weeks.
The effect that this lengthening of the
seasonal benefit period will have can, perhaps,

NOVEMBER 28, 1957
be best illustrated by reference to several
basic examples. First of all, there are two
ways claimants can qualify for seasonal benefit. The first applies to those who do not have
enough contributions to qualify for regular
benefit but who, nevertheless, have 15 contribution weeks since the end of the previous
March. The second applies to those who have
had a regular claim terminate since the
previous May 15, even though they may not
have made a single contribution in that
time.
Under the present act those qualifying in
the first group have a minimum duration
of 10 weeks and maximum of 16 weeks. The
proposed revision will give a minimum of
13 weeks and a maximum of 24 weeks.
In regard to those qualifying in the second
group, the duration of benefit under the
present act is the same as that authorized
on the last regular claim, with a minimum
of 12 weeks and an automatic maximum of
16 weeks because of the end of the seasonal
benefit period. Our proposed revision will
leave the minimum unchanged but does, of
course, increase the maximum duration to
24 weeks; that is, a 50 per cent increase.
The effective date of this proposed legislation is December 1, and by that I mean
that this bill will apply to all claims made in
respect of the forthcoming seasonal benefit
period. A minor exception to this would be
that those in the second group, that is, those
who had a regular claim expire since April
15, 1957, will be able to qualify for seasonal
benefit this winter on that basis. In future
years, the requirement will be that they
must have had a regular claim expire since
the previous May 15.
Another point is that the privilege a seasonal benefit claimant now bas of serving
his waiting period during December will
not be extended. In other words, he will now
be treated as an ordinary claimant and will
have to serve bis waiting period at the
beginning of his seasonal benefit period. This
will not, however, put claimants in any less
favourable a position, since the date at which
they can begin to be paid is advanced by
three weeks and the maximum period of
entitlement is being substantially increased.
In conclusion, honourable senators, we estimate that a large number of Canadian
workers will benefit from the provisions of
this amendment. Last winter, some 214,000
persons established seasonal benefit claims.
This year, since our proposed legislation will
increase the period by two months, we might
expect that the number who qualify would
be somewhat higher. It would seem safe
to say that some 250,000 workers will benefit
to the extent, as I noted earlier, of some $13
million.

I should also like to bring out the point
that this amendment, as well as the revocation of the married women's regulation
announced the other day, is bound to result
in an increase in the number of persons
registered for employment with National
Employment Offices across the country. In
effect, there will be more people registered,
and also they may be registered for a longer
period of time. However, there should be
little or no impact on the monthly Dominion
Bureau of Statistics "Without Jobs And
Seeking Work" Survey, and this survey will
continue to be the official estimate of the
number of unemployed in this country.
Honourable senators, this simply means
that the period during which claimants may
benefit from unemployment insurance bas
been extended from 16 to 24 weeks. In view
of employment conditions in this country,
it seems to me that this is a reasonable
amendment to the Unemployment Insurance
Act. I might say that this legislation was
unanimously endorsed in another place. The
report I had from the Minister of Labour
was to the effect that he had not received
any objections from any of the labour
organizations to which lie submitted this
suggestion.
As I have said, it is estimated that the
unemployment relief benefit will be $13 million. In a period of serious unemployment
a man or woman unemployed will be able
to get an allowance for 24 weeks instead
of for 16 weeks.
Honourable senators, I very heartily support this bill, for second reading.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I wonder if the bonourable leader (Hon. M. Haig) would permit
a question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Golding: The honourable leader
referred to the increase in the number of
employed during the period from 1954 to
1957. Would be tell us what bas been the
increase in population in the same period
of time? I ask this so that we may have a
complete picture of what bas happened.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot give that offhand. I know it is quite substantial, because
our population is now past the 16 million
mark. The labour force bas increased greatly
in the last three years, but I cannot give
exact figures.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I should like to know
the increase in the number of employed in
proportion to the increase in population.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Those figures are here;
I gave them, and I will do so again. In
October 1954 the number of persons unemployed or looking for work stood at 3.3

per cent of the total labour force, and in
October this year it was 3.5 per cent, or
practically the same. Actually, there has
been a decrease in the number of unemployed for October 1957, compared with
October 1954; but, as I have said, it is
expected that, compared with last winter,
there will be an increase in the number of
persons who will establish seasonal benefit
claims under the amended act.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I rise to support this bill. However,
I feel that we should realize what is being
done by this legislation. The Leader of the
Government, in his opening remarks, referred
to unemployment in Canada, and he said the
Government was not going to sit idly by
and allow unemployment to run its course.
I hoped that he would tell us just what the
Government proposes to do to relieve unemployment this winter, but he said not one
word about that. Instead he started to explain this bill, as if it had something to do
with relieving unemployment.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I said we were channelling
$150 million into housing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We must realize that
this bill has nothing whatever to do with
relieving unemployment. What the bill does
is to extend the period during which an unemployed person may receive seasonal benefits; that is ail it does. When this bill is
passed we shall not have solved in any way
whatsoever the problem of unemployment.
I am in favour of this bill, because it will
lengthen the period during which unemployed people will be entitled to seasonal
benefit. Instead of being from January 1 to
April 15, as at present, the period will extend
from December 1 to May 15. I am sure we
I am

particularly glad that December has been included in the extension, for thereby these
people will receive some money in time to
make the Christmas season happier for them
in their homes.

never contemplated, to give benefits to persons who had not qualified under the terms
of the original act. I believe the persons who
are to benefit by the passage of this bill
should receive their payments in accordance
with its terms, but how is the Unemployment
Insurance Fund going to stand up under this
additional charge? It is just another charge
that was not contemplated, and toward which
no contributions have been made over the
years.
The Government recently announced that it
would make a contribution towards unemployment relief costs which had not been
made by the previous Government. Honourable senators recall that in the past the
dominion Government paid 50 per cent of
the unemployment relief costs only when
more than .45 per cent of the province's
population was in need of public assistance.
That arrangement is to be done away with,
and in future the Government will pay 50
per cent of the unemployment relief costs,
with no qualifications or strings attached to it.
Now, I take it, that money will come out of
the public treasury.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It will not be a charge
on this fund. My question now is, why should
the payments under this bill be a charge on
this fund? You may answer that the fund
is well established and has a considerable
amount of money on hand. But money can
disappear very quickly when many calls are
made upon it. If this country had large-scale
unemployment, I am sure the fund would not
last as long as some of us hope it will.
I observe that the other house was informed
yesterday that the Unemployment Insurance
Fund at present amounts to $884,800,516.26
-nearly $900 million. That does seem like
a lot of money. But a new charge is to be
made against it. The other day we learned
of legislation to be put through Parliament
shortly which will mean another charge on
the fund.
My suggestion to the Government is that
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
the Unemployment Insurance Fund should

bill should come out of general revenue.

which is being used to provide funds necesHon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
sary to carry out the purposes of the bill.
The Unemployment Insurance Fund was set senators, may I be allowed to say a few words
up a number of years ago on what we hoped before this bill passes?
I have always been interested in unemwas a sound actuarial basis; but since that
time additional charges have been made on ployment insurance legislation for two reasons
the fund, charges which at the outset were particularly: one, that I am interested in

NOVEMBER 28, 1957
assisting unemployed persons; secondiy, when
the act was under contemplation, some few
years ago, I was a member of the subcommittee that revised the bill and prepared it
for introduction in the other house. That
subcomrnittee studied the measure for a considerabie time, and I have always thought
that it did a very good job. We ail regret
unemployment, but the Unemployrnent Insurance Act has done something to lessen its
baleful influence on the comrnunity.
The honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has stated that this bull
will do nothing to relieve unemployment. That
is true. The present administration seems to
me to be in a fog, so far as the question of
unemployment is concerned. It is at a loss to
off er any solution to alter or correct economic
conditions in that regard, beyond the expenditure, as mentioned by the Leader of the
Government, of $150 million for housing,
which I understand has already been eaten
up. So far as I can see, that is ail that has
been done by the present administration
toward the cure of unempioyment.
Unemployment is a most regrettable situation. I know of no more desperate condition
for any man who has a wif e and family to
support, than to be unemployed, with his time
of no value, and hîs ability to earn daily
bread for himself and his family gone. Therefore, I was enthusiastic when some years ago
this legisiation to provide some relief for
the unemployed was prepared and passed,
although I realized it couid do nothing to
solve the fundamental problem, the occurrence of unemployrnent.
1 amn in favour of the bill now before the
house, not because it touches the question of
unemployment, but rather because it relieves
the distress of the unernployed. We can take
littie pride in the fact that such a measure
is necessary at this time. Did I understand
the honourable Leader of the Government to
say it was expected that we would have
50,000 unemployed people in Canada this
winter?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: 250,000.
Han. Mr. Roebuck: That is a national disaster. Regardless of what Governuient is in
power, to have 250,000 persons unemployed
is a most undesirable situation. I know we
have always expected such a situation when
a Conservatîve Government was in office, but
I had hoped on this occasion, with the bright
new rninds that have taken over the administration of this country, something better
might come of it. However, so far this session
the oniy legisiation that has come to titis
house has provided for the spending of more
rnoney; none has provided any cure for
economic conditions.

Honourable senators, aithough I amn sorry
that the passage of titis bill is necessary,
under the desperate circumstances in which
some o! cur people flnd themselves I arn
delighted to vote for it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bull
was read the second tirne.
TIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shahl this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
move, seconded by the Honourabie Senator
Mouette, that titis bill be read a third time
now.
I have discussed the substance of the bill
fully, but let me say at titis time that when
the estimates corne before us there may be
some opportunity to make comparisons which
would relieve the mind of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). The present Government ntight
choose to copy what was doue in 1954-55 by
the former Government. You wili flnd that
its action was not very far removed from the
present action, but it did not go as f ar as
this legisiation goes. This bill does sornethiug which I was neyer able to understand
why was flot done long ago. It is a most
trying experience for a man to corne i-nto the
late spring with no prospects of a job.
I rnay tell my honourable friends that
while, as I have said, the sum o! $150 million
was provided for housing, there has been
recently voted an additional $100 million for
that purpose. However, that has nothing to
do with my motion for third reading of titis
bull.
Hon. Mr. Pratt: May I suggest to the
honourable Leader of the Government that
this nieasure be referred te the Standing
Clommittee on Banking and Commerce for
consideration?
Sorne Hon. Senators: No, no.
Han. Mr. Haig: I arn willing to refer it to
a committee if the rnajority votes for that,
but let me tell you that if that is done you
wili be depriving the people who would
benefit o! a rnonth's paY. But, if you want to
turn titis legisiation down, by ail means turn
it down. I dare you. to turn it down!
Han. Mr. Pratt: I do not kuow why we
should have to histen to a threat like that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Everything I have said is
the absolute truth, and no heariug lu the
Banking and Commerce Committee couid
change the facts. Ail that this bill would do
is what 1 have said it wouid do, namely, to
increase from 16 weeks to 24 weeks the
period during which unemployed persons can

SENATE
receive seasonal benefit. Why should this
measure go to a committee? I want to get
this bill through immediately, so that it will
be in force on Monday morning and those
entitled to its benefits will be able to get
them without delay. The Governor General's
Deputy will be here in a couple of hours to
give royal assent to the bill. If the house is
against me, then the people will know that
the bill was delayed in the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Why use threats?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to put the majority
of this house in the position that they are
doing the job, not me. I know that every
senator on my side of the house will vote
for this bill.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I rise on a question
of privilege, Mr. Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is no point of
privilege here.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: On a question of
privilege.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have the floor, Mr.
Speaker.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: On a point of order,
Mr. Speaker.
The Hon. the Speaker: On a point of order,
the honourable the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has the floor.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig)
has dared the Senate to do something and
has by implication threatened the Senate. I
do not think he should do that; it bas never
been done here in the past. If he withdrew
his dare we could discuss the matter more
reasonably.
Hon. Mr. Haig: An honourable senator
close to me was pounding his desk all afternoon and demanding that the bill go to committee. Of course, if the house wants the bill
to go to committee, it will have to vote for
it to go there.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The honourable
senator who was pounding his desk was
applauding you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, be was not. He was
applauding you when you were talking.
Hon. Mr. McLean: I was not applauding
the motion to send the bill to committee.
I was applauding my leader (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), as the bill is one dealing with
effects not causes.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order. Honourable
senators, after the motion for third reading of
the bill was made there was a suggestion
that the bill be referred to the Banking

and Commerce Committee, but the question
before the house is the motion for third
reading.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I wish to say that I will vote for the motion,
in spite of the threat or dare that was thrown
at the house by the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig). I regret that he did
this, and I am still hopeful that he will
withdraw the dare.
Hon. Calvert C. Prati: Honourable senators,
may I say just a few words? I suggested that
the bill be referred to a committee, but I did
not suggest at all that the bill should be
unduly delayed, and certainly I did not express any adverse feeling toward the bill.
This bill was introduced in the other house
and after being passed there it was introduced here. All that we have had by way
of explanation of the bill has been the reading
of a statement based apparently on what was
said in the other house, yet when we ask
for an opportunity to study the bill we are
faced with a threat. We are told that if we
refer it to committee we shall delay the
effective date of this legislation for a month,
and that during that period unemployed
people will not be able to benefit under the
amendment. I think that is very unfair. It
is wrong, and I object strongly to it.
Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
it was not my intention to take any part
in this discussion at all. Whatever views I
may have on the bill, it is evidently one that
is intended to do some good. For my part I
have never been able to understand how a
man who has been working at good wages
for a year or two or three years and then
becomes unemployed must be enabled to
get unemployment relief almost at once or
something dreadful will happen to him. Now,
I do not believe that for a moment, but that
is not what I wanted to say. I regret that
my old friend the Leader of the Government
in this house (Hon. Mr. Haig), has taken a
course which upon reflection he may conclude
was not an altogether wise course. This bill
is eminently a bill that should go before a
committee, and I cannot recall in my experience in this house that a similar measure
was refused reference to a committee. Why
do I say that? I am in doubt upon one or
two points in this bill. For instance, will the
enlargement of the period of benefits have
any adverse effect on the fund as it was
calculated when the existing legislation was
passed?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I gave you the figure.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: If it will, then quite
clearly the Treasury of this country and the

NOVEMBER 28, 1957
taxpayers will be involved. Surely it is not
an unreasonable request that we be enlightened upon such points.
So far as I am concerned, I am not going to
insist that this bill be referred to a committee.
I have a very considerable personal regard
for the Leader of the Government in this
house, but I would say this: We have heard
a good deal in the past about by-passing Parliament-about the scurvy treatment of
Parliament-and I certainly do not want to
see this Government get into that practice.
And I say this, honourable senators, that
if the Government cannot arrange its business
so that an important bill like this bas to come
to us under the threat that it must be passed
now or someone is going to lose some benefit,
then it is failing in its duty.
It is the business of the Government, as
it was the business of the old Governmentand I criticized the old Government more
than once on that point-so to arrange its
affairs that Parliament, and this bouse especially, can give proper and due consideration
to the measures that are brought in.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I rise not to pour oil on the fire,
but just a little water. I will do here as I
have done in the House of Commons-to the
astonishment of everyone-I will try to bring
in an olive branch, to show my earnest desire
to have calm and serenity restored to this
Chamber. The honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) will never
realize how deeply all his colleagues suffered
while hearing him say that the ceiling of
this chamber will fall on our heads if we do
not pass this measure, blind-folded. It would
be a calamity for not only the Senate but
for Parliament itself. Remembering as I do
the instruction that I received at school about
British parliamentary practice and British
fair play, I was astonished and dumbfounded
to hear what the honourable Leader of the
Government said, speaking on behalf of the
Right Honourable the Prime Minister and of
all his colleagues in the Government. I recall that when I was a member of the House
of Commons the present Prime Minister repeatedly urged the passage of a Bill of Rights.
It was unconstitutional, but it was his intention to have legislation guaranteeing freedom
of speech passed by Parliament. Then how is
it that his loud speaker in this chamber uses
such offensive language as the honourable
gentleman has used?
My experience can measure up with that
of the honourable gentleman, at least under
this roof, and never in my life, even in the
dark times of R. B. Bennett, have I heard
such threats. No one in Parliament and no
one even outside in the corridor would dare
96702-19j

to speak to a senator of Canada in the
language the honourable gentleman has used.
He is older than I am, but we are on an
equal footing, and His Honour the Speaker,
whom we respect, is the only person in this
chamber who has authority over us. How
can we respect any one of our colleagues
who dares to threaten the whole Senate by
telling them, "If you don't pass this legislation without asking any questions, you will
be punished; you will have retaliation." From
whom? From him. Imagine: How ridiculous!
I know that even the poorest unemployed
will support the stand of the honourable
senators who have just spoken, such as the
Honourable the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald), my venerable colleague the Honourable Senator Crerar, the
Honourable Senator Pratt, the Honourable
Senator Roebuck, all of us; for they will
understand that we are here, not to vote
money blindly, but to demand the right to
defend the parliamentary institutions of this
country and to stop this blackmail.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
the question is on the motion of the Honourable Senator Haig for the third reading of
the bill. Is it your pleasure to adopt the
motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Some Hon. Senators: On division.
The Hon. the Speaker: I declare the motion
for third reading carried, on division.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: On division, yes.
Hon. Mr. Dessureauli: I understand there
is not unanimous consent to the passing of
the bill.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I give no unanimous
consent, no. I want my division to be
registered.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed, on divison.

OFFICIAL REPORT
CORRECTION OF STATEMEN

t

.(Hon.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: H onourable
senators, I have received a letter from the
honourable senator from Vancouv ~er South
(Hon. Mr. Farris) requesting me t e make a
correction in Hansard on his behal f. It will
be recalled that on November 14, when
addressing this bouse in the deba te on the
Address in reply to the Speech from the
Throne, he discussed the right of th 'e present
Prime Minister to ask for dissolution of
Parliament. His comments on th is subject
appear on pages 217 and 218 of Hansard,
where he points out that the Ri ght Honourable W. L. Mackenzie King, wh en Prime
Minister, had been refused dissolu tion. The
correction which be wishes me to make bas
reference to these words appearing on page
218:
Mr.
However, dissolution was refused; and and
Mr.
Meighen was called upon to form a G overnment.
But on the first vote after he became leader, his
Government was defeated.

He informs me that he now fi nds there
were four previous motions on vhich the
Meighen Government had been sustained,
and it was on a flfth motion that th e Government was defeated by a majorit3 of one.
It is that correction which he wis hes to be
made in our official record. He p oints out
in his letter, and I think this is of some
interest, that at the time he made the statement he was speaking from men ory. He
feels that the statement as corre cted does
not alter the trend of his argumen t, but he
thinks that the correction should be recorded.

POTATO PRICES IN MARITIME
PROVINCES
INQUIRY

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. George H. Barbour: Honourable
senators, before the Orders of the Day are
proceeded with I should like to ask the honourable Leader of the Goverment (Hon.
Mr. Haig) if the Government is aware that
potatoes are being sold in the Maritime
provinces, and have been for sometime, at
about 60 per cent of their cost of production.
During the recent election campaign the
presenit Prime Minister toured the Maritime
provinces and told the farmers they would
get parity prices for their potatoes. I would
like to ask the honourable leader if it is the
intention of the Government to bring in
legisiation during this session to provide
parity prices witb respect to, potatoes
produced in the Maritime provinces?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, the
inquiry of my honourable friend from Prince
Mr. Barbour) will appear in Hansrd.
I will inquire into the matter and give my
honourable friend an answer at a later date.

SCN

EDN

Hon. John T. Haig moved the second reading of Bill L-6, to amend an Act respecting
the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge
Company.
He said: Honourable senators I know that
it is out of order to refer to a previous debate
in this bouse, but after the bitter thrasbing
wbich the honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar) gave me in respect to
the Unemployment Insurance Bil, I will send
this bull to committee.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: You have to.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, I don't have to. I am
in a happy position. I don't have to.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Is it not a private bil?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If is a question for
the bouse, not for one member, to determine.
the bouse does not like the way I put it, that
does not change the rule.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We didn't like your
threatening or daring us.
Han. Mr. Haig: Well, you bave the rigbt
to vote it don if you want to. The bonourable senator from St. ovn's West (Hon. Mr.

SENATE
Pratt) has the same right. He can vote it
down if he wants to. He can say anything
he likes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Nobody has any
thought of voting it down.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is a funny thing, but here
I am being accused of threatening and daring.
I have been in politics quite a long while
and I have represented my home city for a
good many years in a legislative body. I did
a lot of daring during that time, but the
voters never*put me out. They always sent
me back to dare some more.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I hope you don't continue
to do it here.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am only doing what
seems to me to be common sense. I know
that what I am saying is out of order, and if
anybody objects I will quit, but I do want
to say that it is easy for the 50 or 60 members
opposite to get up and criticizeHon. Mr. Macdonald: Nobody has done that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -and dare us to go to the
country. But I don't find any of your colleagues in the other place, where the public
can get at them, trying to force the Government to go to the country.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We are not doing that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We have been dared.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You are the one who is
daring us, and some day we will put you out.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The truth is very plain. I
don't like to say this but I have to, for my
self-protection. On April 1, 1957 there was
not a man or woman on the other side of
the house who had the slightest idea that anything would ever happen to the Liberal Government. They were sure they would come
back here with a clear majority.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And you were also.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
said so in this very house.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I didn't have so far
to go. We had only 41 supporters, while the
Opposition-the then Government-had 170.
Hon. Mr. Reid: What about the bill?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is things like that which
make me wonder why people get up and
criticize the Government. Why, the Government has hardly been in office for six months.
You have to give them time to carry out their
policies, whatever your politics may be. Let
me say that the more that is done in the other
house, as well as in this house, the better it is
for our party.

I am not going to argue with honourable
senators about this bill, but I want to have it
passed. It is a bill with a peculiar history.
The act was passed by Parliament in, I think,
1925 or 1926, when the Right Honourable
Mackenzie King was Prime Minister. Last
session a similar bill was introduced in this
house. One or two changes were made, which
did not, however, alter its meaning. The bill
was passed unanimously here and sent over
to the other house, but it was not passed
there because shortly afterwards Parliament
was prorogued and the Government went to
the country.
I want to say that the former Government,
under the Right Honourable Mr. St. Laurent,
in dealing with the matter covered by this
bill did one of the best jobs that the Liberal
Government did during more than 20 years in
office. The Americans had been acting as if
they owned the whole bridge. They had six
men on the commission, while we had only
three. The Prime Minister went to work and
sent representatives down to the United
States, who said to them: "This is the situation: we own half the bridge, and you own
the other half. We are willing to put a commission in charge of the bridge, and we will
have half control of it, and you the other half.
Every two years the chairmanship will alternate between your country and ours, and if
at the end of a period of 30 years we can come
to no agreement each country will control its
own half."
This is a very technical bill. My honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald) knows more about it
than I do. The original bill was drafted under
very careful instructions two or three years
ago, and the civil servants who prepared it
did a good job. I urge honourable senators
to pass it. There is nothing political about
it one way or the other. It is getting near to
Christmas, and if this bill is delayed in going
to the other house, and that house adjourns
until after the New Year, we might easily
run into the delay that occurred last session.
I think this is one of the best bills I have
had the pleasure of introducing since I came
here. I thought the one introduced last session was good, but since getting the facts
directly I am even more in favour of this
measure. I have a full explanation of the bill
before me, and I will read it if it is the wish
of the house that I should do so. This statement has been prepared by the officials who
drafted the legislation, and they have followed
it all the way through. The bill is well drawn.
I ask permission to put this statement on
Hansard;it is not a misleading statement, and
two or three days ago I gave the Leader of
the Opposition a copy of it.

earliest dawn of recorded history we have
stories of people trading with each other.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I suggest "the

Hon. Mr. Crerar: . ..

or better, the perfec-

tion it had reached 50 years ago. In the early
days trade was conducted by barter. I have
not the slightest doubt that if the archaeologists who dig into the ruins of the remote
past find some evidence of the stoneman
age, they will find that men of that age too
traded with each other.
We find this trading instinct in the most
primitive societies, in Africa and elsewhere;
and we find it among the most highly civilized and developed peoples of the world.
Indeed, in certain instances it has been
carried to a rather remarkable degree. I read
a few months ago of a custom in a certain
remote country of husbands trading their
wives with one another.
The Right Honourable Malcolm MacDonald, in a delightful book on his experiences in the Far East, entitled Borneo
People, states that the headhunters of Borneo
were traders; that in the early years the
first people to trade with them were the
Chinese, and later other people followed.
So, the custom of trading was established
in the very beginning of recorded history.
Another observation I wish to make is with
respect to the value of trade. In 1776 Adam
Smith, the predecessor of all modern economists, published his Wealth of Nations, and
it then became open to general readership.
After that event new ideas developed, arising out of the old mercantile theory of trade.
In the first half of the last century there was
in Great Britain wide discussion as to the
value and importance of adopting the principle of trade advocated by Adam Smith.
The principle of freedom of trade which
he advocated was finally adopted, and there
followed the greatest period of prosperity
Britain has ever known. In the latter half
of the last century and in the early years
of this century, before the outbreak of the
First World War, Britain had no tariffs
against imports; she traded freely with the
world-and in all corners of the world in
North America, in Africa, in the far islands
of the sea, and in the Far East. That trade
contributed greatly to the enormous growth
of wealth in that little island and put Britain
in a position which enabled her successfully
to fight through two wars, though at the end
she was largely denuded of her wealth.
Another illustration of the value of trade
is with respect to the United States. Now,
we think of that country as a trading unit;
but it is a combination of 48 different states.

Does anyone for a moment imagine that if
each of those 48 states had had tariffs against
each other-if they were fully sovereign
states, not trading freely within that large
area-they would have achieved the tremendous degree of success and wealth which they
have achieved? It would have been impossible.
From the snows and pines and spruces of
Maine to the tropical fruits of Florida you
have, within the area of the United States,
practically all the resources necessary for
the development and happiness of a nation.
And the development of those resources and
the free trading of the states with one
another, without barriers between them, was
the most important factor in leading to the
immense development, progress and creation
of wealth that have taken place in that
country.
Now, honourable senators, I come to a
point that was raised by the honourable
senator from Shelburne, namely, the impact
that may be made upon our economy by the
development of a free trading area in
Europe. Over 25 years ago, almost 30 years
ago, one of the most eminent French statesmen of that day, the late Aristide Briand,
told the countries of Europe that they had
to integrate economically or perish. Today
we are beginning to see the fruits of that
great statesman's vision.
It is not an easy matter for nations
that are fully sovereign, which for generations have been raising tariffs against trade
between each other, to arrive suddenly at a
point where they say, "This is all foolishness". But, they are arriving at that point
in Europe; and Britain, in her own interests,
must of necessity, I think, join this European
trading group. If she does, then, as the
honourable senator from Shelburne has said,
there will be created an economic trading
area of about 285 million people, where the
objective is that within 12 years, or 15 at
the outside, the economic barriers to trade
between these several nations will have disappeared and it will be one economic trading
union.
Some fears have been expressed in this
country as to what effect that might have
upon Canada's economy. Honourable senators, I have no fear of it. It is true that we
have certain preferences in the British
market, mainly on agricultural foodstuffs. As
far as I am concerned, I would willingly
throw those preferences out the window if
Europe were to integrate in the manner proposed, for if Europe does not integrate
economically the prophetic words of the
French statesman Monsieur Briand will
almost certainly prove to be true.

NOVEMBER 28, 1957
If such an economic unit is built up in
Europe there will be created there a counterforce that may for another 100 years guarantee the peace of the world, once we get out
of our present troubles.
Canada, in the end, cannot lose by this.
A market of 285 million people in Europe
will be a very big market indeed, and will
require many of the things that we produce.
But I will go further: I would say that both
Canada and the United States and Britain
should be a part of that trading area. I am
not afraid of free trade with the United
States, not for a moment. Any person in
Canada who is afraid of free trade with the
United States lacks confidence in the ability
of his fellow Canadians. I say to you that in
initiative, in business skills, in managerial
capacity, the average Canadian, if given a
chance, is equal to the average American.
This was demonstrated during the war. If
the war did one thing, through the tremendous economic developments that we had
to carry out for the purpose of prosecuting
the war, it demonstrated that we had Canadians who were the equal of Americans in
any sphere of economic activity.
Now, supposing we were able to secure
free trade with the United States, upon what
basis should we have it? I would say that
it should be by treaty for a period of at least
50 years, if possible, but in any case for not
less than 25 years. In 50 years, what would
happen?
This great valley of the St.
Lawrence, which has some advantages in
the matter of cheap power, would become the
great manufacturing centre for the North
American continent. Of that I have not the
slightest doubt. What has made Canadians
afraid in the past of trade arrangements
with the United States is what they term
the unpredictability of the Americans. That
is, you might enter into a trade arrangement
with the Americans, and when it suited
them they would cut it off. There may have
been some reason behind that argument.
But I suggest now that if the compact were
made by a long-term treaty-and I am not
sure that the United States would not be
willing to consider that-this danger would
disappear.
There are those who will immediately say,
"Of course, such an arrangement would lead
to political absorption into the United States."
I do not for a moment believe that it would.
Such are not the considerations which bring
about a political union.
Indeed, a continuation of the present conditions may well
be more conducive to promoting the idea of
union of the United States and Canada than
if the two countries were one complete freetrading area.
These views have been
96702-20

expressed in Canada in the past. If such an
arrangement could be put into effect, what
would be the benefits? Consider the position of the Maritime provinces. What theyand poorer provinces right across Canadaneed are markets. Give the Maritimes a
market for their fish and other products,
and there would be brought to these areas
a large increase of prosperity. I do not suppose anyone will dispute that statement. As
for the central region, Quebec and Ontario,
would they lose by it? No. In managerial
skill and general abilities their people are
the equals of people anywhere in America.
I was rather interested in a remark made
during his speech the other day by my
honourable colleague from Waterloo (Hon.
Mr. Euler), that a boot manufacturer, in conversation with him, said, "Give me access to
the American market and I would welcome
free trade with the United States tomorrow."
Beneficial results would occur all down the
line: there would be a better division of
labour and a more economical production
right across the country, and in the United
States as well.
Take the situation in the Prairie provinces.
What we who live there need more than
anything else, honourable senators, is markets.
Someone may say, "You are producing the
same things that are produced in the United
States; you would be selling in competition
with the people there; so how could you benefit?" Well, at the present time some of our
coarse grains are going into the United States
over a substantial tariff barrier. Our live
cattle also are being exported there in spite
of tariff restrictions. Sweep those hindrances
away, and as our production is more economical than that of the average American farmer,
we would benefit from their market. Indeed,
the opposition to the idea, as far as United
States is concerned, would come from some
of their own agricultural interests.
The Prairie provinces are developing other
products. We have oil, also gas in astronomical quantities. The essential need is markets. It stands to reason that If we get access
to 175 million potential consumers we shall
benefit, and benefit largely. And these 175
million potential consumers will by 1975 have
increased probably to 230 or 240 million.
There is also in the Prairie provinces a
substantial production of base metals, of
nickel, copper, zinc. We cannot hope to find
within the boundaries of Canada a market for
more than a fraction of our potential mineral
production. It would be a comforting thought
to those who are mining our lead and zine
if they could be sure that the United States
would not raise the duties against their
products.

SENATE
Go to British Columbia, and you find much
the same condition. The honourable senator
from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) referred
to an address made about a year ago by Mr.
H. R. MacMillan, whose firm is one of the
leading British Columbia exporters of timber
products. Mr. MacMillan's whole plea was
for a reduction of tariffs, for freer trade. The
effect on the economy of this country would
be I think, almost uncalculably great.
I turn to another consideration. Some of
us, at any rate, are greatly concerned with
our mounting expenditures. Today we passed
amendments to the Unemployment Insurance
Act which will involve a further outlay by
the federal treasury. Our expenditures on
pensions and welfare services of all kinds
across Canada are increasing at a rather
alarming rate, faster indeed than the growth
of our gross national production. A continuation of that condition will spell danger.
The point I am getting at is that if, by imaginative and courageous trade policies, we
can bring prosperity to all these areas, the
demand for federal expenditures of the kind
I have indicated will be correspondingly
reduced. That would be a very great boon
indeed. I am a strong believer in laws which
protect people in their work, laws which encourage people to labour and save and produce
for themselves. That is the way civilization
has been built up. It was the way by which
Great Britain accumulated her wealth and
whereby we, on a smaller scale, have achieved
the same result. It is the way that the United
States accumulated capital for the building
of factories, power plants and many other
enterprises. It is most important that this
process shall be fostered and continued in
this young country. The freeing of trade between Canada and the United States and also
between ourselves and Great Britain would
be a tremendous stimulus to development.
A word or two about this proposal of free
trade with Britain put forward by Britain
herself. I am very sorry that it was dismissed
in what I thought was a rather casual fashion.
I am convinced that when the British authorities made this proposal, they meant it. Of
course, we cannot switch 15 per cent of our
trade from the United States to Great Britain
unless we are prepared to do something quite
definite about it. What are our imports fron
Britain? What articles could we take from
her instead of from the United States? How
could we increase trade with the United
Kingdom? One of her exports is Scotch
whisky; that I suppose we shall continue to
take. Another is woollen goods, a line in
which Britain is one of the world's leaders.
Have we the courage to reduce our existing
rather high duty against British woollens?

If so we would immensely stimulate interest
in imports from the Old Country and go some
distance toward achieving the switching of
trade which has been suggested. What about
other textiles? What about boots and shoes,
electrical equipment, rubber goods? Are we
prepared, in order to put Britain in the position of having more dollars to purchase from
us, to cut our duties on these articles?
I do not think so; and I am not very hopeful that the present trade mission, concerning
which we have heard a great deal, is going
to achieve any tangible, worth-while results.
It will be rather surprising, when the delegates visit British woollen factories, for instance, and express the hope that they will
sell more to Canada, if the reply from their
manufacturers is not to this effect, "We would
do that if you would remove your import
duties." I am bound to say that I do not see
this Government doing any such thing; and
I am pretty certain that the previous Government would not have done it, either. But
here lies the crux of the matter. The sensible thing to do, and I am all for it, is to
join in free trade with Britain and if possible
with the wider European area. I am entirely
in accord in that respect with the honourable
senator from Shelburne. Nothing would be
more desirable, in my view, than an arrangement whereby Europe and North America
traded freely with each other, back and forth.
Trade has a civilizing influence. It adds
to the wealth of all who are engaged in it.
On the contrary, when its flow is impeded
by barriers, wealth begins to decline and
jealousies appear.
There is but one other matter I wish to
mention. To my mind, international trade
bas a unifying influence; it makes for peace
between nations. A little over a century
ago Cobden and Bright elaborated that thesis
in Great Britain. It stands to reason that
when there is peaceful expanding trade between nations, and individuals come in
contact with each other for that purpose, each
side benefits, and you create a climate in
which it is much easier to maintain peace
than if trade rivalries are maintained and
expanded. I believe this to be a very profound truth, and that it is evidenced by the
fact that many of the wars of the past 200
years have risen frorn the belief of one nation
or another that it was "cabin'd, cribb'd, and
confined" and so was determined to get additional outlets for its energies. This conviction was an essential factor in producing
the first World War. Germany felt she was
surrounded by nations which she regarded as
more or less hostile; she wanted lebensraum,
or living space, opportunities for growth and
for trade.

NOVEMBER 28, 1957
We may avoid such dangers and immensely
stimulate the urge to peace in the world if
nations are enabled to trade freely with each
other. For that and other reasons which I
have indicated I am wholly in accord with
the honourable senator from Shelburne in the
proposals he has embodied in this motion.
If these purposes can be achieved-not at
once, but perhaps within 10 or 15 years-and
complete free trade adopted between Canada
and the United States, between Canada and
the European free trade area, and also between the United States and that area,
humanity will have taken one of its longest
steps to the maintenance of permanent peace
in the world.

OUTLINE OF INFORMATION RESPECTING PEACE BRIDGE

PRESENTED DURING DEBATE ON MOTION FOR SECOND READING
FORT ERIE PUBLIC BRIDGE COMPANY BILL

As this Bill which relates to the Peace
Bridge in Fort Erie, in Ontario, and Buffalo,
in the United States, was approved by this
chamber during the last session, you will
recall that the circumstances leading to the
amendments incorporated in this Bill were
fully outlined by the Honourable the Government Leader at that time. His remarks will
be found on Pages 464 to 468 in the Debates
of the Senate of Tuesday, April 2nd, 1957.
For the purpose of this consideration, and to
refresh honourable senators' memories of
what was said at that time, I should like to
review some of the facts and circumstances
which have lep up to this bill.
The Peace Bridge was first conceived about
the beginning of the First Great War by
prominent citizens in both Canada and the
United States. It was suggested to commemorate a century of peace between the two
countries. Shortly after World War I, efforts
were made to incorporate a company known
as the Buffalo and Fort Erie Public Bridge
Company, with a capital stock of about $3
million. In 1922 a Bill was passed by the
Legislature of the State of New York setting
up this Company under laws of that State.
A similar bill was passed by Parliament of
Canada in 1923. In 1924, the United States
Congress approved the construction of the
Bridge.
The New York State and Canadian statutes authorized the incorporation of similar
companies of the same name, with powers
in each enactment to unite the two statutory
companies under one company under the
same name. Accordingly, the company subsequently united under these respective Acts
and proceeded to the construction of the
bridge. To finance the bridge there was a
public subscription of approximately $5 million worth of bonds, of which $34 million bore
a rate of 7 per cent, and $14 million of 8
per cent, the prevailing rates of the time.
Construction of the bridge was begun in
1925 and completed on June 2nd, 1927. From
the opening of the bridge in 1927 until 1929
the Company enjoyed a very favourable experience, but subsequent to 1929 encountered
a sharp drop in traffic. In these circumstances it became impossible to retire the
bonds in accordance with the original
intention.
In 1934, the Company applied to New York
State Legislature and the Parliament of
Canada for remedial legislation. The resultant

OF BUFFALO AND

legislation created a Buffalo and Fort Erie
Public Bridge authority and provided for
refinancing which would permit a considerable reduction of fixed charges. The legislation also provided that when the bonded
indebtedness of the bridge was retired, the
property of the bridge situated within the
territory of Canada would revert to Canada.
A similar enactment affected the property
within the territory of the State of New York.
The bill passed by this Parliament became
Chapter 63, 24-25, George V, and it is this
Act which this Bill proposes to amend.
As was pointed out when we considered
this matter last, the bridge authority has
achieved a very healthy financial position
with gross revenues reaching the order of
$11 million per annum, and net revenues
slightly more than $½ million per annum.
The surplus thus accumulated has been
applied to capital improvements of the bridge,
such as increased customs warehouse facilities, bus terminals, marshalling areas, and so
forth.
In the light of this record, and in view of
the service provided, the Government of
Canada has been satisfied with the performance of the Bridge Authority. However, it
had to be anticipated that by 1962, with the
retirement of the bonded indebtedness the
existing authority would be wound up automatically and some consideration of the
future management of the bridge was
inevitable.
In addition, from the Canadian point of
view, Canadian representation on the bridge
authority was three members out of a total
of nine. However, these matters would not
have been expected to arise until some time
in the '60's, just prior to the normal expiration of the present arrangement. However,
about 1955, the City of Buffalo and the adjoining counties were much concerned about
the development of the Port of Buffalo to
take advantage of the increased shipping
anticipated, as a result of the St. Lawrence
Seaway development.
A scheme to apply the net profits of the
Bridge for Buffalo port expansion was proposed, and this resulted in an enactment by
the Legislature of the State of New York, in
1955, of a statute creating the Niagara Frontier Port Authority. of interest to Canada
was the fact that this statute placed the
Peace Bridge and its revenue under this
authority. The statute also provided that out
of a twelve-man authority, three would be

NOVEMBER 28, 1957
Canadians, with the right to participate in
matters affecting the bridge only. Canada
was not consulted concerning this enactment.
Almost immediately following this enactment, this oversight was appreciated within
the State of New York and an opinion by
the Attorney General of the State was given
to the effect that such changes could not be
effected without the consent of Congress and
the Parliament of Canada. This, of course,
was also the position of the Canadian
Government.
Following this, representation from the
Government of the State of New York and
the City of Buffalo with the support of the
United States Embassy, sought the approval
of Canada for the proposed changes. It was
stated that the port authority could not function unless it included the bridge project. It
was also stated that the terms of the trust
indemnity which accompanied the issue of
the bridge bonds made it necessary that the
bridge and the port be included under one
authority if the New York share of bridge
revenues was to support the project.
The Government considered this matter,
and while desirous of maintaining the tradition of co-operation between the two countries came to the conclusion that the New
York State proposals, as embodied in the
Niagara Frontier Port Authority statute,
were unacceptable. It was, however, recognized that the United States did have a half
ownership interest in the bridge and, therefore, had the right to request an alteration
in the status of the bridge if they so wished.
It was also recognized, as I mentioned
earlier, that because of the reversionary
clause some new arrangements would have to
be worked out for the period subsequent to
1962, and that Canada would want action to
increase the Canadian representation on the
authority from the present position of three
members out of nine. Accordingly, the New
York State Embassy was informed that while
the proposal was unacceptable, Canada was
prepared to discuss appropriate alternative
arrangements for the future.
Discussions at the official level followed,
and on November 23rd, 1956, in a further
note to the United States Embassy, Canada
outlined certain principles which it felt should
govern any future arrangements for the
operation of the bridge. These were:
1. The control and management of the
bridge should be vested in an international
commission composed of equal representation from Canada and the United States with
the chairmanship alternating between Canada
and the United States from within this
membership;
2. The control and operation of the bridge
should be kept separate from any other
Canadian or United States interest;

3. The first charge on all revenues of the
bridge must be the normal operating costs,
the amount required annually for normal
maintenance of the structure and its auxiliary buildings on both approaches, and the
annual cost of such capital works as are
required from time to time to accommodate
the traffic seeking to use the facility.
Canada also stated its view that any excess
or net revenue, after the charges referred to
in (3) above had been met, should be divided
equally as between the two countries, to be
paid to agencies designated by the appropriate
legislative bodies.
These principles were ultimately agreed
upon and it was further agreed to retain the
existing authority with suitable alterations
as the best means of implementing the principles. The most important alteration, from
the Canadian point of view, was an increase
in Canadian membership on the commission
to five, or a position of equality, with the
additional provision that the chairmanship
would alternate annually between a Canadian
and United States member of the commission.
Other arrangements were to provide for the
control of increases in tolls, in Canada to be
subject to the authority of the Board of Transport Commissioners, and the purposes for
which tolls were to be levied. The current and
future capital needs of the bridge were to be
provided for by the creation of a capital improvements reserve fund into which would be
paid a rising percentage of the gross receipts
of the bridge up to 14 per cent per annum.
Finally, in accordance with the principles
outlined earlier, it was agreed that it would
be provided that any net revenues would be
distributed in equal shares between Canada
and the United States.
These agreed charges were embodied in
amendments to the existing New York State
Act which created the Peace Bridge authority.
These were passed by the New York State
Legislature at its last session, and the first
version of the Niagara Frontier Port Authority
Act suitably amended to remove provisions
touching on the Peace Bridge. A concurring
resolution approving the arrangements has
been passed by the United States Congress.
The Bill before this House will, if enacted,
complete Canada's part in the arrangements
by amending the existing Canadian statute
to provide for increased Canadian membership
from three to five, the receipt of 50 percent
of the net revenue from the operation of the
bridge, and to extend the life of the authority
until January lst, 1992. This date will provide
a period which, taking into account the time
necessary for legislative passage and suitable
terms of bond issue, and so forth, has been

SENATE
agreed as a suitable period to provide a reasonable life for the authority and yet provide an opportunity for review by both
countries in the future.
This bridge, as honourable senators will
appreciate, is important to Canada because of
its role as an economic artery, as a link between Canada and the United States, and as
an important customs port of entry. It is also,
of course, of considerable direct importance
locally as a large employment factor in the
town of Fort Erie and surrounding municipalities, in addition to its transportation
value. In this connection the capital works
program, to which I made reference earlier,
is of considerable national and local importance. A number of important projects, on
the Canadian side particularly, require
completion.
It will be the policy of the Canadian Government; through its representatives on the
authority, to ensure that the capital works
required by the bridge are completed within a
reasonable period of time. The capital improvements reserve fund, to which I have also
made reference, will ensure that not only
these works but any others in the future that
might be required can be financed either on
a cash accrual basis, which has been the
policy of the present authority up to now,
or by a new loan in one form or another when
the existing bond issue has been recalledwhichever in the opinion of the new authority
members seems to be in the best interests of
the bridge, taking all factors into account.

Finally, the 1934 statute, which this bill
proposes to amend, provides in section 11
that the bridge and its real property in
Canada shall be subject to assessment and
taxation by local authorities. I understand
that a satisfactory arrangement for taxation,
worked out between the town and the bridge
authority, has been in effect for several years
and will run into 1962, when it is presumed
new arrangements would be worked out. I
am sure honourable senators will be pleased
to know that it is not proposed to disturb this
situation and nothing in the amending bill
before us will limit or affect this liability to
taxation. It bas been provided, however,
that an amount equal to any amount which
may be paid in the way of taxes to a Canadian
Government entity will be paid to an entity
designated by the State of New York.
In conclusion I would like to say that taking
into account the international character of
the situation, the arrangements for the future
of the bridge appear to be reasonable and
efficient and are in the interests of Canada.
I should like also, on this occasion, to endorse what was said by the Honourable the
Leader of the Government at the hast session
on the subject of the spirit of co-operation
exemplified by these arrangements. While
there were earlier misunderstandings that
might have produced much more serious problems, these did not long survive once discussions between
representatives
of both
countries took place. From that point on,
one cannot speak too highly of the attitude
taken by the United States representatives,
both at the Federal and at the State level.

SENATE
SPEECH FROM

THE THRONE

MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
November 27, consideration of Her Majesty
the Queen's Speech at the opening of the
session and the motion of Hon. Mr. White,
seconded by Hon. Mr. Méthot, for an Address
in reply thereto.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, with the very kind permission of
my honourable colleague from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croll), who adjourned the
debate on Wednesday last, may I have the
pleasure of addressing you at this time? I
had notHon. Mr. Macdonald: Before the honourable
senator proceeds, am I to understand that the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina is
giving way, or will be speak later?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: He will speak later, or
adjourn the debate, I am not sure which.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I will adjourn the debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Are you speaking on behalf
of the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No one can speak on
behalf of my friend from Toronto-Spadina.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I
want to know if this can be done. Is there
a rule which says that a senator may adjourn
a debate, withdraw, and speak later?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Well, I have seen it
done a good many times.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I want a ruling.
The Hon. the Speaker: With the consent of
the Senate, the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) may
address the Senate at this time.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Then you can do anything
with the consent of the Senate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In answer to my honourable
friend from New Westminster (Hon. Mr.
Reid), I would say that the consent of the
house must be had first. That is the only
way it can be done. If the consent of the
Senate is given, I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I presume I have the
consent of the house?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Nothing hangs on the
matter: it is just a matter of procedure.
The honourable senator from TorontoSpadina and I discussed this matter only
this afternoon, and it was arranged that

I should proceed. He had been very busy
over the weekend, and I was not quite so
busy. It is small matter, and I thank my
honourable colleagues for seeing it in that
light and for permitting me to proceed at this
moment. It is a little more convenient, that
is all.
Honourable senators: I was about to say
that I had not intended to take part in the
debate on the Speech from the Throne this
session, as I did at a number of previous
sessions but certain statements in an address
made in the Senate last week by the honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon.
Mr. Pouliot) stirred me up sufficiently that I
thought some reply should be made, lest by
our silence we of the Senate be understood
to be unanimously in favour of those statements. Perhaps everyone else agrees with
them, but I disagree, and I thought it wise and
necessary to state my grounds for disagreement.
The honourable senator from De la Durantaye made certain critical references to the
Supreme Court of Canada, particularly with
respect to a recent decision of that court in
the case of Saumur versus the City of Quebec
(1953) 2 S.C.R., at page 299. That is the
official citation, but the case, for certain
reasons, has become known as the Jehovah's
Witnesses case.
In my opinion a criticism of the Supreme
Court of Canada in this chamber takes on
certain importance. While the court itself
has been established for some considerable
time, only recently has its jurisdiction been
extended and has it become the court of last
resort for the whole of Canada. It is in the
national interest, honourable senators, that
when a court deserves the public confidence,
that confidence should be retained, and the
court that deserves the confidence of the
public of Canada should be permitted to
continue in that confidence.
May I note in passing that this court has
no means of defending itself on the floor
of this house; but on the other hand, it may
well be said that it has no need to defend
itself, that if its case is good somebodyeven as humble an advocate as myselfwill in all probability take up the challenge
on its behalf.
Let me by way of introduction assure the
honourable senator from De La Durantaye
and all other honourable senators that I have
no criticism of a senator's action in criticizing the court, if in that senator's opinion the
public interest is to be served by so doing.
The court is a creature of Parliament; it is
established by Parliament for the administration of the law as passed by Parliament. I
know that we carefully refrain from commenting on cases while they are in the course

DECEMBER 2, 1957
of trial before any court, lest the debates in
this house or in the other house in some way
influence the decision of the court, which,
of course, should always be in accordance
with the evidence; uninfluenced by public
clamour; and lest by our interference we do
an injustice to one or other, or perhaps both,
of the litigants, and make the role of the
court that much more difficult. But, honourable senators, once a decision has been rendered by a court of law, and that court
is functus officio in the matter, the decision
of the court becomes fair subject for our
consideration. Neither the court nor its
decisions are sacrosanct, certainly not on
the floor of this house. As a matter of fact,
it may be that we in Parliament may be
called upon to correct a decision of the court
which we think is wrong by passing legislation to that effect.
Now, while I acknowledge the honourable
senator's right to criticize the court, and
while I thoroughly enjoy his eloquence and
humour and admire his parliamentary skill,
in this instance I am obliged to disagree with
him. Lest silence on my part be taken for
assent, I feel impelled to express my disagreement. In my humble opinion, the decision which the honourable senator criticized
was a wise decision and it was sound in law.
May I pause here to observe that when
one, however eminent and learned he may be
in law and other matters, disagrees with the
Supreme Court of Canada he should remind
himself, before rushing into print or addressing one of the houses of assembly:
First, that nine high-standing professional
jurists, after hearing argument by leading
counsel, may conceivably know as much
about the subject as does the critic himself.
That may be a slight understatement, but it
would be well to bear in mind, when one
takes issue publicly with a court, that the
court has had advantages, both individually
and as a group, of knowing a good deal about
the subject of their decision.
And second, just as the Constitution of the
United States has been said to be what the
Supreme Court of the United States says it is,
so the law of Canada-the Supreme Court of
Canada being the court of last resort-is
what that court says it is; of course, with
this reservation: until it is changed by due
process of parliamentary procedure.
Now the subject of this court's decision
which was criticized so severely by my friend
the senator was a bylaw of the city of Quebec
which reads in the following words, which
I take from the decision of the court itself.

having previously obtained for so doing the written
permission of the Chief of Police.
That is paragraph 1 of the bylaw.

Then the

bylaw goes on to provide penalties for the
distribution of literature without that police
licence.

Honourable senators should know that the
bylaw provides no rule or direction for its
application, except only that unless permitted
by the censor there may be no distribution.
That is the simple statement of the bylaw,
and that only, without any rule or direction
as to its application. The granting or refusal
of a licence depends entirely on the will of
the Chief of Police, of the censor, applied to
the content of the document.
Honourable senators will also observe that
the bylaw is sweepingly wide in its application. It may permit distribution of literature
of one political party and refuse distribution of
literature of another political party, should
the censor feel that that was the thing to do.
If the Chief of Police feels so inclined, he
may permit the distribution of one newspaper
on the streets of Quebec and refuse a similar
right to another newspaper.
The prohibitions contained in that bylaw
are not confined to documents expressive of
religious or anti-religious dogma, though it is
certainly wide enough to include such literature. It is evidently applicable to all literature
of any religious character

or non-religious

character, for no literature of any character
can be distributed unless approved by the
Chief of Police. That it did include documents
of a religious or anti-religious character is
evident from the fact that the bylaw was
used to prevent distribution of literature by
the sect known as Jehovah's Witnesses. I am
not interested in the sect or in the content of
the literature, provided the statements were
not contrary to law, which is not alleged. The
case has become known as the Jehovah's Witnesses case, because it was that sect which
took action to impugn the legality of the
bylaw.
I pause here again to observe, though perhaps unnecessarily, that I am not defending
in any way that particular sect. The Witnesses
were not under trial in that case. It was the
bylaw that was the subject for discussion, not
the people who were impugning its validity.
May I say to the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot), who I am
very sorry is not present tonight, that this
house owes a debt of gratitude to him for
his having performed a useful service in
bringing to the attention of this house a preConfederation statute of 1852 of the ancient
It is by the present bylaw forbidden to distribute
Province of Canada, 14-15 Victoria, Chapter
in the streets of the city of Quebec any book,
pamphlet, booklet, circular, tract whatever without 175. The relevant portions of that ancient and

SENATE
famous statute are as follows-I read from
page 321 of the case in question:
The free exercise and enjoyment of Religious
Profession and Worship, without discrimination or
preference, so as the same be not made an excuse
for acts of licentiousness, or a justification of
practices inconsistent with the peace and safety
of the Province, is by the constitution and the
laws of this Province allowed to ail Her Majesty's
subjects within the same.

May I read the enactment again, leaving
out one phrase which does not mean very
much in the course of our argument?
The free exercise and enjoyment of Religious
Profession and Worship, without discrimination or
preference . . . is by the constitution and laws
of this Province allowed to ail Her Majesty's subjects within the same.

In my humble estimation that is a very
sweeping and magnificent proclamation of
religious freedom. It is a charter of religious
liberty, and what a tribute it pays to that
generation of statesmen of the old Province
of Canada who passed that statute, and to
those who left it on the statute books at
Confederation!
The honourable senator from De la
Durantaye was rightly proud of that "Magna
Carta" of religious tolerance. Surely he
would not now see it whittled down by
municipal bylaws or bylaws which allow the
liberty so eloquently expressed in that statute
to be extended to one section of Her Majesty's
subjects and denied to others.
My honourable friend said that the Statute
is still in force in the province of Quebec,
by virtue of section 129 of the British North
America Act, which, with your permission,
I shall take time to read to you, because of
its importance in this and other matters. I
shall leave out, as he did, certain portions of
the section of the act which are not necessary for the argument before us at the
moment. Section 129 reads:

jurisdiction had the power after Confederation to abolish, amend or change it?
Honourable senators will find the substance
of the statute now carried forward in the
province of Quebec in the Freedom of
Worship Act, which is section 2, chapter 307
of the Revised Statutes of Quebec, 1941.
My honourable friend questioned whether
the statute was still in force in the province
of Ontario, because he says it was dropped
from the Revised Statutes of Ontario some
little time ago, although he did not mention
when. But here is where the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye and I, with
great respect on my part, differ in this matter of law. As I understand section 129 of
the British North America Act, neither the
Legislature of the province of Ontario nor
that of the province of Quebec has constitutional authority to repeal or amend this act
of the ancient Province of Canada. I submit
that jurisdiction rests exclusively within the
Parliament of Canada.

The question arises

as to what jurisdiction actually has authority
over religious liberty in Canada under the
Constitution of Canada. My honourable
friend says that religious liberty is a matter
of civil rights, under section 92 of the British
North America Act, paragraph 13, which
reads:
Property and Civil Rights in the Province.

With great respect I disagree that religious
liberty, while it may be a civil right within
the dictionary meaning, is included in the
phrase "Property and Civil Rights in the
Province" as it appears in the British North
America Act, and I further submit it was
never intended by the authors of that act
that religious liberty should be a matter of
provincial control and should be included in
the words "Property and Civil Rights in the
Province". Religious liberty, I suggest, to
my friends, is not a local or private matter;
Except as otherwise provided by this Act, ail it is a matter that is nationwide in its imLaws in force in Canada, Nova Scotia, or New

incompatible with provincial status.
That means, of course, very plainly what

it says, that the alteration of an act of the old

DECEMBER 2, 1957
these reasons, quite untenable in my opinion. Even
if such a matter could be so regarded it would
not be a civil right within the province.
He has a good deal more to say about it,
but I think that will be sufficient for my purposes this evening. Religious liberty is but
a part of human liberty. It is obvious that a
general right of liberty is all inclusive, and
is not a proper matter for provincial control,
but in the nature of things is a part of
Canada herself.
Honourable senators, my submission is that
this statute of religious liberty, in force in
the Province of Canada at Confederation,
remained in force in both Ontario and Quebec
quite irrespective of any action which may
have been taken by the Legislatures of
either of those provinces; and it can be
altered or abolished only by the authority of
the Parliament of Canada. If that be so, it
certainly cannot be set aside by a municipal
bylaw, as in this instance there was an
attempt so to do.
With my friend's admonition to the
Supreme Court of Canada to be very careful
in constitutional matters I heartily agree, and,
I am glad to say, so does the court, because
I observe that this judgment covers no less
than 90 pages of printing in the Supreme

voluminous handling of a case in which there
was evidently a very thorough investigation.
For preserving inviolate this religious charter
of freedom, which we in the province of
Ontario and you in the province of Quebec
have inherited from our predecessors in life
in the old province of Canada, I conceive that
the Supreme Court of Canada is entitled to
our thanks, not to our censure. The Court
should be thanked rather than criticized. In
that regard, I am sorry, as I said before, that
my friend from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr.
Pouliot) is not present this evening, because
if he were I might still hope that he would
join me in that sentiment.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
it had not been my intention to take part in
this debate, any more than the honourable
senator who bas just resumed his seat, but
I, too, was somewhat struck, and perhaps I
may say somewhat perturbed, by the speech
the other day of the honourable senator from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot). I do
not think there is much that I need say with
regard to that, except this, that I do entirely
agree with the interpretation of the British
North America Act which has been so ably
put before the Senate this evening by the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
The basic question
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
really is, as he says, whether these fundamental rights-the right of free speech, the

right of free exercise of one's religion, the
right of assembly to discuss public grievances
-is a matter which under the British North
America Act falls within the purview of the
federal jurisdiction or the provincial jurisdiction. The honourable senator from De la
Durantaye, in the case of freedom of religion,
made this statement, which appears on page
272 of Hansard:
I have put that case before Parliament to
establish that the freedom of religion is a highly
personal and civil right which belongs exclusively
to provincial jurisdiction.
Now, with profound respect, I completely
disagree with that statement. If honourable
senators will look at the provisions of the
British North America Act they are well
aware that the division of legislative powers
between the federal authority, on the one
hand, and the provinces on the other, is set
out in sections 91, 92 and 93 of that act. The
basic difference between our Constitution, as
set out in those sections of the British North
America Act, and the Constitution of the
United States, is that the residual power in
our Constitution lies with the federal authority. Section 91 says that the Parliament of
Canada may:
mIake laws for the Peace, Order and good Government of Canada, in relation to al Matters not
coming within the Classes of Subjects by this Act
assigned exclusively to the Legislatures of the
Provinces; . . .
In other words, unless you can find some
special power granted to the provinces by
section 92, anything else falls within the
jurisdiction of the federal authority.
My honourable friend from De la Durantaye bases his view that freedom of religion
is a provincial power on subsection 13 of
section 92 of the British North America Act,
which enumerates the powers inherent in the
provinces. Subsection 13 gives as one of the
powers granted to the provinces "property
and civil rights in the province".
Now, I thoroughly agree with my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity that it is
inconceivable that those words "property and
civil rights in the province" can by any
stretch of the imagination be taken to extend
to these wide general rights such as freedom
of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of
assembly and so forth. These are basically
federal matters-they are basically inherent
in our democratie way of life.
Honourable senators will see what was
meant to be granted to the provinces if they
will look at the last subsection of section 92
-that is, the subsection which follows all
these other subsections, including subsection
13 of which I spoke; this last subsection
reads as follows:
Generally all matters of a merely local or private
Nature in the Province.

SENATE
Now, can any honourable senator take the
view that these basic questions, these fundamental pillars of our democratic system, can
in any way, shape or form be said to be
matters of "a merely local or private nature
in the province"?
So, I must say that I entirely disagree with
the honourable senator from De la Durantaye. Like my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity, I am sorry that the honourable
senator is not in the chamber this evening
to reply to us. But like my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity, I felt I had to
get up and at least say what was in my mind,
and go on record as being completely opposed
to the point of view which the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye took in the
speech he made a few days ago.
Hon. C. G. Power: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Am I or am I not
right in this statement: that the proponents
of Confederation in the province of Quebec
urged the acceptance of the pact upon their
fellow citizens of that province by saying
that their rights to their religion and their
language were protected by that very subsection which you quoted, that is to say, the
property and civil rights subsection? Historically, am I not right in that statement?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I have no such knowledge.
Hon. Mr. Power: I have always understood
that to be the view which prevails, at any
rate, within our province. Whether it be
founded on an exact and proper legal interpretation of the British North America Act,
I am not sufficiently learned in constitutional
law to say. However, I think from the standpoint of history it is fairly accurate to say
that this pact would not have been generally
accepted in the province of Quebec unless
persons who were instrumental in the promotion of the acceptance of the pact had told
their constituents, and the people of the
province of Quebec generally, that their
rights to religion and language were protected by that very section 92.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it was not unanimous.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: That is the point.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: There were two groups,
two each, who dissented, not necessarily on
this particular point.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Was it not a decision of
five judges against four?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, it was a five-tofour decision.
Hon. Mr. Monette: In which religion did not
play much part?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think it played
any part.
Hon. Mr. Moneite: There were both Roman
Catholic and Protestant judges on each side
of the question.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Monette: So it can be said that
the honourable judges of the Supreme Court
did not express views that were tainted by
their own personal religious feelings.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Quite right.
Hon. Mr. Monette: The views of the members of the court were divided five to four.
Therefore, is it not correct to say that the
authority which the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity has mentioned as flowing
from that decision is somewhat impaired by
the fact that it was not a unanimous decision,
but was divided five to four?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: My honourable friend is
correct, it was a divided decision. In this
respect I rather agree with the honourable
senator from De la Durantaye, that in our
court each judge may write his own judgment. In this case two judges joined in one
decision and two in another. The senator
from De la Durantaye pointed out how difficult it is to discover what was really the
decision of the court, because it is necessary
to read all the lengthy judgment. That is
quite different from the practice in the Privy
Council, where one decision is written. HowHon. Mr. Roebuck: May I be allowed to ever, it is law in Canada that the majority

makes the decision, and in this case the

move adjournment of the debate.
Now let me say a word in reply to what
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: May I be permitted my friend from Gulf (Hon. Mr. Power) asked
to ask a question of the senator from Toronto- about head 13 of section 92 of the British
North America Act:
Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)?
Property and Civil Rights in the Province.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes.
Let me point out that there are many rights
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Was the judgment preserved in the British North America Act,
of the Supreme Court of Canada in the Sau- in sections other than head 13 of section 92.
mur case a unanimous judgment?
For instance, section 93 guarantees the right

DECEMBER 2, 1957
to denomninational scliools. That is not property and civil riglits at ail. Had it been so,
it would not have been necessary to enact
section 93 guaranteeing to the people of my
friend's province and of the other provinces
the right to denominational schools and to
other things, sucli as the right to 11f e, which
is more important than the riglits to property,
to either of the two languages, to parliamentary government and to many other
valued privileges.
The right to freedom and the democratic
way of 11f e is guaranteed in the British
North America Act in the opening paragraph
of section 91, and these fundamental principles are flot a part of liead 13 of section 92.
If I were given time I could run through
the act and point out section after section
which guarantees the riglits of the people of
Quehec and upon which the Fathers of Confederation relied when tliey consented to
Confederation.
I arn not tryîng to whittle down the riglits
granted in head 13, "Property and civil rights
in the province", but the section applies for
the most part to rights attaching to property
-contractual rights and other such civil
riglits. 'Under head 13, for instance, the
province of Quebec was guaranteed the civil
law, with regard to property and such rights
as are attached to property. I should flot say
"1rights attached to property", because there
are no rights attached to property; there are
rights attaching to men and women with
regard to property. That is the better way
to, express it.
So, if a constitutional iawyer from the province of Quebec confines lis case for the
guaranteed privileges of his province solely
on liead 13 of section 92 he is xnissing a
very great deal of the act upon which lie

could rely, and upon which I submit to you
the statesmen of Quebec did rely at the time
of Confederation.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Monette, the debate
was adjourned.

NOTICE OF INQUIRY

STANDS

On the notice of inquiry by Hon. Mr. Reid:
1. Will the Government have drawn to the attention of the Royal Commission, set up by the
Government to inquire into and make recommendations relating to energy and sources of energy
that fall within the jurisdiction of Parliament, the
situation in British Columbia whereby natural gas,
the product of Canada, is being sold at a reduced
or lesser price than that being charged for consumption of Canadian natural gas in the United
States?
2. Will the Government have inquiries instituted
by the said Commission as to the reasons why the
Westcoast
Transmission
Company
were
not
obligated to comply with the regulations governing
the exportation of natural gas set out by Order-inCouncil P.C. 1955-907, section 9, which reads:"The price charged by a licensee for power or
gas exported by him shall not be lower than the
price at which power or gas, respectively, is
supplied by him or his supplier in similar quantities
and under similar conditions of sale for consumption
in Canada."

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, the
same thing is true to this inquiry. I have
asked for the information, and as soon as it
is available I will give it to the house.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I hope we get it before
Christmas.
The Hon.

the Speaker: The notice stands.

Hon. Donald Cameron rose in accordance
with the following notice:
That he will draw the attention of the Senate
to the necessity for Canada to mobilize and expand
the educational resources of the nation with a
view to maintaining and strengthening her position
as a member of the world community.

He said: Honourable senators, first of all
I should like to thank the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) for his
courtesy in giving me the detailed answers
to my inquiry with respect to federal contributions to education. This is information
which is not generally known outside of
Parliament, not nearly as widely known as
it should be. Also it establishes the principle
that the federal Government has already
recognized, in a substantial way, the responsibility to assist the provinces in the field
of higher education.
The present crisis in education is a subject
on which many citizens are expressing concern today, and my justification for bringing
it into this forum is that I believe the Senate
can perform a very useful service in giving
some study and thought to this important
question. The way in which we meet the
crisis is likely to have a great deal to do with
the economic growth and development of
this country in the next 25 years.
Obviously if we are to deal with the situation adequately we will have to acquire a
new perspective with respect to the cost of
education, and I think we will have to
evolve a new sense of values as to what is
important in our national life. We are living
in a rich and extravagant age, when millions
of dollars are being spent on things which,
if it became a matter of the survival of the
country, we could do without and not suffer
very great hardship. You have only to think
of the extravagant bills for advertising, television, radio, entertainment, liquor, packaging etc., to realize the importance of that
statement.
The reason I mention this is that these
and countless less worthy examples of our
extravagant way of living which come to
mind, all serve to underline an imbalanced
sense of values in our life which is almost
tragic. Against this ostentatious display of
economic waste we contrast the fact that the
professors in our universities, the teachers in
our schools, the ministers in our churches,
and, in short, all of those agencies which are
concerned with building and maintaining the
educational, spiritual and moral values in our
communities, continue to struggle along like
so many mendicants, trying to eke out an

DECEMBER 3, 1957
existence with austerity budgets, and being
constantly told that more money cannot be
made available for these purposes because
we cannot afford them. To say that we
cannot afford the kind of educational system,
or the kind of church community we need,
is just so much nonsense. We can afford
these things when we develop a sense of
values which appreciates their importance;
and when we do that we shall find that the
answer to the needs of education in particular
is not to be found in the provision of money
alone. If we are to develop and maintain
the kind of educational system we need in
the Space Age, we shall need more money,
and lots of it, but we shall also need new
motivations for our youth, and a different
set of heroes from those rather shadowy ones
set up by radio, television and film industries.
I stress these things at the beginning, because if we are to succeed in the new competition for survival we must understand that it
can only be done on the basis of a new
mobilization of our resources for the national
welfare and a new sense of discipline and
dedication on the part of our people.
Having reviewed the background, I would
like now to state the educational problem and
to put forward some proposals which I hope
may be the basis of a forward move in Canadian education. Some time ago the honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall),
in an excellent speech, dealt with some aspects
of the educational problem, and I do not propose to duplicate what he said so well.
In a free society great changes can only
come about when people are informed and
have the facts on which to base judgments.
Before they can be informed it is necessary
to mobilize the resources of information and
to disseminate the basic factual material as
widely as possible among people who exercise
a role of leadership in the community.
Beginning about 1950, and in many cases
even before the end of the war in 1945, Canadian educators were starting to warn our
governments at all levels that we would be
confronted with a crisis in education, if for
no other reason than the rapidly increasing
post-war birth rate, which it was estimated
would create a serious situation with respect
to teachers and teaching facilities from 1960
onwards. With the onset of the economic expansion in the 50's, business and industry
have also become increasingly aware of a
trained manpower shortage of alarming proportions. The result has been the evolution
of a new and badly needed partnership between business and education. Before 1950
educators were holding meetings and conferences ad inftnitum, but the number of
occasions when businessmen even discussed

education in their meetings, let alone held
meetings about education, were very rare
indeed. It is not so now. In the last few
years educational matters have had an increasingly important place on the agendas of
business groups and some important conferences have been sponsored, if not solely by
businessmen, certainly by businessmen and
educators.
Since 1950 a number of management training schools have been established by universities in co-operation with business, and out
of these has come a new interest in the
broader fields of education. Two or three
years ago Cyrus Eaton established his Pugwash house-party for the interchange of information by international scientists. James
Duncan, an enlightened and distinguished Canadian industrialist, along with Crawford
Gordon of the A. V. Roe Company and a number of others, in 1956 called a National Conference on Engineering,
Scientific
and
Technical manpower. Out of this meeting
came the Industrial Foundation on Education,
a permanent fact-finding and executive organization, with a staff and headquarters in
Toronto. The University of Toronto has followed with its Round Table on Human Needs
in an Industrial Society. In 1956 Queen's
University organized the Queen's Conference
of Executives and Educators.
The four
western universities have set up the Senior
Seminar in Advanced Management at Banff.
And in February of 1958, in Ottawa, there
will be held a large national conference on
education sponsored by some twenty national
organizations. The result of these meetings
has been a tremendous new interest in Canadian education, a new mobilization of factual
information and a determination to do something constructive about it.
In presenting a program of higher education for Canada over the next 22 years,
1958-80, it is well to proceed from the benchmarks of known facts and to make projections from those facts on the basis of the
best advice and experience available. According to the latest estimates of the Dominion
Bureau of Statistics, in the fall of 1957 there
were enrolled in Canadian schools 3,745,000
pupils from age 5 to 21 years, or from kindergarten to grade XIII. To give some idea of
the rate at which school enrolment is growing,
the 1957 figure represents an increase of
568,000 over the enrolment of two years ago.
In the same period of time enrolments in
our universities have increased from 70,000
in 1955 to 79,000 in 1956, and to 85,000 in
1957. In the three-year period 1955-56-57,
according to D.B.S. figures, the total number

SENATE
of students graduating from Canadian
universities with their first degree was:
12,290
1955 ..................
(estimated)
1956..................12,650
(estim ated)
1957..................13,200
In the current academic year 30,000
students are enrolled for their first year at
a university. In terms of past experience
these are substantial figures, and in spite of
substantial building programs which have
been carried out by many universities since
1950 I am reliably informed that the number
of square feet of classroom and laboratory
space available per student is less than it
was in 1950. In other words, our building
program is not keeping up with the present
rate of increase, let alone meeting the need
for greatly expanded numbers of highly
trained people.
In the year 1957 there are 2,000 students
in Canada proceeding to higher degrees in
engineering, science and medicine. Another
2,000 are proceeding to higher degrees in the
humanities. In the academic year 1954-55
the total income of Canadian universities was
$53,082,000 and of this amount $22,300,000
was contributed in one form or another by
the federal Government. In terms of the
thinking which bas governed policy with
respect to higher education in Canada up to
the present time, this has been a substantial
achievement but one falling far short of the
requirements for the maintenance of even
the present rate of progress in our economy.
In the same year we spent $1,685,000,000, for
national defence. The figure I want to leave
with you is that the federal contribution to
education was $22 million some odd hundred
thousand, or approximately .013 per cent of
the amount we spent on national defence.
This figure does not include the amount that
was spent directly on national defence
research.
As all honourable senators are aware, there
have been a number of meetings of educators
and businessmen in the last two years which
have had as their objective an attempt to
define and spell out in specific terms what
our trained manpower needs are likely to be,
either in the 10-year period 1956-65 or in the
25-year period 1955-1980.
Two of these conferences were of national
importance, one being the National Conference of Canadian Universities held in
November 1956, and the other the National
Conference on Engineering, Scientific and
Technical Manpower, held at St. Andrews-bythe-Sea in September of the same year. I
shall quote liberally from both sources,
because the N.C.C.U. estimates are based on
the careful, cautious and minimal requirements so typically requested by university

administrators, while the estimates of the
St. Andrews Conference are those of businessmen and educators and are at a much higher
level, representing the needs as seen through
the eyes of Canadian businessmen.
It should be remembered too that all these
forecasts were made in what we might call
the pre-Sputnik age and before the Western
world had an opportunity to realize that the
launching of the Russian satellite represents
a scientific breakthrough of tremendous
significance. There is little doubt that if
those conferences were being held today, in
December 1957, the objectives would be
substantially increased and the rate of
acceleration of the program as well.
The National Conference of Canadian
Universities estimated that by the year
1965-66 there would be 123,000 students
registered in Canadian universities. The
Dominion Bureau of Statistics estimates that
the number would be 131,000. As a matter
of fact, if the present trend continues, both
estimates are likely to be low on the basis
of what might be called a normal growth.
The N.C.C.U. estimated that they would
need a capital requirement of between $285
million and $300 million, and out of this
amount $56 million would be required for
student residences. In the same period the
universities estimated that their teaching staff
requirements would go up from the present
6,000 to something in excess of 10,000.
The St. Andrews Conference, taking the
25-year period 1955 to 1980, came up with
two projections on enrolment for 1980. The
first estimate was based on the current rate
of increase, which would produce 375,000
university students in that year. The second
enrolment figure was based on the potential
estimate that 30 per cent to 33 per cent of
high school students are of university calibre
if given the opportunity. On this highly
optimistic basis we might expect a university
enrolment of 490,000 students in 1980.
Teaching staff requirements were placed at
a figure in excess of 30,000 and capital
requirements were estimated at $1,750 million.
So much for the estimates of two authoritative and responsible groups. One or two
others might be of interest. The Engineering
Journal of February 1957 states that Canada
will need 145,000 engineers in the next 25
years. This is an average of nearly 6,000
engineering graduates a year, or twice the
post-war peak of 1950 and nearly four times
the present rate of graduation. Actually we
graduated only 1,700 engineers in Canada in
1957.
Related to the scarcity of engineering
graduates is an even more serious situation
with respect to technicians. According to

DECEMBER 3, 1957
engineers 46 are working in private industry,
23 are teaching, and the rest are mainly in
governmental employment. Britain estimates
that by the beginning of 1960 she will need
30,000 more scientists and engineers.
In the United States, in 1954 there were
22,000 engineering graduates, almost a 60
per cent decrease from the peak of 1950,
when the veteran-swollen classes produced
52,000 engineers. The Americans, unless they
launch a "crash program", can scarcely expect
a growth to more than 43,000 by 1964.
In a study entitled "Soviet Professional
Manpower", published in 1955 by Nicholas
de Witt of Harvard, the comparable figures
given for Russia were: engineering graduates
-60,000; technicians-lower grade engineers
-70,000.
The foregoing figures have been crosscheeked and accepted as reasonably accurate
by the American Science Foundation.
I think I have given enough information
to suggest that we are faced with a problem
of major national importance, and now I
would like to discuss some of the steps which
need to be taken to relieve the situation.
Obviously, if we are to produce a much
greater number of highly trained scientists,
engineers and technicians and the complementary numbers in the humanities, we can
only do so if the foundation of the educational
pyramid, the elementary and secondary school
system, is sound. Little need be said about
the numbers in the elementary schools.
Children of school age must attend school,
and our concern here must be with the
provision of an adequate number of properly

E. W. Wood, Principal of the Institute of
Technology and Art in Calgary and a distinguished Canadian educator, the ratio of
engineering technicians to engineers varies
from industry to industry and from. plant to
plant. In some cases it is two to one, in others
five to one, and sometimes higher, but it is
expected that the five-to-one ratio will be
the most common very soon. The present
need for technicians is six times greater than
the number being produced. In 1957 we produced 1,700 engineers, and on a ratio basis
of two technicians to one engineer we should
have graduated 3,400. We actually graduated
less than 600. As a matter of fact we have
only two training institutions in Canada in
this field-the one in Calgary already referred to, and the Ryerson Institute in
Toronto. It is estimated that to meet Canadian needs for technicîans in the next 25
years we would have to enrol an average of
62,000 per year because the drop-out experience in this field is 40 per cent, which would
leave a net graduation in this field after
matriculation, plus two years in a technical
school, of 37,200 per year.
Before leaving the assessmient of the existing situation it would be well to have some
appreciation of what our competitors are
doing. It is becoming generally accepted
today that a nation's economic and productive
progress is determined by the number of
university graduates in relation to population.
On the basis of this yardstick the following
chart prepared for the St. Andrew's Conference, and shown on p. 11, part 2, of the
brief is enlightening:

SENATE
to 33 per cent of the pupils in high school
have the I.Q. necessary to succeed in the
university. Instead of 30 per cent completing
high school, however, the number is about
7 per cent. How can we get the larger
number necessary to enter and graduate with
one, two, three or more degrees from a
university? While by no means professing
to be an expert in what is needed, I am going
to suggest a program for our schools which I
think would improve the situation greatly.
We will start with the teacher.
If we are going to attract to and retain
people in the profession, I suggest that the
following steps are necessary, in the order
named:
1. An insistence on a high degree of professional training for all teachers before
getting permanent certification.
2. On receiving permanent certification the
teacher's professional status to be equated as
equivalent to law, medicine, science or any
other profession.
3. Salaries to be paid commensurate with
other professions, with provision for substantial salary increments on the basis
of satisfactory experience and outstanding
achievement.
4. Provision of adequate, modern teaching
facilities. This does not mean the spending
of millions on gymnasiums and swimming
pools, but it does mean bright, airy, functional classrooms with good equipment. Some
of our schools are so depressing that it is no
wonder students want to escape from them as
soon as possible.
Before leaving this section on the role of
the teacher I should like to say a word about
salaries. In 1955 the monthly starting salaries
of students graduating from the university
with their first degree was as follows:

I suggest to you that in order to put those
salaries on a par with other professions they
should have been increased by 50 to 75 per
cent. On the basis of a 75 per cent increase
this would have meant a salary range of
$7,239 for 4 years' professional experience,
$8,166.95 for 5 years' and $9,453.50 for 6
years'. Not until we pay such salaries, and
as well attend to the other matters I have
mentioned, will we get the teachers we need,
nor will the profession have the dignity and
status in society that its importance demands.
Now I come to the question: How do we
get the students to complete matriculation?
Having established the fact that there is
no dearth of matriculation candidates with
the potential to succeed, it becomes a matter
of how we persuade, encourage and assist,
if necessary, the larger number required.
First of all, I will assume that if the steps
outlined above with respect to the teachers
and teaching facilities are carried out, this
in itself will go a long way toward encouraging the students to complete their high school
programs. First-class teachers with dignity
and status in the community, plus attractive
and functional school facilities, will do a lot,
but we need to do more, and I would suggest the following:
1. Put on a program in the schools, on the
air, on television and in the press and
magazines explaining the opportunities and
rewards open to those who proceed to higher
education.
2. Stress the national importance of the
educator, the scientist and the public servant.
Create a new sense of values designed to
give the technician, the engineer, the scientist
and the professional man a new and more
important status in the community. In short,
make the people who serve the nation the
ideal to be followed rather than the shoddy
imitation foisted on the people by Hollywood
press agents.
3. Make more use of talks and visits to
the schools by professional people of stature.
Try to make the average schoolboy as
familiar with the names of leaders in
business, labour and the professions as he is
with movie stars and rugby or football
players.
4. Establish a National Awards Program
with substantial rewards for outstanding
achievement. This would in reality be a
large and widely publicized extension of the
present more or less haphazard scholarship
program.
The next point is where we take off into a
new departure as far as Canada is concerned.
5. Establish a revolving scholarship and
loan fund. A national program to be set up

DECEMBER 3, 1957

in two parts: (a) A charitable foundation
through which private gifts may be encouraged and channelled for the specific purposes
of encouraging high school and technical
school education, and (b) A special fund to
be created and administered by local school
authorities, 50 per cent of the fund to be
raised by a fractional assessment on the mill
rate and 50 per cent to be contributed by
the provincial governments.
The purposes of the revolving scholarship
and loan fund would be:
(i) To see that no boy or girl with the
necessary ability is denied the opportunity
for a complete high school education by lack
of funds.
(ii) To provide a system of scholarships
awarded on the basis of scholarship rather
than need. These should be limited in number but of high value for each year of high
school.
(iii) Provide a system of non-refundable
bursaries awarded on the basis of need.
These should be in amounts of from $50 per
year up to a maximum of 75 per cent of the
students' essential costs. These should be
limited to a specified quota per year per
province.
(iv) Provide a system of student loans to be
made on the security of the parents and the
student, in amounts ranging from $50 up te a
maximum of $300 per year. Loan to be interest-free during the high school term but
te start bearing interest at 3 per cent six
months after graduation and te be repayable
in a period of three years.
(v) The reason for setting up a foundation
is te mobilize the charitable donations of a
large number of private individuals who
would contribute at the local or small community level if they could see the results of
their giving and get income tax credit for it.
(vi) Provincial governments and local school
boards would contribute the funds on an
assessment basis in proportion te the number
of pupils in high school in each school district. Assessments might be made on a per
capita basis with the objective of raising a
fund of $30,000,000 over a three-year period,
the money te come from school boards and
provincial government departments of education, supplemented by such funds as might
come through the educational foundation. The
suggestion is that at least 60 per cent of the
fund be on a loan basis, with the idea that
there is no better time te start inculcating a
sense of responsibility in young people than
when they are in school. By a generous program of scholarships we provide incentive,
but for the person who doesn't quite make the
scholarship there will be non-recoverable bursaries in cases of real need and revolving loans

where need is not quite se great but where
the individual might stop school if the funds
were not available.
(vii) Encouragement of technical education.
It is my suggestion that the various scholarships, bursaries and loan funds be equally
available te the student who does not wish te
go te university but who would prefer te
train as a high grade technician.
I will now deal with the Program at the
University Level. When we come te the current
situation with respect te university education
in Canada the problem is much the same as
it is in the high schools, but in a more acute
form. There is an urgent need te attract te
and retain in university teaching and research
a larger number of better trained people.
There is need for better salaries, for more
teaching buildings, research laboratories and
student residences. It was pointed out earlier
that at the present time there are 15 students
per 1,000 of population in American universities and technical schools against 5 per
1,000 in Canada and 20 per 1,000 in Russia.
Without in any way suggesting that we should
become involved in a race with these nations,
it does seem reasonable that in the next ten
years we should seek to double the number
of Canadians per thousand of population who
will complete university and technical school.
If we accept this as a modest target it will
involve a tremendous increase in the demand
for teaching staff, classroom and laboratory
space, and research facilities.
Without changing the rate of increase projected by the National Conference of Canadian
Universities and the D.B.S., under which they
estimated 130,000 students in 1965, the
doubling of the rate per thousand would
mean that we would have 260,000 students
te provide for in 1965 instead of 130,000.
Even this increase would still leave us far
behind our competitors on a proportionate
basis. However, for the sake of argument let
us assume that we will be content te take
the N.C.C.U's capital cost estimates of $285
million te $300 million for the years 1956-65
and apply them te meeting the needs of
260,000 students instead of 130,000, and we
would arrive at a capital cost structure of
approximately $600 million, or an average of
$60 million a year for the ten-year period.
That sounds like a lot of money for capital
expansion of universities alone. We must
remember that any expansion in elementary
and secondary education facilities, plus those
of technical education, will be over and above
the university programs.
In discussing development needs with
officials of the University of British Columbia
a month ago, I was told that their plans envisaged a program of $10 million a year for

SENATE
the next three years. The University of
Alberta, of which I am a member, was planning to appropriate $10 million a year for
the next two years, but the actual amount
of construction carried out is likely to be
substantially less, so that the amount of
money is more likely to be expended over
three years rather than two.
The estimated income of Canadian universities in the current year is somewhere between $95 million and $100 million, and
expenditures will not be far behind. These
operating costs will also increase very rapidly
as the number of students goes up so that we

are inevitably faced with a budget for higher
education in Canada that, in relation to any
previous concepts, will seem astronomical.
However, figures are only relative. If we
keep in mind the fact that in the current fiscal
year we budgeted for $1,717 million for
defence, and if we also remember that today
a nation's defence is centred in our universities and their products, the figure seems
much more manageable. Assuming that the
cost of operation plus capital expenditures of
the universities in the current year were $160
million to the federal Government and that
the whole amount was called a defence expenditure, which it could be, we wouldn't
hesitate very long in deciding that this was a
necessary and good investment. I suggest to
you, honourable senators, that this may be
the way we will have to look at our university expenditures if we are going to maintain
our defence and industrial position.
I need not labour the point that if we are
to maintain our position in the new age of
technology which we are entering, we must
raise our financial sights very materially.
Before going on to suggest in practical terms
some of the things we might do to meet the
situation I should like to give you some
additional figures which you may use in
deciding what the cost will be in any given
situation.
At the present time we have in Canadian
universities and research institutions 2,000
men and women proceeding to higher degrees
in medicine, science and engineering. Another 2,000 are proceeding to higher degrees
in the humanities. In other words, in the
current year there are 4,000 students in
Canada in the process of getting their Masters
or Doctoral degrees. In addition, the Institute of International Education in New York
reported that for the 1955-56 year, 1,451
Canadian students were enrolled in American
institutions of higher learning. Of this number the National Research Council reported
that 480 Canadians were enrolled in graduate
courses in 65 American universities.

It bas been suggested by a number of
authorities that we need to double the number of highly qualified scientists in the next
few years. Such a development would certainly be in keeping with the needs of an
ever-expanding economy, and here again the
costs are formidable. For every scientist or
research worker we employ we need a minimum space of 2,250 cubic feet-a space
10 feet x 15 feet x 15 feet. I don't think
anyone would suggest that such a space was
sumptuous. Very accurate studies indicate
that the cost per cubic foot of research space,
including the average minimum essential
equipment, is $3 per cubie foot. If we are to
double the number of scientists we will
require nine million cubic feet of laboratory
space, which alone would cost $27 million.
However, it would be unthinkable to double
the number of scientists without doubling the
number of advanced scholars in the humanities-because it is in this field that we are
sadly far behind-so we could easily involve
a cost of $50 million in the next few years
for facilities for the people who do the basic
research from which all progress comes.
Again, some careful estimates based on
actual studies have been made on the cost of
keeping a scientist at work for a year. The
figure, covering salary, technical assistance,
equipment and materials, is put at $30,000
per scientist. Therefore, if we have 8,000
scientists and scholars at work (the present
2,000 in medicine, science and engineering,
plus 2,000 in the humanities, doubled in ten
years) the cost of this item alone would be
$240 million.
From the foregoing samples of the cost involved it will be readily seen that the day of
the billion dollar budget mainly contributed
by the provinces for university education is
not very far away. Before we are warranted
in spending sums of that kind it behooves us
to look critically at the use we are making
of the facilities we now have and to modify
some of our present practices. Some of the
things we might consider are these:
1. Explore the possibility of extending the
idea of junior colleges in co-operation with
local school boards, to take care of many
first-year and possibly some second-year
students.
2. Consider putting the universities on the
quarter system so that the facilities are used
to capacity the year round instead of the
present seven to nine months.
3. Consider reintroducing for a time at
least the shift system with classes and laboratories running from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. at
night. I know I shall be in hot water with
some of my colleagues over this, because
they do not like this system at all. However,
I think it can be done.

DECEMBER 3, 1957

4. Consideration of the revision of many
laboratory courses which are expensive in
terms of time and space, and which could
be more effectively taught on the job in
industry.
5. Utilize institutions buiît for another purpose but which are no longer fully utilized
because of changing conditions. Examples
are some agricultural schools in Alberta,
normal schools in other provinces or even
some of the more elaborate air force or army
centres.
Considering the kind of people we are
getting at the graduate level, I quote from
an article entitled "What the Colleges are
doing" in the 1957 spring issue of the house
The Dean
organ of Ginn and Company.
Barzun referred to therein is Jacques Barzun,
Dean of the Graduate Faculties of Columbia
University.
Designating the graduate school as the "one
autonomous place where, in a perlod of sllpping
high-school and college standards, the traditional
idea of scholarship can and must be kept intact,"
Dean Barzun warns of threats to the integrity of
this cultural arsenal.
"As things already stand," Barzun asserts, "those
who teach first-year graduate students toc, often
have the feeling that they are taking their young
charges on the adventurous dlscovery of the
three R's."

And he is right.
He makes the followlng charges:
1. The tirne spent in making professional scholars
is toc, long for the results achieved.
2. Instructors are required to do too much lecturing and students too much sitting and note-taking:
both groups should do more "independent work"
and corne together for periods of true tuition and
apprenticeship.
13. The research done for the Master of Arts and
Doctor of Philosophy degrees is too often re-search:
It adds little or nothing to knowledge-hence it is
bath pretentiaus and wasteful.
4. Graduate study does not form a coherent
whole: it is neither professional training for college
teaching, nor a dlslnterested intellectual enterprise
by a "company of scholars". The rlght Instruction
is lacking for the former and the right facilities
for the latter.
5. The various devices for comblnlng speclalties
under the name of major and minor do not; lead
to anythlng deserving the title of a course of study:
as a result, it is a rare graduate student who can
be said to be an educated man....

That needs emphasizing, too.
Many millions of dollars could be saved
by this kind of mobilization of resources and
the possibilities should be carefully explored.
Now, while good teachers are essential for
good results in our schools, they are even
more necessary in the university, where
much of the stimulus and enthusiasm comes
from the free interplay of minds, the blending of youth and experience, and the zest of
exploration into the realm of the unknown
with other minds equally curious. Great
teaching comes from a combination of natural
teaching ability, training and deep resources

of the mmnd, and those resources can be
acquired only through years of experience,
study and research. One of the main reasons
we are not attracting to, and retaining in,
university work more men and women of
outstanding ability is low salaries. In the
year 1956 the median salary for all university professors in Canada was $5,775. The
range of salary from lecturer to dean was
from $2,000 to $15,000 and I can assure you
there were precious few deans getting
$15,000.
In 1956 the Canadian Association of University Teachers recommended the following
scales, which are by no means immodest:
Lecturer......................$ 6,000.
Assistant Prof essor............. 8,000.
Assistant Professor............11,000.
Professor .....................
14,000.
Dr. Sidney Smith, in the spring of 1957,
set a target of $12,000 to $14,000 for a full
professor, this target to be attained over a
three-year period. Most Canadian universities
are far behind this objective, as is the University of Toronto itself. Yet, a full professor in the University of Moscow gets
$35,000, and in many cases a summer dacha
in the country is thrown in as a fringe
benefit.
In contrast to the present university salary
scale we find in our business schools that
the young executives in attendance, with one
degree and sometimes none at all, who have
been out of college from six to ten years,
are frequently drawing salaries of from
$10,000 to $18,000. No wonder these men
hesitate to spend another two to three years
doing graduate work at the university at the
salaries offered.
In contrast to this kind of an income, some
honourable senators may have read the estimated annual incomes of a dozen or so of
Canada's radio and television personalities,
as published in the December 7 issue of
Macleans magazine. These varied from.
$t22,000 to $35,000 for well-known stars in
Ontario. Our friends in Quebec are even
more generous, running from $25,000 to
$50,000. No one wants to deny such people
the kind of salaries they are getting, but I
suggest that s0 long as we continue to value
the services of movie stars, radio performers,
football players and hockey players far more
highly than we do those of our scientists,
educators and ministers, there is something
seriously wrong with our sense of values.
If something was done about salaries we
might stop the waste which goes on every
year through the large number of university
trained people who migrate to the United
States, Some honourable senators may have

SENATE
read an editorial in the Ottawa Journal of
November 20, which reads in part as follows:
The Technical Service Council, an organization
which helps (without charge) to find posts for
Canadian scientists, puts out a report telling that
the number of engineers and scientists who left
Canada for the United States between 1951 and
1956 was equal to almost one-third of the graduating classes of that period.

I need not say more on that situation; the
statement speaks for itself.
One reason why many of our graduates go
to the United States to do post graduate
work and are lost to us is that many of the
bigger graduate schools in the United States
have large numbers of highly trained staff
working in a single field. This provides the
opportunity to work with and study under a
number of men in one institution, and thus
the student receives a broader training and
greater stimulus than he would if he studied
in a smaller department in a Canadian university whose leadership in a given sphere
comes from one scientist who cannot possibly
give the breadth of training that would come
from several equally highly trained men.
It is no reflection on Canadian universities
that this situation exists. Obviously, to offer
the requirements for a degree in a variety
of fields, each university needs at least a
nucleus of staff in those fields. However, if
we are to build strong graduate schools in
Canada we will have to give much more
consideration to the idea of specialization
among universities than we have given up
to the present time. In other words, as a
national policy we might agree that one phase
of research would have its main centre at
McGill, another field would be centred at
Toronto, another at the University of British
Columbia, and petroleum engineering and its
related advanced work might be centered in
Alberta. By building up strong graduate
schools with adequate staffs of international
stature we would be strengthening Canada
and making it more attractive for our most
advanced scholars to take the most of their
training and find their job opportunities
here.
Canada has made great strides in the
establishment of scholarships in the universities in the last 25 years, but we are still
far short of the experience in Great Britain
and the United States. In the United Kingdom 78 per cent of the students attending
university are receiving some kind of
assistance. In the United States the proportion is 60 per cent, and in Canada it is 42
per cent. We do better than that at the
graduate level, where about 75 per cent of
the students receive some assistance, although
in many cases the amounts are too small to
make the graduate program attractive.

I have some experience with scholarship
programs and I am convinced that there is no
investment that a country can make that will
pay dividends equal to those returned from
an investment in cultivating young and vigorous minds. In saying this, however, I am going
to suggest a new approach to a program of
national scholarships. By all means let us
continue to provide a large number of scholarships for outstanding achievement. We should
increase the number and the value of those
we have now and we should publicize by
every means at our disposal the outstanding
achievements and contributions of our scholars
and scientists. Having made that provision I
would suggest that if we are going to make it
possible for our students, after graduation, to
earn big salaries in business, industry, and
even in education under a new and more
enlightened dispensation, then I think we
have a perfect right to ask the individual
student after he is established in productive
employment to repay the bursary or loan he
received to put him through. In other words, I
am suggesting that an important aspect of our
new approach to higher education in Canada
should be the establishment on a national
basis of a revolving scholarship and loan fund.
Many of the young men with a degree in
commerce or engineering who pass through
our Management Training School at Banff and
who have been in business for eight to ten
years are earning salaries of from $10,000 to
$15,000 a year. Similarly, many young doctors
I know who have been graduated for ten
years are earning from $12,000 to $25,000 a
year. In the future it would not seem unreasonable to ask people like thern to repay from
their earnings within five years such sums as
may have been advanced to them as student
loans. Such a system would have many advantages. To begin with, no student who
wished to go to the university and had the
talent to do so would be prevented from going.
Secondly, and very importantly, if provision
was made to take care of those in financial
need, albeit on a loan basis, the universities
would be able to rearrange their fee structure
on a much more realistic basis and charge
fees more nearly in line with costs. Finally,
such a scheme could be worked out actuarially
and placed upon a self-supporting basis after
the initial grant had been made. The administrative machinery of the Canada Council could
easily be expanded to look after the program
on a co-operative basis with the National Conference of Canadian Universities.
When we come to the field of graduate
scholarships the matter is not so simple.
People who are going on to doctorates and
post-doctorate work are going to be in nonremunerative work for three, four or five
years, and here some form of subsidy should

DECEMBER 3, 1957
probably be considered as a national investment. As was pointed out earlier, some 75
per cent of those in post-graduate work now
receive assistance which varies in amounts
from $600 to as much as $2,200 per year.
Scientists in charge of research programs say
that as many of these young scientists-to-be
marry-and it is desirable that they should
do so-annual grants in the form of fellowships, assistanceships or research grants,
should be from $3,000 to $4,000 per year. If
we were to assume that 3,000 senior postgraduate students a year were to be given
assistance of an average value of $3,000 each,
such a program would cost $9 million per
year. Here again the self-supporting angle
might be introduced on the basis that the
institution would contribute 50 per cent of
the money as a bursary and loan, the student
would pay the balance, under an agreement
that he would start repaying it within one
year after taking up employment. Such an
arrangement would keep down the budget
required for the program and probably
impress a greater sense of responsibility on
the recipient.
Now, as to the university residence program, the Canadian university student
residence situation today is nothing short of
deplorable. The first enthusiasm of many
a young student has often been dampened, if
not put out altogether by his first unhappy
experience at the Alma Mater of his choice
as he tramps the streets looking for a place
to stay. Canada loses hundreds of students
per year to the United States because most
American universities have done something
about housing their students. As one who
knows how much a well-organized residence
life can contribute to the enrichment of any
program of education, I am appalled at the
lack of initiative on the part of university
administrations in tackling this important
problem. A national program to build
university residences is long overdue. Such
a program can be a self-liquidating project
and the funds can be provided under the
National Housing Act through an amendment to section 16. However, it might be
preferable to consider special legislation
designed to recognize the needs of the
universities for what they are-needs of
great national importance.
I have gone into the university residence
picture in some detail and have prepared a
table of my findings. I do not propose to
read it in detail at this time but, with the
permission of the house, I shall place it on
Hansard, and give you a summary of its
contents.
For table see appendix to today's Hansard,
p. 328.

The survey shows that in 15 out of the 34
Canadian universities, with 62,000 out of a
total enrolment of 85,000, there are in those
universities 6,663 student rooms housing 7,570
students. In other words, approximately one
student in every eight in those universities
has the opportunity to live in a residence. If
we assume that 50 per cent of the students
live at home while attending universities in
their home cities, it still leaves three out of
four, or approximately 32,000, who must live
in rooming houses. These figures are based on
the situation in 1957. Presently declared
building programs for the next 10 years indicate that another 3,600 rooms will be built.
However, while they are being built the
student population will go up from 85,000 to
somewhere between 130,000 and 200,000, so
the residence picture will get progressively
worse unless something is done about it. For
this reason I suggest that either the appropriate sections of the National Housing Act
be amended so that money can be loaned to
the universities through Central Mortgage
and Housing Corporation, or, better still, that
the Government bring in entirely new legislation designed to assist the universities to
build not only residences but research
laboratories as well.
Assuming that the National Housing Act
was used, the arrangement could be that the
university in question would be the corporation with whom Central Mortgage and Housing would deal. The university, as the limited
dividend corporation, would put up one-tenth
of the capital cost and the balance could be
borrowed on a 30- or 40-year basis at an
amortized cost of approximately 4J per cent
or possibly less. Assuming a residence cost
of $4,000 per room, such rooms could be
financed on a self-liquidating basis over the
period at $20 per room per month. As the
majority of these rooms would be for junior
students they could be arranged on the
basis of two students per room, so the cost
for room as distinct from board could be as
low as $10 per month, plus the overhead for
servicing and heating, which should not be
more than another $10 or $12 per month. In
other words, double rooms, including maid
and janitor service, light, heat and maintenance, could be provided at a cost to the
student of $20 to $25 per month if National
Housing Act loans were provided on a 30-year
basis at 4J per cent.
As this is an eminently practical proposition, I am going to suggest that the federal
Government, in co-operation with the universities, should launch a program of building university residences at a cost of $10
million per year for the next ten years.
This would be a $100 million program on a
self-liquidating basis. Such a program would

SENATE
provide about 25,000 rooms on a cost basis of
$4,000 per room, or 20,000 rooms if the cost
was $5,000 per room. The program would
have the following advantages:
1. It would enrich the quality of university life by providing for greater intellectual interchange and stimulus.
2. It would make university life more
attractive and would draw more students to
it as well as cutting down the migration
of those who annually go to the United States
for no other reason than the attraction of
university residence.
3. There is a good precedent for the program in the United States, where college
housing loans were instituted under Title IV
of the U.S. Housing Act of 1950.
4. It will be absolutely necessary if university enrolments are to be increased to the
extent present projections indicate.
5. It would be an entirely self-liquidating
proj ect.
6. Under present conditions it would be a
stimulus to employment.
For these reasons it would be a constructive
thing to do.
Similar special provisions should be made
with respect to facilities in regard to research.
However, I am not going to take the time to
develop that at the present moment.
To sum up the proposals I have put forward as the basis of a practical program of
higher education for Canada in the new
technological expansion which we must face,
I have made the following specific proposals:
1. That to maintain our position among
the modern nations we must improve the
quality of our education at all levels,
elementary, secondary and university.
2. That we will do this by providing
improved teaching facilities and better
trained teachers who will be given a higher
in the
professional status
degree of
community.
3. That in order to attract to and retain
people in the teaching profession at the
elementary and secondary levels we will
have to pay much better salaries, and the
suggestion was that they be raised from 50
per cent to 75 per cent beginning after four
to six years' experience.
4. That in order to provide the necessary
number of university graduates in the next
10 years we must encourage a much higher
percentage of students to complete their
high school education.
5. To encourage students to proceed to
higher training we should greatly expand
our scholarship program in the high schools,
and that we should set up a national foundation for this purpose on the one hand, and

establish a revolving Scholarship, Bursary
and Loan Fund, financed jointly by the
school boards and provincial governments
and to be administered provincially.
6. That in order to meet the desperate
shortage of technicians we must greatly
expand our facilities for technical education,
and that students going into this field should
be brought under both the secondary and
university scholarship and loan programs.
7. That in order to finance the Revolving
Scholarship and Loan Fund, provincial
governments and local school boards should
establish a fund with an initial capital of
$10 million.
8. That at the university level, if we are to
attract to and retain in teaching and research
the number and quality of people necessary,
salaries will have to be substantially raised
and the Canadian Association of University
Teachers' recommended scale of $6,000 for
lecturer, $8,000 for assistant professor, $11,000
for associate professor and $14,000 for full
professor should be a reasonable objective.
9. That to meet the demands imposed by
the increased enrolments already projected
and to meet the impact of a greatly increased
enrolment per 1,000 of population who will
attend the university in the next ten years we
should be thinking of a minimum national
university capital building program of $60
million a year for the next ten years.
10. That if we are to expand our training
program of scientists we shall have to give
more attention to the principle of specialization among universities, so that work in
related fields of scientific research at the postgraduate level will be concentrated and multiresource staffs of international reputation can
be brought together to increase the richness of
the offering to the students.
11. That we should increase very materially
the present scholarship program to recognize
outstanding achievement, but we should also
give consideration to the establishment of a
large, self-liquidating, revolving scholarship
and loan fund, and that the resources of the
Canada Council and those of the National
Conference of Canadian Universities might be
used to administer it.
12. That special attention might be given to
increasing the amounts made available in
fellowships, assistanceships and revolving
loans for those who are going to do from three
to five or more years of research to the doctoral and post-doctoral level.
13. That we should immediately embark on
a ten-year national program to correct the
serious university residence situation by using
the facilities of the National Housing Act and

DECEMBER 3, 1957
the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation to launch a $100 million residence program to be financed on a self-liquidating basis
over a period of 30 years.
14. That we should as a national Government evolve a program of expanding present
facilities for basic research and that we might
give consideration to establishing one entirely
new research centre in Western Canada.
The foregoing proposals will involve expenditures of hundreds of millions of dollars.
It is neither a "crash" program nor one
evolved in a panicky attempt to compete with
the United States, Great Britain and Russia
in a scientific race. Rather it is a modest
program designed to maintain Canada's place
as a modern industrial nation with probably
the richest potential of any country in the
world. To say that Canada cannot do this is
nonsense. To say that assistance in this kind
of educational program is not the responsibility of the federal Government is equally
silly. The truth is that the federal Government has already recognized its responsibility
in this field, and, in the last five years-if
you look at the replies to my questions in
Hansard of November 28-has provided
grants of approximately $143 million. And
this does not include the contribution of $100
million to the Canada Council in 1957.
Honourable senators may have noticed in
the press on Friday, November 29, that the
Government of Australia had decided to increase its assistance to Australian universities by four times, starting immediately. I
am not suggesting that the federal Government should increase its grants to technical
and university education in Canada by any
such amount, but I am suggesting that in
view of the universities' crucial role as the
very basis of our national defence and
industrial and economic well-begin the governments should be thinking in terms of a
program of assistance along the lines indicated, which might cost $150 million a year in
the next ten years. Whether this was charged
up to national defence or whether it was
divided and looked upon as an investment in
productive development matters little, but it
is the kind of program which will repay itself
many times over, and as such I commend
it to your consideration.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I just want to say a word or two in connection with the subject-matter of the speech by
the honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron).
In the first place, I hope that no dominion
Government will ever undertake to take education away from the provinces. That is
where it is now and that is where it ought to
remain. That is one of the most unifying
96702-21

ideas in the whole of Canada and it can only
be kept alive by leaving it strictly alone. The
Fathers of Confederation probably made
many mistakes in drafting the British North
America Act, but when they left education
to the provinces they were on sure ground.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend has
given us figures here this afternoon that I
never expected in my wildest moments to
hear mentioned in public. The millions and
millions of dollars that he threw around here
this afternoon were simply startling. I say
that the Government which I have the honour
to represent in this house will not be spending
that kind of money in the next five years,An Hon. Senator: They have already spent
part of it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -nor will any other government that I know of. The only suggestion
I would make on behalf of the Government
which I have the great honour of representing on the floor of this house is that, should
my honourable friends opposite regain power,
the honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron) be chosen as their Finance Minister.
For if he were to carry out the money-spending policy he has advocated this afternoon,
that Government would not last long.
All my life I have never been sure about
the basis of rewards in terms of money. I
am not a professor in a university; I am just
an ordinary, everyday, jackknife lawyer, who
makes a dollar or two by practising law, and
thereby earns enough for three meals a day
and a bed to sleep in, and is very happy
about it. But never in my wildest moments
have I been convinced that it is extravagant
remuneration that makes people do things.
The boys and girls with whom I was educated,
the young men and women with whom I
graduated from university, and with whom I
have lived many years of my life, and who
chose teaching as their occupation, did not
make money their standard, nor regard it as
the keynote of their activities. I had the
honour of serving for 14 years as a member
of the Winnipeg school board. We hired
many teachers. When I joined the board there
were 500 of them; when I left it their numbers had increased to 1,000. We did not pay
them salaries such as my honourable friend
has mentioned; but I am not sure that even
with the lower salaries then paid we did not
obtain as good services as one gets today
from teachers in the same schools. I do not
believe that, in this matter, money makes any
difference at all.
It is said that some professions do not pay,
financially speaking, as well as others. Of
course not. The differences in the nature

SENATE
of the work involved make equality impossible. May I, as an example, say a word or
two about the medical profession: I hope
the doctors present will forgive me for stating
that the professional experience of a medical
man does not train him to be a good financier;
he is not an expert in the handling of money.
On the other hand, a lawyer, if he has any
inclination for finance or business, is enabled by the experience he gets to capitalize
on it and make profitable investments. By
their very nature, some professions provide
openings along certain lines. On one occasion,
after making a political speech, I was asked
how it came about that I knew certain things
-for instance, what happened in a particular
district to some family of, say, four or five
children and an improvident father. Did I
go and investigate particular cases? I said
the answer was very simple. Somebody, a
day or a week before, had come to my office
and told me the story, not of the family my
questioner had in mind, but of other people
in much the same situation; and human nature
being what it is, I could say that like causes
have very much the same results.
So, I repeat, the payment of large sums
to persuade men to become university professors gives no assurance that one will get what
one pays for. I can remember, although it
is 56 years ago, Dr. Kilpatrick, a professor
in Manitoba University, who at that time received the "large" salary of $3,200 a year.
But what he told his class at the beginning
of the century is as fixed in the minds of
those of his pupils who are now living as
though it were said yesterday. It was not
the salary, it was the man who did the trick.
Therefore, no matter how much we talk
about the salaries that should be paid, there
must be in the individual chosen the heart and
intellect and the desire to be in that profession, or the results will not be worth while.
One word in conclusion. At the DominionProvincial conference the other day, which I
attended as a member of the cabinet, I listened
to the representations of the ten premiers, and
I did not hear one of them mention education
as something for which they required money.
They spoke of roads, bridges, dams, sewage
disposal schemes and enterprises, but not a
word about education. As a matter of fact,
education is a matter of provincial or local
policy; and it is a subject which, more than
any other, raises difficulties between various
provinces. I do not know why it should, but
it does; and I think we in this house would
be very foolish to attempt to deal with the
matter. We should not even recommend to
any Government the outlining of a policy
which would put education under the control
of the federal authority. I am opposed to

the idea, and I believe that any man or woman
who studies the problem will be opposed to it
too. As I have said, the concern of the
Fathers of Confederation was to place the
subject of education under control of bodies
which they believed to be most capable of
attending to it, and for that reason they referred it to the provinces.
I had not intended to speak so long. The
resolution can pass, or not, for all I care;
but 1, and the party I have the honour to
represent, are opposed to the sentiments
contained in it.
Hon. Mr. Cameron: Honourable senators,
may I claim the privilege of saying that I
believe the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) misheard or misinterpreted what I said? I did not say that
education should be under the federal Government: quite the contrary: I suggested that
any such fund as I mentioned should be by
way of supplement. The amount I proposed
was $150 million a year for the next ten
years. The present Government is already
spending nearly $50 million a year. However,
I am not going to argue about figures.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Am I to have the opportunity
of replying to what the honourable senator
is saying?
The Hon.

the Speaker: Yes.

Hon. Mr. Cameron: But the figures I mentioned have been arrived at by men of the
calibre of James Duncan and Crawford
Gordon, who are among Canada's top businessmen, with the assistance of top educators. If
the honourable gentleman wishes to disagree,
that is his privilege.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, may I have a word?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think I am entitled to
reply.
The Hon. the Speaker: I recognized first
the honourable Leader of the Opposition
(Hon. Mr. Macdonald).
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I was going to say
in the first instance that the honourable
senator from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron) will
be entitled to close the debate when all other
honourable senators who wish to take part
in it have spoken. My purpose in rising at
this time is that I thought the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig)
was inclined to belittle the remarks of the
honourable senator from Banff, who obviously did a great deal of research before he
made his speech today.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

DECEMBER 3, 1957
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I feel we are indebted
to him for the information he has given
the house. I did not gather the impression
that he suggested that education should
come under the jurisdiction of the dominion
Government. I thought the purport of his
speech was to leave the field of education
under the jurisdiction of the provinces within
the framework of the British North America
Act. He made many proposals, most of which
I think would have to be carried out by the
provincial governments.
I believe the
Leader of the Government misunderstood
what he said. I gathered from his speech
that these things are needed if Canada is to
maintain its place in the world under present
conditions, and I think he suggested that
this place in world affairs could to a very
large extent be maintained through our
educational institutions. I do not think it
was suggested the federal Government should
supply the money to maintain these institutions, although it could make some contribution. The point is that our primary and
secondary schools and universities will have
to receive more money in order that they
may educate our future generations. The
honourable member from Banff did not suggest that this money should corne from the
federal Government.
The honourable Leader of the Government
suggested that university professors should
not receive more money than they are getting
now, and gave an illustration of a professor
who received $3,500 per year some 52 years
ago.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Fifty-six years ago.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes. The unfortunate
position in which too many of our professors
and primary and secondary school teachers
find themselves today is that teaching salaries
are not much higher than they were 56 years
ago.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: No, no.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Probably I should
not go that far, but the members of the
teaching profession have not received the
increases that others have received. In other
words, the increases they have received have
not been in keeping with the rising cost of
living. I will put it that way and I defy
anybody to prove that I am wrong.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: Teachers are doing better
lately.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, but they are not
receiving what others are. Their income bas
certainly not kept pace with the rising cost
of living. I do not think anyone will go so
far as to say that the salary scale of professors today should not be more than it
96702-21J

was 56 years ago. One of the points the
honourable senator from Banff made was that
professors should receive higher pay today.
Take the question on the public school level.
Where are we going to get teachers for our
public schools unless we give them fair
salaries? There will have to be an increase.
It will not come from the federal Government, but our provincial Governments across
the land can read the speech delivered today
by the honourable senator from Banff.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It was
a brilliant speech.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yes, it was a brilliant
speech.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: They can analyse the
facts he has given. I am sure his speech
will be very helpful to boards of education
throughout the country.
The honourable leader said the provincial
governments need money for roads, bridges,
dams and other works. Admitting the importance of these things, I still think this
honourable body can spare at least one afternoon for consideration of the question of
education. I do not feel we are spending
too much of our time on this matter. I rose
this afternoon not only to commend the
honourable senator from Banff for his speech
but also to commend the honourable junior
senator frorn Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall) for
the splendid contribution which he made to
this subject a few weeks ago. The two
speeches are masterpieces and should be
studied by all who are interested in
education in this country.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Roebuck, the
debate was adjourned.

Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend from
Toronto-Spadina
(Hon. Mr. Croll) may
not agree with me, but there is a point
of order here. Last Wednesday he adjourned
the debate, and when it was next resumed,
which was yesterday, the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon.
Mr. Roebuck) continued the debate. When he concluded his remarks the debate was adjourned

by the honourable senator from Mille Isles
(Hon. Mr. Monette), who is now asking that
the order stand. I do not see how anybody
can precede him.
Hon. Mr. Croll: What is the point of order?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The honourable senator from
Mille Isles is not ready to go on now because
of the hour, and he has asked for an adjournment. Of course, if honourable senators do
not want to grant this adjournment they do
not have to. It is up to the house. I would not
raise any objection to the honourable senator
from Toronto-Spadina speaking after the
honourable senator from Mille Isles, who
wants to follow up the line of thought taken
by the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) and the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen) on a subject in which we are all
very much interested.

that the honourable senator from TorontoSpadina (Hon. Mr. Croll) speak tomorrow, and
then someone could adjourn the debate on
behalf of the honourable senator from Mille
Isles, who could decide when he wished to
speak. Is that agreeable?
Sone Hon. Senators: Yes.

upon us now by the challenging world conHon. Mr. Macdonald: I have a suggestion ditions which cannot be ignored. As for
that would need the unanimous consent of changes, well, every one of us here can recall

DECEMBER 3. 1957
when we could count on the fingers of one
hand the number of countries in the world
which were regarded as industrialized. Education was confined to a comparatively few
persons in most countries, and knowledge
of peoples of many countries did not spread
much outside their own boundaries.
It is true that we talk generally about the
changing world-changed by science in a
hundred ways-but industrially I think we
of the North American Continent are backward in forming a policy to adapt ourselves
to the economic changes going on around us.
When I say "going on around us" I refer to
areas of all the oceans and continents, because scientific development bas changed in
so many respects the significance of geographical boundaries.
I quite agree with those who have spoken
on the subject that we in Canada must plan
for a broadening of our markets and for wider
relations generally so as to be more in line
with what is shaping up to be a well
recognized world movement. To do that we
have to keep our thoughts on buying as well
as selling.
World trade bas its roots in national interest. We can write all the trade treaties
we like, we can have the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade, Commonwealth trade
discussions, international get-togethers of all
kinds and forms, but the overriding consideration of all countries, within the Commonwealth or without, is what is the immediate
and ultimate effect on each country individually.
An entry into a market, no matter where
it is, has to be made by meeting competition
from other sources. No one part of the world
is going to subsidize goods from another part,
for reasons of national loyalties or any other
motive, except what in the overall picture
is beneficial to each country. If we go along
with any thought contrary to that, we are just
playing around with useless idealism.
That brings me to a point I want to
emphasize as an essential factor in our Canadian economy. We must export to live. The
United States with its huge free trade area
of 48 states and 170 million people could
possibly exist without its export trade, but
their standard of living would be lowered
distressingly if they lost that important factor
of their economy. The foreign trade of the
United States is about 7 per cent of its gross
national product, while that of Canada is
about 35 per cent. We would just wither up
and die without our export trade.
What we sometimes seem to forget is that
we must keep our costs in line with foreign
competition to hold our export trade. This
applies to primary products as well as to

manufactured goods. The matter of import
tariffs, which is designed to protect manufacturing industries, is tied in with the cost
of living and cost of production in all industries, whether they are called primary
or secondary. The previous speakers have
dealt forcefully with that subject from different points of view.
I do not subscribe to a complete wiping
out of tariffs, unless developments over a long
period of years should justify it. On the
other hand, my definite opinion is that we
are running along a very dangerous course
when customs tariffs are just walls around
industries-secondary industries we call
them, for want of a more appropriate name
-whether or not they are economically operated or fundamentally sound. To afford more
and more protection, simply because they
happen to exist, is wrong.
One of the greatest dangers to Canadian
economy and, indeed, to Canadian unity, is
ever higher and higher protection demanded
and conceded to manufacturing industry.
Industrial management and organized labour
should be in closer co-operation in this matter
than they are. They both have a double
responsibility: one is the maintenance of
sound industry and efficient operation, which
calls for capital investment to keep industry
modern and up to date; the other calls for
reasonably priced labour and services that do
not call for higher and higher duties and
competitive restrictions.
When such artificial remedies have to
be applied in continuous process, as is too
often the case, it is dangerous to the people
who make their livelihood on the farms, in
the woods, on the sea and in the mines.
Everywhere they have to pay for it, not only
by higher prices but, what is more important,
by reduced earning power in their competitive fields.
The honourable senator who introduced
this inquiry referred to the "Have Not" and
the "Have" areas of Canada and the need for
an evening out of economy throughout the
land. Generally speaking, what may be
termed the "Have" areas are our industrialized areas in central Canada. In those
sections manufacturing and servicing are
done for the supplying of other portions of
Canada, which are chiefly supported by the
development of primary industries. Those
industries live chiefly on export trade. It is
these exports which provide the main contribution towards the purchasing power of the
people who buy the goods from the protected
industries and who pay the costs of transportation and servicing.
I know that people generally do not examine into what tariff protection is costing.

SENATE
Actually, they do not appear to be much
concerned; but the people in areas far removed from the places of manufacture have
their net realizable income reduced far more
than would be the case if importations into
those parts were freer than they are. That
can only be done by keeping tariff protection
within reasonable bounds and encouraging
freer import and export trade, as the subject
before us indicates. To put it bluntly, the
eastern provinces, and I expect the western
provinces also, need a certain amount of
protection from the highly industrialized
centre of Canada. This, of course, cannot be
given by the imposition of tariffs against any
province, but it can be given by broadening
the foreign trade relations of Canada generally, thus providing the outlying provinces
with more facilities for trading abroad. This
would help not only in lowering the cost of
living, but undoubtedly would help the export trade, which would be for the benefit
of everyone-east, west, and in the centre.
While on this particular matter I would
like to refer just by way of example to my
own province, Newfoundland. Prior to 1949
we had our own customs tariff, which was of
a varying nature, and upwards of $20 million
was collected annually by way of customs
duties. Many lines of food and other essential
commodities were duty free; the tariff varied
from free up to 30 and 40 per cent. Very
little manufactured goods came from Canada,
as Newfoundlanders were world buyers. With
the coming of Union, purchasing almost completely switched to the other provinces because of the Canadian tariff. It was revealed
in the first year, and has since been a matter
of continuous record, that in the overall position very little, if any, of their previous tariff
payments was saved by the people of Newfoundland, who then numbered about 375,000.
The amount of the customs duties was used
up in cost differentials by reason of the
protected industries of Canada. To some
degree, but perhaps not so completely, that
illustration can be used for some of the
neighbouring provinces.
An important, and probably the most important, aspect of this issue is its bearing on
the facilitating of our exports. Let me again
take Newfoundland as an example, and this
application can, I think, be regarded as quite
general. In the export trade Newfoundland
is the best example of all the provinces, because in no other part of Canada is the livelihood of the people so completely tied in with
exports. I might say also that no other province has to buy as large a proportion of its
requirements from other parts of Canada and
sells relatively so little within the dominion.
As you know, Newfoundland people live by
the production of goods for sale outside of

Canada. In recent years foreign exchange
has been one of the province's great difficulties. Spain, for example, which has been
one of its chief markets for codfish, is restricted in its buying because of dollar shortage. Sterling from that country would not be
nearly so difficult to obtain as dollars. Other
European customer countries, as well as some
South American countries, are similarly reBy Canada
stricted in their purchasing.
spreading its trade more widely than it does
now, these problems would to some extent be
relieved. As I said just now, I use this case
as an example, and I am sure similar situations exist in industries seeking export opportunities from all parts of Canada.
I would like to use this opportunity to
bring to the attention of Parliament a very
important event in the development of international trade, an event which happens every
second year. I refer to the Biennial Congress of the International Chamber of Commerce. Two years ago honourable senators
gave me the privilege of reporting on the
proceedings of the Congress which had been
held in Tokyo, Japan. Last May this organization met in Naples, Italy, for the consideration of international trade problems. While
at this time I have not the opportunity of
dealing with the proceedings as fully as I
did on the other occasion, there are some
features which have a bearing on the subject
now before us and which might be useful
for me to mention. I may say that I as a
member of the Canadian Council was privileged to be one of 36 delegates from Canada.
To emphasize the importance and significance
of the deliberations, I need only mention
that 64 countries of the world were represented by delegates, either by national
committees of the International Chamber of
Commerce or through organizational or asTwenty-two Asian
sociate membership.
countries were represented. It is significant
of the times that there were more countries
of Asia represented at that conference than
of any other continent.
The main theme of the proceedings was
"New factors of economic progress". The
subject of the much publicized Common
Market in Europe came in for close consideration and explanation from those intimately indentified with the movement. As
this promises to be of particular significance
to Canada, I shall refer to that again in a
moment.
I shall not endeavour to summarize subjects considered or opinions expressed, as
that would be impossible in the few minutes
I have to devote to this topic. Just a few
random thoughts and ideas reflected in the
proceedings may be of interest.

DECEMBER 3. 1957
First and foremost is the impression, as
I said before, of the upsurge in industry in
areas of the world which to me, at least, was
most unexpected. Then there is the ambition of peoples to participate in economic
development as partners and not as poor relations. One eastern speaker said the term
"undeveloped" countries should be dropped
for the more appropriate words "insufficiently
developed" countries.
Without minimizing by any means the
need for aid, a prominent Pakistan gentleman
stated in forceful language that "aid is not
charity". He gave due credit to the United
States, the British Commonwealth and other
countries for aid granted in the development
of water power, irrigation and industrial
facilities for the utilization of materials of
his country. It is of greatest importance,
he said, that technical and management experience be given, so that the ambitions of
their own people for self-development could
be met. Encouragement and help towards
self-development was constantly stressed.
A speaker from India pointed out that with
the development of transport and communication the world has shrunk in size, and
that people in the less developed areas are
increasingly aware of the life and culture of
the more fortunate people in the advanced
areas.
He stressed the point in these words:
The urge for development is such now that
poverty is dangerous like war, and poverty in one
part of the world is a potential threat to the
prosperity of all other parts of the world.

"Democracy", said one speaker, "has no
appeal to empty stomachs." He brought out
forcibly the point that there will always be
a different pattern of economic life in different countries and that human aspirations
will never be the same everywhere. Advice
was given to the peoples of the advanced
countries not to be setting up in their minds
that the success of their aid to the far-away
lands could be measured by comparing their
habits and mode of living with that of their
own. Nothing worse could happen than a
breakdown in the traditions and habits of
living which are inherent in the nature of
various peoples.
The need for international co-operation in
the field of new sources of power was very
strongly expressed by experts from various
countries. Trade barriers caused by national
prejudices were cited to illustrate the very
real obstacles that exist to a freer exchange
of goods for the benefit of all. The amazing
call for development in what we regard the
remote parts of the world is one of the outstanding features of these times.

I might digress for a moment to pose this
further comment. There was at the conference a gentleman from one of the faraway countries in the East, and he said:
It is a shame how much our people are misunderstanding and misinterpreting the life of the
people in the Western areas.

He referred to the United States and Canada.
You people of North America may not think this
is serious, but I regard it as being very serious
and so do many of our citizens. The people in my
country

-a country away out in the South Pacific
somewherego to their movie houses just as the people do in
the West and see American and Canadian pictures,
and the general impression they form is that the
people of your countries are killing each other
all the time, you are shooting each other on the
streets, you are chasing each other on horses through
the woods to kill each other. That is the general
impression.

He continued:
I am serious, because I travelled in those countries
and I know the conditions are not as the pictures
represent.
I will tell you that you will never
get over to us a true idea of the life of the people
in your countries unless you do something to correct
that impression, because our people will never
believe that what they see in these pictures is not
true and such terrible things are not being carried
on everywhere and ail the time.

That was something, honourable senators,
that was not directly tied in with the trade
issues, but it was a human touch that greatly
impressed me. The statement was made very
strongly and feelingly by that gentleman, who
has a wide interest in the development of
human life and the betterment of human
relations.
There is one growing conviction which I
get from such gatherings as these, and it is
that whether it is Canada, the United States
or any country that has an economic policy
which is not flexible enough to encourage
trade throughout the world on the broadest
possible basis, it will in the course of time
be overrun by the industrialization of the
world outside of it. If such countries do not
change their policies soon enough, they will
suffer tremendously.
I will now refer for a moment to a freer
trade development which is coming into being
in Europe and which will have a very vital
relationship to us here in Canada.
On March 25, 1957, a treaty establishing a
European Common Market was signed in
Rome by representatives of Italy, France,
Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands. Those countries now have a
population of 163 million. Over a period of
from twelve to fifteen years, and by gradual
stages, a Common Market is expected to be
developed. The general effect will be that
when a reconciliation of their various interests is arrived at that there will be no customs

SENATE
tariffs against each other, and there will be
a uniform or common tariff against the outside world.
We hear so much on every hand of the
great development of Canada. It is great
indeed. Surprising as it may be to most of
us, even greater development has taken place
and is taking place in the countries which I
just mentioned and which are now termed
the Common Market nations. For the past
four years the national output as expressed
in volume-fnot in currency, by the way-of
those six nations increased by 22 per cent,
and none of them can be termed underdeveloped countries. In comparison, during
those four years the national output of Canada increased by 18 per cent-as against the
22 per cent for the Common Market nations
-the United States 15 per cent, and the
United Kingdom 15 per cent.
Then, there is under consideration, and
under the leadership of the United Kingdom,
a still broader body known as the Organization for European Economic Co-operationO.E.E.C., as it is called. This is designed to
embrace as a unit the countries comprised in
the Common Market, which I just referred to,
and also the United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark, Switzerland, Austria, Turkey, Portugal,
Greece and Ireland. The main difference between these two is that the Common Market
body of six will, as I said, have no tariff
against each other but a common tariff
against all outside countries, while the
O.E.E.C. with 15 members will work toward
no customs tariff against each other, but each
of the nine I have mentioned will have for
some unspecified time their own and separate
tariff system for outside the area. What I
want to bring out is that important movements of that nature in major countries of the
world, such as those, cannot be ignored by
us. They set up a new condition in world
trade which cannot be met by isolation -of any
country and certainly not by such a vulnerable country as ours.
We got in on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, and it has been useful.
What it did was to adjust tariffs here and
there, but it was so flexible in its application
that it was full of uncertainties and perplexities. It is true that these new organizations will be full of uncertainties and
perplexities, but they definitely represent a
trend among nations of the world which we
simply cannot ignore.
During the years 1949-1956-in seven years
exports to those six Common
-Canadian
Market countries increased by 137 per cent,
the largest increase to any area of the world
where our trade is substantial. This was
without any consideration of the Common
Market plans, which, of course, are not yet

operative. It does emphasize the need for our
being alert and being ready to co-operate with
the international changes in trading relations
that are taking place.
It is interesting to note that while the
increase of Canada's exports to those six
countries in seven years rose by 137 per cent,
the increase from Canada to Western
Europe generally was 100 per cent; to the
United States, 87 per cent; to the United
Kingdom, 15 per cent; and to the Commonwealth countries outside the United Kingdom, 15 per cent.
At this point, I would recommend for
study by all interested in this subject a
reprint from issues of Financial Post,
entitled "Prosperity with Independence",
prepared by Mr. Michael Barkway. It was
from this publication that I obtained many
of these figures. I might add also that the
magazine entitled Foreign Trade, published
by the International Trade Relations Branch
of our Department of Trade and Commerce,
gives a most useful coverage of our foreign
trade matters.
Should the larger group of European
countries to which I just referred come into
a common agreement, which would not only
include the seven countries particularly
mentioned but embrace the United Kingdom
and eight additional countries, then it will
become still more important to be searching
outside our own boundaries, outside the
United States and outside the Commonwealth,
for trading partners-and I emphasize the
word "partners". The area of the larger
group of European countries embraces 285
million people.
Honourable senators, I have taken up
more time on this subject than I probably
should, and I thank you for your attention.
I want also to say in closing that I feel the
honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon.
Mr. Robertson) is to be heartily commended
for having introduced this subject, which is
of very great consequence to Canada.
I do hope that in this chamber the great
implications of co-ordinated trade movements
now in progress among the nations of the
Western world will be fully explored, and
that the Government of Canada will keep its
trade policy geared to the vital changes which
are taking place in international industry and
international trading relations.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: May I ask the honourable senator from St. John's West (Hon.
Mr. Pratt) whether the 22 per cent to which

I have been in public life continuously for
fifty years, and never out, and I will tell my
honourable friend that my home city of
Winnipeg never beat me once, not once. So
I say to my honourable friend that as long as
the city of Winnipeg has that opinion of me I
don't care what opinion he has, but I will give
him the same treatment, fair and honest and
as quick as I can. Now, although I do not
do it as fast as some other people, it is just
because I am a little poky, a little slow.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: That is completely out
of order.
Hon. Norman P. Lamberi: Honourable
senators, may I have a word to say on the
inquiry made by my honourable friend from
De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot)?
The responsibility for the selection of the
pictures in the National Gallery that have
been referred to here, as well as for the
prices attached to them, does not fall on the
shoulders of Mr. Jarvis.
The decision to
make those purchases, as well as the prices
attached to them, was the responsibility of
the National Gallery Board. That was very
definitely decided upon and was illustrated
quite clearly and adequately in the other
house last year when this question was discussed. At that time several pictures were in
question.
The collection from which they
were bought included one very valuable one,
which has not yet been purchased and about
which several questions were asked in the
other place at the time.
I just wanted to make this point quite clear,
that the new board, the recently appointed
board of the National Gallery, is the body
which is completely responsible for recommending and undertaking to buy those
pictures, with the consent, of course, of the

resoonsible minister. I do not think that it
is quite fair to suggest that Mr. Jarvis be
"the goat" in this case.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot:

Therefore, honourable

senators, my remarks apply to the whole
board.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
MOTION FOR ADDRESS IN REPLYDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday con-

sideration of Her Majesty the Queen's Speech
at the opening of the session and the motion
of Hon. Mr. White, seconded by Hon. Mr.
Méthot, for an Address in reply thereto.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
a speech made on November 27 by my colleague the honourable senator from York
North (Hon. Mr. Sullivan) has prompted me
to enter the debate at this late stage. The
honourable senator to whom I have made
reference is one of the most eminent specialists in the medical profession. From my
own knowledge I would say that he is
matched by few and surpassed by none in
his
competency
and
devotion to
his
profession.
I differ from his political views and conclusions as he expressed them in this house
on November 27, and particularly with
respect to health insurance, which he called
"state medicine". I began to differ from him
almost from his first sentence, when he said:
The medical profession as a body, united in
action, cries out "halt".

These are strong, strange and bristling
words, and they made me suddenly realize
that I was listening to something different
from what one normally hears with respect
to the subject of health insurance. So I made
it my business to find out just what the

DECEMBER 4. 1957
medical profession says about health insurance; and I thought it would be well if we
looked at the record.
On June 13, in the Toronto Globe and Mail:
The voice of organized medicine in Canada-the
Canadian Medical Association-today announced
that the profession is in favour of universal hospital
insurance. It was made clear that if it had a choice
the profession would rather see any such plans
voluntarily and privately administered by agencies
such as Blue Cross, than compulsory and Government-administered.
But, apparently in acknowledgment of public
opinion, the C.M.A. said it is encouraging its
provincial divisions to co-operate with their provincial Governments in setting up Government
plans.

people were for it. The two major political
parties have endorsed it. The two minor
political parties have endorsed it. In fact,
all the political parties in Canada have
endorsed it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question? Would he
define what he means by health insurance?

Hon. Mr. Croll: As I go along. If there
is any doubt in anyone's mind, one way of
testing is to ask those honourable senators

British Columbia if the people in those provinces are prepared to give up the schemes

Toronto Academy of Dentistry was told today. Dr. Gallup poll conducted in Canada. I quote:
Donald W. Gullett, Executive-Secretary of the
Canadian Dental Association, suggested the profession would be well advised to gain experience
now in voluntary insurance plans for dental
services.

Note these words:
Dr. Gullett said federal health grants were
instituted in 1948 "to be utilized strictly as preparatory steps for the introduction of health insurance. . . . A few years later special assistance
was provided for the increasing of diagnostic
facilities-again, as stated at the time, in preparation for health insurance.
In the meantime a statement was made on several
occasions giving the order of the graduai introduction of health insurance services.
After the preparatory steps were taken the first
service to be instituted was stated to be hospital
services under health insurance.
This action is
occurring right now and right on time in accordance with the original plan.
The next stated service planned to be included is
medical services, to be followed by dental services.
Difficulty would be experienced today in finding
any individual well versed in Canadian health
affairs who does not believe that full-scale health
insurance is going to become a fact in Canada."

We are told that the medical profession,
as a body united in action, cries out "Halt!"
Yet here are the dentists asking at the same
time: "Be sure and include us in. Don't
leave us out".
Who else is for national health insurance?
Well, I wouldn't be far afield if I said the

Public wish for a government-operated plan for
hospital insurance is increasing at a rapid
rate . . .
Last April the Gallup poil reported that six in 10
Canadian men and women were in favour of a
governinent-operated plan for payment of any
hospital expenses "you incurred". Critices of the
plan suggested that there would be a different reaction if the phrase were enlarged to "any hospital
expenses you, or someone else, incurred".
The poil reveals, however, that in the five-month
span of time, 10 per cent more of the public like
the idea-for their own expenses, and for anyone
else's as well.
Question used in this study was:
"Would you favour or oppose a governmentoperated plan whereby any hospital expenses you,
or someone else, incurred would be paid out of
taxes?"
Comparison between today's public reaction and
that of last April is shown in the following table:

In order to make sure that citizens who were
looking for "pie in the sky" would realize that
such a plan might cost them more money, interviewers asked those men and women who said they
wanted a government-operated hospitalization plan,
whether they would still feel this way if it meant
higher taxes. As the table shows, they cannot be
shaken in their wish for it.

Remember, 72 per cent in September said

Honourable senators, an article appeared
in the Toronto Star last night, which seemed
to be very timely, and I thought it would
interest the house because it has to do with
a health plan. The author is J. E. Belliveau,
a very well-known newspaperman, who has
been in the Parliamentary Press Gallery.
The article is headed "Need For Health
Plan". I quote:
Some idea of how much this country wants a
national comprehensive health insurance plan may
be had from a pile of letters on this desk. T,
came as the result of comments one day last week
concerning a family in eastern Ontario made
destitute by years of illness.

Further on:
While the letters were arriving, the report of a
three-year study of the Windsor, Ont., prepaid
medical scheme by the University of Michigan's
bureau of public health economics proved a notable
point. It shows Windsor's comprehensive plan to be
highly successful and endorsed by doctors as well
as the public.
The community scheme covers 85 per cent of the
Windsor population, collects $5,000,000 annually in
premiums and gives Windsor doctors 60 per cent
of their income.

And further on:
Doctors who may oppose public health insurance
would be interested to know that in Windsor
patients do not swamp the medical men with
trivial or needless calls. One-third of the people
insured make no claims at all. Home calls to the
insured in that city are fewer than to the
uninsured.
Most notable of all, Windsor doctors have an
average income of $13,762, which is substantially
higher than the Canadian average of $12,166.
Since the Windsor scheme bas 200,000 subscribers and bas been operating for a generation,
it ought to have proved its point. It bas inspired
other plans, for example the Ontario Medical
Association's less comprehensive Physicians' Services, Inc.
A large industrial city like Windsor, perhaps
Canada's most thoroughly organized, of course has
a head start in establishing such a system. However, the Swift Current, Sask., city-rural regional
plan on a different basis did the same thing out
there. Here again there were special circumstances.
These successes have proved the traditional
private doctor-patient relationship was not disturbed as some had feared.
Further, by their
very rarity. they suggest vast areas of Canada are
left uncovered by any really comprehensive, unlimited and easily managed health insurance
coverage.

Hon. Mr. Crerar: May I ask my honourable

friend a question, because he is discussing a
very interesting point now? How much of

the Windsor scheme was contributed from
taxation, if any? I rather got the impression
that it was a voluntary scheme.
Hon. Mr. Croll: There is no taxation involved in the Windsor scheme.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Everyone
scheme like that.

a

Hon. Mr. Croll: It is a scheme that was
locally built up. They pay for the services,
but they do it on a joint basis. What I am
suggesting is that everyone pays co-operatively.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is really a form of
insurance?
Hon. Mr. Croll: National health insurance.
That is what I am talking about.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What do you mean by
What do you
national health insurance?
include in national health insurance?
Hon. Mr. Croll: The Ontario hospitalization
plan is a beginning, but it is more like the
scheme in Alberta and Saskatchewan rather
than the bare bones of the Blue Cross scheme.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, the Ontario Government scheme does not include medical fees.
Hon. Mr. Croll: It does not at the moment.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: All it is, is a hospitalization
scheme.
Hon. Mr. Croll: I realize that. What I am
saying is that this is the first step to national
health insurance. That is exactly what Dr.
Donald W. Gullett said, and exactly what
the Government said in 1947 when it was
taking that first step.
Honourable senators have heard the quotation I read a moment or so ago. They may
recall my association with the first medical
health plan in the province of Ontario, and
will appreciate why I was distressed with
the speech of the honourable senator from
North York. The honourable gentleman opposite (Hon. Mr. Brunt) asked me what I
mean by national health insurance. My idea
of health insurance is the kind of plan they
have in Great Britain, which is by far the
very best in the whole world. I saw it in
operation in 1949 and 1950, and at various
other times. That plan must be the ultimate
aim in this country. There was a great deal
of talk about the British plan. My friend
the honourable senator said he had investigated it in 1949, and he did not have many
nice things to say about it. From time to
time we hear the British plan talked about,
but let us sec what the British public itself
think about it. I have here the Toronto

DECEMBER 4, 1957
Star for July 16, 1956, under the caption
of "British Gallup Poll":
A unique "two-sides-of-the-coin" study on the
status of Britain's famed ten-year-old national
health service has been completed by the Gallup
poll of Britain, and shows a surprising unanimity
of opinion as between the general public on the
one hand, and the medical profession on the other.
Both groups now support the basic idea of the
national health service, although doctors have many
criticisms.
The attitude of the general public was measured
by interviews with a true cross-section of adults.
The views of the medical profession were obtained
from a randomly selected cross-section of 500
general practitioners serving under the national
health service throughout England and Wales.
It is probably not surprising that the British
public generally favours the plan.

And here is the question that was put to
the public:
As far as you, personally, are concerned, how far
up or down this scale would you rate the national
health service?

This is how the general public responded:
Gave favourable rating ................
Gave unfavourable rating ..............
Undecided .............................

89%
4%
7%

Then they questioned the general practitioners alone:
Suppose you had a chance to go back 10 years
and vote on whether the national health service
should be started or not. How would you votein favor of starting it, or against starting it?

The general

"G.P.'s" in answer to further questions, report,
in the main, no change in the number of night
calls; relationships with patients "just about as
personal as before."

A little farther on the article says:
Among the public, overwhelming majority feel
they are getting good service from N.H.S.

The following question was put to the
general public:
All things considered, do you think you are
getting good service or poor service from the
National Health Service?

Here is the response of the general public:
Poor service ..................
Good service ..........................

Well, there is the story. Can it be said that
the medical profession as a body united in
action cries out "Halt." I wonder whether
consideration has been given to the view of
the Medical Council, the view of its president,
the view of the dental association as expressed through its secretary, the view of the
political parties of this country, in the light
of the Windsor plan, the Gallup poll on the
hospitalization plan in Canada and the Gallup
poll on the British plan? I cannot for the

life of me see anything that says "Halt" in
any of these things I have presented up to
the present time. If anything at all, it is not
"Halt" that I see, but rather "Get it into effect
as quickly as you possibly can."
Hon. Mr. Gershaw: Would the honourable
senator permit a question at this point? He
spoke of hospital insurance. Apparently in
Britain the hospital is paid for by the Government. Would he not favour a system like
we have in Alberta, where the provincial
Government pays part of the hospital bills
and the municipal Government pays part,
and yet the patient is asked to contribute a
small part as well?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I am not as well versed
with the Alberta plan-although I have made
notes on it-as I am with the British plan.
For many years I have followed the British
plan, and I know something of it. On two
or three visits I have made to Britain I
have watched the plan at work. I like the
British plan above all others because it has
worked on a large scale, particularly in
industrial areas, and it seems to be a model
plan in this modern world. I am not saying
anything to belittle the Alberta plan, but it
has not had the experience.
I have dealt with one aspect of what the
honourable senator from North York had to
say. But he went further than that. The
senator's thesis seems to be that something
called "State medicine"-which is never defined-leads a country straight to the infernal
regions, namely, communism. And he bas
backed up his argument with a second statement, that state medicine causes malingering,
leads to ever-growing expenditure of public
funds, dilutes the cause of medical service,
and tends to reduce doctors' fees or honoraria.
To the charge that state medicine leads to
communism, one can say that no one with
the exception of the honourable senator has
ever advanced such a theory; and no one,
including the senator, bas been able to
demonstrate that such a theory is valid.
In the course of his speech he equates
communism with social welfare, and he goes
te great lengths to attempt to prove that
from the days of Bismarck to Bevan communism-or its companion, socialism-has
been conspiring to destroy the medical profession. Such an argument has always been
the refuge of those who fear that a privileged
position is endangered by what they call
political meddling.
The greatest minds, historians, economists,
philosophers, have established that a number
of factors, largely economic and historical,
have brought about the rise of totalitarianism,
whether one calls it communism, fascism or

SENATE
any other "ism". It was not state medicine,
or anything relating to state medicine, or
welfare services, that brought about Russian
communism, but a combination of a hundred
years or more of political repression, social
injustice, incredible stupidity of the governing classes, plus disastrous defeat in a war,
plus the bold seizure of power by a handful
of brilliant but unscrupulous people.
I ask, what bas all this to do with state
medicine?
I have every respect and admiration for
the medical profession, and I say this when
I am well, not when I am sick. It is a
profession dedicated to one of the noblest
aims in life, to serve its fellowmen. But the
way the honourable senator tells it, the main
purpose of the Russian Revolution was to
break the medical profession and turn
doctors into overworked and underpaid civil
servants.
This leads me to the second theme, that
state medicine, as the honourable senator
put it, means malingering and waste of
the public purse; thus, when the cry for
economy goes up, it will mean lower fees for
the doctors. The only answer I can make is
that these things have never come about, as
one can see by the experience in Windsor, in
Swift Current and in Great Britain. In countries which have various forms of socialized
medicine the incidence of "lead-swinging"
and attempts to "beat the system" are no
greater than they are in our own system of
Unemployment Insurance in Canada.
Does anyone say that the Government,
which is to say the Canadian people, is being
fleeced through abuses of the Unemployment
Insurance scheme? Is there any appreciable
"malingering" to "milk the fund" unduly of
benefits? I do not think those questions need
to be answered. Then why should a health
insurance scheme-not state medicine, whatever that is-permit any greater abuses?
As to mounting costs, where does anyone
think the moneys paid for health insurance
go? They go to doctors, nurses, hospitals,
pharmacists, makers of drugs and medicines
and hospital beds and bandages and crutches.
In other words, health insurance funds filter
through the entire economy at every level;
and finally, a good share of them, after benefiting the whole country, comes back to the
Treasury in the form of income tax, sales
tax and so on. I ask, is this process bad for
Canada?
Opinions may differ as to costs. None of
us are experts on that question. There is no
way of knowing exactly what it will cost.
The best way to find out is to go ahead with
the prograrn and meet the situation as it
arises. I am a little bit suspicious of these

people who are constantly painting pictures
of horrendous expenditures. I well remember that ten years ago, in a White Paper
delivered to the House of Commons, the
experts predicted that Canada by 1971 would
have a population of 15 million. How wrong
they were!
Furthermore, national health schemes are
not give-aways, but are an investment in
health, which, to a nation, is wealth. Sickness, if not arrested, causes absenteeism, loss
of production, with consequent cost to the
individual and to the country.
Some abuse in health insurance is certain
to be encountered, just as the medical, legal
and other professions encounter abuse of its
ethics by a small minority of its practitioners.
Is that any reason to denounce a plan which
will benefit the vast majority of citizens
whose one great desire is to be rid of the
spectre of crippling medical bills? Most
working people are unable to bear the burden
of medical costs today. As far as the average
person is concerned, any major illness is a
catastrophe.
As for making doctors into civil servants
and reducing their fees, or rather their
honoraria, I should say, first of all, we owe
an apology to the members of the public
service across the country, from the deputy
ministers at Ottawa to the smallest municipal
clerk in Saskatchewan or Newfoundlandand there are many thousands of them. Since
when has it been a fate worse than death to
be a civil servant? An awful lot of people
do not think so, and that includes a number
of doctors, lawyers, engineers, accountants,
architects and school teachers who are in the
public service right now. And are not we
in this chamber also in the public service?
But in any case, no one is now suggesting,
or has ever suggested, putting the Canadian
medical profession into a strait-jacket and
telling them how to diagnose measles or take
out an appendix, or have thern lined up for
pay cheques every second Friday.
The argument that National Health Insurance will reduce the doctors to ciphers is
cobwebby and has been rejected time and
again by the medical profession. Nowhere in
Europe or Great Britain, where medical plans
are operated, has the medical profession been
reduced to the flat level of sameness. What
is donc under these plans is to direct some
of the activities into state operated plans
whereby the criterion for obtaining medical
care is not the size of the bank account. In
this day and age the patient must receive
care not commensurate with his means, but
with his malady.
What is suggested and what is going to be
of that you can be certain, is a system of

DECEMBER 4, 1957
insurance whereby the risk and expense of
illness will be shared by a group instead of
by a large number of separate individuals.
In essence, it is no more complicated or more
sinful than Unemployment Insurance, which
has been functioning well and has brought
benefits to millions of wage earners; the cost
to the public purse has been negligible. Is
the moral fibre of Canada weaker because of
unemployment insurance, and does anyone
seriously think that health insurance will
drag us all clown to'perdition or make leeches
and milk-sops of us ail?
Is it not rather by helping to free men's
minds from the menacing spectre of illness
and disease, and the fear from crippling expense, that so often accompanies them, that
we will be freeing our people for more productive and fruitful things than worry and
f ear? To say "that the status of health care
depends on the level of wealth, nnt schemes
of one kind or another" is propounding a doctrine which, if followed, would tie the welfare concept to the gross national produet. It
is true that a country can provide only those
services which. it is capable of paying for.
Can anyone say truthfully that Canada cannot afford to bring medical care within the
reach of ail its citizens? If, as my honourable
friend says, "to achieve welfare one must
have wealth"ý-is not the first caîl on the
public purse that which will help ail Canadians? Then surely national health insurance
is not the ogre that was pictured here a few
days ago.
National health insurance can neyer be discussed, as the honourable gentleman put it,
"in the spirit af cold-blooded realistic discussion". We are discussing human beings
and their welf are and, more particularly, sick
people of limited means. The first thing to
remember is that they are the backbone of
this country and they are not expendable.
In the world of tomorrow there will be no
free medical market where the doctor alone
can pick and choose. It must be one of
mutual picking and choosing, where prerogatives will have to be relinquished on al
sides.
Before national health insurance is denounced by the medical profession, they
should be reminded that it has achieved substantial progress in Canada under a semniwelf are state.
Federal grants to hospital
construction, started in 1948, to date amount
ta over $93 million. This does not take into
account what was spent on D.V.A. hospitals,
National Defence, Indian and Eskimro hospitals, and that is considerable. Add to that
$125 million at least spent by provincial
Governments; from $75 million to $100 million or maybe $125 million spent by municipalities, and there you have $300 million,

almost $400 million, in 10 years, out of the
public treasury.
And sa here we find in Canada, despite our
vaunted democracy, despite our great riches
and equality of opportunity, that matters of
health are stili ta an extent at least governed by income. A national health plan
would simply mean the redistribution of
present costs among the total population, sick
and heaithy. It would lighten the load of
those least able to pay and would permit
people ta pay when they are well instead of
when they are ill.
It is said that death and taxes are the only
certainties o! 11f e. Well, there is not much
we can do about either of those. But illness
is an ever-present possibility. We can do
something about it, and we ought ta do something about it as quickly as we possibly can.
I have been long enough in public life i
this country ta remember politicians who
fought against family allowances and lost;
fought against unemployment insurance and
lost; fought increased pensions and lost;
fought against social welfare measures and
lost. And you can count this fight against
national health insurance as lost. My advice
is ta stop struggling and join us.
I close with a quatation from Prof essor
Malcolm G. Taylor of the University o!
Toronto, who has had first-hand experience
in the field as Director of Research for the
Saskatchewan Health Planning Commission
and has recently completed a study of health
plans from coast to coast under a Rockefeller
Foundation grant. He said this last June, at
a meeting of the Canadian Manufacturers
Association:
The issue of healtb insurance bas been subi ected
to more emotional pleading, more outright distortion. more red herrings, more exaggerated cost
estimates, more unwarranted predictions of evil
consequences than any other matter of public
attention since Haley's comet.

To me that statement makes sense, and 1
hope it does to the rest of the house.

SENATE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I moved the adjournment of this
debate after the speech that we heard yesterday afternoon largely, but not quite entirely,
for the purpose of paying a tribute to the
honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron) for his magnificent address.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.

we shall need 6,000 engineering graduates
each and every year for the next quarter of

a century, and that the same or a like statement applies with regard to technicians.
Well, I am all in favour of having many

engineers; I hold the profession in the highest regard; but if we cannot employ 1,700
graduates per year, what are we going to do
with 6,000 graduates per year?

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It was a splendid piece

of parliamentary
investigation, of research, into the subjectmatter that was to my mind very, very
creditable. It was a lengthy speech. I
notice that it fills no less than 22 columns of
today's Hansard. But I submit that the length
of the speech was not out of keeping with
the importance of the subject which the
honourable senator was discussing. He told
us that there are 3,700,000 pupils under 21
years of age in Canadian schools this year,
and that this is one-half million more than
the year before, showing not only that great
numbers of our children are involved but
that the number is growing rapidly. He told
us also that the demands for better and,

those paid here.

us that the Engineering Journal states that

have left Canada,

Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: These men left
Canada because of larger returns in some
other country.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That, certainly, is a
factor. But some of the managers of big
industries which employ engineers tell me
that the ruling consideration is not the
salary, that the remuneration of engineers
in Canada at the present time is fairly proportionate to what is paid across the line;
that the real difficulty is shortage of work,
unfortunately, more expensive education are particularly public work; that so much of
also growing. Not only does that apply to engineering services, for instance in the
ourselves and our own needs, but in com- making of aeroplanes for the Royal Canadian
parison with other countries the demand in Air Force and other buyers, is done across
Canada for greater expenditure and more the line, the explanation being that it costs
20 per cent more to do the engineering in
attention to this matter is imperative.
The honourable gentleman stated that in Canada than in the United States. If you

I am not quite sure how far it goes nor what increase in the number of engineers, but I
it means, because I notice that nothing was think we should be realistic in our approach

Canada. During this period I have observed
The honourable senator says that in 1937 the same trend among scientists-educated
we graduated 1,700 engineers, and he tells men, skilled tochnicians and others-who
partly because of lower

DECEMBER 4, 1957
returns, and partly through lack of suitable
employment in our society. Year after year
we have spent large sums of money in
educating these men, the most valuable of
our population, only to see them drift across
the line. I am not saying this in a spirit of
criticism of the honourable senator who
made so magnificent a speech, but I do insist
that it is something of which we must take
heed in a discussion of the subject of
producing yet more skilled technicians.
My honourable friend told us, and I
thoroughly agree with him, that the wages of
teachers,-and I think he meant those engaged in all classes of education, primary
and upwards-are too low. He suggested
$14,000 per annum as an appropriate wage
for a full professor. That amount is not
excessive, but it is a good deal more than
the average professor in our universities is
getting today.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No more than a footballer.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is true and it
is a spectacular comparison; and it may be
extended to the actor, and the lawyer,Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -and

the doctor.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: -and the doctor. It is
too bad that we have valued our teachers so
low, as is evidenced by the salaries we have
paid and are paying them. But where does
the honourable senator's argument lead us?
lIe tells us that the buildings and equipment
of our teaching institutions are inadequate.
Certainly I do not challenge that statement.
He says that the housing of the students is
unsatisfactory, that only one in eight can
cram into the residences of the universities.
He wants more scholarships. He wants loans
to students who require the money in order
to conduct their studies and to graduate. He
sees a billion-dollar budget for the universities of Canada in the not-far-distant future.
I am not appalled exactly, but I am at least
impressed with the magnitude of those figures.
However, I am not impressed with the comparisons made; that is to say, I refuse to be
panicky because of the Russian toy Sputnik
that bas been circling the globe. I am not
going to yield or shake at the knees about
other comparisons between the ability of our
people to produce and the ability of the Russians or some other people to produce, irrespective of their training. I am not so sure
how much practical benefit one gets from
higher learning. It is true that we need a
certain percentage of the most highly trained
and educated technicians. That is undoubtedly so, but I very much doubt whether an
educated person on the farm needs to know
very much about higher calculus. I very
much doubt whether some graduate from one

of the Russian institutions, who may know a
great deal about the history of art and other
things and who may be an exceedingly skilfuI mathematician, could fix my drain any
better than a Canadian plumber of today.
I am for education. Do not misunderstand
me. All I am saying is that I am not going
to be panicky or rushed by this kind of comparison. Mr. Wendell Willkie, who ran for
the presidency of the United States, later on
visited Russia and made a report on his visit.
It was very kind to the Russians. Certainly
he was not prejudiced against them; but he
made a comparison between the efficiency of
the factories in the United States and those
in Russia, and this comparison-which would
apply to Canada as well-was very favourable to the United States. Mr. Willkie rated
the productive power of our individual considerably greater than that of the Russian.
That would be reasonable to expect, because
we have been at it so much longer. It is also
reasonable to expect that in due season the
Russians will catch up with us in many ways.
Instead of being afraid about that I think
we should almost welcome it.
We should be realistic in these matters to
the last degree, whether that is complimentary to ourselves or otherwise, but let me add
that fear is the worst of counsellors. I resent
the effort that bas been made to frighten us
by a Sputnik or something of that kind. I
know it bas had a great effect, and perhaps
a good one in some regards. I see it is
reported in the press that the President of
the United States will propose to Congress an
expenditure of $2 billion on these things that
circle the earth.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Satellites.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, satellites to the
earth. I have no doubt this will have great
influence on the military appropriations of
the United States. I once asked a full colonel
of World War I how long lie thought the
people of Canada would continue to make
such very large expenditures with respect to
military upkeep. His answer was, "So long
as we keep them scared". Now, do not read
too much into that statement. I have voted
for all our military expenditures and I intend
to continue to do so, although I do not like
it. I do not like military expenditures. I
remember many years ago discussing this
very subject with Sir Wilfrid Laurier. I
believe that was prior to the famous naval
debate. It was away back in those years
long since forgotten by most of us. With
that eloquence which was his in private conversation as well as in public debate he said,
"There are people in this country who would
bring about the damnable conditions of

SENATE
European countries which spend one-half of
their national revenue on military upkeep".
Well, in the interval we have fairly welI
paralleled those conditions of Europe, for
today we are spending somewhat in the
neighbourhood of 40 per cent of our entire
revenue on military upkeep, and unfortunately we must go on doing so.
All I am saying now is that I am not going
to be frightened into anything by the military
situation or any comparison of that kind.
The honourable senator from Banff (Hon.
Mr. Cameron) referred to an editorial in the
Ottawa Journal of November 20 to the effect
that the Technical Service Council reported
that from 1951 to 1956 the number of
engineers and scientists who left Canada for
the United States was equal to almost onethird of the graduating classes of that period.
That is a pretty serious figure. Here we
have educated all these men at great expense,
having chosen perhaps the very best of our
stock. We have made them valuable people,
only to hand them over to the United States.
We should consider this fact very carefully
in order to find some method of retaining
these students after graduation. Involved in
my honourable friend's discussion was a suggestion that the dominion Government should
contribute more largely to educational costs.
Several times on the floor of this house I have
stated I was convinced that education should
be left to the provinces and that we in the
dominion should not interfere in that field.
I join with the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) in his statement of yesterday that the Fathers of Confederation were
wise when they put education under the
parliamentary jurisdiction of the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But there has been
some change since the British North America
Act was enacted. At that time the Fathers
of Confederation must have had primary
education in their minds. There was very
little of any other kind of education then.
Primary education was in the public eye,
but in the meantime there has been a good
deal of change in our educational system. It
may be that the time has come for us to
revise to some extent our opinion with
respect to higher education, but certainly not
with respect to primary education. No matter how things may have changed, I would
still oppose any interference by the dominion
authority in the matter of primary education.
But we seem to have broken through with
common consent and with very little protest
in the matter of higher education; we are
now contributing quite considerable sums
toward the cost of education on that level.

And I am inclined, notwithstanding the
strong views that I have held for a long time
in the past, rather to withdraw my opposition to that kind of thing. But, honourable
senators,-and I think the senator beside me
will concur in this-if we are going into
large expenditures such as those mentioned
by my good friend from Banff it will be
necessary for us to consider, more than we
have in the past, the sources of our revenue.
If, as he suggested, we add $150 million a
year to our educational costs from the
Dominion treasury, what are we going to do?
We cannot for one moment anticipate a
decrease in our military expenditures-we
can hope for it but we cannot expect it. We
cannot cut down materially on anything
else that I know of. Are we going to increase
the tariff in order to get more money, and so
make the situation worse than it was in
regard to holding our trained men? I am
told by manufacturers that the 22 per cent
cost in engineering, resulting from the tariff,
is one of the difficulties against which they
struggle to hold their men from United
States employers. Are we going to add to
those taxes which increase the cost of living,
that is, consumption taxes? If so life will
be made still more difficult in this country
and the cost of living will be still more pronounced. Are we going to increase income
tax, which now takes roughly one-third of
the earnings of those in the higher brackets?
For my part, I feel we have gone too far
in that regard already. I would not like to
see the tax increased. There has been a
fairly strong popular movement of late to
decrease it, which I hope can be carried into
effect.
Then, what are we going to do? It is true
that there is a source of revenue which it
seems that it is not polite to discuss, but we
might ask a question of those who have the
special privilege of owning the revenue that
comes from natural resources which are now
taxed only by municipalities. If we are going
to carry on those kinds of expenses that
make the carrying on of business in this
country almost impossible, will the time not
come when we shall have to consider charging those people who benefit from the financial returns of the ownership of natural
resources of our country, that is, the land, for
the privilege which they enjoy? What is
the reason why Russia has been able to make
the progress she has made? She bas very
large universities and very heavy military
expenses, but at the sarne time she does not
support a landlord class. This is a new idea,
no doubt to many of us, but if we are going
into these larger expenditures-and I am for
them-we shall have to consider very much
more carefully than we have in the past the

DECEMBER 4, 1957
effect on the public, on the prosperity of our
country, of the sources of our revenue.
Hon. Mr. Reid: And have some control
over it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: And have some control
over it.
Honourable senators, that is enough on that
subject at the moment. Let me conclude by
paying a further compliment to my good
friend from Banff. I think his speech does
credit not only to himself but to this house.
It is a valuable contribution to the question
of education. His speech was the result of
great research, full of substance, and is
almost a reference book on the subject. I
compliment him on his industry, and on the
very fine way in which he presented the
subject to us.
Hon. William M. Wall: Honourable senators, first of all, I would like to thank the
honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron) for bringing this important problem to our attention during the present session, and to congratulate him upon the comprehensive nature of his documentation and
analysis of key educational problems. His
vigorous argumentation on behalf of interesting, significant and challenging suggestions
which he advanced made a deep impression
upon me.
I should not like to trespass and touch on
problems which have been raised by honourable senators during this debate, which I am
sure the honourable senator from Banff will
wish to deal with in his closing remarks. My
purpose in rising to take part in the debate
on this particular inquiry is that I should like
to substantiate, if you will, some of the arguments he advanced to emphasize that Canadians do indeed face increasingly pressing
educational needs. These needs we must
learn more about so that we may understand
them better, assess them more adequately,
and then solve them as quickly and as effectively as possible.
Once they are possessed of the facts of the
case, I believe that the Canadian people will
gladly undertake realistic and courageous
solutions to such pressing educational problems, even if they involve the expenditure
of the millions of dollars which the honourable senator from Banff had indicated. Canadians will spend that kind of money if they
are convinced of the need and the practicability of the solutions being suggested by
competent Canadian educationalists.
Of
course, the honourable senator's estimate of
an additional $150 million per year for the
next ten years is a great deal of money.
However, if I understand him correctly, this

money is to be provided by local, provincial
and national governmental authorities and
through the private enterprise efforts of our
Canadian people.
Furthermore, this estimate of an additional
$150 million per year must be related to the
estimated $915 million which is now being
spent annually for public education. Perhaps
these sums would be beneficiated to their
proper proportions were we to relate themi no sense of criticism, I must stress-to the
sums Canadians spend annually on ordinary
entertainment, pleasure travel, soft drinks,
confectionery and chewing gum, tobacco,
alcoholic beverages, attendance at horse races,
and betting. The total amount spent on all
these things in 1955 was $2,500,000,000. Tobacco and its accessories cost Canadians in
1956 the sum of $512 million; in that same
year Canadians imbibed at a cost of $965
million.
Perhaps I may be excused for referring
once again to the fact that the percentage
relationship of our total educational expenditures to our gross national product-and I
would contend that our G.N.P. does indicate
our ability to provide for education-is now
only about 2.75 per cent, and has not approximated for many years the 4 per cent we
were somehow able to provide for educational
services during the lean depression years.
May we note, please, that an increase of 1
per cent in this relationship would bring to
education an additional $300 million per
year-twice as much as the sum suggested
by the honourable senator from Banff.
There were some references made regarding the relevancy and irrelevancy of
discussing educational problems in this
honourable chamber. Surely, honourable
senators, one of Canada's most important
general social services, for whose efficiency
and adequacy the federal Government must
assume its proper share of responsibility, is
the service of education. This responsibility
must be defined in terms of assistance, not
federal control. Surely the role of our educational institutions in helping to achieve
the goals of national development and
national purposing needs no protagonistic
argumentation in this chamber. The Canadian nation as a whole does bear a collective
responsibility to provide for every Canadian
boy or girl equality of access to, and equality
of participation in, accepted and acceptable
educational services, irrespective of the
province or locality in which that boy or
girl may reside.
For many years the Canadian nation,
through its national Government, has given
direct assistance to education. During the
past five years more than $140 million was

SENATE
expended for all forms of education in Canada; this year, 1956-57, almost $43 million
is to be spent. The principle of federal participation in education is now part and parcel
of our political tradition and reality, as is
the principle of federal financial participation in health and welfare, for example,
which I understand to be primarily
provincial responsibilities.
Nor can the national Government of Canada avoid its responsibility for making
certain that the provinces and their local
Governments have the financial means to
discharge
their constitutional provincial
responsibilities, among which is the responsibility for the education of our children and
our youth. This evolving principle of "lessdirect" national responsibility for basic social
services under the jurisdiction of provincial
governments is also part and parcel of our
political tradition and reality. That is why I
respectfully suggested to the honourable
senators, in my address on November 7 last,
that the fiscal needs of education generally
should not be overlooked when a comprehensive transfer payment formula was being
adjudicated and evolved at our federal-provincial fiscal conferences. This formula
must help to assure that every Canadian
province can in fact provide the quantity
and the quality of educational services
which we believe every Canadian boy and
girl should have.
What are the pressing problems of education, or what those of us who have been in
education like to term "the crisis in education"? I hold in my hand a very illuminating
study which was carried out under the
auspices of the Canadian School Trustees
Association, and was published in 1955. This
study, which is entirely "School Finance in
Canada", gives us significant information
concerning the many educational problems in
the ten provinces. Let us look for a minute
at the difficulties we face in providing adequate accommodation and teaching services
for steadily increasing school enrolments, or
what is called "the rising flood of numbers".
In 1951-52 the total enrolment in grades 1
to 13 was about 21 million pupils; of these
330,000 were in grades 9 to 13.
Averaging three carefully worked-out estimates of future enrolments, this study
guessed that by 1960-61 we would have
3,500,000 pupils in grades 1 to 13, of whom
484,000 would be in grades 9 to 13; and that
by 1965-66 we would have 4,038,000 in grades
1 to 13, of whom 576,000 would be in secondary schools.
The study, which is based on what we
know now to be low estimates, calculated
that by 1965 we would need 38,000 additional

classrooms, with of course 38,000 additional
teachers, and as well additional inspectors,
supervisors and so on. We now have in Canada 120,000 teachers. This would mean an
increase by 1965 to roughly 160,000 teachers.
To provide these additional services, assuming that the then-prevailing prices and salary
scales remain unchanged, would cost Canadians $950 million in capital expenditures,
and would bring increases in annual current
operating costs of $135 million; it would increase the total annual salaries of teachers
by $85 million.
We now know, as I have already said, that
these estimates are low. The 1957-58 estimates of enrolment in grades 1 to 13 is
3,750,000, which is more than the estimate for
the year 1960-61. Last year we already had
507,000 students in our secondary schools, but
this study had estimated 484,000 for 1960-61.
Now let us further suppose that the percentage of our pupils completing junior
matriculation continues to rise over our
present 25 per cent, because that is what our
figures now are. If 10,000 pupils begin in
grade 1 we graduate out of high school 2,500,
or 25 per cent. Suppose that figure rises to
35 per cent, or indeed to 50 per cent, as it
is now in the United States, what an additional flood of students we shall have to
provide for, and still more buildings, more
trained teachers and greater educational expenditures which we just will not be able to
avoid.
The honourable senator from Banff stressed
the need to encourage a much higher percentage of students to complete their high
school education, and as one means of doing
so he advocates the setting up of a National
Foundation for this purpose on the one hand,
and a revolving Scholarship Bursary Loans
Fund in each of the ten provinces on the other
hand. I respectfully suggest this kind of
student aid program merits consideration by
all concerned.
May I now come to the need of professionally trained university graduates.
We
in Canada share with every progressive
country the problems of a societal structure
which bas become increasingly complex each
year. The function of the professionally
trained specialist grows in relative importance
while that of the unskilled labourer declines.
In 1931, honourable senators, the percentage of professionals in our total labour force
was 5.4; by 1956 this percentage had increased
to 7, which is roughly a 40 per cent increase.
It is further estimated that during the next
10 years the relative percentage of professionals will increase by another 50 per cent
-so that from our present 400,000 professionals we shall have to reach a figure of

DECEMBER 4, 1957
600,000 by 1967. In other words, we shall
have to train within 10 years 200,000 professionals at a rate of 20,000 per year.
How many graduates have we at Canadian
universities to meet this need, even if we
add to that number the 2,000 professionals
that we used to gain by immigration of professional people to Canada, which immigration is beginning to peter out in that particular aspect? Last year, in the scholastic year
nding 1957, the universities graduated
15,200 students. If we need 20,000, we will
have to increase that number by 5,000 per
year.
Evidence from the St. Andrews Conference held last fall, which the honourable
senator from Banff mentioned, and from the
1957 meeting of the National Conference of
Canadian Universities, would seen to indicate
further shortages of highly trained professional personnel. These shortages range from
30 per cent to more than 100 per cent, with
the average running between 60 and 70 per
cent.
The St. Andrews Conference boldly predicted that if we were to graduate sufficient
technical and professional personnel to look
after the needs of our growing economy, and
if we were to try to maintain some kind of
parity with the United States and with the
Soviet Union, we would need to have by 1980
about 375,000 students in our universities.
We now have in our universities 85,000
students.
Our present inflow of entrants into our
universities appears to be inadequate if we
are to increase the relative percentage rate
of graduations, which is now 600 as compared to 10,000 students entering our schools
at the grade 1 level. One practical way of
increasing this inflow is the provision of
many thousands of new scholarships, bursaries and loans.
The honourable senator from Banff mentioned a press dispatch about the quadrupling
of federal Government spending on Australian
university education during the next three
years. Through the courtesy of the Australian
High Commissioner I have this paper, plus
other information. I see that the new program of assistance to the universities is going
to be increased from £6 million, spent in the
three-year period 1955-56-57, to £22 million
in 1958-59-60, and the news dispatch plus the
budget paper goes on to spell out the terms
of this distribution.
I will not discuss that point any further,
but I do want to point out one thing that
interests me about the contribution of the
Australian federal and state Governments to
university costs. This is very illuminating
and I would like to tell you about it.

The 1956 total expenditures of all Australian universities was £11,515,814, and of
that total £9,200,000 was provided by federal
and state grants.
And then, another very interesting thing.
I have heard about the federal or, as they call
it, the Commonwealth, Scholarship Scheme
which provides annually 3,000 scholarships to
the states on a population basis, with some
reservations. An interesting figure is that
there are now in the University of Australia
9,300 students on these Commonwealth or
federal scholarships-that is 25 per cent of
the students attending the universities-and
I told honourable senators once before that
the sum total of all our scholarship students
is only 15 per cent.
I submit that the problem of getting sufficient entrants into our universities is most
important to the survival of democracies in
the world situation we now face-perhaps
with alerted realism and decreased complacency. The problem of identifying, assisting,
educating and inspiring needed professional
manpower is becoming ever increasingly
crucial, and in this connection we have
ample and deeply disturbing evidence that
about 50 per cent of our able young people
do not continue their education beyond high
school.
Are we sure that we can afford this inefficient use of human talent? Many gifted
children never go to a university at all.
This is a waste which we must assess realistically, asking ourselves if we can really
afford it.
I have an interesting estimate of this
waste from a survey prepared by the Ontario
College of Education. It is claimed that 60
per cent of academically gifted children, having I.Q.'s of 115 and over, never go on to
higher education institutions; and furthermore-what is even more startling-one out
of every three of the very gifted-that is,
students having an I.Q. of 130 plus-also do
not go on to higher education.
I believe we have progressed past our
former laisser faire attitude or conviction that
when a young man or woman deserves and
wants to go to the university he or she must
carry the whole financial load. I believe we
must recognize that Canada falls behind
other democracies in the providing of financial
assistance for scholarships and bursaries for
young people of talent, and that we should do
something about it through public and private
means. In this connection the Gordon Commission's preliminary report is very interesting, because it points to this critical shortage
of trained manpower and specifically suggests
increased direct and substantial aid from
Governments to needy and deserving students.

SENATE

Honourable senators will remember that,
with some hesitation and trepidation, I suggested that perhaps Canada could spend $10
million a year for financial aid to students to
provide 5,000 scholarships, at a rate of $2,000
per year, divided equally between the student and the university.
Now I should like to talk a little about
university training facilities. The need of
meeting this problem of enlarging the facilities was underlined by Dr. Claude T. Bissell,
President of Carleton University, early this
year in one of the Department of Labour's
radio programs,-"Canada at work". His submission was that on the basis of sober statistical analyses the present total of 75,000
university students will double in ten years'
time. Dr. Bissell asked, "What is Canada
going to do about it?"-concerning (a) capital
costs, and (b) finding 4,000 professors to add
to the present 6,000 to teach these students.
An analysis shows that the capital costs
needed for the next ten years are variously
estimated from $300 million to the $600 million of which we heard yesterday from the
honourable senator from Banff.
I should like to submit this interesting
observation. Dr. E. F. Sheffield, of the Education Division of the Dominion Bureau of
Statistics, agrees that present trends indicate
a doubling of candidates for university admission between 1955 and 1965. I would suggest
that the present trends are not necessarily
just or, should I say, adequate, and that we
may have to treble this number within the
next ten years.
I have attempted to re-emphasize a few
of the pressing educational problems which
Canadians face as they prepare to meet the
rising tide of students entering our educational institutions. Furthermore, we do need
to increase the relative percentages of graduates from our secondary schools, from our
technical and vocational institutions, and
from our universities if we are to have adequate numbers of technicians and professionally-trained people to satisfy the future
needs of our rapidly developing and changing
economy in its socio-economic, political, and
cultural aspects.
May I conclude by expressing the hope
that honourable senators will follow with interest, and if possible attend, the first largescale comprehensive national conference on
education, which is to be held here in Ottawa
from February 17 to 20, 1958. This national
meeting grew out of a strong conviction on
the part of many people that the time had
come for a truly national conference of both
educators and representative laymen to examine the needs of education in Canada.
Honourable senators have received notification of this conference and, I am sure, have
read the message it contains.

Finally, may I express my satisfaction with
two aspects of this discussion: one, that the
hon-ourable senator from Banff brought this
whole educational problem to our joint attention in this form; and, two, that the honourable members of this chamber have made it
possible to give some time to a consideration
of what I believe is one of our most important
general social services,-the service of education. Thank you, honourable senators.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Having listened to the
splendid speech of the honourable senator
from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall) I wonder
whether he would mind answering two questions.
During my long association with
Parliament I have heard year after year
discussions of the British North America Act
and the rights of the provinces outlined
particularly in regard to health and education. When I heard him speak about the
traditions of the provinces in the matter of
education, I wondered if he had not overlooked the fact that the B.N.A. Act places
education under provincial control and
whether, if the federal Government is to
hand out moneys for all these educational
purposes, he would favour the elimination
from the act of the section which makes
My
education a provincial responsibility.
second question is, would he be in favour of
millions of dollars being handed out by the
dominion Government without any check as
to how that money is to be spent?
Hon. Mr. Wall: In answer to the first question, dealing with the constitutional responsibilities and the prerogatives of the provinces
in relation to the control and administration
I would be the last person in
of education:
the world to contend that this constitutional
or responsibility should be
prerogative
trespassed upon by the federal Government,
but perhaps the federal Government could
contribute to education directly as it now in
fact does, and when assessing the needs of
the provinces and municipalities at the
dominion-provincial conference to be held
early in January it might recognize the needs
of education and decide to pay out moneyor, as the honourable senator from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) said, hand out
The provinces
money-to the provinces.
could then use that money with responsibility
and care for the education of their children.
Honourable senators will recall that I
challenged the validity of the principle of
giving conditional grants. It is like giving
a conditional grant to a boy; or, if I may be
excused for the simple but inadequate
analogy, you give a boy a dollar a week as an
allowance and then you tell him how he is
going to spend it.

DECEMBER 4, 1957
I think the provincial governments know
the needs of their people and are perfectly
responsible and will, in fact, do what is best
with the money that cornes fromn the federal
Governiment in the forn of a tax-rental
redistribution or, as some may cail it,
retribution.
I wonder if the honourable senator frorn
new Westminster would restate his second
question?
Hon. Mr. Reid: Would the honounable
senator feel it right that the dominion
Governrnent should hand out millions o!
dollars to the provinces for educational purposes without the fedenal Govennment having
some control as to how that rnoney is to be
spent?
Hon. Mr. Wall: There may be aneas of
education where conditional grants or assistance grants for certain speciflc purposes
under certain tenms of reference, which could
be accepted or rejected, couid be given to
the provinces, just as we are going to give
grants in aid of a national hospital insurance
plan which is to come into effect under certain conditions. I believe the main point of
the honourable gentlernan's question is answered by the fact that I am specifically not
too great a believen in conditional grants, and
that I feel money that is nedistributed by the
fedenal Government to the -provinces should
be le! t to the provinces to spend as they deern
best. Suneiy the provincial governments
would shoulder that responsibility in a
wondenful way.
Hon. Mr. Reid: 1 raised these questions
because it is my feeling that thene are many
provincial govennments today which do not
care a rap about the British North Arnerica
Act just so long as the federal Govennment
gives themn enuugh money for health and
educational purposes. You neyer hean thern
talk about provincial rights as long as they
get this money.
Hon. Mr. Davies: I should like to ask the
honourable senator frorn Winnipeg (Hon. Mn.
Wall) a question relating to what has been
said about scholarships by hirnself and by the
honunable senator frorn Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron). Would he think it practical, if
such a scholarship scherne were adopted, to
stipulate that persons educated under the
scholarship scheme would have to stay in
Canada for, say, at least five yeans after
graduating? Would the honourable senator
be in favour o! putting any restrictions at
ail on these scholarships? If we pay out
rnoney for the education of a great many
young Canadians, should we not benefit from
this expenditure, or should we let them go off
to the United States as soon as they graduate?

Hon. Mr. Wall: I find that question difficuit
to answer, fur when I received a scholarship
f rom. Harvard university it did flot place any
limitation on where I could work after I
finished my studies there. I would rather
express an opinion than a conviction on this
question, for surely there is a great deal of
menit in the contention of the honourable
senator from Kingston (Hon. Mn. Davies) that
if money from the Canadian taxpayers is to
be used for scholarships some limitation
should be placed on the students to guarantee
that they do flot; leave Canada for at least
some period of tirne. I think that wouid be
a neasonable requirement.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think it would be
very difficuit to put into effect.
Han. Gustave Monetie: Honourable senatons, may I take time to say a few words
on this question? As I understand it, the
honounable senator frorn Banff (Hon. Mn.
Camenon) and the honounable senaton fnom
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall) have stressed the
necessity for expanding educational facilities
in their respective provinces. I arn inclined
to feel that they are right, that it would be
beneficial to so expand education within those
provinces, as well as within any other provinces. I would be pleased to see Quebec and
any othen provinces doing more than at
present, if necessary, in one way or another,
to advance education. And if they feel this
should be done they might decide to allocate
more of their money for this purpose. I do
not think any member of this chamber would
question their right to do so. However, the
way in which this subi ect was pnesented to
the house involves another question, that is
the serious question of federal grants to
provinces in the field of education. That is
the problern.
I arn sure honourable senators are familian
with the provisions of the British Nonth
America Act, but it may not be useless to
nead from section 93 of the act:
In and for each Province the Legislature may
exclusively make laws in relation to education, subject and according to the following provisions...

One of these provisions is that the privileges
that were gnanted before Confederation to
the ternitonies within those provinces shall
not be attacked or destnoyed. But the
principle is that the enacting of laws and
providing for ail things pertaining to the
direction of education is exclusively attributable to the provinces, and one province has
no right to indicate to another province what
it should do in matters of education. The
fedenal Government itself has no authority
at ail, eithen directly or indirectly, or in
biased ways, to say what kind of education
should be had in any province of Canada.

SENATE

I am not opposed to the provinces getting
more than their present revenues for the
purposes of education if they so desire. I am
not opposed to the federal authority making
to the provinces some forms of grants, provided they are not earmarked for education,
and provided it is left to the provinces and not
to the federal authority to decide whether the
whole or part of such grants will be used for
education.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? He used the word "earmarked".
Does he mean that the federal Government
in making a grant to a province should not
definitely say that the money shall not be
used except for education?
Hon. Mr. Monette: That is it; because they
could not earmark it for education.

esteem him. I followed his speech the other
day with great interest. To answer his question I would say this: suppose the federal
authority made to a province a grant earmarked for a university, then the province
would be in this position, that even though it
felt that at the moment it could better
enhance the progress of education by applying the grant to the common school level, it
could not utilize the money in that way.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? I ask him the same question that I asked the honourable senator from
Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall). Would you agree
to the handing out of millions of dollars by
the federal treasury under the conditions you
have just outlined, without any control or
investigation by the dominion Government

than education?
I am sorry to bring the subject of income
Hon. Mr. Monette: I will try to answer the tax into this debate, but I do so just for an
honourable senator. I am not as experienced example. The British North America Act
as he is, and he does not know how much I provides that the federal parliament has

DECEMBER 4, 1957
jurisdiction for "the raising of money by any
mode or systemn of taxation". Before the war
the then revenues from federal taxation
were sufficient; for peace-timne needs. During
the war, however, the federal authority found
it necessary to collect much larger sums of
money by increasing both personal and
corporation income taxes. The provinces
agreed to allow the federal authority to do
this for the duration of the war, and for the
time being they transferred their rights in
that regard to the federal authority. At the
end of the war the federal authority decided,
rjghtly or wrongly-I am not; passing on that
at the moment-to continue taxing as heavily
as it did during the war. Now the provinces
are placed in the position that if they reassumned their former taxing powers they would
appear to be imposing excessive taxation.
Therefore if it were possible for the federal
Government to alleviate the burden of those
taxes by reducing its present rates of levy,
so as to allow the provinces to re-enter
adequately their legitimate fields of income
and corporation taxation, then the provinces
would again be in a position to meet their
needs in relation to education.
So, briefly, while I understand the position of the federal Governmnent, I would support the position of the provinces in dlaiming the return to themn of their taxing
facilities.
I appreciate the very clear and earnest
appeals mnade by the honourable senators who
have discussed the need for greater education. May I add to what they have said that
we are now facing the most pressing problemn
of extending our scientiflc education to farreaching limits. Indeed, unless we solve this
problem expeditiously we may be lost. I am
strongly in favour of such a scientific educational program. So, honourable senators, I
say again that I support the view that the
federal authority should make it possible for
the provinces to levy a reasonable share of
taxes, or give the provinces generous grants
without having themn earmarked for education or any other specific purpose assigned
exclusively to provincial jurisdiction. In that
way all provinces, not only Alberta and
Manitoba, would have avallable to them
substantially larger amounts than their
present revenues, and it would unquestionably be within their exclusive jurisdiction to
decide how that money should be spent.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: Honourable senators, I arn not a lawyer, and cannot discuss
the provisions of the British North America

Act as many of my friends can. But one
problemn has been apparent to me for many
years. The Family Allowances Act requires
that parents of children past the age of five
or six years must either send their children to
school or forfeit the right to receive the
allowance. Is that law not now ultra vires?
Hon. Mr. Monetie: Honourable senators,
may I be allowed to ýsay another word or
two? As I understood the honourable the
junior senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Wall), he said that these special grants to
education have now become part and parcel
of our systemn and are considered a reality.
By that statement I understood him to mean
that this partidular problem of jurisdiction in
education as between Ottawa and the
provinces is now conditioned by precedents
which tend to legalize those encroachments
upon our Constitution.
This may be a way of modifying, by
precedents, a body of law. It may be a very
respectable way indeed, but fortunately the
provinces were not unanimous in acceptmng
those grants earmarked for education. They
were flot approved by Quebec, as that
province did not and does not accept them
because of their being so earmarked.
Therefore, may I say to my honourable
friend from Winnipeg that the systemn of
earmarked grants has not yet reached the
point where it could be deemed to modify
our Constitution. As I see it, the system is
stili under discussion, and we want to be able
to discuss it as long as necessary. As it stands
at the -present time it is not constitutional.
Let us help the provinces as much as we
can by direct uncondîtional grants or by
alleviating taxation, and leaving to the
provinces the unimpaired liberty of determining what shall be spent on education
within their own borders.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt: As my honourable
friend from Mille Isies (Hon. Mr. Monette)
knows, the Quebec Minîster of Social Welfare
and Youth received in 1936-37 and for many
years, a purse in the form of a scholarship,
which was contributed by the federal Government and the provincial Government, for
the assistance of students taking technical

On motion of honourable Mr. Beaubien,

APPROPRIATION

BILL NO. 7

FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
a message has been received from the House
of Commons with Bill 198, for granting Her
Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service of the financial year ending the 31st
March, 1958, to which they desire the concurrence of the Senate.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
move, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Brunt, that this bill be read the second time
now. This is a financial bill, providing for
supplementary supply. After this bill has been
passed and certain moneys have been voted,
the right of any honourable senator will be
reserved to discuss any item in the bill as
though the bill had not been passed. This is
the usual reservation made on a bill of this
nature, and I repeat it.
Before speaking on this bill today, I asked
Department of Finance officials to prepare
me a statement, which I ask permission of
the house to quote. It is quite long-some
honourable members may think it is unnecessarily long-but when it is remembered that
part of the money was voted last March and
April, and part has been voted by way of
supplementary supply this fall, it will be
agreed that it is a most complicated matter
for the Department of Finance. Indeed, the
gentleman whom I engaged to come and help
me with the bill tells me they have never had
this happen before. Usually when the Government changes, the supply bill has been
passed and all the business done for the year,
and the new Government steps in and votes
its own supply. But that was not the case
this time.
Honourable senators may think my explanation a little long. When I conclude my remarks
I will ask permission to place on Hansard,
by way of financial information, the text of
the document prepared for me. By this means
any honourable senator or any outsider will
be able to get an up-to-date statement of the
financial facts from April 1, 1957, to date.

The supply bill before us today covers two
things, namely, additional supply of the
regular items to carry on for one month, and
some other matters that have been added in.
Both these items will be covered in my
explanation.
As I have indicated, I am going to make a
little longer explanation than usual. I do
so for two purposes. If we referred the bill
to a committee and examined it there this
same official to whom I refer would come
there and give us the information we require. I did not feel that would be as good
as having him make a statement to me in
answer to my questions put to him as to the
actual situation. In any event, that is the
procedure I followed, and he made a statement as an official of the department, not
as a political man, if I may use that expression. He has given us a statement which I
think is better even than anything that has
been placed on the records of the House of
Commons, because as the Minister himself
said, quite candidly, his was mostly a
speech of his own making, and it probably
would not contain any of the details that a
person might want to ask about.
This report that I have here covers all
those matters. Now, honourable senators,
after I read this report if anybody wants to
ask any questions I will be glad to answer
them, and thus we will have a record here
for ever of the transition period. And I may
say, honourable senators, that this is something that I personally wanted to be placed
on record and I think every member wanted
this kind of report. It is more important to
the Senate than it is to the House of Commons. God willing, many of us will be
here for some years, and within let us say
the next four or five years we will be able
to refer to this report for details of the
adjustment between what happened to the
expenditures authorized by the old Government, and what has been done by the new
Government. Questions like that will always
be coming up for consideration, regardless
of whether expenditure was authorized by
the old Government or by the new Government.
This report divides those questions. Before
I read from the report, may I say that it
is the report of an official of the Government,
one who is not on one side or the other.
For many years he has been in the employ
of the Department of Finance. I think he
worked in that department under the Bennett
Government, and then under the Liberal
Government, and he now works under the
Diefenbaker Government.
I think honourable senators will find this
to be a comprehensive report. It will give

DECEMBER 5, 1957
to each one of us, and not only to members
of the house but to quite a number of people
outside-people who have already spoken
or written to me saying that they would
like to know-information as to what the
adjustments are with regard to the finances
during this transition period. When I got
the chance to do it I thought I would get
it out in such form that in the future an
auditor or anybody else who wanted to
know about the relationships between the
accounts would be able to refer to an official
record in our Debates.
For those reasons I may take a little
longer than usual to deal with it, and it may
be that it will be a little tiresome to the
house.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
may I say to the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) that we have
no objection to his taking the time. I think
we would all like him to take the time of
the house, and I feel the statement should
be read completely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will read it fully.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Does the honourable
leader mind telling us the name of the
official who wrote the report?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was written by Mr.
Allan. I do not know him at all. I just
asked for one of the officials, and they named
two, and I chose Mr. Allan just by chance.
I did not know either of them. Mr. Allan
came and I was very delighted with his
work. That is all I know about him. I
never saw him before in my life; I had
never spoken to him before.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: May I ask the honourable gentleman if what he is putting on the
record is an official statement or a Government
statement?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am speaking as representative of the Government in this house. Of
course it is a Government statement. I am
standing behind it. I have mentioned the
source of my information. I did not get it
from the minister: although he is a great
friend of mine I wanted, not that kind of
statement, but material from an official of the
department, who is not in politics at all.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Was the official who
gave the statement authorized to do so by
the minister?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. The minister said I
could apply to any official I wanted, and I
named this man. That is all there is to it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I think it is excellent.

Hugessen:

Hon. Mr. Haig: It is my statement.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But the honourable senator, I presume, may add to it. He might tell
us, for instance, when we are to have the
budget.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In answer to honourable
gentlemen, I repeat that I take full responsibility, but in fairness to all concerned I
want honourable senators to know the basis
of my report; otherwise some might say,
"Haig did not know and lie did not try to
find out." I did try to find out, and I am
giving you information on the best authority
at my disposal. I am not trying to hide behind it, however; I am taking full responsibility for it, and so does the Government.
I really felt obligated to give the house a
financial statement of which it could be said
"This is not Haig's report; it is prepared by
departmental officials and can be depended
upon as being authoritative." I believe it to
be so, though there may be a slip here or
there. As I have said, the official prepared
it, not I, though I accept full responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Prati: Are we to understand, in
hearing the statement, that it reflects Government policy-actual Government policy?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would not say that it is
Government policy, or that it is not.
Hon. Mr. Prati: It is not accepted by the
Government?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am giving honourable
gentlemen the facts of the case.
Hon. Mr. Prait: May I ask, what case?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is a report of what the
Government has done about finance-what it
has done with the money-since it came into
office on June 10.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Go ahead.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Proceed: let us
have the statement.
I think the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) has made it clear
that he is presenting this statement on his
own responsibility, as a member of the Government. He has told the house the source
of his information, but he is not relying on
anyone outside this house: he is acting, as
I say, in the capacity of Leader and representative of the Government in this chamber.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: I wanted to give honourable
senators the facts. They can draw any conclusions they like. Although I may dispute
those conclusions, the facts speak for
themselves, and I am not denying them.
Hon. Mr. Golding: Read the statement.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This is a situation which
may not happen again in 50 years. It never
happened before.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It may happen in a
year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It may happen in a year.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Here is a record which
everybody can understand when it is discussed. I thought the ladies and gentlemen
of this chamber would want this kind of
report. That is exactly what I am trying to
give you.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Let's have it, then.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Section 2 of the bill provides one-twelfth of all the items to be voted
in the main estimates for the fiscal year
ending March 31, 1958, except certain votes.
Sections 3 and 4 of the bill cover additional proportions of four special items in

the main estimates to provide for construction programs for which expenditures are
concentrated in the first nine months of the
year.
Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the bill are covered
by the first page of the report, giving exactly
what money has been spent, including the
one-twelfth.
Then you turn over the page and you get
one-sixth of all the items to be voted in

the further supplementary estimates. The
particulars are covered in the bill itself. The
additional proportions of three special items,
not included before, are given with the
amounts.
Then, the other estimates not included
amount to $4,453,000, giving a total of $281
million odd. That is the amount of this
estimate.
Now, then, the proportions requested in
this bill are intended to provide for all necessary requirements of the public service up
to December 31, 1957, excluding those for
which full supply has already been granted.
The form of the bill is the same as that
of similar bills passed in previous years.
Then they go on. The first item, one-twelfth
generally of the main and supplementary
estimates, $276 million; the second item, sixtwelfths generally and special proportions of
the main and supplementary estimates, $1,714
million; and the third item, remainder of

items in main and supplementary estimates,
$63 million. That has been passed in full.
That covers each one of the items up to
that point. Then it goes on to the next item,
for acquisition, construction and improvement of public buildings. The major repairs
to and improvement of, and plans and sites
for public buildings, are listed. The item is
$300,000. That will be found in the text,
and is covered in the special estimate.
The note from the department that I have
before me says:
The additional proportion of 1/6th will bring the
total amount allotted to this vote to 11/12ths, or
$275,000. The many minor projects of an improvement nature for public buildings, for which this
vote provides, have been under way for some time
and are now being completed at a rapid rate. The
vote is fully encumbered, and estimated expenditures to December 31 total $275,000, of which
approximately $75,000 will be spent in Ottawa, and
approximately $200,000 elsewhere in Canada.

Then with regard to Northern Affairs and
National Resources:
Votes 318 and 719 provide a total of $10,911,741
for construction and for acquisition of equipment
for the Northwest Territories and other field
services. This additional proportion of 1/12th will
bring the total amount allotted for that purpose
Work in the north, of course,
to $8,884,784.15.
must be concentrated largely in the warmer months,
this reason, more than the general proand for
portion is required at this time.

This brings me to the estimated expenditure to December 31, of the additional onetwelfth of the main estimates, for Building
and Works, $7,580,000. When that amount
is deducted from the supply proposed in this
vote for the portion of the program carried

out

by

the

Public

Works

Department,

amounting to $7,735,000, a balance for allowance for contingencies remains of $155,000,
which is one-seventieth of the total vote.

Additional one-twelfth amounts of the
main estimates are listed in the schedule, and
include the wharf at Borden, improvements
to French River south, and many others, at
$1,440,000, showing where expenditures have
been made for improvements at different
places, on the main estimate vote in the
original bill.
There is an item under "Development
Engineering Services", to provide for the construction of the Trans-Canada highway
through the national parks, amounting to $10
million. The breakdown is given of the
estimated expenditure by allotment to
December 31, and is as follows:

DECEMBER 5, 1957
The next is an additional one-third of the
amount shown in the further supplementary
estimates (2) item. These estimates show an
amount of $12,700,000 for the acquisition of,
and additions and improvements to, governmental buildings, etc., in Ottawa.
These estimates show how the former
administration spent the amounts.
The next item concludes the votes on
Public Works, and shows a further amount
required of $1,500,000 to provide for the construction of the Trans-Canada highway
through national parks.
Honourable senators, I ask that this statement be put on today's Hansard, with the
consent of the house. It shows what the
former Government voted, and how much has
been spent on each item.
For statement see appendix to today's
Hansard, pp. 358-62.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, as the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig) has explained, this is an interim
supply bill, and it is the second interim supply bill presented to this house during this
session. As he stated, it represents a portion
of the estimates which were brought down
prior to this Parliament, during the present
fiscal year, by the former administration, and
also a portion of the estimates brought down
by the present administration this year. Honourable senators will recall that in the early
part of this year the former administration
brought in its main estimates. Those estimates appear in the Blue Book, of which we
all have a copy. Later, and before the middle of April, the administration brought down
further estimates, known as supplementary
estimates, of which we also have copies. Still
later, before Parliament was dissolved, the
former administration brought down further
supplementary estimates (1). Honourable senators will recall that those estimates were
not passed by the former administration, but
that Parliament, before dissolution, granted
six months' interim supply to the former
administration.
After the new administration took office
and called Parliament, it tabled further supplementary estimates known as "Further supplementary estimates (2)". So, we have before
us now the main estimates, the supplementary
estimates, the further supplementary estimates (1), and the further supplementary
estimates (2).
As the honourable Leader of the Government has said, this bill, generally speaking,
represents interim supply for one month, and
the total amount being voted is $281,607,101.16.

I made the general statement that this represents one-twelfth of these estimates, but as
the Leader of the Government has said, it
covers more than one-twelfth of certain items.
If honourable senators will look at Bill
198, copies of which have now been distributed, they will see that clause 2 votes the
sum of $260,679,899.09, being one-twelfth of
the main estimates. Clause 3 would vote onesixth of certain items, which are set forth in
Schedule A to the bill. As the Leader of
the Government has said, that is an estimate
prepared in connection with certain public
works, and one-sixth of that item is being
voted. That is an item in the main estimates.
Clause 4 would vote $1,787,853.42, being
one-twelfth of the amount set forth in
schedule B to the bill. Honourable senators
will note that that schedule contains certain
items of the Department of Northern Affairs
and Natural Resources and the Department
of Public Works.
Clause 5 would vote $1,497,738.25, onetwelfth of the supplementary estimates.
Clause 6 would vote $2,138,888.89, which is
one-ninth of certain further supplementary
estimates (1). Honourable senators may ask
why in this paragraph the percentage is oneninth, while in most other paragraphs it is
one-twelfth. As the Leader of the Government has pointed out, the supplementary
estimates were for a period of nine months,
not for a year; hence, the vote is for oneninth of the amount.
Clause 7 would vote $125,000, which is
one-twelfth of the amount of an additional
item in the further supplementary estimates
(1). It is an expenditure in connection with
Maritime freight rate assistance.
Clause 8 would vote $13,474,054.84, which
is one-sixth of the further supplementary
estimates (2), with the exception of certain
items.
Clause 9, which would vote $1,853,666.67,
is one-third of further supplementary estimates (2). Those items are set forth in
schedule C to the bill.
As the Leader of the Government has
pointed out, this is the usual supply bill, and
I do not take any exception to it. The fact
is, the former administration tabled most
of the main estimates and the supplementary
estimates; the further supplementary estimates (2) were brought in by the present
administration, for the most part to cover
increased expenditures under amendments
made to the Old Age Security Act, the Old

SENATE
Age Assistance Act, the Blind Persons Act,
the Disabled Persons Act and the War
Veterans Allowance Act, 1952.
I recall, honourable senators, that when we
passed the former interim supply bill it was
stated there would not likely be time for the
Finance Committee, under the able chairmanship of the senator frorn Milford-Hants (Hon.
Mr. Hawkins), to consider these estimates
this year. It now seems that the session may
last long enough for that committee to have
ample time to go to work on them.
In the meantime, I wish to say only that I
take no exception to what the Government is
doing at the present time. This is in line with
the custom that has been followed throughout
the years, and, so far as I am concerned, I
approve of the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, before
this bill is passed, I would like to ask the
honourable Leader of the Government a question. In his opening remarks this afternoon
he said there would be further estimates come
before the house, and an opportunity would
be given to honourable senators to examine
them. My question to him is this: In view
of what bas happened in the past can he
assure us that these further estimates will be
brought down in tirne for us to examine
them, or will we be told that the Governor
General is coming here in two hours and for
goodness' sake let us get through with them?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thank the honourable senator for his question, and I entirely agree
with what he says. The problen is to be
able to carry out such an assurance. Let me
say that I will do my best to carry it out.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Before the question is put,
would the Leader of the Government explain
clause 7, which would vote $125,000 for
Maritime freight assistance?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am sorry, but I am unable to answer my friend. My understanding
is that there is an organization functioning
in the Maritimes, and this item is by way
of a contribution to it. I am unable to give
a precise answer.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not have the

Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the following bills:
Bill C-7, for the relief of Bernhard Wilhelm Michael.
Bill D-7, for the relief of Paul-Emile
Bedard.
Bill E-7, for the relief of Gordon Frank
Skilling.
Bill F-7, for the relief of Michael Todascu.
Bill G-7, for the relief of Iris Dorothy Birks
Yates.
Bill H-7, for the relief of Marion Gloria
Ewart Balleine.
Bill 1-7, for the relief of Yvonne Florence
Kee Brien, otherwise known as Yvonne Florence Kee Durocher.

Whitlock.
The bills were read the first time.
SECOND READINGS

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall these bills be read the
second time?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
have objected many times to bills being given
one reading after the other at one sitting
when there is not a good reason advanced for
s§ doing, but in this instance, since we are
drawing near to the close of the session-at

SENATE
least, we hope so-it is in the public interest
that we give three readings to these particular bills today. With the concurrence of
the house I ask that they be read the second
and third times today. If that is done, they
may go before the other house even tomorrow, and certainly on Monday next. If we
do not do so, but go through the regular
delays, it will not be possible for the bills
to receive consideration in the other house
until the end of next week. Therefore,
honourable senators, I move, with the consent of the house, that these bills be now
read the second time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I am
sure the house will consent to give second
reading now to these bills, because I have a
nasty motion coming up-I am going to
propose that this house adjourn today until
Tuesday night next. So if these bills are to
go before the House of Commons right away
we should agree to giving them three
readings today.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is what I intended
to ask. We are on the motion for second
reading now.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the second time, on division.
THIRD READINGS

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall these bills be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: With leave, I move the
third reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bills
were read the third time, and passed, on
division.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I move
that when this house rises today it stand
adjourned until Tuesday next, December 10,
at 8 o'clock in the evening.
The motion was agreed to.
EDUCATION
NECESSITY TO MOBILIZE AND EXPAND
EDUCATIONAL RESOURCESDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from yesterday the
adjourned debate on the inquiry of Hon.
Mr. Cameron drawing the attention of the
Senate to:
The necessity for Canada to mobilize and expand
the educational resources of the nation with a
view to maintaining and strengthening her position
as a member of the world community.

Hon. T. A. Crerar: Honourable senators,
as this is Thursday afternoon, and I have no
doubt that some honourable senators would
wish to leave rather earlier than usual, I
shall endeavour to make my remarks brief.
Hon. Mr.
rest of us?

Macdonald:

What

about the

Hon. Mr. Crerar: I hear some remarks to
which I am not going to pay the slightest
attention!
We are indebted, I think, to the honourable
senator from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron).
Many of us know that the cause of education
is very close to his heart. Unfortunately I
did not hear his address on Tuesday, but I
have read it with much interest. It covered
a very wide field. All of us may not agree
with the suggestions he put forward, but
certainly we can concede that many of them
are challenging, and we are in his debt for
the amount of research he bas done and for
the facts in relation to the subject which be
bas given us.
Personally, I could wish that the honourable senator had given a little more attention
to the purpose of education-what it is, and
what it is for. In this day and generation
there are, it appears to me, widely conflicting
opinions as to what we really mean when
we fling around, rather loosely at times, the
term "education". Some people hold that it
is a preparation of our youth for the struggle
in life. I cannot agree. Education is something more than the sharpening of the beak
and the talons of the individual so that he
may the more successfully prey upon his
fellow man. That is a wholly mistaken concept of its purpose. Primarily it is the
mental development of the individual, but it
is not limited to that. If it is adequate it
makes a contribution to his spiritual, moral
and cultural and-I would add-his physical
development.
When a man has run the gamut of his
years of education, what should he possess?
If the process bas been successful, one consequence is a realization and an understanding of the importance of discipline in life.
It seems to me that in these days we do not
put enough emphasis on the importance of
discipline, not only in our family associations but in the broader aspect of our human
relationships.
Discipline is essential.
If
there was any glory and grandeur-as I
believe there was-in the old Scottish system
of education it arose largely from the importance it assigned to discipline. To the young
lad or girl entering into active life, going to
school, getting his or ber preparation for
the years that lie beyond, nothing is more
important than an understanding of the
meaning and purpose of discipline.

DECEMBER 5, 1957
Hon. Mr. Euler: What is discipline?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable colleague
from Waterloo (Hon. Mr. Euler), whose education in this respect has not been defective,
and who is of an inquiring turn of mind,
asks, what is discipline? Well, it is selfcontrol, and it is the recognition of the rights
of others. I believe that these definitions
sufficiently explain the meaning of a quality
in which the honourable gentleman in his
youth was, I am sure, very well trained.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Another product one is
entitled to expect frorn a good educational
system is intellectual integrity. There is, I
believe, nothing of greater importance to the
individual in his associations with his fellow
men. What do we mean by intellectual
honesty? It means the courage and ability
to think clearly and honestly. In my time in
Parliament, which goes back now so many
years that I hesitate to mention them, I
think one of the most outstanding figures in
public life who had intellectual honesty
beyond everything else was the Right Honourable Arthur Meighen. I did not agree
with him always. I thought he was often
wrong. But there was no question whatever
that he had the courage of his convictions,
and that he had the intellectual honesty to
put them forward even in the face of great
difficulty and opposition. That is a great
asset in a human individual.
If a young man has a well-rounded education when he comes out of university, be
will have much of the spirit of toleration.
Almost eternally human beings fall into confiict with each other, so what a fine thing it
is to be able to try to understand each
other's viewpoint. I was very much impressed the other day when my honourable colleague from Waterloo, while discussing the
international scene, pleaded that we try to
understand the point of view of those opposed
to us in our human relationships, business
relationships and, indeed, in all our relationships in life. That is a fundamental need.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: We should have a good
deal of the milk of human kindness fixed in
our mode of life when we leave university.
That is an essential thing in helping us to
overcome any difference of opinion that may
exist. A university will be making another
important contribution to a graduate's wellbeing if it can help him to acquire a sense
of humour that will enable him to laugh at
himself, if necessary. There is no more saving grace in the relationships we hold with
each other than that of a sense of humour.
96702-23J

I am convinced that these advantages I
have enumerated cannot be produced by
any system of education alone. They can
be added to in school and university,
but the foundation for these attributes is
laid in the home during the first six years
of a child's life. That is basic. The home
is where ideals are implanted in the young,
unfolding mind. There is where you get in
the wise home the first lessons in the importance of discipline, and it is in the very
early years when the value of truth and of
honesty in our dealings with one another
is implanted in the childish mind.
Honourable senators, will you pardon me
a personal allusion? As many of you know,
I grew up out on the hard-bitten prairies of
Western Canada, where my father was a
pioneer who settled in the rural district in
1881, when I was five years of age. You do
not have to do any mental arithmetic on
my age, because the newspapers publish it
every time I have a birthday.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is the only way we
would know it.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Our home was typical of
the homes in that Scottish frontier community. I am glad to say that there was
family worship in our home every morning,
When one contrasts the conditions of today
with what they were then, well, there is
no comparison at all. It was a stern life,
Some of our sociologists would weep bitter
tears if they had to endure some of the
experiences that our frontier people underwent. I had to quit summer school when I
was 12 years of age and I did not return to
school until I was 18. There was not the
same opportunity then for university education, but my parents instilled these ideas
into me. One of the books I read before I
was in my teens, a book that profoundly
influenced my life, was entitled My Schools
and Schoolmasters, or The Story of my
Education, by the very famous Scottish
geologist Hugb Miller. In his book the author
tells how he came from a very poor home
and lacked the advantages of an early education. He describes how he set about, assisted
by others who were willing to help him, to
acquire an education and a knowledge of the
world. That man later became one of the
most eminent geologists of his time.
I never like introducing personal allusions
and I would not have done so today except
I think it illustrates something I wanted to
express to the house. I say that that experience, hard as it may have been by today's
standards, gave me something which was of
inestimable value to me during my whole

SENATE

life. Perhaps at times I show too much impatience with those who wish to hurry along,
those who wish to have fine new university
buildings and all the paraphernalia and
equipment associated with them. But I would
say to them that if there is not the foundation in the student, if he has not got within
his own soul the desire to grow and expand
and learn, then one of the essential elements
in his success is lacking.
Our colleague from Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron) drew some comparisons between
Canada and Russia. I have no doubt that
in some ways we may be lagging a bit
behind countries like the United States,
which, after all, have had a hundred years
start on us. If in the next hundred years
-and none of us will be here to see it-we
make as much progress in the humanities
as Russia has made in material things, then
this will be a very blest country, indeed.
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: But coming back again
to Russia provokes some very interesting
reflections. If I understood the honourable
senator from Banff aright, there is little
doubt that in certain aspects of education
Russia has made very great progress. I
think, honourable senators, there is a reason
for that, which I should like to put before
this house. Russia's great progress bas been
in the broad field of the science of mathematics, the science having to do with the
development of atom bombs, hydrogen
bombs, these strange things called sputniks,
for which, may I say, I have very little
regard. But in the broad field of the science
of mathematics there is no ideology,
absolutely none. It is a well-known fact
that after the war the Russians grabbed the
Germany
had
which
rocket scientists
employed at their rocket base, or nearly all
of them. A few of them escaped to the
United States and helped to develop the
atomie and hydrogen bombs in that country.
Russia's own country was broken, devastated, and she took these German scientists
and gave them the best in the land-fine
houses, motorcars, and good salaries. Mathematical scientists, particularly, are more concerned with the development and study of
their science than with anything else. These
scientists laid the foundation for the development of the progress that Russia has made in
the whole field of mathematical science.
But what did they do in other fields? They
gave free rein to the scientists, but not to
the students of philosophy and of the
humanities, who, such as they have, are
obliged to toe the Marxist-Lenin line, so far
as ideology is concerned. They miss the
opportunity of development in those fields,

and therefore they have not access to the
progress made in other parts of the world in
this direction. Imagine what would happen
to a professor in a Russian university if he
got up some morning and lectured his class
on the merits of the democratic system of
government, as we understand it, or said
to his class, "I have been doing a great deal
of study and research, and I think that the
Sermon on the Mount provides tremendous
truths for the guidance of mankind." How
long would he last? He would be put out,
without question.
In my humble opinion-and perhaps I am
not qualified to judge-therein lies the
weakness of Russia. Sooner or later these
ideas must come to the surface. You cannot open the windows of the mind, even in
the science of mathematics, without an urge
and a yearning to have the windows opened
in respect to other things. Eventually this
influence in Russia will gather momentum
and force and, I am convinced, profoundly
influence the future of that country. That
may be some years away, and in the meantime we have to live with the Russians. My
plea this afternoon is for an understanding
of what education really means.
Honourable senators, I come to another
point, and this may find me at variance with
some of my colleagues, which is not an
unusual thing, sir, I can assure you.
I was impressed in another way with the
highly admirable address given by the
honourable senator from Banfl-with the
splendour, shall I say, of his plans for broader
university and educational development. It
was quite clear that a great deal of money
would be involved. That in itself should not
be a barrier. After I read that portion of
his speech I pondered, and I thought to myself, well, we are spending, for example, over
$400 million a year at the present time in
family allowances. What was the purpose of
family allowances? The great argument was
that they would assist parents to bring up
their children in the proper way. But was
there not a fallacy in that argument? If history has proven anything it is that money is
not the most essential thing in the training
of a child.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is very handy, though.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: It is not the most essential
thing; and when I reflected that family allowances were paid to families where the income
might be $25,000, up to, say, $50,000 a year,
I wondered if that were wise, and if we
could not use that $400 million a year to
better advantage. Of one thing I am convinced, that we have been starving our school
teachers and our university professors. I hope

DECEMBER 5, 1957
to say a word or two about that later on. 1
would like to see conditions evolved whereby
a young man or woman taking up the teaching profession as a career could expect to
live with a reasonable degree of comfort, and
to have a pension at the end of his term of
service to continue so to live.
That brings up the very interesting question of the relationship of the federal authority with the provincial authorities in
education. I am a convinced believer in the
federal system of Government in Canada.
The framers of our Constitution showed extraordinary wisdom when in the end they
came down with a federal system. It would
not have been possible to achieve Confederation at the time, as honourable senators
know, if the effort had been directed toward
a unitary state. But under the Constitution
certain things are left to the federal authority:
the control of a monetary system, trade and
commerce, tariffs, defence-in these broad
fields the central authority is pre-eminent.
But the Constitution leaves to the provinces,
and wisely so, the control of education.
Now, if the federal Government drifts into
the habit-or accepts the principle, if you
like-that it is part of the federal responsibility to assist in education, then I do think
it will bring some peril to the concept of the
Fathers of Confederation. That is not to say
that the federal Government should deny all
assistance.
I have always been troubled in my mind
about the developments in what are called
federal-provincial fiscal relations, concerning
which we had a conference in Ottawa a short
while ago. There is no doubt, and it is a
demonstrable fact, that the central provinces
do draw wealth from the outlying provinces,
a wealth which the outlying provinces cannot reach but which is earned in those provinces.
That is a condition which some
sensible means must be found to overcome.
Whether wisely or not, an arrangement was
made. Now, within that limitation, recognizing the essential rightness of that principle, I hold to this view, and it is not new
with me, that the conribution by the federal
authority to the provincial authorities should
be under that heading, and under that heading alone.
I dislike-nay more, I distrust-this business of mixing our federal and provincial
finances. We have the provinces coming here
and telling the federal authorities what they
need for roads, what they need for education,
and what they need for this, that and the
other thing. We have taken over in a
very large measure the responsibilities of
the provinces. For instance, the whole realm
of welfare was essentially the responsibility

of the provinces under the Constitution. But
that can be carried through, I think, without
impairment of the principle I am endeavouring to deal with. I would try to arrive at
some arrangement whereby one kind of payment was made, and out of that the provinces
had to do al their own financing.
I would hope further that as time goes on,
and as we accumulate wealth-and in the
natural order of things much of that wealth
would go to individuals because of their
superior skills and abilities-we would have
in Canada wealthy men who were willing to
give a portion of their wealth, at any rate at
their death, to some beneficent purpose by
way of a foundation. Nothing has been more
noted than the degree to which that has
been done in the United States, and it is a
custom we could well follow here.
This business of one government raising
money and giving it to another government
to spend is essentially unsound; it is
unsound in the very nature of it. The government that has the need to spend the
money should have the responsibility of raising it, subject to the qualification I mentioned a short time ago. In that way it
would be a little more prudent perhaps in
its spending, than if it felt it could come
to Ottawa next year with increased demands,
and under pressure probably get them.
These are very important matters. They
are not directly related to education, but they
are indirectly related to the motion moved by
the honourable senator from Banff. I say
that because a reading of his speech inclines
me to the view that he had in contemplation
that because the provinces could not meet
the increased demands for education, such
as extension of university facilities, residences
and so on, the federal authority should come
to the rescue. I dislike to differ with my
honourable friend, but on that point I am
bound to say, honourable senators, I am
"from Missouri".
Honourable senators, I have taken up more
time than I intended to take, but there is
no question of the value of a discussion on
the subject raised by the honourable senator
from Banff.
I do wish to say, as my last words today,
let us try to understand the importance of
education. Let us try to understand what
it means and of what it should consist. I
think it was the honourable senator from
Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) who in
his address the other day quoted a line from
Tennyson:
Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.

I place stress not necessarily on knowledge,
but on wisdom, which is the essential thing.

356

SENATE

The old Scottish folk had a homely expression to describe it when they called it "common sense". But wisdom is the essential
thing.
I do hope that out of the turmoils and
differences of opinions to which we give such
free rein and expression in Canada we
ultimately will learn wisdom. If there is
one lesson that has been impressed by all the
great thinkers of history from the time of the
Hebrew prophets down to the present time,
it is the importance in all human activities
of learning wisdom.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Kinley, the debate

Tuesday, December 10, 1957
The Senate met at 8 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers.
DIVORCE
REPORTS OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Divorce, presented
the committee's reports Nos. 189 to 192 and
moved that the said reports be taken into
consideration now.
The motion was agreed to.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
I now move that these reports be adopted. I
should point out that these are the last four
reports to come from the committee. I will
have the corresponding bills te present in a
few minutes and will ask for special consideration of thern. I will ask that these four
bills be read the first, second and third times
tonight, because our time in this session is
running out. This evening also I wish to
present the comnittee's final report of the
session, giving figures on the work that we
have done. But I have some remarks to make
prior to the presentation of the committee's
final report.
Once again it is my duty and pleasure to
report te the house at the close of the sittings
of the Senate Cornmittee on Divorce, and to
inform the house of the committee's work
and progress.
Honourable senators will recall that at the
last session we revised the rules of divorce,
making a number of very important changes.
It may be worth while te mention the more
important of these changes. They are as
follows:
1. The naming of and service of documents
upon every person with whom it is alleged
a matrimonial offence has been committed.
2. Setting out of the alleged matrimonial
offences fully and precisely in separate paragraphs, including, whenever possible, the
name and address of every persen with whom
a matrimonial offence is alleged te have been
committed, and omitting vague allegations
such as "at divers times and places".
3. Where the name or address of the corespondent is alleged te be unknown, a statement that every reasonable effort has been
made without success to ascertain the name
and address of such person, together with
particulars of the efforts which have in fact
been made,

4. Verification may now be made "in a
form valid in the jurisdiction in which it is
made" rather than, as in the past, under the
Canada Evidence Act only.
5. If the respondent or co-respondent desires to oppose the granting of the divorce
and to be heard by the committee, he or she
must now file and serve upon the solicitor
for the petitioner a concise statement of the
material facts upon which he or she relies in
answer to the petition.
6. Where the committee is of the opinion
that there has been an offence against the
Criminal Code of Canada or a violation of
any other law in force in Canada, they may
now direct that such evidence, or a part
thereof, be drawn to the attention of such
law-enforcement or other agency in Canada
as the committee may deem appropriate.
7. Provision has been made whereby every
witness summoned shall, at the time of
service, be tendered conduct money.
These are important changes. Honourable
senators who are not serving on the committee can hardly realize how important they
are. The new rules went into force on
September 1 of this year, and since that date
60 petitions have been presented to the
Committees Branch and are accordingly
subject to the new provisions.
Honourable senators will be interested to
know that of the 60 petitions presented, only
six petitioners made application to proceed
without naming and serving the co-respondent. The applications are supported by affidavit evidence as to lack of knowledge of
the name or location of the co-respondent,
and as to the efforts made to discover the
name or to serve the person. When the circumstances seem to justify a relaxing of this
rule, an order is made in the following or
similar terms:
Ordered that the petitioner be permitted to proceed to trial without naming or serving the
co-respondent, without prejudice to the right of the
committee to take such action at the hearing as
may seem appropriate.

That is to say, when the parties are before
the committee and the evidence is given viva
voce and recorded, the committee may waive
the rule and tell the petitioner that he must
serve the documents on the co-respondent if
he knows who he is.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Were the six applications granted?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Yes, all six were
granted and none was changed by the
committee when the evidence was heard.
Honourable senators, before I read the
formal report of the committee let me tell
you that in the short time that Parliament
has been sitting this session there has been

384

SENATE

held a total of 24 meetings of the main committee, and of course many more meetings
of subcommittees, where evidence is heard.
And let me express again my appreciation
of the industry and devotion of the working
members of this committee. It is an honour
and a privilege to be chairman of such a
group of men and women. I hope that you
will not be surprised when I tell you that
every one of the 300 odd reports we have
made to the house have been unanimous,
both in the subcommittees where the evidence was heard and in the general committee to whom the subcommittees report. There
has been no effort to bring about unanimity.
Such is the fruit of long experience, knowledge and wisdom of each individual member
that we just naturally think alike.
Because I firmly believe in giving credit
where credit is due, I have made a practice
in recent years of giving the names of the
working members of the committee and their
attendances. In this connection I bow, as
usual, to the Honourable Senators Golding
and Gershaw, each of whom attended 23 of
the 24 meetings. They take the prize.
Some Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is difficult to be
present at all times at an institution of this
kind which functions day in and day out for
most of the session.
I also bow to the Honourable Senator
Hodges-I am sorry she is not here this evening-who was present at 20 meetings; and
also to the Honourable Senator Fergussonand I am glad she is here-who was present
at no less than 19 meetings. Here, let me
pause to say how much I appreciate the
attendance of these women senators at the
meetings. One would think it was a distasteful job, but once I heard one of them
say, when some special reference was made
to the women on the committee, "Please don't
-I am just one of the members of the committee." They have acted as such, without
showing any special concern, or responding
in any way differently from the rest of us, but
nevertheless infusing into the hearings a certain indefinable something which has added
to the dignity and, I think, the wisdom and
carefulness, of our meetings.
Others who attended over 50 per cent of
the time, and some a good deal more, are
the Honourable Senator Smith (Queens-Shelburne), 17 meetings; and the Honourable
Senators Barbour, Howden, Hawkins, myself,
Kinley and Taylor (Westmorland). These
hold the best record of attendance.

However, attendance is not everything. I
have referred to attendance at the general
meetings, not at the subcommittees, and I
bow to my deskmate, the Honourable Senator Croll, who attended no less than 9
general meetings, and also presided at all
but two of the contested cases, of which there
were 30 notices given. To the hearing of
these contested cases he gave of his knowledge and wisdom. His special qualifications
made him a most acceptable and capable
chairman.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I express my gratitude
to him, for he volunteered to do that work
and to take the burden off my shoulders. We
were grateful to have an able lawyer as
chairman for the contested cases.
May I also make special honourable mention of the Honourable Senators Isnor,
Burchill, Cameron, Baird and Horner.
The senators I have named are the ones
who did the work. There are no less than
20 members on the committee, and in addition two ex offßcio members, the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) and the
(Hon. Mr.
Opposition
the
of
Leader
Macdonald). The honourable positions they
hold in the house entitle them to this recognition. They are not expected to attend the
committee's meetings; but to those who have
done the work, the credit which I have mentioned is due.
Honourable senators, since I am giving
credit where credit is due, permit me also to
mention the staff of the Committee Branch
for their good work, knowledge, care and
ability, which are responsible for the smooth
and efficient working of the committee's sysThe chief of that branch, who is
tem.
responsible for a great deal in connection
with this work, is Mr. Harvey Armstrong.
He has been a member of the branch for
37 years, and I need not say, honourable
senators, that he is thoroughly experienced
and, I may add, thoroughly capable of supervision of the work done by that branch.
It may not be known to all honourable
senators, but the Committees Branch prepares all cases, examines the proceedings,
checks to see that the rules are complied with
in respect of advertising, payment of fees,
proper service and proof thereof, and so on;
and, when the meetings of the committee
take place, certifies to the committee that all
the rules with regard to each petition being
heard have been duly observed. That is
responsible work.
In addition, the preparation of the cases,
the calling of them when they are ready for
hearing and listing of them for the days of

DECEMBER 10, 1957
meeting, is a very big piece of work. In that
connection, Mr. John Hinds, who is the
Assistant Chief Clerk of Committees, has
taken a most active and creditable part. He
is a thoroughly experienced officer, and has
been with us for no less than 12 years. Mr.
James MacDonald is clerk of No. 1 subcommittee, the committee in which I, when
I am there, sit as chairman. He has been with
us for 11 years. Let me say that as a
registrar of the court and one who handles
multifarious details, his work is outstanding.
Mr. Alfred Fortier, another member of the
staff, is clerk of No. 2 subcommittee. He has
been with us 10 years. Mr. Gerard Lemire
is clerk of No. 3 subcommittee. His experience is not so great, he having been with us
for only four years, but his ability is very
considerable.
I give honourable mention also to Mr.
George McIntosh, the crier and filing clerk,
who has been with us only a short time,
and to Mrs. Bertha Anderson, the stenographer in the Committees Branch office. I
do not know that all businessmen appreciate
as much as do lawyers the advantages of
having a competent stenographic staff in the
carrying on of the work of an office. To
Mrs. Anderson I tender the olive branch:
she has been doing excellent work.
Let me say a further word about the
staff. A great part of the routine hard
work of the committee is donc by the
Hansard reporters who report the evidence
day after day with remarkable concentration
and attention to detail. It is exhausting
work, and it is done with a great deal of care
and efficiency.
Mr. Basil Lake, as you
know, is chief of the Reporting Branch; Mr.
Graydon Hagen is senior reporter, and
Messrs. Shelton, Hubbard, Crockett and
Lawrence are the other reporters, all of
whom have been engaged in this task. I
should not fail to mention the young women
who type these long stories day after day
with a great deal of care and devotion.
Honourable
senators,

While this has been a short session, and
there has been a good deal of pressure on all
of us, every case that was ready to be heard
at the time we set for the closing of the hearings, was heard; no case that was ready for
hearing at that time was deferred. Each of the
134 petitions not disposed of is a case in
which some detail has not yet been completed,
in consequence of which the case goes over to
the next session.
Of the petitions recommended, 186 were
from petitioners domiciled in the province of
Quebec, and one from a petitioner domiciled
in the province of Newfoundland. I bow to
Senator Baird, from Newfoundland, who is
a member of the committee. I am pleased
to say that the work from that province is
very much less than it has been in previous
sessions.
Of the 186 petitioners domiciled in the
province of Quebec, 59 were husbands and
127 were wives. We may hear from the ladies
on that point. When I presented a similar
report on a previous occasion, an honourable
senator commented "The figures speak for
themselves."
The petitioner domiciled in the province of
Newfoundland was a wife.
Of the petitions heard, eight were opposed
at the hearing.
The committee met on 24 days and held a
total of 75 meetings. That takes into consideration the meetings of the subcommittees.
On eight days the committee functioned in
one section. On five days the committee functioned in two sections. On 11 days the conmittee functioned in three sections. I may say
there are really four subcommittees, but they
do not all meet at the same time. Three subcommittees have been hearing the non-contested cases, and the fourth subcommittee,
presided over by Senator Croll, usually sat
on days when the other subcommittees were
not sitting.
In seven cases when the petitioner pleaded
inability to pay the full parliamentary fee,
the committee recommended a partial remission. It is sometimes said that our committee

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Has the committee

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We always come to the

that fees be remitted, and then only in part,
never in whole. On each occasion when we
have so recommended, our report has been
approved by the Senate.
The fees paid to Parliament for bills of
divorce heard and recommended during this
second session of 1957 amounted to $38,475.
So it can be seen we did not remit all the

I have here statistics covering the number
of divorces granted in Canada in the years
1952 to 1956, both inclusive, and in 1957 for
Quebec and Newfoundland. I do not propose
to read all of this statement, but I might
point out that in Canada, in 1952, there
were 5,634 divorces and that number has
held fairly consistently through to 1956, the
last year for which we have full records,
when the number was 5,890. The same is
true in large measure of the provinces. In
the number of divorces Ontario led of course
with 2,366 last year, and British Columbia
followed with 1,502. With permission, I will
place the figures on Hansard:

Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I
suggest that this inquiry should be dropped.
The Government notified the House of Commons on Friday that it had no complete
report at all on this matter and as to what
they did have it was not in the public interest that it be produced or tabled in the
House of Commons. The same answer would

Who, in Canada, are officially entitled to be called
"His Excellency"?

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
have the following answer to the honourable
gentleman's inquiry:
The persons residing in Canada who are generally
accorded the title Excellency in official usage are:
The Governor General of Canada or The
Administrator of the Government of Canada;
Ambassadors, High Commissioners and Ministers
Plenipotentiary of other countries accredited
In Canada;
The Apostolie Delegate to Canada.
It has been customary in the past to accord, by
courtesy, the title Excellency to the wife of the
Governor General.
In ecclesiastical usage the title Excellency is
accorded to Archbishops and Bishops of the Roman
Catholic Church.

SPEECH FROM THE THRONE
ADDRESS

IN REPLY ADOPTED

The Senate resumed from Wednesday,
December 4, consideration of Her Majesty the
Queen's Speech at the opening of the session
and the motion of Hon. Mr. White, seconded
by Hon. Mr. Méthot for an Address in reply
thereto.
Hon. Gustave Monette: Honourable senators, on this my first occasion of rising in the
debate on a Speech from the Throne my mind
is still deeply impressed by the exceptional
and may I say, historical, event, when Her
Majesty the Queen of Canada, in person,
graciously came from the heart of the community of British nations to open, for the
first time, our Canadian Parliament. Those
of us who, on that memorable day, were just

born as members of this house and integrated
as such into the very structure of our Parliamentary system, cannot but feel, and I believe
all honourable senators do feel, that this
royal accomplishment was a great blessing
of which we should endeavour to remain
worthy.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Monette: For indeed, the event
is of a great momentous significance. This
official act of Queen Elizabeth II in coming
and opening herself our Parliament has
brought us ta a closer and more vivid realization and understanding of what the Crown
means in our Parliamentary institutions. The
idea of a monarch presiding and, therefore,
dominating by majesty and dignity, a democratic Parliament, where the policies and
destinies of a nation are framed through free
debate, and ultimately resolved for action,
has not evolved nor has it been maintained
without criticism. But allow me, honourable
senators, to speak my mind. Never was I
more convinced than I am at this time-and
I was already convinced long before-that
the Crown, in our system, far from being
just a preservation for the sake only of tradition, politeness, or even vanity, of a mere
sign of the past, is in reality a true symbol
and an always fertile stimulant for us ever
to maintain, in the necessary impact of our
singular and sometimes serious divergencies,
a paramount aspiration for national unity.
From our feelings of pride as well as
emotion, all of us at the time realized what
distinct features of grandeur, dignity and
self-respect, as well as of common devotion
to our state, the hereditary, and therefore
non-partisan, royal authority is maintaining
in our debates, in our divisions, and even in
our strong and definite party platform
determinations, honest and legitimate as they
may be. When our Monarch represents
Canada in other countries-as it occurred
lately for Her Majesty to visit, as Queen of
Canada, the great neighbouring republic of
the south-we all feel, as we truly did feel,
that our august representative was voicing
the good wishes and hearty feelings of all
Canadians, irrespective of creed, religion,
language or party differences.
To royalty, mingling in a free parliamentary régime an ever-present and discreet
appeal to unity and grandeur, I have long
given, as I do now, the assent of my mind
as well as of my heart. This is the more true
when, as on this last occasion, the majesty
of the Queen appeared environed, not only
with dignity, but also, in a most sympathetic
demeanour, with the charm and grace
family
and

atmosphere. In spite of criticisms that we

SENATE

have heard of, though not coming from our
country, we have experienced an event
which clearly demonstrated the possibility of
a Queen behaving with a most natural and
cordial feminine smile and countenance,
though, at the same time, reflecting all the
majesty expected from a Sovereign acting
in the performance of ber so important
functions, within Parliament as well as
throughout the Canadian territory which it
was made possible for ber to visit.
Honourable senators, let us continue, as
usual, to pray in this house for our Queen,
Elizabeth II, and the royal family.
Now I believe it is my duty, honourable
senators, to give you a word of introduction
about myself. Since 1911 I have been simply
exercising my profession as a barrister and
solicitor. My legal studies I performed at
the Montreal branch of Laval University,
which branch bas since evolved to the present
status of the independent University of
Montreal. As to college instruction, preparatory to university's attainment, it was in
the form of a classical course, which I followed and completed at the College or
Seminary of Ste. Thérèse de Blainville, in
the county of Terrebonne, one of the component parts of the senatorial division of
Mille Isles, which I have the honour to represent.
However, my primary education,
that which was my first inspiration and
stimulant to try to do my best in life, I
received from my parents, at home, and from
a modest but very noble and devoted woman
country teacher in the very heart of the
farming district in the county of Laprairie.
That is where and how, under the continued
attention and moderate severity of my father,
I was definitely impressed, in my heart and
mind, to try to become an honest and useful
citizen.
Last week, honourable senators, I was
deeply moved when listening, very keenly
indeed, to the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar). While elaborating on the essential features of education, he
was stressing the paramount importance of
the examples of honesty and discipline that
one can receive, as he himself was fortunate
enough to receive, and be definitely marked
with, in the elevating atmosphere of such a
bome, more especially, as I am sure be
meant, in the noble and fertile profession of
cultivating the soil.
Surely Virgilius, whom Emperor Augustus
had asked to glorify the virtues of the simple
farm life, in an effort at reforming the morals
and the whole social fabric of the Roman
Empire, was, in three words, referring to the
inspiring family atmosphere of such farms as
the honourable senator has given us to appreciate: Potens ubere glebae.

In referring to the senatorial division of
Mille Isles, I wish to render homage to my
predecessor, the late Honourable Senator
Armand Daigle. While until his death he
was the Senator for Mille Isles, be used to
live close to me at the summer resort of
Laval-sur-le-Lac, just separated by the river
of Mille Isles from his senatorial division
of the same name. He was the husband
of a very noble and discreet wife, and the
father of a large and sympathetic family.
An industrious and distinguished citizen himself, he was always loyal to his many friends,
to his political association, to his province
and country. He was a discreet example
of honesty, a model citizen whom one is
happy to try and follow. To his wife and
family I offer my sympathy and admiration.
It is now my great pleasure to thank
honourable senators most sincerely for the
courtesy extended to me from the first day
I came to this house, and which has been
continued to this time. I have appreciated, in
private conversations, honourable senators,
your very good words of welcome, and on
all occasions, whether in this bouse or outside, the assistance generously given. I know
that it is our duty firmly to offer criticism
of opinions expressed in this house, as the
occasion may appear to warrant, and to defend one's own principles with conviction
and courage; yet I find the atmosphere of
this house to be serene and not unduly
partisan, and this to a much greater extent
than I had expected. I found that we all
could here, in honest and firm debate, endeavour to adequately scrutinize legislation
originating in our house or brought to us
from the Commons, suggest substantial modifications as to wording or substance, and
also challenge, perhaps, the principles underlying any proposed legislation. Above all, I
realize that in all our honest endeavours we
are preserving among ourselves a sense of
fairness and mutual respect.
Mr. Speaker, may I offer you my congratulations upon your appointment to the high
position you now occupy and the noble
functions you are now called upon to exercise. Not only, your Honour, do you discharge
your duties with determination, clarity and
grace, but you have already made it plain
that your impartiality is at the level of what
honourable senators on both sides are expecting from you in the pursuance of their
constitutional right to free speech and debate.
To my beloved and so honest-meaning
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Haig), I offer
my thanks for his indefatigable assistance
to me, and to all of us. His constant efforts
are aimed sincerely at his being fair to every
senator, and in respect to any matter.

Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.

Hon. Mr. Monette: Honourable senators, I
should like to say a few words in reference
to the honourable senator from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler). When taking part in the
debate on the Address in reply to the Speech
from the Throne on November 20 he referred
in particular to the policy and manner of approaching the question of international relations, especially in our dealings with Russia
and the Communist nations. With the permission of the house I should like to take the
time to quote his remarks rather extensively.
He said:
I shal take the liberty of quoting from a. speech
which I made last year. I stated then that in the
last few years two events of tremendous international importance had taken place. The one, of
course, was the invention of the atomic bomblater, of the hydrogen bomb-and now, and still
more important, of the guided intercontinental
missile.
I do not know how powerful this last
weapon may prove to be, but certainly it has put
the fear of God into the United States and other
nations. The second important event was the

event there had been, apparently, an entire reversai of policy on the part of the Russians. I
said:
"Since the reversai of Stalin's policy the attempts
of these leaders
The Russians"to come to improved relations with the West
appear to be sincere. I am bold enough to say
that we cannot afford to ignore these attempts
and we should go half way to meet them. Keep
your powder dry if you must, but let us use every
opportunity of trying to remove the friction that

from what we hear there are just two courses
open to us: we have got to live with these people
or destroy them and be destroyed ourselves. My
thought is that this Government should do what it
can to bring about a meeting such as bas been
suggested, even if this suggestion does come from
Russia.
I will conclude my remarks by quoting from what
I said last year in this bouse:
"Anything we can do, either through trade or
in some other way, to replace international friction
by good will, to remove the threat of war and
restore to our people a sense of security,"which they have not had for two generations now"will certainly be in the best interest of Canada
and of the whole world."

Honourable senators, those were very
important words. I consider them to be very
sound and I have no hesitation in declaring
that I share the honourable senator's way of
expressing what ought to be done at the
present time with respect to international
affairs. The honourable senator from Waterloo
might have been pleased to read lately that
the present Minister of External Affairs, the
Honourable Mr. Smith, said that it seemed to
him we should not always answer "No" to
proposals made from Russia. I cannot say
what the new minister has in mind for further elaboration on that; be it sufficient to
say that since he appears to be pretty much
of one mind with his predecessor as to
Canada's foreign policy, he appears himself
to be willing to scrutinize perhaps more than
has been done in the past the possibilities of
coming to an understanding with Russia. I

SENATE
think we should leave him to elaborate on
his policy, but we can express our gratitude
for the meeting of minds on the two sides
of this Government and Parliament with
respect to foreign affairs.
Honourable senators, I would like to say
a word concerning the honourable senator
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck).
First, I compliment him, and through him,
his committee, upon the splendid work they
have done. I do not speak on the advisability
of having divorces; but since the system
exists it is necessary to cope with the situation of the increasing number of petitions for
the relief of unhappy married couples. I note
that the job is well attended to. The report
that was presented today impressed all senators to a great extent, and myself particularly.
I congratulate the honourable gentleman upon
the clarity of his exposé, and upon the results
achieved by the indefatigable work of both
himself and his associates.
Yet-and perhaps I arn wrong-I would
like to express a little reproach at the words
spoken the other day by the honourable senator when he was referring to the number
of unemployed. As recorded in Han.sard on
page 287, be said:
Did I understand the honourable Leader of the
Governinent to say it was expected that we would
have 50,000 unemployed people in Canada this
winter?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: 250,000.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is a national disaster.
Regardless of what Government is in power, to
have 250,000 persons unemployed is a most undesirable situation. I know we have always expected
such a situation when a Conservative Government
was in office, . . .

I stop there.
Some Hon. Senators: Oh, oh.
Hon. Mr. Monelle: Perhaps many senators
on both sides know that indeed such situations develop. If I may be permitted to paraphrase the honourable senator's remarks, I
would suggest that with a little time for
previous reflection he might rather have said:
"I know I have always expected such a situation, when the economic conditions of Canada
were such, as before the last elections, that
the people of the country felt they had better
choose a new administration to act as a
receiver, in order to prevent the nation's
economy from going on the rocks-while
there is yet time".
And if my honourable friend has read a
number of commentaries in the Toronto Telegram on the policy of tight money, which was
not a creation of the Conservative party, he
will realize that the tight money policy has
already been responsible to a large degree for
the decline in our economie situation, and
has caused a great change of opinion in the
country.

Honourable senators, I come now to a
question of great importance, that is, freedom
of religion and worship, on which a decision
was brought down lately in the Supreme
Court of Canada. This question was raised
in very able terms, and in very sincere
accents, by the honourable senator from De
la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot). At the
moment it is not my purpose to add to his
criticism of the Supreme Court of Canada. In
fact, I do not want to criticize, for reasons
that I shall try to elaborate. The matter that
was before the Supreme Court of Canada was
a very difficult one, and extremely complex.
The judgment took up 90 pages in the
Supreme Court Reports. The full court of
nine judges sat. All the judges wrote notes,
except two. In those notes we see the comphexity of the case, the number of legal
sources to be considered before the judges
could arrive honestly, as they did, at their
individual conclusions. The court's decision
was five to four. The very learned, honest
and qualified jurists on both sides also gave
their divided opinion on many incidental
issues, connected with the only point that
they determined by a majority of five to four.
1-lonourable senators, there are to my
knowledge some other cases bearing somewhat on the same question which are still
pending to be heard and decided by the
Supreme Court of Canada. It is true that the
case which was decided is no longer sub
judice. But some aspects of the main question are still before the court in other cases
yet to be decided, and, as honourable senators may see in a moment, some other
solution for other cases may be forthcoming.
Therefore, although I realize that in anything I say in this regard I have immunity,
as a senator, there is no advantage in discussing that further. We have a court of
great credit and ability, of which we should
all be proud. And though it be divided on
important matters, it is nevertheless a body
which does not deserve criticism that is too
loud or too strong. If I had to give an
example of a judicial forum where there is
division, among the highest courts, it would
be in the United Kingdom, namely, in the
House of Lords, the highest court of that
land. That so renowned final Court of England has decided a number of great questions,
and its members write their notes, which
very often reveal definite divergence, both
of reasoning and of conclusion.
The Privy Council, however, does not show
dissidence by judges. That is not because
the judges fall easily into common accord,
but rather because the Privy Council, being
an institution by itself, consisting of Privy
Councillors who are sworn in to hear cases
and deliver judgment in th name of Her
Majesty, could not divide themselves and

DECEMBER 10, 1957
show the Sovereign as being divided against
herself. So the members of the Privy Council
are always unanimous in their judgments.
The House of Lords is just as important
as any other court in the world, but the
judges are free to express different opinions.
Nevertheless the majority decision is respected. The same situation obtains with
respect to the Supreme Court of the United
States, which hears very difficult cases that
are important to the life of that country.
issues, connected with the only point that
There again, the rule is the majority decision
of the highest tribunal, and such decision
becomes the law on the point raised in each
case.
Honourable senators, no democratic country can be really great unless justice is administered by men who are respected by all.
The Government seeks out and finds those
men whom they believe are best qualified,
the men whom they believe have the best
legal minds in the country, and appoint them
to the highest court. Once that court has
made a decision, we must bow to it.
It is of course true that the Senate, as one
of the Houses of Parliament, has the right
to scrutinize decisions of our Supreme Court.
But we must not indulge in violent criticism.
I do not for a moment suggest that the honourable senator from De la Durantaye was
expressing such extreme criticism. I am just
expressing a general opinion. The Senate
has the right, after close scrutiny of a decision of the court, to recommend action. But
whatever action should be recommended, certainly, it should not be that a judgment be
reversed, for we do not have power to do that.
We might offer some remedy for a situation
by amending the law in respect to a particular
subject, if we felt it should be amended. But
it would serve no purpose in the interests
of justice to persist in debating a decision
of our own Supreme Court, which is the final
court, while there are other similar cases
sub judice.
Therefore, honourable senators, with all
due respect to the senator from De la Durantaye-and I have great respect for him, and
for other honourable senators who have
debated this question to a moderate extent
-I would suggest that as early as possible
we close the debate on this subject, unless it
is felt that we can off er some measure of
remedy, without criticizing the court.
Therefore, if you will allow me, I would
only make some observations on the many
difficulties involved in the question which has
been raised, and the diverse points of view
that have been expressed, without bringing
any disrespect on our highest court, but
rather with a view to helping us to understand the situation better and have greater
admiration and respect for the court.

The case in question arose out of a municipal bylaw of the City of Quebec prohibiting
anyone from doing anything that would have
the tendency to, or the effect of, denying the
right of full freedom of religion and worship
to anyone. But the bylaw provides one exception to such freedom. In this connection I
should like to read the bylaw, which is in
broad terms and appears in (1953) Supreme
Court Reports at page 365, where the decision
is reported in full. The bylaw reads:
It is ordained and enacted . . . It is by the
present by-law forbidden to distribute in the
streets of the City of Quebec any book, pamphlet,
booklet, circular, tract whatever without having
previously obtained for so doing the written permission of the Chief of Police.

Let us stop there. This municipal bylaw
prohibited the circulation and distribution of
papers without first having obtained permission from the Chief of Police of the city concerned. Let us examine

on what authority

that bylaw was passed. It was based, as was
explained in the case, on an article, or rather
a number of articles, of the Cities and Towns
Act of the province of Quebec. This argument
was put forward by one side, and was not
very strongly disputed by the other side. But
that is not the point at issue. It was claimed
that the municipalities had the right to enact
such a bylaw to prohibit distributions of that
kind without proper authority first having
been received, whether from the City Clerk
or from the Chief of Police. It was said that
the Chief of Police perhaps was not qualified
to determine the propriety of any particular
paper or document to be distributed on the
street. But that is not the point for the
moment.
Going a bit further as to the source of the
bylaw, which was based on the Cities and
Towns Act, the latter being part of the laws
of the Province of Quebec, it was propounded
by four judges that this provincial law derived its authority from section 92 of the
British North America Act, paragraph 13,
which says that the provinces have the exclusive right of legislation in matters of property and civil rights in the province. That
point was challenged by the opposing parties,
and also by some of the honourable judges,
who were divided on it-that is, divided
fairly and honestly.
This law of the province of Quebec, permitting the municipality to enact such a bylaw, was based not only on section 92 of the
B.N.A. Act. Indeed, as I shall try to explain,
it could be said that it was not based at all
on the B.N.A. Act, because Chapter 307 of the
Statutes of Quebec prohibits any municipality
in the province from attempting to counteract
the freedom of religion and worship of any
citizen of any religion.
That statute made an exception, and I am
referring now to section 2, Chapter 307 of
the Revised Statutes, 1941, and to the bylaw,

What does that mean? It means that the
Confederation does not exist for these laws;
that these laws shall continue to exist as
having been existent in the separate colonies
at the time they were independent one from
the other, and therefore shall continue to
exist in the province of Quebec and in the
province of Ontario, as it is said, "as if the
Union"-that is, Confederation-"had not
been made".
If we were to stop here, there would be no
case at all for those who contend that the
statute of Quebec, which is the reproduction
of the anterior law of 1852 in force in Lower
Canada at the time, had ceased to exist. The
absolute, constitutional validity of that Quebec statute about freedom of religion and
freedom of worship could not be questioned
at all. This proposition is subject to an
exception. And let us go further. Section 129
of the B.N.A. Act goes on:

The next words, which are within brackets,
are not important at the moment; leaving
them out, section 129 would read:
.

nevertheless to be repealed, abolished, or altered
by the Parliament of Canada, or by the Legislature
of the respective Province, according to the
Authority of the Parliament or of that Legislature
under this Act.

Therefore, after Confederation, either the
Parliament of Canada, if it had authority,
or the provinces themselves, if they had
authority, had the power to modify those
laws. And so we come to the question as to
which of these authorities has the right to
modify the laws which existed in Quebec
before Confederation. The question does not
present itself in the present case, for the
Parliament of Canada has never modified,
altered or revoked this statute of 1852 which
was passed under the Parliament of the
Union. It is recognized by everybody. It
was made plain in Court. Therefore, this
law that existed in both Ontario and Quebec
before Confederation continues in existence
in Quebec by virtue of section 129 of the
B.N.A. Act, and it can be defeated only by
an amendment made by the Legislature of
Quebec or the Parliament of Canada, whichever has jurisdiction to amend those laws.
The question has never been raised as to
whether the federal Parliament or the Legislature has jurisdiction, for nobody has sought
to amend the statute. No law has been passed
by the Parliament of Canada to amend, modify
or repeal that legislation, and it will continue
in force unless amended by the proper
authority.
The province of Quebec reproduced verbatim in its own statutes this statute that existed

under the union of both provinces in Canada.
The province of Ontario did the same thing.
Some honourable senators thought that the
honourable senator from De la Durantaye
(Hon. Mr. Pouliot) said that the law had been
abolished by Ontario. He did not say that.
He said the act was reproduced for some time
in the Revised Statutes of Ontario and later
omitted. But Ontario did not pass any act
that would abolish or modify it at all. So the
law still exists in the statutes of Ontario.
It was not reproduced in subsequent revisions;
but there was no legislation to state that the
non-reproduction was caused by the fact that
the Ontario Legislature wanted to abolish it.
So, it is still the law of Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I did not use the word
"abolish". I said "dropped".
Hon. Mr. Monette: Perhaps the word
"dropped" is a better one, but I should think
"omitted" would mean the same thing. However, the constitutional question of the continued validity of the statute that existed in
Upper and Lower Canada at the time of Union
cannot be challenged at the moment. It is still
the law. It was not modified, abolished,
dropped or in any way tampered with. It is
still the law of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are you making that
statement in accordance with the judgment?
Hon. Mr. Monette: No, I am making it in
accordance with certain propositions that
were made and discussed. This is not the
gist of the judgment. This was advanced by
some judges and it was made clear, especially
by the Chief Justice at that time. It was
challenged by other judges. Ultimately that
point, as many other points discussed in the
judgment, remain to be considered as obiter
dicta, that is, as not bearing essentially on the
determination of the judgment, since the
decision determined a majority judgment
only on one point, as I am going to show in
a moment.
This avoids the necessity of elaborating on
subsection 13 of section 92 of the B.N.A. Act.
It may be argued that neither section 91 nor
section 92 has any bearing on the validity
or constitutionality of the Quebec statute,
Chapter 307, reproducing the act of 1852, for
it was continued under the Confederation
Act, section 129, and it was never modified.
In concluding my discussion of this subject
may I say that the judges have quoted
authorities from the Supreme Court in many,
many cases which bear more or less closely
on the subject, depending on opposite views.
They have quoted very important authorities
from England, but not based, it was argued,
on the statute that Confederation preserved
for Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia.

DECEMBER 10, 1957
I wish to summarize now and try to show
what was the gist of the decision of the
Supreme Court, notwithstanding these diverse
opinions, quotations and authorities. There
were many points discussed but one point
only was determined by the majority judgment. It is to be found at page 299 of volume
II of the Supreme Court Reports, 1953.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Before
the honourable gentleman proceeds, may I
ask him if he says that the statute of 1852,
which was passed in Quebec by the Legislature empowered to pass that statute, has ever
been reviewed by the courts to determine
whether it is now intra vires the Legislature
of Quebec? Has it ever come before the
courts?
Hon. Mr. Monette: That is not my impression. I may be wrong, since when one denies
that something was done the denial is not
as strong as an affirmative of something
which he knows to exist. As far as I know
it has never been decided that there was an
amendment made by the federal Parliament
to this previous statute of the Union; and it
has never been decided, according to my
information, that the statute in questionwhich in the absence of such amending legislation by the Parliament of Canada or of the
provinces would remain the law of Quebec
and Ontario as fully as if Confederation had
never existed-could be amended by the
Parliament of Canada and not by the
Legislature.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: May I be permitted to
say to the honourable senator that Mr. Justice
Kellock in his notes said that it was the first
time that that statute was brought before the
Supreme Court of Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I think I can help my
honourable friend by reading from the notes
of Mr. Justice Kellock. This is what he said:
I have not overlooked that the Legislatures of
Ontario and Quebec have since Confederation purported to re-enact the statute of 1852. The question
of the competency of this legislation has, however,
so far as I am aware, not been previously judicially
considered.

Hon. Mr. Monette: I thank the honourable

senators for this information. But what I
said in answer to the honourable senator from
Ottawa West (Hon. Mr. Connolly) was that
to my mind it was not challenged by any decision of our Supreme Court of Canada. Obiter
dicta, opinions of a judge during a hearing,
demanding respect as they do, are not
judgments.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): It was
never in direct issue.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I had decided not to
refer to the judges by name, but since one
of the judges was named, I may say this: I

have high esteem for him, for he is one of
the most eminent judges in Canada. Yet he
is human-he may be wrong or he may be
right, and I am not determining who is right
or wrong.
Honourable senators, if I may proceed
further, I wish to try and explain the gist of
that decision and to impress upon you that
this decision was only on one point, which
was a point of interpretation of the bylaw
of the City of Quebec. The majority decision was not on any other topic, but five of
the judges were in agreement on that point,
as against four who were dissident. The
Saumur case, at 299 says:
Held: (reversing the decision appealed from),

The decision was from the Court of King's
Bench in the province of Quebec.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: Was the court in Quebec
unanimous?
Hon. Mr. Monette: No; there was one
dissent.
Held: . . . that the bylaw did not extend so as
to prohibit the appellant as a member of Jehovah's
Witnesses from distributing in the streets of the
City any of the writings included in the exhibits
and that the City, its officers and agents be
restrained from in any way interfering with such
distribution.

So the decision was one of interpretation, not
one of constitutional validity. The decision
was one of interpreting a bylaw. It did
it in a way so as not to prohibit a class of
people like Jehovah's Witnesses from distributing those so-called religious tracts and
papers in the city of Quebec. Mr. Justice
Kerwin, as he then was, ranked with the
majority decision, and he elaborated on the
subject. I will read what he said, at page 321:
Whether or not such legislation be taken to
supersede the pre-Confederation enactrnent, no
statutes such as the Quebec City Charter, in the
general termos in which they are expressed, and
whenever originally enacted, have the effect of
abrogating the specific terms of the enactment
providing for freedom of worship.
It appears from the material filed on behalf of
the appellant that Jehovah's Witnesses not only do
not consider themselves as belonging to a religion
but vehemently attack anything that may ordinarily
be so termed but in my view they are entitled to
"the free exercise and enjoyment of (their)
Religious Profession and Worship". The Witnesses
attempt to spread their views by way of the
printed and the written word as well as orally and
state that such attempts are a part of their belief.

Of course their tracts were not only against
the Catholie church; and they were in really
violent terms, I might say, if anyone will
read the evidence in the case. The judgment
goes on to say:
Their attacks on religion generally, or on one in
particular, do not bring them within the exception
"so as the same be not made an excuse for
licentiousness or a justification of practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of the Province".

So that is the gist of the judgment. This
was the decision of five judges out of nine.

SENATE

Mr. Justice Kerwin was one of the five, and
his pronouncement served as the basis of
the one-point decision, that the tracts and
papers that were distributed by these people
attacking not only the Catholie religion, but
other religions, did not constitute licentiousness nor a practice inconsistent with the
peace and safety of the province. It will be
found in the summary of the decision that
two or three judges, or one judge alone,
expressed opinions on broader questions,
such as the constitutionality of the Quebec
Act and so on, but none of those propositions
are determined as a judgment by a majority
of five. The five who decided did so only
on that point which I have mentioned.
Honourable senators, in conclusion, I do
not change my mind in respect of my analysis
of the conflicting views expressed by the
honourable Justices in the case. I have my
views, but I hold them with some concern,
because it has happened to me, and to many
lawyers more learned than I am, that my
views have not always been affirmed by the
judgments or decisions of the courts. I am
not giving my opinion, nor criticizing. I can
only say that divergence of opinions of very
honest and learned judges is very frequent
and very normal indeed, and that in many
cases, important as they may be, with very
complex points, conclusions are bound to vary
at times, even in the highest courts of the
land, as they varied in this case. It is nevertheless necessary, for the purposes of good
government of a country, that our courts be
stable and our justices have authority. Where
a judge happens to be in error in a judgment,
there are remedies by way of appeal to correct such an error. But when a decision is
made by our highest court, it should be final.
A late respected confrère of mine, Aimé
Geoffrion, often said to me: "I may have my
own opinion, and I may be right in my own
mind, but once the majority of the highest
court has given its judgment, that is the law,
regardless of what I thought it was."
May I once again, honourable senators,
beg of you, out of decency and respect for
the authority of the highest court in our
land, and for the maintenance of the well
deserved credit of all the judges who sit on
that court, that, as far as possible, we refrain
from further discussing this case. Certainly
we should refrain from discussing it when
there are parallel cases still undecided.
I thank you, honourable senators, for
your kind attention and for your courtesy
in listening to a lengthy and tiresome speech
on a complex and tedious problem of law.

to it and I hope that my honourable friends
are not offended because I said that none of
us is a doctor of divinity or a theologian.
But now, honourable senators, I have some
other remarks to make. The effect of my
modest speeches must have been tremendous,
because the honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) said that I have
stirred him up sufficiently. And the case of
the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon.
Mr. Hugessen) was worse. He said that my
speech had somewhat struck and somewhat
perturbed him. I never thought that by
speaking quietly and in a mild manner about
legal issues I could create such a commotion
in the minds of any one of my honourable
colleagues.
I also have another correction. It is that my
honourable friend the senator from TorontoTrinity said, as reported at page 302 of
Hansard, in the second column:
In my opinion a criticism of the Supreme Court
of Canada in this chamber takes on certain
importance.

I did not criticize the court, I criticized
some opinions-rather opinions than judgments-but I reserved my judgment to use
the sacramental word about the court itself.
But on the other hand my honourable friend,
the senator from Toronto-Trinity followed the
illustrious example of our late leader, Mr.
Mackenzie King, in arguing both sides at the
same time, for although he differed from me
be supported my argument, and I will prove
it to the honourable gentleman, although I
did not go as far as be did. I did not criticize
the court, I criticized the opinions of judges.
In the same column he says:
I have no criticism of a senator's action in
criticizing the court, if in that senator's opinion
the public interest is to be served by so doing.

And following again our late leader's
illustrious example he said, as reported on
page 305:
With my friend's admonition to the Supreme Court
of Canada to be very careful in constitutional
matters I heartily agree . . .

I thank my honourable friend for his sup-

port, which I deeply appreciate. After he
had enunciated those principles I cannot see
why he was stirred up by some remarks I
made about legal opinions of others.
I have another correction which I wish to
make. The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity said:
My honourable friend says that religious liberty is
a matter of civil rights, under section 92 of the
British North America Act, paragraph 13, which
reads:
"Property and Civil Rights in the Province."

I never said so. My argument was that
the rights of the province in the matter of
religious freedom were in virtue of section
129 of the British North America Act. What
surprised me was that another distinguished
member of the legal fraternity who has an
outstanding reputation, the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr. Hugessen),
said the same thing. I am not going to insist
any more about it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I interrupt my
honourable friend? I see at page 272 that
my honourable friend said this:
I have put that case before Parliament to establish
that the freedom of religion is a highly personal
and civil right which belongs exclusively to provincial jurisdiction.

By that I understood my friend to mean
that in his view religious freedom was a
provincial matter which came under section
92 of the British North America Act.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Well now, honourable
senators, you see my friend took it for
granted, but I never said it, which is entirely
different, and I do not want anybody to
speak on my behalf. I do not know the
whole corpus juris by heart, but when I
speak on a question of law I try to have my
feet solidly on the ground, and to show my
honourable colleagues that I have learned
enough to know my onions. I would be
thankful if my honourable friends would
read what I have said, quietly, near the fireplace, smoking a cigar. They will perhaps
not enjoy that reading, but gradually they
will have the conviction that there is another
issue, and that perhaps one was right against
the opinion, not of nine, but of five judges.
If we come to the argument that nine judges
can do better than one modest country
lawyer, it means the rule of numbers; it
means that nine men know more than one
man. There is a principle of philosophy
about it, but there are exceptions. I say to
my honourable friend from Toronto-Trinity,
if it is the number that counts, who was
right when be, as Attorney General of
Ontario, discharged 10,000 justices of the
peace by a stroke of the pen? Was be
right or were the ten thousand right?
May I conclude what I was saying when I
was interrupted by my honourable friend, my
learned and friendly confrère from Inkerman
(Hon. Mr. Hugessen)? I am imbued with the
Christmas spirit. I have not yet made any
Christmas gift this year but I will make two
now, one to each one of my distinguished
colleagues. And if they find that the consolidation of the Ontario Statutes in 1902 is
contentious-if they consider that what happened 55 years ago, when we were all youngsters and when some of us were probably not

DECEMBER 11, 1957

yet born, is contentious-I hope that what
I will send them will not be found any
longer controversial, because it relates to what
happened more than a century ago, in 1852,
105 years ago.

EDUCATION
NECESSITY TO MOBILIZE AND EXPAND
EDUCATIONAL RESOURCESDEBATE CONTINUED

The Senate resumed from Thursday, December 5, the adjourned debate on the inquiry
of Hon. Mr. Cameron drawing the attention of
the Senate to
the necessity for Canada to mobilize and expand
the educational resources of the nation with a
view to maintaining and strengthening her position
as a member of the world community.

Hon. John J. Kinley: Honourable senators,
may I take this first favourable opportunity
to congratulate the Honourable the Speaker
upon his appointment as Speaker of the
Senate.
We first saw you, Your Honour, in action
on that historie and brilliant occasion when
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II visited Canada and for the first time the Parliament of
Canada was opened by the Sovereign in
person. Although that event must have been
quite a trial for you as a new member of
this chamber, I was glad to see that you
seemed to be at ease you carried on with
grace, and you finished the day without a
f ault.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: We thought you looked
good on that occasion. Since that time, having
seen you here, we know what you can do,
we know that you are good, and we are
pleased to have you as our Speaker. I hope
you will be happy in your service. I believe
you will guard carefully the privileges and
the honour of the Senate, and I am sure that
in doing so you will have the co-operation of
every member of this body.
Honourable senators, I am going to talk
on education. That is a wide subject, and
I believe that if I say a little about ourselves I shall remain within the rules of
the bouse.
First, I am most pleased to hear that that
veteran of this chamber the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine), who
while on a mission for the Government became seriously ill in India, is now on his
way home, partly restored to health. I am

glad also to see my old friend the honourable
senator from Algoma (Hon. Mr. Farquhar),
who has come back to us after his illness.
It is a pleasure also to extend congratulations to those honourable senators who have
joined us since the election. They have
already shown that they are going to be good
and valuable members. The Liberal Government was friendly toward the Senate and left
the portals open, and as a result we now
have a Conservative delegation that is worth
while. Their leader (Hon. Mr. Haig) must
be proud to have so many excellent men
behind him.
The party to which I am attached was in
power for 22 years. That is a long time.
Naturally there was criticism; some people
chafed at what they believed was too large
a representation of Liberals in this house.
However, the Government has changed, and
I think we shall have fairer winds from
now on.
Members of the Senate sometimes are
criticized on the ground that the tenure of
our appointment is too long. I recall that
when I came here the number of my Senate
ticket was 86. That was 12 years ago. Today
the number is 32, so it can easily be seen
that nature too brings about changes in the
Senate. I do not suppose there is a corporal's
guard of senators who were members of
this chamber when a Liberal Government
took office 22 years ago. Probably changes
occur more slowly in the Commons than in
this house, because after 22 years the strength
of the Liberal party in the other house
is practically as great as that of the party in
power. So if anyone says that we senators
have a long term of office, they may be
reminded that, by comparison, our stay is
even shorter than that of members of the
House of Commons.
I am particularly glad to see here my
friend of old days in the Commons, the
honourable senator from Hastings-Frontenac
(Hon. Mr. White). We sat near each other
and served together in that house, and it is
good to see him here because he will be a
valuable addition. I recall the splendid speech
he made in which he was quite critical of
certain provisions governing succession
duties. He thought the rates were too high.
I find that in what they call the "baby
budget" the present Government has proposed
a reduction of succession duties. This indicates that the honourable senator is a man
of influence, an.d it is satisfying to have a
colleague who is influential with the party
in power.
As I have said, I am going to talk on education. I do not do so with much confidence,
because I have been preceded by men who

DECEMBER 11, 1957

are specialists on the subject, whereas I am
just an ordinary man who never had a
college education. I listened with a great
deal of interest to the speech of the honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron).
It was an exhaustive presentation of the
subject from his point of view. He was
positive in his statements; he quoted many
authorities, men eminent in the educational
field; and his conclusions were definite. I
do not know that we can agree with all of
them, but at least we learned something from
his address. It showed he had a splendid
knowledge of the situation from his point of
view, which is that of the educator. He was
ably supported with many facts by the
honourable senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr.
Wall), whose rhetoric and language is so
colourful that it would delight any audience
and adorn any record-and in this instance
it adorns the pages of the Senate Hansard.
The honourable senator from TorontoTrinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) also took part
in the debate. He gave a very practical
review of what had been said in the debate
and I am sure we all enjoyed his contribution. Then we had a speech from the
honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr.
Crerar) who, after long and distinguished
service, has mellowed. He dealt with the
human side of the problem in a way that
pleased us all.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Kinley: I may say that I could
not accept as an independent appraisal what
was said by the honourable senators from
Banff and Winnipeg. They are advocates of
a cause in which they are deeply interested
and of which they have a great knowledge.
I read the speech of the honourable senator
from Banff twice. He quoted many authorities, and his speech reminded me of the
story about the cadet who was marching in
a parade in which many bands took part.
lis superior officer said to him: "You are
out of step. Don't you hear the drum in the
band behind?" The cadet replied, "Sir, I'm
listening to the drum up in front." The
honourable senators from Banff and Winnipeg are in the front line, but we must take
a realistic look at the whole situation.
The honourable senator from Mille Isles
(Hon. Mr. Monette) entered the debate and
brought something new to it. Although we
were all aware of the fact, lie pointed out
that by virtue of section 93 of the British
North America Act jurisdiction over educational matters is exclusively vested in the
provinces. I think that is the law, and that
everybody agrees it is the law. It would be
difficult to change it. We changed the British

North America with respect to the humanities, but I do not think anybody would say
that we should change the act with respect
to education. The section governing education is one of the cornerstones of Confederation. If it were changed and education came
under federal jurisdiction, somebody with a
certain ideology might get into power some
day and disrupt this whole country. I am
sure everyone agrees that that part of the
British North America Act is good and should
remain unchanged, that the provinces should
continue to control education.
The honourable gentleman from Mille
Isles said something to the effect that when
the federal Government makes contributions
to the provinces it should do so without
strings attached. The honourable senator
from Winnipeg got over this by pointing out
that last year the Government gave $23
million to education in Canada, and lie said
that all he was asking was that the Government should continue to make such
contributions and to add to them.
When we are dealing with education we
are dealing with three theatres of government
in this country-the municipal, the provincial and the federal. Of the three, the heaviest
burden falls on the municipalities. The honourable senator from Banff said that this
educational matter constituted a crisis. He
referred to the "present crisis", and in the
same paragraph lie proposed certain action
"in order to meet this crisis". I cannot go
along with that. I do not think it is a crisis.
It seems to me that a crisis would indicate a
weakness, an emergency, an hour of imperative decision, when conditions call for an
immediate radical change. I will admit that
it poses a serious problem. However, that is
not because of any weakness but rather because of strength. Canada is a strong country, which has lived up to its obligations and
kept in step with the world in educational
and other matters. It is because of our
growth that we have this problem. You see
the same sort of thing everywhere. When a
city grows too fast it is difficult to provide
the taxpayers with the services they require.
When a country goes ahead too fast it is
difficult to find the money to provide for
the necessary capital expenditures. It is a
sign of strength when a country needs a lot
of capital. A year ago I visited the city of
Caracas, Venezuela, which is said to be the
fastest growing community in the world. I
was told they are paying 20 per cent for
money. They have oil and other riches but
they are short of capital and are restricted in
their development, all because they are going
ahead too fast.
Back in 1924 I was a member of the Government of Nova Scotia, and as such I was

SENATE

a member of the Council of Public Instruction. There came a time when we were
thinking of replacing our Superintendent of
Education. He was a splendid official but he
was getting old. A young Nova Scotian by
the ,name, I believe, of Davis, who had been
doing very well in the United States, came
up and gave a lecture in one of the local
auditoriums, and he defined education as "the
ability to survive". Now, from what I read
of the speeches of the honourable senators
from Banff and Winnipeg, I think that definition would appeal to them. Mr. Davis gave
certain examples. He pointed out that the
big powerful dinosaur has become extinct,
whereas the little flea apparently possesses
qualities that enable it to survive. Perhaps
the flea helped to bring about the extinction
of the dinosaur, for there is always trouble
when fleas are around. The honourable senator from Churchill may demur to acceptance
of the definition of education as "the
ability to survive", for it will be remembered
that he said he did not think people should
strive competitively to get ahead of one another in trying to get a formal education. I
don't know, but I think the ability to survive
calis for character and discipline. If a person
does not have these qualities he is apt to
have trouble in dealing with others and he
might not survive. I know that in political
life-and I have run in seven elections-if
you do not have discipline and character, or
at least if the people do not believe you have
it, you will have a difficult time. I agree the
qualities of discipline and character, therefore, should be included in the idea of what
education should be.
A few years ago I was in Oslo, which is a

displays a number of figures representing
the struggle of mankind toward the top. No
matter how we feel about the matter, if
man does not compete, life will be very
drab and he will not get very far.
The honourable senator from Banff suggested that the satellites which the Russians
put into outer space rather spark-plugged
the idea that something should be donc,
and done quickly, about education. Well, I
recall that a few years ago, when my son was
taking post-graduate work at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, I used to
go down and visit him and talk to the
students. At that time they were all excited
about the splitting of the atom, and they
said that that was the big objective. A little
later on American scientists and technicians
did split the atom. I think that achievement
was responsible for the peace we have
enjoyed in the world during the past ten
years. Everybody was afraid to start a war,
realizing that another war would result in

The splitting of
universal extermination.
the atom led to the discovery of a very
powerful force and was, I think, the
scientific achievement of the century.
It is one feature of education that the
universities cannot claim all the credit for
achievement.
For
discovery in scientific
instance, at Chalk River we have a reactor
that is one of the best in the world, and we
feel that Canada played quite a part in this
atomic energy project.
When the reactor
was built we were told that we were in the
"atomic age". We know there is a future in
atomic energy. We have uranium and the
other necessary materials. As I have said,
the Americans split the atom-I suppose
with the help of Einstein and other foreignborn scientists-and I have no doubt they
will advance further in the realm of science.
We are told that we need to get excited
because a satellite has been rocketed into
space by the Russians. It must be remembered that a satellite travelling in outer
space is an uncontrolled force. The Russians
cannot get back either of their Sputniks,
er they have not succeeded in doing so yet.
It is said that each will be destroyed when it
falls toward the earth, and that the dog
which was sent up in the second of them
perished.
The impression I have received
from men of science is that a satellite is of
very undetermined value, as to both science
and defence. Although Russian scientists have
made a dazzling achievement, and something
that we must admire them for, I do not think
it comes anywhere near the creation of the
atomic bomb.
I did not like the following remarks of
our honourable friend from Banff, which are
recorded in Hansa-rd at page 308, second
column:
You have only to think of the extravagant bills
for advertising, television, radio, entertainment,
liquor, packaging, etc., to realize the importance
of that statement.
The reason I mention this is that these and
countless less worthy examples of our extravagant
way of living which come to mind, ail serve to
underline an imbalanced sense of values in our
life which is almost tragic. Against this ostentatious
display of economic waste we contrast the fact that
the professors in our universities, the teachers in
our schools, the ministers in our churches, and,
in short, all of those agencies which are concerned
with building and maintaining the educational,
spiritual and moral values in our communities,
continue to struggle along like so many mendicants,
trying to eke out an existence with austerity
budgets, . . .

Well, as I understand it, a mendicant is a
professional beggar. I think this in an overstatement on the part of my honourable
friend. It is truc that in the past some of
our ministers and most of our teachers have
had a hard time financially in this country,

DECEMBER 11, 1957
but they are doing infinitely better now, and
they certainly have flot done so badly in
the past few years.
Honourable senators, I have here a clipping from a recent issue of the Ottawa
Journal, which bears the caption, "700 Ottawa
Ps Teachers Get Pay Boost". The article
reads:
Salary increases approved by a quorum of Public
School trustees will add some $200,000 to the annual
budget and affect some 700 Ottawa teachers.
Described as a major salary revision, the move
wlll bring a maximum across-the-board raise of
$200 for many of the teachers.
It also puts Ottawa teachers with first-class
certiflcates but no university degree in a higher
maximum salary bracket than any other Canadian

The new salary range goes into effect January 1.

teachers, from. $6,400 to $6,800.
Also affected were the salaries of instrumental
music teachers and those lnvolved in physical
instruction, ceramics and general music instruction.

Oh, it may be said, that is in Ottawa, the
capital city. Well, I could take you to
Halifax, in the poor country of Nova Scotia,
where two years ago Judge Pottier, a former
member of the House of Commons for some
years and a room-mate of mine, was
appointed a commissioner to review the
provincial situation in regard to teacher's
salaries. Judge Pottier made a report, and
in Halifax today the salaries are ten per
cent above the scale hie recommended. Also
in the town in which I live, and where I was
chairman of the school board in 1909, the
salaries are higher than those recommended
by the Pottier report. In Halifax an academic
tOacher is paid up to $5,960 and a principal
gets another $10.0 to $300, according to the
number of rooms in the school.
True, this is not a high salary as salaries
go today, but I do flot think the teachers are
mendicants or professional beggars, by any
means. We are told that people in other
professions get more money.
When the
senator from Toronto-Trinity was making his
speech the other day, someone mentioned the
high pay received by football players. Let
me point out that teaching is a sheltered
and an honourable profession. Teachers have
regular duties and a steady income, and a
pension when they are through teaching. No
one would suggest that a football or a hockey
player has those benefits. Indeed, very few
of them get hîgh pay, and those who do are
outstanding. In the field of entertainment
some high salaries are paid, but they go only
to those who are good, who appeal to the
06702-25

public and who are 0f some value to their
sponsor. These people are short-lîved in their
professions.
The prize fighter is another
example: he bas to be good and hie bas to
conquer every competitor before he rises to
the top and gets big pay. So, honourable
senators. it seems to me a littie unfair to
compare teachers' salaries with those in other
parts of our economny.
We are told that we are wasteful, that
there are many things we could do without
in order to give more money to education.
Mention was made of liquor. As I understand
it, about 90 per cent of the cost of liquor
goes to pay federal and provincial taxes;
the provincial Governments get a lot of
money from that source, and they usually
tell us they are going to use it for education.
Mention was also made of cigarettes. Cigarettes too have very llttle value in themselves, in that the cost largely represents
taxes. Indeed, if I were a temperance advocate I would caIl all the drinkers and smokers
together and tell themn what fools they were
to pay the taxes for other people who do not
indulge in these luxuries.
In Halifax the school principals are sometimes hired by agreement. As you know,
the school teachers have discovered there is
strength in organization, and they now have
good unions that are able to look after their
members. It seemis to me that is what happens
in Nova Scotia.
There is no use in doing something that
will kill you. Down in Nova Scotia, after
the Pottier Report, Bill 60 came out and got
into the hands of the people and the municipal taxes were raised before the election.
In the county where I live there was a school
inspector who had degrees fromn universities
in Europe and the United States and was well
lked by everybody. He was regarded as a
splendid candidate and thought to be a future
Minister of Education. Well, he went into
the election, but hie had two strikes against
him before hie started. The people said,
"You are the f ellow who put the taxes on us,"
and hie was defeated. Mind you, the people
down in that part of the country are not
carried away by ephemeral things-they are
good solid citizens. But when their taxes
were raised by as much as 200 and 250 per
cent, it became a serious matter and they
would not take it. Hence, this promising man
was defeated, and the Government went down
too. I have no doubt the main reasonl for the
defeat in most of the counties was the high
municipal taxes, and I do not think they will
ever be reduced. At the samne time, the party
had been in power a long time and perhaps
it was just as well they were defeated. As
we know, all that lives must die. They may
revive and live another day.

SENATE
My honourable friend from Banff made one
suggestion that I look on with favour. He
said that he thought it was a good thing to
put in a quarter system, that is, to divide
the school year into four quarters. He pointed
out that the school facilities are now used
for only seven to nine months in the year,
five hours a day, five days a week. I think
my friend's suggestion is a splendid one,
because it would mean using the plant for
production to the highest degree. And I
think over-time pay for teachers would not
be a bad idea. As you know, when we pay
our employees in industry time and a half
for over-time we save on the overhead, and
it is an advantageous arrangement. I think it
would be equally advantageous if the schools
paid their teachers for over-time.
My friend from Banff pointed out that the
ratio of students attending university per
thousand of population in three countries
were as follows: In Canada five to 1,000; in
the United States 15 to 1,000, and in Russia
20 to 1,000. Well, I think even in poor little
Nova Scotia we can beat the percentage for
Canada. In that province we have five
universities: Dalhousie, King's College, St.
Mary's, St. Francis Xavier and Acadia, all
splendid institutions.
Dr. Kerr, president of Dalhousie University,
has said that the payment of grants to universities on the basis of population is unfair. He
suggested that grants should be made on the
basis of the number of students attending the
universities in the province. He knew what
he was talking about, because in Nova Scotia
we have about eight students per 1,000 of
population atending universities. If Canada
as a whole has a ratio of five students to 1,000
of population and it is the wish that the
student population be doubled within ten
years, Nova Scotia can easily do that. And
do not forget that the Right Honourable C.
D. Howe is now Chancellor of Dalhousie
University.
With respect to the suggestion that no
strings should be attached to grants made to
the provinces, it seems to me there might be
a way by which the provinces could save
face and still have a say in how the money
is to be spent. If the federal Government
paid so much per student attending university in any province, there would be no
perceptible strings atached to the grant, and
the local government would not likely use
the money for anything but education. I
throw that suggestion out for what it is worth.
As I mentioned earlier, there is a desire to
double university attendance over the next 10
years. It seems to me that such an effort for
number has its weaknesses. I do not think it
is always wise to surrender quality for

quantity. My friend from Banff, out of his
wisdom, suggested that there be graduate
schools in three or four provinces: I think
he suggested there be one in Toronto, one in
Montreal and another somewhere in British
Columbia. These graduate schools would be
centres for higher learning. I would go
along with that idea, provided there were
proper aptitude tests, that students were
screened and only those were admitted whose
achievement was such that they would be expected to go far. In such postgraduate schools
we would put the best of our facilities.
There are in Canada some institutions outside of the universities which contribute to
the education of our people.
When I was going to the Lunenburg high
school a chum of mine left school in the
tenth grade. At that time we had only eleven
grades, but before I left school there were
twelve. I left in the eleventh grade to become an apprentice in pharmacy. My chum
went into the employ of the Royal Bank, and
eventually he became president of that bank
and also Chancellor of McGill University.
Evidently he continued his education while
in the employ of the bank. Honourable senators, I want to say that our Canadian banks
do a splendid job as an educational institution. Years ago the banks did not pay very
good salaries, and they used to say, "We cannot educate a man and pay him at the same
time", but they are doing better now. I
venture to say that as a result of being an
educational institution our banking system
has developed to be the best in the world.
Financial control in Canada is admired and
envied in almost every country, and we are
considered to have the highest financial
standards. I think banking education in this
country has had a great deal to do with the
ability that our people have shown in finance.
Our Canadian Navy, our Canadian Air
Force and our Canadian Army might all be
termed educational institutions. The forces
are educating large numbers of technicians
today. Young people enlist for a five-year
period, are paid well while in the service,
and receive a splendid technical education.
The same thing is done in the United States.
The missile venture that failed the other day
was developed by the United States Navy.
In advanced education the armed forces are
right in the forefront. They have to be, because they are struggling against the forces
of the world and in order to have a supply
of well trained personnel they have to educate them. Here in Canada we are turning
out hundreds of thousands of technicians in
that way. I think that is something splendid.
Occasionally young men come to see me and
ask my opinion about going into the army

DECEMBER 11, 1957
or the navy. Well, for a boy who wants a
whole lot of help, the services provide a way
to get it.
Now a word about industry. I am president
of an industry that bas been established for
50 years. We have 250 men on our payroll,
of whom six are labourers, all the rest being
technicians, and good ones. We do work all
over the Maritimes, in Newfoundland and in
the French Islands. Some years ago I sent
the man who is now manager of our plant
to England for six months, along with the
foreman, to study the development of the
diesel engine. The honourable senator from
Banff referred to the Ryerson Institute of
Toronto. Well, the son of the manager of
our plant is taking a course there now.
We undertake to send our men to the best
places for training. We send them to the
Aluminum Company to learn how to fabricate and weld aluminum; and to other places
where they learn how to fabricate steel and
the latest methods in the welding of steel.
We are sending men to some of the great
plants in Milwaukee now, in order that they
shall become proficient in their various
trades. And mind you, honourable senators,
these plants co-operate: we pay the men's
wages and the plants will pay their board
while they are there. We think this is an
excellent arrangement. We do not ask our
men to sign a contract to remain with us,
and some leave us, but most of them come
back.
Honourable senators, so far as Nova Scotia
is concerned, education is an export. My
honourable friend from Shelburne (Hon. Mr.
Robertson) a free-trader, who has long
advanced free-trade theories and knows more
about that sort of business than probably any
politician in Nova Scotia, will know what is
doing in Nova Scotia in that regard. Large
numbers of very able men have left the
Maritimes. We educate them and export
them to other parts of Canada. There is
free trade in education. I am not so sure
that they have it in Ontario-I think the
Law Society of Upper Canada is a little hard
to get into. However, free trade in higher
education is international. We have it with
the United States and England, and students
go back and forth between these countries
and Canada. It is a splendid thing that we
have free trade in thought and education on
this hemisphere.
Now, what about Russia? Well, education
in that country is state-controlled. It is said
that Russia has a lot of men in the universities, but they are state-controlled and you
do not know why they are there. Russia controls all ber people. For many years Russia
was pretty backward, and perhaps now she

is making a crash effort and trying to catch
up. I do not know, but that has been suggested by some people. It may that ber
classifications are different from ours. It
would seem that all technical men in Russia
are trained in what they call universities.
They have a great many technical degrees,
and I think perhaps every steamboat engineer
on the Volga would be classed as a university-trained man.
Let us take a look at the railroads of our
own country. Many of the engineers employed
by the railroads of Canada are not university
trained, but let me tell you that they render
a valuable service to the railroads and to
this country.
What about the engineers in the merchant
marine? What about the master mariners
in the merchant marine? They do not have
university degrees, but they are out in front
fighting to make this country great, and I
feel that they deserve great credit.
Now I want to refer for a moment to a
really big question, the question of money.
Where did the professional men say you
would get the money?
Well, honourable
senators, you will find professional men are
a little weak on explaining where the money
is to come from. They think you ought to find
the money. I do not believe you can get it from
industry, because industry at present is paying
47 per cent of its profits over $25,000 to
the Government of Canada as income
tax. Don't forget that profits are made up of
inventory, cash receivable and cash, and
when you take 47 per cent of the profits out
of the business in cash every year and pay
it to the Government there is not much
left for venture capital nor for working
capital to carry on with, nor for anything
else. What is public opinion on that question
in Canada now? You know, for we had an
election recently. People want reduction of
taxes. But it seems to me that the federal
Government will need to be careful, because
if it grants the provinces all they ask for
or need, it may have a deficit. One can see
how the surplus can dwindle. Some $35
million has been allotted to the Colombo
Plan. Perhaps my educationist friends would
like to take a second look at it. To cover the
whole field they asked for an expenditure of
$300 million in ten years. Their present
budget amounts to $150 million, but the
honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron), asks that it be doubled. I may
be wrong, but I doubt whether this country
can be more heavily taxed at the present
time.
If
national
production
largely
increases and there are bigger revenues,
things may be different, but I believe we
have just about reached the meridian in this
respect.

SENATE
Now, as to children's allowances. I was
surprised at the suggestion of the honourable
senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar)
that they are a bad thing and that the money
may be used for purposes of higher education. With the payment of children's allowances goes the obligation that the children
shall attend school. In Nova Scotia our
primary classrooms are filled to overflowing.
Why? Because of the obligation I have
mentioned. Let it not be forgotten that the
men whosefamilies benefit most by children's
allowances are, for the most part, those who
do not pay income tax at all.
In order to have motion you must have a
bigger intake than outflow. Motion requires
force behind it, and you cannot take out more
than you put in. Everybody knows that. The
intake must be there; any engineer would
consider it before he considered the outflow.
I do not hear from our friends any criticism
of the colleges and universities. Are they
well managed? Why is it that universities
take in only $90 million a year? I think that
is a point which should be discussed. I do
not suggest that they should be money-making
institutions, but their revenue of $90 million
is very small; and any institution which
comes to the country for money should be
able to demonstrate that it is efficiently managed. I noticed that an extract was quoted
from a paper written by the Dean of Columbia University, who stated that he is not
satisfied with the universities' state of efficiency or the work that they are doing. It
seems to me also a valid criticism that it
takes too long to educate the students in our
colleges. They are not well grounded when
they arrive.
The honourable senator from Churchill
stressed the importance of discipline. I believe, as he does, that discipline is a valuable
character-builder. My mind goes back to my
home, as his does to his when he was a boy.
There were nine of us around the table. My
mother was a school teacher in Nova Scotia,
80 years ago, before she was married. My
father was a sailor, often away at sea. Three
meals were prepared for us every day by my
mother, and when the evening came we sat
around the kitchen table with a lamp, and
she saw to it that we knew our lessons. On
Sundays the only reading matter we were
allowed was the Presbyterian Witness; nothing else was permitted. And we had to go to
church. That reminds me that right in this
city of Ottawa, in the newer sections, there
are as many as three Sunday School sessions

every Sunday and two morning services in
United churches. That is some indication of
our educational needs and how they are being
met. My mother lived to be 92 years old; and
having in mind the service she did for us, and
how we regarded her and her advice, I am
prepared to assent to the words of Wallace:
The hand that rocks the cradle
Is the hand that rules the world.

One or two more remarks, and I shall be

among our mendicants. But I have never
heard it suggested that the Government
should make payments to the churches. In
my view the church courts and the congregations have the responsibility. In Nova Scotia
we have had great ministers, such as Bishop
Courtney, Robert Norwood, Canon Shatford,
Clarence Mackinnon, and our gifted Dr. Kerr,
Dean of Dalhousie. Most of these men went
to the United States and some filled important churches on Fifth avenue; others went
to Montreal. Canon Shatford was in Montreal
for years. And let me point out that they
did not read their messages, they delivered
them direct. It seems to me that one of
the things to avoid is the reading of speeches
or sermons, because it destroys the effect;
the speaker cannot "get across" his personality. There is a parliamentary rule against
the reading of speeches in either house, and
one can never be sure in the Commons that
someone will not rise and announce, "the
honourable gentleman is reading his speech",
upon which the Speaker compels him either
to desist from reading or to take his seat.
There is no doubt that in so far as a minister is concerned, if he speaks his message
instead of reading it the effect is much
better; and I think the same rule applies to
all who are called upon to speak in public.
In conclusion: we all have the faith, though
in some it is more active than in others. So
let us put first things first, and look after
our churches. I like to think of the words
of James Russell Lowell:
Careless seems the great Avenger;
history's pages but record
One death-grapple in the darkness
'twixt old systems and the Word;
Truth forever on the scafTold,
Wrong forever on the throne,But the scaffold sways the future,

EDUCATION

EDUCATIONAL RESOURCESDEBATE CONTINUED

A civilization to endure must be built on an
educational system which puts the emphasis on
virtue first, wisdom second, and skill third. We
have erred in placing skill before wisdom and
wisdom before virtue.
In education there has been too great stress
upon the development of technique and not enough
on the development of reason.

Hon. Percival G. Burchill: Honourable senators, I think the honourable senator from
Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron), who I am sorry
to say is not here this afternoon, is to be
commended for bringing this very useful and
important subject to the attention of the
Senate. The speeches in the debate which
followed have been profitable, for they
emphasize the importance of keeping always
before us a proper sense of values as our
objective in education, as well as underlining
the basic essentials of true education. In
these days of guided missiles, and in an age
in which, as someone bas said, "We are more
skilful with our hands than in our thinking,"
fundamentals are apt to be overlooked and
there is a danger of getting off the track.
All the speeches in the debate have been
excellent, but I want to refer especially to
that splendid address which We were
privileged to hear from the honourable senator from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar).

The chief task of education is to make human
beings, to develop the aptitudes and attitudes necessary for successful living.
The criticism of the classics is due to a fallure
to distinguish between knowledge and wisdom.
Knowledge gets out of date often very quicklyespecially scientific knowledge-but wisdom does
not. Like gold it keeps uis value however long ago
some human mind dug it up.

An editorial in one of our newspapers the
other day had this heading, "Freedom
requires Education", and those of us who
are in public life know how true that statement is. We in the free world, as we caîl
it-the western democracies-boast of our
freedom, but to safeguard that freedom and
protect it from the licence requires an
electorate who have learned to know the
value of our political institutions and the use

ALASKA-YUKON PIPELINES LTD.-COMMONS
AMENDMENTS CONCURRED IN
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons returning Bill X-1, respecting Alaska-Yukon Pipelines Ltd., and
acquainting the Senate that they had passed
this bill with certain amendments, to which
they desired the concurrence of the Senate.
The amendments were read by the Clerk
Assistant as follows:

SENATE
The third feature of the bill deals with the
mutualization of life insurance companies.
This is something new that has been introduced in Canada. Provision for it bas never
been on the statute books before, but if the
clause is adopted it will enable stock life
insurance companies to buy in their stock
and become mutual insurance companies.
Now, the last division of the bill does not
relate to any insurance company but rather
to Canadian fraternal benefit societies. It
makes a change in the law as to how they
may invest their funds and gives them the
right to consolidate two different funds which
are at present being operated separately
by these societies.
Some of you may ask why these changes
are being made to the Canadian and British
Insurance Companies Act. I think I should
point out to honourable senators that since
1930 control of seven Canadian life insurance
companies has passed from the hands of
Canadians into the hands of non-residents.
The first such change took place in 1930,
when an English insurance company acquired
control of the Montreal Life Insurance Company.
No further changes took place until 1945,
when a Swiss insurance company purchased
control of the Continental Life Insurance
Company.
Ten years elapsed before the next change
took place, when another Swiss company
acquired control of the Canadian Premier Life
Insurance Company.
Then, in 1956, the Western Insurance Company was purchased by certain United States
investors.
Again, in 1956, a Dutch insurance company
acquired control of Commercial Life Insurance Company.
Then, in 1957, control of a company changed
hands while really shocked a great many
Canadians. That was when control of the
Dominion Life Insurance Company, whose
head office is at Waterloo, Ontario, was
acquired by an American insurance company.
Finally, in 1957, British insurance interests
purchased the Fidelity Life Insurance Company. I believe it was the sentiment of the
previous Government, and is the sentiment of
the present Government and of the people
of Canada generally that they would prefer
that the control of Canadian life insurance
companies which have been set up by Canadians, who provided the investment capital
in the initial stages, and which companies
have been ably managed by Canadians, should
remain in Canada. That, I understand, is one
of the main reasons for these amendments.
Now to deal in detail with the bill. Clause 1
is a mechanical clause and does not require

any explanation: it repeals subsection 3 of
section 3 of the act, which is set out in the
explanatory note, and it provides that certain
other sections shall apply. By reading the
subsection that is repealed with the sections
which are to remain in effect, one can easily
determine the meaning of clause 1.
Clause 2 is the one clause which relates to
all insurance companies that come under the
act, that is all companies which are incorporated by an act of the Dominion Parliament. It sets out the qualifications of the
directors. Subclause 3 of clause 2 states the
monetary qualification required of a person
before he can become a director. It will be
noted that the amount is rather substantial. I
understand that in this respect there is no
change. It is the feeling of all concerned
that, to be a director of an insurance company, a person should have a substantial
interest therein.
The subclauses which are marked 3(a)
and 3(b) are those which will bring about a
change in the qualification of directors. Under
these subclauses it is now provided that a
majority of the directors of a company, even
where that company has more than one class
of directors-for instance, policyholder directors and stockholder directors-must be
Canadian citizens ordinarily resident in
Canada. I have been advised by the Department of Insurance that at the present time
all Canadian companies have complied with
this clause, but I think it is only fair to
point out that if there is a Canadian company the majority of whose directors are not
Canadian citizens ordinarily resident in
Canada, upon the passing of this measure
it will have to change its board of directors
so that this section shall be complied with.
Clause 3 relates to life insurance companies only; it has nothing to do with those
companies which write fire and casualty insurance. It relates to the transfer of shares,
and enables the directors of a life insurance
company to restrict the transfer of shares.
Honourable senators will note that it refers to
directors of a life insurance company doing
business in Canada. This must not be construed in any way to cover all life insurance
companies doing business in Canada. It only
refers to the companies that are covered by
this act, being companies that are incorporated by an act of Parliament.
You will note also that the directors may
allow or refuse to allow the transfer of any
stock owned by a Canadian ordinarily resident in Canada to any person who is not a
Canadian citizen ordinarily resident in
Canada and/or a foreign corporation, association or partnership. It is not mandatory
legislation at all. It is just permissive legislation, which permits the directors to refuse the

DECEMBER 16, 1957
transfer of shares owned by a Canadian
citizen ordinarily resident
here to a
non-resident.
Everyone realizes that a certain number of
shares in Canadian life insurance companies
are at the present time owned and registered
in the names of non-residents. This act does
not in any way interfere with the rights of
a non-resident shareholder. Under clause
3(2) a non-resident can sell and transfer his
stock to another non-resident person. A nonresident corporation can sell and transfer its
stock to a non-resident corporation. In other
words, the act does not in any way restrict
the sale and transfer of shares owned by
non-residents.
This clause, while it is new in Canada, is
not new in Europe. For instance, I have been
advised that Italian, Swiss and Dutch insurance companies all come under a similar
provision in their acts of incorporation or the
laws of their respective countries. The provision exists for the reason that these foreign companies desire to retain their native
characteristics and retain control within the
particular country concerned.

the opinion that certain shares have become
foreign-held, and if the number of foreignheld shares exceeds 25 per cent of the total
shares in the company, they may call upon
the holder of such shares to prove to their
satisfaction that he is not classed as a foreigner and his shares are not classed as
foreign-held shares. If this proof is not forthcoming within three weeks they can serve on
the shareholder a written demand to transfer
the share in such a manner as to make it a
British-held share.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Does the honourable
senator think that this legislation goes far
enough? Apparently the purpose of the bill
is to keep the control of Canadian companies
from going out of Canadian hands. If it is
only permissive is it strong enough?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I can only express my
own opinion, and I must say that I do not
like restrictions on the transfer of shares.
For that reason I think it goes far enough.
Mind you, it may not go far enough to bring
about the result that everybody would
desire, but personally I do feel it goes far
enough.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Do I gather that you
think it goes a little too far?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, no; I think it is just
about right. I think this section is notice to
everyone of what the feeling of the Government is, and I think it is also the feeling of
the people of Canada. It is to be hoped that
when non-residents of Canada give consideration to buying shares in Canadian life
insurance companies they will look at this
section and say, "Oh, we are not very welcorne". If the section does that and acts as
a hindrance to non-residents trying to acquire
control of our companies, I think we shall
have accomplished a great deal.
The next is clause 4, which applies to life
insurance companies only.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Otawa West): Before
the honourable gentleman proceeds, would
he allow some further questions?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Of course.
Hon. Mr. Connolly: Perhaps I should tell
the honourable gentleman that if he were
not doing so well in the explanation of the
bill he would not get these questions. His
explanation is very comprehensive, and I
must compliment him on the way he is proceeding. However, I wondered if he has
given this clause full consideration. I must
say my own examination of it has been very
cursory. Take the case of a person who
owns and has a property right in shares in
a life insurance company, one of the companies covered by this legislation. If he desires
to make a transfer and is prevented from
doing so by the board of directors in accordance with this proposed legislation, I wonder
if that would be interference with a property
right, and whether or not it is competent for
Parliament to legislate on that point. Perhaps the honourable gentleman has given
consideration to that point and could answer
now.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I have that in my notes,
but neglected to mention it. I am glad that
the question is asked, and I am very pleased

to answer it. When this bill came before

senator I could not ask any questions, but
I was sitting next to a rather talkative
gentleman, so I gave him my questions. One
question which he asked was whether or
not this particular clause of the bill did not
infringe upon property and civil rights,
which is something within the jurisdiction of
the provinces. I quote from the evidence
taken at the Banking and Commerce Committee of the other place on December 5 last:

contract and incidents flowing from the contract
are vested in the legislatures of the provinces.

Then the witness, who was Mr. K. R.
MacGregor, Superintendent of Insurance,
said:
I might say, Mr. Stewart, that the constitutional
aspects of the clause were considered carefully by
the Department of Justice and they have assured us
that what is proposed is intra vires.

Frankly, I have not read enough either of
textbook law or casebook law to give a
definite opinion which I could call my own,
to the effect that the section is intra vires,
but I am prepared to accept the opinion of
the Department of Justice. They have given
study and consideration to this particular
point, and it is their opinion that the section
is intra vires of the Dominion Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Perhaps
the honourable gentleman will allow me just
for a moment. The point that I raised is,
I think, not a question of insurance law, but
has to do with the transfer of shares. It
may very well be that the law officers of the
Crown considered this point and have come
to the conclusion that subsection 13 of section 92 of the British North America Act is
not violated. If they have considered that
point and are of that opinion, I think it might
be very helpful to the committee if one of
the law officers of the Crown could be present
at our committee to help us on the point.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I have been assured by
Mr. MacGregor that-to use his own wordsthe Department of Justice have ruled on this.
However, I will get word to him that he
should have someone from the Department of
Justice before the committee on this point
tomorrow morning.
Honourable senators, clause 4 of the bill
is the mutualization clause; it consists of 23
subclauses, and deals solely with the
mutualization of life insurance companies. It
is under this clause that a stock company can

DECEMBER 16, 1957
become a mutual company by buying in its
own stock. It is a well-recognized principle of
law that no company can deal in its own common shares, and this particular section is the
one that gives to Canadian life insurance
companies the right and power to deal in
their own shares by buying them in.
Briefly, the steps to be taken, as outlined
in this particular clause, to bring about the
mutualization of a life insurance company,
are as follows: The first step, under subclause
1, is that the insurance company, first of all,
must obtain the permission of the Minister of
Finance in order to establish and implement
a plan for converting the company into a
mutual company by the purchase of its own
shares. After the company has obtained the
consent of the Minister of Finance, step 2 can
be taken, whereby the directors must pass a
bylaw setting out in detail the plan which
they propose to follow in mutualizing the
cfompany. Under paragraph 2 of the same subclause, the bylaw must be approved at a
special general meeting by a majority of not
only the shareholders of the company but also
of the policyholders; and thé meeting, of
course, must have been convened for that
particular purpose.
After all this is done, the third step requires
that the bylaw must be subinitted to the
Treâsury Board for approval. The bylaw is
entirely ineffective until it is approved by the
Treâsury Board. Paragraphs (á) to (f) of subclause 3 set out in detail-and they are listed
there at great length-the conditions to be met
and complied with before the Treasury Board
can approve of the bylaw. This results in the
Treasury Board having the final say as to the
price that is to be paid by the company when
it purchases its own stock.
In other words, if the company has decided
what it is going to pay for its shares and
the directors have approved of it, and the
shareholders have approved of it, the Treasury Board acts as a referee or arbitrator and
decides finally whether or not the price is
fair not only to the company but to the
shareholders. If the price were not fair, the
Treasury Board would not give its consent,
the bylaw would have no effect, and no
shares could be purchased.
Step 4 is set out in subclauses 4, 5 and 6
of this general clause 4. They deal with the
length of time during which the offer is
good. Provision is made that the original
offer must be available for acceptance for
at least six months, and no change can be
made within that period. Then, if the company finds it wants to make a subsequent
change in the price to be paid for its shares
the procedure is outlined by which a change
in the price can be made. Of course if any

change is made the Treasury Board will once
again have to decide and determine whether
or not the subsequent price is a fair one.
Step 5 is set out in subclauses 7, 8 and 9,
and provide for the manner of payment of
shares purchased by a company. I would
like to call the attention of honourable
senators particularly to subclause 7, under
which a company has the right, so to speak,
to purchase shares on credit. If cash is not
available a company can issue promissory
notes which, if the shareholders are willing
to accept, can be accepted as settlement for
their shares. The notes must be payable
within ten years of the date of issue, and
the rate of interest in the first instance is
fixed by the board of directors of the company. Subsequently the approval of the
Minister of Finance must be obtained as to
the rate of interest which the company proposes to pay on its promissory notes.
Some honourable senators may ask why
this provision is necessary. I understand that
subelause 7 was put in this legislation in
order to protect an insurance company from
a loss which might arise if a company was
compelled to sell securities in an unfavourable
market-for instance, in the past three months
there has been a rather unfavourable market
for all sellers of securities-in order to raise
money to purchase its shares. In other words,
if the market is not favourable the company
can retain its securities, have the shareholders accept notes, and when the market
becomes favourable, sell its stock and retire
its notes.
Subclauses 10 and 11 of clause 4 deal with
the amount of company funds which may be
expended by any company in the purchase
of its shares. These two subclauses are designed and set up to ensure that the financial
structure of a company is not in any way
impaired or endangered by the purchase of
shares. In other words, these two subelauses
compel a company to maintain an adequate
surplus and adequate reserves, and in no
event can a company ever reduce its reserves and surplus by the purchase of its
stock below 6 per cent of its capital.
As I read the words of these subclauses
they sounded rather complicated. So I had
the Superintendent of Insurance set up for
me an example to illustrate what was the
intention. His example made the intention
much plainer to me, and I shall pass it on to
the house.
Let us look at the balance sheet of a fictitious company by the name of The Ottawa
Life Insurance Company.

4,000,000

$100,000,000
From that example, honourable senators,
you will see that this fictitious life insurance
company has reserves and a surplus of $8
million, made up of a general reserve $4
million, and surplus and contingency reserves
of $4 million; you will also note that the
total value of the assets of the company is
$100 million. which would entitle the company to spend $2 million on the purchase
of its shares. In other words, you take 6 per
cent of the assets of the company, which is
$6 million, and subtract that amount from
the surplus and reserves of $8 million, leaving $2 million, which is the sum available for
the purchase of stock.
On first glance of at my example you would
say the company has twice the amount it
needs to purchase stock. That is not so,
because no life insurance company today can
buy its own stock at its par value-such stock
is worth much more than its par value.
Subclause 12 of clause 4 is a simple one.
It provides for the pro rata purchase of
shares where the number and value of the
shares offered exceed the funds which are
available to a company for the purchase of
shares.
Subclause 13 is a sort of bookkeeping clause.
Under this subclause a company is required
to keep proper records with respect to shares
purchased, the price paid for the shares, and
all other data which in any way relate to
the offering of the shares of a company and
the purchase of shares by a company.
Subclause 14 is self-explanatory. By it
provision is made whereby if a company runs
out of money available for the purchase of
shares it is compelled to notify all shareholders who have offered their stock to the
company that the company is out of money
and cannot purchase any further shares at
that time.
Hon. Mr. Savoie: May I ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Savoie: I refer to section 14, the
explanatory note on which reads:
Total ..................................

The purpose of this subsection is to require a
company that has temporarily exhausted the funds
available for purchase of shares to notify ail shareholders who have made offers and whose offers
have not been fully taken up.

What funds are really available for purchase
of shares by a company? Is it the funds in
the legal reserve or general reserve, or in
the surplus and contingency reserves? Do I

understand that money available for the purchase of shares must be taken out of surplus
and not out of the general reserve or legal
reserve?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I understand, subject to
correction, that the money can be taken out
of the general reserve and surplus and contingency reserves. These are not reserves
which are set up for the protection of the
policyholders, but are reserves which belong
to the shareholders.
Hon. Mr. Savoie: Excuse me. The general
reserve or legal reserve, and the contingency
reserves, belong to the policyholders.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No.
Hon. Mr. Savoie: And the surplus belongs
to the policyholders?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The company cannot use
reserves, as I understand it, that have been
set up for the benefit and protection of
policyholders. It must use the company's own
reserves which have been set up for the benefit of shareholders.
Hon. Mr. Savoie: That is, surplus?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
I turn now to subclause 15, paragraph (a)
of which defines the composition of board of
directors, and sets out how the division of
directors is to be made as between policyholders' directors and stockholders' directors.
Paragraph (b) is an important one: it prevents a life insurance company from offering
for sale any shares which it has purchased
or bought in. This clause is very, very necessary because if a company had the right to
resell the shares which it bought in, and decided to do so, it would never become
mutualized since, in order to become mutualized a company must get all its stock in. This
provision prevents the company from selling
any of the shares which it has purchased. It
also prevents the company from issuing any
new stock, and from making any further calls
on stock that has been issued and is not fully
paid up.
Paragraph (c) is, I think, one that would
apply to me personally, because I have never
liked selling shares once I have acquired
them. This provision is put in the bill to
protect the stubborn shareholder with respect
to dividends, that is, the fellow who says,
"I don't care what you pay me for my stock,
I am going to keep it." The company cannot
penalize him or force him to sell by cutting
the dividend. You will note the clause provides that the dividends must equal the average of the dividends for the three prior
years unless the company can show good
reason why the dividends should be lower.

DECEMBER 16, 1957
It is only fair that a man who wants to keep
his stock should be protected with respect to
dividends.
Paragraph (d) deals with the matter of
the payment of dividends on shares which a
life insurance company has purchased. For
instance, if a company bought in 55 per cent
of its issued stock, 45 per cent remaining in
the hands of the public, and it pays a $3
dividend, the question arises: What happens
to that dividend? Under this clause the
amount of such dividend is to be credited to
the insurance funds of the company and for
the benefit of the policyholders, which is
quite proper; the company having purchased
the stock, that dividend belongs to the
policyholders and not to the shareholders of
the company.
Subclause 16 deals with the writing down
of the value of the shares from the purchase
price paid by the life insurance company to
the par value of the stock. Under paragraph
(a), in applying the 6 per cent rule which
I referred to a short time ago as set out in
subclauses 10 and 11, the par value of the
stock is subtracted from the price paid for
the stock, and at least 20 per cent a year
must be writen off the difference after the
first year. No write-off is required on the
stock the year it is purchased, but by having
an annual 20 per cent write-off, in five
years' time the difference between the par
value and the purchase price value of the
stock is entirely written off.
Paragraph (d) provides that the policyholders' directors of the company-and this
is important-shall vote all the shares that
are bought in by the company, that none of
the shares shall be voted by the stockholders'
directors.
Now, passing along, we come ta subclauses
17, 18 and 19 which enable the company to
get rid of the stubborn shareholder, the man
who says, "You cannot buy my stock". These
subclauses are really the only provisions that
give the directors of a life insurance company
the right ta take from a shareholder his stock
whether he wants ta sell it or not. But this
is nat new. Similar provisions are set out in
the Dominion Companies Act and are used
every day by companies ta get in the final
10 per cent of their outstanding stock.
I can recall the case of the British Columbia Pulp and Paper Company, which was
purchased by Abitibi. I was a common shareholder, and I finally had ta give up my stock.
I did nat like the price, but I had no option
-they had acquired 90 per cent of the stock,
I was among the 10 per cent, and by following a certain procedure Abitibi took over
my stock. In this way a company finally
acquires all of the stock that bas been issued
and sold. After a company acquires all of

its stock it is then in a position ta mutualize.
It has no more shareholders. The only members of the company are the policyholders.
Subclause 21 sets out in detail the final
steps ta be taken by a company after it has
acquired all its stock by purchase and converts from an ordinary stock company into
a mutual company. But before this step can
be taken a company is required ta have
completed all of the following requirements:
(1) It must have acquired all of its stock.
There must be no stock outstanding.
(2) It must have written down on its books
the shares so acquired to their par value.
This is required by subclause 16.
(3) It must have retired and cancelled all
of the stock by resolution of the board of
directors.
The company then becomes a mutual company, having as its members all of the policyholders of the company, and the directors
shall then pass the necessary bylaws ta
entirely organize it into a mutual company.
Subclause 22 is a very interesting one. Incidentally, I understand it has been approved
by the taxing authorities. The sole purpose
of this clause is ta place all shareholders
in exactly the same position financially and
income-taxwise as such shareholders would be
if they had sold and disposed of their shares
in the open market. There is no doubt that
insurance companies, in order ta mutualize
and purchase their own shares, will have ta
use reserves on which income tax has nat
been paid. That may as well be admitted.
But I do not suppose that any shareholder
would offer his stock ta a life insurance company, knowing that he would be taxed on
part of the purchase price: he would sell it
in the open market, because what he received
in the open market would be tax free. All
this clause does is ta place the shareholder
who sells his stock ta the company in
exactly the same position as the shareholder
who sells his stock in the open market. I
do not think that that provision can be
criticized.
Clause 5 simply repeals clause 98 of the
act, which, in the opinion of the Department of Justice, is no longer required. Clause
6 is something which has been added. It
repeals subsection 3 of section 99 of the act
and substitutes a new subsection. It is the
one clause in the bill which does not in
any way relate ta an insurance company.
It has to do with Canadian fraternal benefit
societies which have been incorporated by
special act of the dominion Parliament. The
present act requires such societies ta set up
and maintain separate funds with respect ta
insurance written on adult members and with
respect ta insurance written on dependent

SENATE
children of members. When benefit societies
of this kind were incorporated, years ago,
everyone was of the opinion, and justly,
that there should be two separate funds,
because at that time the mortality rate
amongst infant children was rather high.
That condition has changed; the mortality
rate has dropped; and the department has
seen fit to decide that these societies should
have to maintain only one fund, that there
is no further need for them to operate two
funds. The operation of two funds involved
needless expense and created certain investment difficulties with respect to the infant
funds, because of the fact that at times there
was only a small amount in the infant
funds available for investment. By putting
all the money into one fund, societies will
have more money available for investment
at any one time, and they will be relieved
of a certain amount of bookkeeping. The
change will be brought about by a very
simple method, namely, by having the boards
of directors of the societies concerned pass
the necessary bylaw.
I might state, from information gained in
discussing this particular section with officers
of the Department of Insurance, that, so far
as the department has been able to ascertain,
all benefit societies are in favour of this
amendment.
That is all I have to say with respect to
this bill. I want to thank honourable senators
for the attention they have given me. If
there is anything I have not explained to
their satisfaction I shall be very glad to
answer any questions, or, if I am unable
to answer them, we can, I am sure, have
them answered in committee tomorrow
morning.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I wish to say only a very few
words with respect to this bill. First, may I
congratulate the honourable senator from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) on the splendid
explanation he has given. He has gone into
the bill very carefully, and if we did not
know everything about it when we came
to the house this evening, I am sure we
are well informed on it at this time.
I rise for two reasons: first to congratulate
the honourable senator, and, second, to say
that I regret that this bill was not introduced
in the first instance in this house. It is a
type of legislation which should originate with
the Senate. There is no question of its being
a money bill; it relates to matters on which
honourable senators are well qualified to give
the Canadian public the benefit of their
advice and experience. We have in this house
a number of lawyers who are exceptionally
well versed in insurance law. I do not say that

they could have prepared this bill any better
than it has been drafted, but I contend that
if this bill had been introduced first in this
house we would now know, from officers of
the Department of Justice, whether it is
intra vires of the Parliament of Canada. I
say we would know now, meaning at this
stage of the bill; we would have discussed
that question and settled it in this chamber,
and then, it having been so settled, we would
have sent the bill to the other house. But now,
what position are we in? We had before us
this very important question of civil rights,
and all that is available to us is a statement
by a witness-not from the Department of
Justice, but from the Department of Insurance-in the committee, and with no
supporting documents, that the legislation is
intra vires. Here is what he said on being
questioned in the Banking and Commerce
Committee of the other house:
I might say that the constitutional aspects of the
clause were considered carefully by the Department
of Justice.
How does he know whether or not they
were considered carefully by the Department
of Justice? He goes on to say:
And they have assured usThat is they have assured the Department
of Insurance, I presume; certainly they have
not assured the committeethey have assured us what is proposed is intra vires.
Honourable senators, that is not satisfactory;
and in my opinion the bill should not receive
second reading and be passed by the house
upon an opinion such as that, which is certainly not first-hand information. So, I say,
it might have been much better if honourable
senators who are solicitors and well versed
in the law, and other members of the house
who are directors of insurance companies,
having had wide experience of life insurance
matters, had been given an opportunity of
considering this bill before it was passed by
the other house.
The main principle in this bill is the
proposed right of joint stock companies, life
insurance companies, to become mutual companies. I might tell honourable senators that
this question of mutualization was considered
by the former administration, and had that
administration been returned to power it
would have introduced a bill to authorize
the mutualization of these companies. But I
will not go further and say that such legislation would have included those other provisions for transferring shares, and so on. The
proposal of mutualization is acceptable to
me, and for that reason I would vote in support of the bill. However, I reserve my right
to question officials of the department when
they appear before our committee.

DECEMBER 16, 1957
Again I wish to commend the honourable
gentleman from Hanover for his explanation
of this bill, and I am very pleased that he
suggested it should be sent to committee.
Hon. T. D'Arcy Leonard: Honourable
senators, I rise to speak on the second reading of this bill because I have an association
with the life insurance business, and on that
account I should pretend at least to have
some knowledge of the subject. I should say
at the outset that the particular company
with which I am connected, the Continental
Life Insurance Company, which was mentioned by the honourable gentleman from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), is not affected by
this legislation. It is a provincially incorporated company, and this bill applies only to
federally incorporated companies. Therefore,
I repeat, this legislation does not apply to my
company, nor does it apply to me personally.
Honourable senators, before dealing with
the bill itself I should like to join with my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) in
complimenting the honourable senator from
Hanover upon his very comprehensive and
lucid exposition of the bill.
I also wish to join with the honourable
senator from Hanover in his felicitations to
His Honour the Speaker, which I am sure
are shared by all members of this house.
As my honourable leader said, the main
principle in this legislation is that of transforming a life insurance company into a
mutual insurance company, a process which
is appropriately described by the word
"mutualization". The scheme and plan for
mutualization is set out in section 4 of the
bill, which enacts a new section 90A of the
act. I am in complete agreement and accord
with that principle. I think it is desirable
to have on our statute books a general piece
of legislation which will enable any Canadian life insurance company that desires to
mutualize to follow a plan or scheme for
that purpose. The section, as carefully explained by the honourable senator from
Hanover, is designed to protect both the
policyholders and the shareholders, requiring
as it does the consent of the Minister and
of the Treasury Board. As I say, I am in
agreement with the principle of that section.
May I say, however, that I am sorry to see
incorporated in the bill the provisions of
section 3, enacting a new section 16A to the
act, a section which enables the directors of
a company to allow or to refuse to allow a
transfer to non-residents.
First of all, in my opinion that section has
nothing to do with mutualization, and the
provisions of the bill dealing with mutualization are quite adequate and cover the whole
subject without the enactrnent of section 3.

That is a section which stands by itself and
deals purely with the question of transfer of
shares from residents to non-residents. As
far as I know, this is a precedent in general
company legislation in Canada, and I think
it is an undesirable precedent.
The honourable senator from Hanover gave
us several instances, one involving the Hudson's Bay Company. He also referred to the
fact that there might be legislation granting
sinilar powers in some European countries.
I am not familiar with those provisions. I
think anyone who has had experience as a
lawyer in company organization work in Canada knows that private companies very
often do have restrictions on the transfer
of shares. As far as I know, in general
company legislation this will be a precedent
on our statute books. The Hudson's Bay
Company, as we all know, is a company whose
charter goes back to the days of King
Charles II, incorporating "The Governor and
Company of Adventurers of England trading
into Hudson's Bay". It is a royal charter. I
do not think any of the provisions in its
charter are covered by general legislation.
For all I know, although we might find out
differently, the precedents as to European
companies might also not be applicable to our
companies. I do not know of any Canadian,
English or American legislation that is a
precedent for this provision in the case of
life insurance companies. It seems to me
that this section springs from a lack of understanding of the role being played by foreign
investment in Canada, and a lack of appreciation of just what is the place of foreign investment in Canada. We would not be having
the prosperity that we have today, we would
not be having the expansion in employment
we are having today, had it not been for the
contribution, particularly in the last few
years, made by the investment of foreign
capital.
The preliminary report of the Gordon Commission dealt with that. A good many submissions were made to the commission on
this subject, and if I may I shall read from
page 86 dealing with foreign capital investment in Canada. I quote the relevant part:
Canada has always welcomed the investment of
foreign capital and has benefited greatly and will
continue to benefit from the foreign capital that
has been invested here. To date Canada has not
been able to generate enough capital herself to
take care of all her requirements, Including the
requirements of the resource and manufacturing
industries, during periods of rapid growth. It is
obvious that without foreign investinent the rate
of growth and development in Canada would have
been much slower.

To give one example of that, let us take the
Canadian national income figures for the year
1956. We had a great expansion in that year,

SENATE
due in large measure to our capital investment. Our capital investment is the amount
of our production that is going into new and
permanent assets for Canada, such as mines,
factories, roads, schools, housing, hospitals,
and all such capital assets of a lasting nature.
Out of our total national production of approximately $30 billion, a very high percentage, 25 per cent, or approximately $74
billion, went into production of these capital
assets or capital investments. Now, ordinarily,
a country can only finance its capital investments out of its own savings or by drawing
upon foreign resources. The savings of the
Canadian people in 1956 were approximately
$6.1 billion, or $1.4 billion short of the amount
that was put into capital investment, and we
financed that deficit by drawing upon our
foreign resources. Had we not done so our
capital production would have been a great
deal less than it was, our employment would
have been that much less, with consequently
less prosperity, or alternatively, we would
have had a far greater measure of inflation
than we have had.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Yes, indeed.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I wonder if the honourable gentleman realizes that the Gordon report
made a recommendation with respect to the
transfer of shares.
Hon. Mr. Leonard: Yes, honourable senator,
I do, and I shall deal with it later.
The next point I want to make is that when
foreign capital comes into this country, it is
of course completely subject to our laws and
our jurisdiction, so that if it in any way does
not act in the interests of Canada, or if it is
in any way detrimental to the interests of
Canada, then we have just as effective control
over it as over our own businesses or over our
own resources. For example, in the case of
companies such as International Nickel, General Electric, or Imperial Oil, where the
majority shareholding control is outside of
Canada, those companies are, in their operations and in their business, subject to our
laws and to our jurisdiction. Similarly, in
the life insurance business, approximately 30
per cent of Canadian life insurance business
is now done by non-resident companies, that
is, by companies other than Canadian companies, and yet those companies are subject to
the same supervision and inspection by the
same department, that is the Department of
Insurance, as are our Canadian life insurance
companies, so that in the conduct of their
business here and for the protection of their
policyholders they are subject to the laws and
the jurisdiction of Canada.

The honourable senator from Hanover made
reference to the fact that some seven Canadian life insurance companies have been
taken over by foreign interests in the last
few years. Perhaps he would permit me to
make a slight correction for the record. I
think he said that the Continental Life was
taken over in 1945. As I happen to be connected with that company, I can say that
the year was 1955 when the controlling
interest was acquired by the Zurich Insurance Company, a company doing business
in a great many parts of the world, and well
and favourably known in Canada for a great
many years.
Honourable senators, may I point out three
things in connection with companies such as
Continental Life and others, of which I
have some knowledge? In the first place,
notwithstanding the change of control and
acquisition by foreign investment interests,
those companies are still subject to the same
inspection and control as they were previously; there has been no change in that
respect whatsoever. In the second place, I
think all those seven transactions would
have taken place even if this section 3 of
the bill had been on the statute books, because this section is purely an enabling one,
enabling the prevention of new transfers;
and I believe I am correct in saying that in
all those cases the change in control was
brought about by the directors of Canadian
companies, and indeed by the shareholders
of such companies. So that obviously when
they were in favour of the transfer of control
to non-resident investors they would not
have prevented the transfer of shares.
Finally, speaking again from my own
experience, I think that the result of those
transactions is beneficial to Canada, for it
not only brings money into the country, but
I believe it will strengthen the position of
the policy holders of those companies,
enabling better service to be given to them,
and it will provide greater opportunities for
Canadian life insurance agents and Canadian
management. Therefore, the result is not
in any way detrimental to the interests of
the country.
May I add one or two other comments as
to this section 3. It is true it is purely
enabling. It may be that no Canadian company will take advantage of it-and I hope
that will be the case-but nevertheless, it is
an invitation and confers rather a blessing on
discrimination against non-residents; and one
result which I think may flow from it is that
it will create two markets for the shares of
the company that does act under the section.
A non-resident shareholder will be able to
transfer his shares to anybody in the world,
to a Canadian or anybody else. A Canadian

DECEMBER 16, 1957

shareholder will be able to transfer them
only to another Canadian. Now, the natural
result, one would think, is that shares now
held by non-residents would continue to be
held by non-residents, and would be transferred among non-residents and probably
would command a premium over the shares
held by Canadian residents where the ability
to transfer is restricted.
May I now come to the Gordon report, about
which the senator from Hanover asked me a
question. Dealing with this question of
foreign investment in Canada, the Gordon
Commission made a number of suggestions:
one, for example, being that it would be
desirable for foreign companies operating subsidiaries in Canada to allow Canadian participation in shareholdings, and to permit, say,
20 or 25 per cent of the shares of the Canadian company to be held by Canadians. I
think there would be almost unanimous agreement among Canadians as to the desirability
of that. I think it would be in the interests
of the foreign companies themselves to permit
that participation. But it seems to me inconsistent and rather insincere if at the same
time that we are urging non-resident companies to permit Canadian participation in
those companies we, on the other hand, say
we do not want you to invest in our companies.
It might well be that such a provision as
section 3 could be pointed to by non-resident
companies as indicating a reason why they
should not allow participation by us in their
enterprises.
Now, after the Gordon Commission report
deals with suggested participation by Canadians in non-resident companies, it goes on
to refer particularly to Canadian chartered
banks and life insurance companies. I shall
read from page 93 of the commission's preliminary report on this subject:

at that, a restriction against voting is, in my
view, very much less objectionable than the
provision that is contained in this bill,
because I believe that most of the investments in Canadian life companies have not
been what we call hot money, but have been
long-term investment money, the type of
foreign investment which is desirable for us
to have. Just as foreigners who invest in
debentures, bonds or securities in Canadian
companies have no voting rights, so there
might not be the same objection to investment in shares where the voting rights did
not go with the ownership of the shares.
Certainly, in my opinion it is far less objectionable than is the provision in this bill
which is intended to prevent investment by
non-residents.
To sum up, I may say that with the main
purpose of the bill namely, mutualization, I
am quite in accord, but I do wish to express
my regret at what I think is a rather narrow,
protectionist and short-sighted provision in
the bill which discriminates against foreign
investments in Canada.

of Canada in the future would be ineligible to vote.
This restriction should not be applied to existing
non-resident holders of such shares.

(Text):
Hon. Calveri C. Pratt: Honourable senators,
I shall take only a few moments of your
time. This is a complex bill, and I for one
have not had an opportunity of studying it.
We have had a clear explanation of the
legislation by the honourable senator from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) which I followed
with a great deal of interest.
During the course of the honourable
senator's explanation I raised a question with

(Translation):
Hon. J. Eugene Lefrançois: Honourable
senators, I do not intend to delay concurrence in the bill.
I would like, first, to congratulate His
Honour the Speaker of the Senate upon his
appointment, which he well deserves and,
even more, to congratulate those who
appointed him to preside over this Chamber's discussions with such dignity.
As a director of one of the most important
mutual benefit companies not only of Canada
but of the whole American continent, I may
say that this measure to amalgamate adult
and children insurance funds is a most
Foreign ownership of the stocks of the Canadian commendable one. This bill is the happy

which are incorporated under Canadian law, Is not the years to that effect.
particularly large at the present time. It is desirOn behalf of the mutual benefit companies
able that Canadian control of these institutions be
maintained. The Commission suggests, therefore, I take pleasure in the fact that such a
taken to prevent any measure has been introduced and I will
that appropriate action be
substantial measure of control of the chartered
banks and of the life Insurance companies from surely vote in favour of the bill. In giving it
honourable senators will
coming into the possession of non-residents. One their approval
way in which this might be accomplished would be render great service to the mutual benefit
to provide by statute that any shares in such
institutions which were acquired by non-residents companies of Canada.

Personally, I would prefer that there not
be even any restriction against voting. Certainly, I think if any such restriction were
to be put into legislation, there would have
to be more evidence of the situation which
the Gordon Commission thought might
require some action. As the commission
report says, "Foreign ownership ... is not'particularly large at the present time." But even

SENATE
regard to his citing the Hudson's Bay Company of England as being restrictive in its
transfer of shares to those who are not residents of Great Britain. It is quite true that a
company can have in its charter a clause
which permits such restrictions as have been
referred to; but it would be quite another
matter for the Parliament of England to pass
a law which would place a company, or a
class of companies, in a position to restrict
transfer of shares such as is envisaged in
this bill.
Personally, I do not agree with the policy
of restriction of share transfers to non-residents as proposed by the bill, except under
extraordinary circumstances. There may be
sone justification for it with life insurance
companies, but at the moment I cannot see it.
Interference with the liberties of non-residents in their investments in Canada, simply
because they are non-residents, could be very
harmful to Canadian development. If that
should become a trend of the times-and
there seems to be some indication of it these
days-it would lead us into great difficulty.
Whether this particular phase of the bill
with reference to shares held by non-residents
is representative or not of such a trend, or is
merely to provide for special circumstances,
I do not know; but I entirely agree with the
sentiments expressed by the honourable
senator from Toronto-Rosedale (Hon. Mr.
Leonard), that it is very dangerous for us to
set up legislation which can be construed by
persons outside Canada as being discriminatory, and which will dispel the idea that
prevails generally as to the fair treatment of
investments in Canada.
Some years ago I had a very interesting
experience in London, England. While there,
I learned, through the officials of Canada
House, of a very large company which carried
on international operations. That company
was looking for a country in which to extend
its industry. I was informed that it had
investigated several countries: One country
mentioned to me offered better natural advantages than Canada for the particular
industry, but the company was not sure what
kind of reception it would get there; another
country offered certain physical advantages,
but it was looked upon as being unstable.
The company, after investigating four or five
countries and spending a great deal of money
on surveys, decided to come to Canada. I
had two or three conversations with persons
interested in that company, and the reason
they decided to come to Canada, as it was
explained to me, was that they were sure
there would be no discrimination against
non-resident investments, that our laws were
stable and could be relied on, that the Canadian people, unlike the people of some other

countries, did not demand restrictions for one
reason or another after an industry became
established.
Now, honourable senators, we all know
there are many countries which have very
great natural resources-some have more
natural resources than Canada has-but many
of these countries do not get the flow of
capital necessary for their development, because there is no confidence in them. While
I do not want to overemphasize this particular aspect here as applying to this bill,
nevertheless it is something we have to be
very careful about, for if we put restrictive
laws into effect, measures whereby the flow
of capital into the country can be restricted
in one way or another, they will certainly
count very much to the detriment of Canada
in the development of its industries.
I just want to make that point, because it
will be regrettable if an impression grows
that we are not inviting capital from abroad
into our industries; and if there is any
lessening of confidence that non-resident investment will be fairly treated, nothing would
retard the progress of Canada more than that.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I have a few remarks to make about this
bill, but before doing so I am going to follow
the example of the honourable senator from
Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt) and propose to
start with something that is not in the bill
at all, and that is to mention the fact that
our dear friend the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) celebrated an anniversary
yesterday. Every one of us here, no matter
on what side we may sit in this house, has the
warmest affection and respect for him and
we hope he will live to have many similar
anniversaries in the future.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Perhaps I should say
a second thing for the particular benefit of
the honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner), and that is that I am
neither a director nor a shareholder of any
of the insurance companies which are to be
affected by this bill.
I think there is general agreement among
the honourable senators who have spoken
-and I have nothing to say against their
point of view-on two of the three principles which are incorporated in this bill.
As the honourable senator from Hanover
so clearly explained, section 2 really contains only a requirement that a majority of
the directors of any insurance company falling under this bill shall be residents of
Canada. I do not think that any of us object
to that and I think it will meet with general
approval.

DECEMBER 16, 1957
Then of course there is the very long and
very complicated section, which was so adequately and exhaustively explained by the
honourable senator from Hanover, permitting
a stock life insurance company to mutualize
itself by following the procedure laid down
in the bill; that procedure seems to me to be
very complete and to take account in fairness
and equity of all the circumstances which
might arise in the event of an insurance
company that is now a stock company desiring to mutualize itself.
What controversy there has been in this
bouse this evening has related to section 3
which, as the honourable senator from
Hanover explained, is a permissive section,
permitting the directors of a Canadian life
insurance company to refuse to allow the
transfer of shares of that company to nonresidents of Canada. I listened with a great
deal of interest and attention to my honourable friend from Toronto-Rosedale (Hon.
Mr. Leonard), and to my honourable friend
from St. John's West (Hon. Mr. Pratt), and
with a great deal that they had to say on
that subject I find myself to be in agreement.
But there is another angle to it, in the light
of which I do not see so much objection
to that section as they appear to see.
After all, honourable senators, let us take
the case of one of our really big national
life insurance companies such as the Sun
Life Assurance Company of Canada or the
Canada Life Assurance Company. Would it
not be a tremendous shock to public opinion
to find that some day control of either of
these companies had left Canada and gone to
some other country by reason of the purchase of a majority stock interest in the
company?
Now, there are two things that I want to
say about that. The first is that that is not
a hypothetical question that I have asked,
because it is well known that that very question arose a few years ago in connection with
the Sun Life Assurance Company.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I ask a question? Are
you sure the majority of the stock is not
owned outside of Canada now?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, yes. But an attempt was made by New York interests a few
years ago to purchase majority stock control
of the Sun Life Assurance Company, and it
would have been a poor thing for Canada as
a whole if the interests which attempted
to get control of that company at that time
had in fact acquired control.
Now, the reason why attempts of that kind
might be made bas a bearing upon this question of mutualization. Honourable senators
know that the old-established life insurance

companies in Canada started as stockholders'
companies, with a very small amount of capital
by our present standards-$1 million or $2
million-and that as those companies have
developed over the years the interests of the
policyholders have expanded, in some cases
into thousands of millions of dollars, while
the stock of these companies has remainded at
the comparatively small amount at which it
stood when the companies were originally incorporated, many years ago. So that it was,
and still is, rather a temptation to people
who feel that by putting up $5 million or $10
million to acquire majority stock control of
one of our Canadian life insurance companies
they can in fact acquire control of assets
worth hundreds and, in some cases, thousands
of millions of dollars.
I agree with my honourable friends who
have preceded me that, as a general principle,
restrictions on foreign investments in Canada
should be discouraged; and I do not think
that I would support the provision contained
in clause 3 of this bill, were it not that, as
the honourable senator from Hanover bas
stated, it is merely permissive. In the particular incident to which I refer, it would
have been very helpful if the directors of the
Sun Life Assurance Company at that time
had been able to say to those interests that
were endeavouring to acquire stock control,
"No, we will refuse to register your stock."
From that point of view I think there is
something to be said for inserting a provision
of this kind into the proposed legislation; and
I direct the attention of the honourable sena(Hon. Mr.
tor from Toronto-Rosedale
Leonard) to the fact that it bas nothing to do,
at least in my opinion, with preventing additional American or other foreign capital from
coming into this country. What it may do is
to prevent American or foreign capital from
substituting itself for Canadian capital which
is already invested here. So from that point
of view I do not regard his argument on this
head as quite as valid as the other arguments
he advanced.
I am glad to know that the sponsor of the
bill intends to move its reference to committee. It is pre-eminently a bill which
should be studied by us in committee. Also
I am very glad that my leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald), made the observation that this is
obviously a bill which should have originated
in this chamber.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it is moved by the Honourable Senator
Brunt, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Pearson, that this bill be now read the second
time. Is it your pleasure, honourable senators,
to adopt the motion?

SENATE

REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Brunt, the bill was
referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.
EXCISE TAX BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 231, to amend
the Excise Tax Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I move the second reading now. I shall not
take very long in explaining it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is not much
to it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As I say, it will not take
me long to explain it. The purpose of the bill
is to cut the excise tax on automobiles from
10 to 71 per cent. The net result will be a
reduction in revenue of approximately $20
million a year. I do not propose that the bill
shall go to committee unless somebody wants
it sent there: I do not think it is worth while.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: There are not
many words to this bill. It was supposed to
be a very important measure, and I understand the purpose of it was to ease the condition of unemployment which exists in the
country. If my assumption is wrong, I stand to
be corrected. The bill reduces the excise tax
on automobiles from 10 per cent to 73 per
cent. Why were automobiles singled out?
A great many articles carry an excise tax
of 10 per cent, but for some reason or other
only the tax on automobiles has been reduced
from 10 per cent to 71 per cent. I repeat, the
only purpose of making this reduction was to
improve the condition of employment in the
automobile industry.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: And to reduce the price
of automobiles.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: To reduce the price
of automobiles?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes; the reduction is
passed on to the purchaser.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understand that
the result will be that a person who buys

an automobile for $3,000, and pays cash for
it, will have the price reduced by $50.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Seventy-five dollars.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I will take my friend's
word that it is $75. Was the purpose of the
bill to save someone, who is buying an automobile for the first time, $75? No, honourable
senators, the purpose was to reduce unemployment; and unemployment, since this
legislation was first announced, has increased
instead of decreased. The lowering of the
excise tax from 10 per cent to 71 per cent
bas not put one man to work. A year agoin November 1956-257,000 people were out
of work; on November 7 last 327,000 people
were out of work. How many are unemployed now, I do not know. It is to be noted
that the last monthly figures for unemployment were brought down on November 7; and
although, as I understand it, the returns are
to be made each month, for some reason or
other, although it is now the 16th day of
December, no figures on more recent
unemployment have yet been issued.
Honourable senators, I am not emphasizing
the condition of unemployment in Canada.
I am merely saying that this bill has not
served the purpose for which it was introduced. If the Government admits that there
is a grave condition of unemployment in this
country-and they must admit it or they
would not introduce this bill-then this bill
does nothing to relieve that serious situation.
I ask the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig), what is to be the next step to
relieve unemployment in Canada?
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I think the honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) is expecting
results too quickly. There is no doubt at all
in my mind that this legislation will aid
employment in the automobile industry. It
was suggested that people were refraining
from buying cars because they expected some
slight reduction would be made in the excise
tax on cars. Well, $50 to $100, depending on
the price of cars, is a considerable reduction.
I think it is entirely wrong to say that this
legislation has not relieved the unemployment
situation. I noticed in the press just the other
day that one of the large automobile manufacturers-I do not know whether it was
the Chrysler Corporation or General Motors
-had to call a large number of men back
to work. It is true that there is a certain
percentage of unemployment today, but this
bas been so down through the years. I read
in an article only today that even at the very
peak of prosperity there were 1.7 per cent
unemployed. During the winter months there
is always a certain amount of unemployment
in Canada. I think it is entirely wrong to

DECEMBER 16, 1957
say that this measure is designed solely to
aid the employment situation. It may be said
to aid employment in the automobile industry, and I think it has accomplished that.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Question!
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall the bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Next sitting.
INCOME TAX BILL
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill No. 232, to
amend the Income Tax Act.
The bill was read the first time.

living expenses as a deductible item for income tax purposes, provided he continues to
maintain his residence in Ottawa.
Another amendment in the bill increases
from $20,000 to $25,000 the first level of corporation income which is subject to a tax rate
of 18 per cent. In other words, at the present
time the rate of taxation paid by a corporation
is 18 per cent on earnings up to $20,000. The
amendment would increase the amount from
$20,000 to $25,000 on which the lower rate of
18 per cent would apply.
Honourable senators, those are the amendments. The bill is clear and it is easily understood. It is largely a matter of reducing the
income tax of people in the low income
brackets. There is no doubt about that. The
legislation will result in some 70,000 taxpayers
being taken off the tax roll. I admit that they
now are small tax contributors, but at least
they will no longer be contributing. I am sure
that they are the people we should all be
thinking about, especially in these days of
high living costs. The bill is aimed at assisting
that income class.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) bas given a good explanation
of the bill, but I would like to have an opportunity for further consideration of some of
its amendments. I therefore move adjournment of the debate.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Macdonald, the
debate was adjourned.

SECOND READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
move the second reading now.
The purpose of this bill is to provide certain
reductions in the field of income tax. The

will recall that he is Chairman of the Standing Committee on Natural Resources, which
was called to meet tomorrow. I have also
heard that the minister who presides over
the department concerned, and who, I observe
by reference to the notes of the committee's
proceedings last week, was to have given
evidence at the next meeting, cannot attend
tomorrow. Furthermore, I notice that a number of honourable senators who are very
interested in the subject matter are not here
this week. My question to the honourable
Leader of the Government is: In view of
what I have stated, is it his intention to
proceed with the meeting of the Natural
Resources Committee tomorrow?
Hon. John T. Haig: I thank the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald)
for the information he has just given us. I
should not like the committee to meet in the
absence of its chairman; first, because the
bill which it bas under consideration is quite
a contentious one; and second, because the
chairman bas had the handling of the bill
since it was referred to the committee. I know
that one honourable senator on this side of
the bouse cannot attend tomorrow, and for
the same reason which detains the honourable senator from Kennebec. I suggest that I
be permitted to advise the Chief Clerk of
Committees to notify the parties concerned
that the discussion in committee will be adjourned for three weeks. The matter cannot
be suspended for any lesser time because of
the holidays. The Senate will reassemble on
the first Tuesday of January, so the committee could be held on Wednesday, the day
following. With the consent of honourable
senators I shall give the necessary notice.
Hon. Senalors: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have never had to deal
with a similar situation in this bouse before,
but I will take it for granted that, unless
there is objection from the floor, I have
authority to speak to the Chief Clerk of Committees and ask him to postpone this meeting
and give the necessary notice that it will be
held three weeks from tomorrow.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.

Haig for the second reading of Bill 232, to
amend the Income Tax Act.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators will recall that last night the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig) explained this bill, entitled an Act
to amend the Income Tax Act, which was
passed by the other bouse.
As the honourable leader explained, the
bill contains three or four features. I will go
over them briefiy but not necessarily in the
order in which they appear. The first provision with which I wish to deal is one
whereby employees in construction companies
will be given an allowance under the Income
Tax Act for expenses incurred by them when
working away from home. In certain construction work the actual employment takes place
away from the worker's place of residence,
and as a result he is required, while maintaining his residence in his own community, to
pay board and lodging at the point where he
is working. For a number of years these employees were allowed the expenses of board
and lodging as a deductible item when computing their income tax. Then the law was
changed, I believe for one year. As I understand it, the purpose of the amendment under
discussion is to make it clear that expenses
incurred by a worker under these circumstances can be deducted from his earnings
for income tax purpose.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Another amendment
to which I would refer is the one which
increases from $20,000 to $25,000 the first
level of income which is subject to a tax rate
of 18 per cent in the case of incorporated
companies. The present provision is that an
incorporated company having taxable profits
of $20,000 or more pays taxes at the rate of
20 per cent-that is, 18 per cent, plus the 2
per cent old age security tax-on the $20,000,
plus 47 per cent on the profits in excess of
that amount. This bill provides that the 20
per cent rate shall apply to profits up to
$25,000.
I wish to refer to one other provision,
namely, with respect to personal income tax.
At the present time, on the first $1,000 of

SECOND READING
Another provision deals with deductions for

adjourned debate on the motion of Hon. Mr. the present time a taxpayer who is a parent is

DECEMBER 17, 1957
allowed a taxable deduction of $150 for each
child receiving the family allowance. Under
this bill such a taxpayer will be allowed to
deduct $250 for each child.
Another provision applies to the taxpayer
who is supporting dependents. At present such
a taxpayer can deduct from his income, in
order to arrive at the base on which he pays
taxation, $400 for each dependent person, and
this amount is being increased to $500.
Honourable senators, from what I recall
was said last evening by the Leader of the
Government, I think those are the main provisions of the bill.
At the outset, I must say that so far as I
am concerned this bill is very disappointing
because of the manner in which it
-first,
was introduced into the other bouse. I am
fully aware that I cannot refer to debates
that took place in that bouse, but I can refer
to documents that were tabled there. As
honourable senators know, when a budget is
introduced into Parliament the resolutions
are tabled in the other house and then
referred to the committee of ways and means,
and in this way a balance sheet is produced
to the country. When that is done we all
know just where the country stands
financially, and we can then decide whether
there should be reductions or increases in
taxation. But at present, honourable senators, we are flying blind; we do not know
whether our finances are sound enough to
warrant these deductions; we do not know
whether they are sound enough to permit of
even greater reductions. We are not told
anything. I think this is the first time that
such a condition has prevailed in this country, namely that taxes are being reduced
without Parliament's knowing what the
effect is going to be on the financial structure
of the nation. As a general principle it can
be stated that each and every one of us is
in favour of lower taxation-we all would
like to have our taxes reduced-but we do
want to know just what the financial standing of our country is.
Honourable senators, I repeat that never
before in the history of this country has there
been a reduction in taxation without a financial statement being presented to the people.
In this case, we know nothing about it, and
I think that is regrettable. The people of
Canada were entitled to have a budget presented, so that it could be examined in
Parliament, and so that they would know on
what basis changes were being made. We
have not got that, and we are voting for this
bill-I think each and every one of us will
vote for it. I intend to do so. However, I
say to the Leader of the Government that he
should insist on his Government bringing
down the financial statement in the House of

Commons at the earliest possible date, so that
we shall know where the country stands.
Now, honourable senators, just a few more
words with respect to some of these reductions. At the opening of my remarks I referred to the fact that this bill provides that
incorporated
companies
having
taxable
profits up to $25,000 a year will now be taxed
at the rate of 20 per cent, which rate previously applied only to companies whose
taxable profits did not exceed $20,000. That
is all right for companies making between
$20,000 and $25,000; they will get some benefit from this bill. But throughout the last
election, and prior to it, this Government said
that we were forgetting the little man. Well,
what about the little man? We are ignoring
him. I say that the little man is forgotten
entirely in this proposed legislation. What
about the little man who runs the corner
grocery store and has incorporated and makes
$10,000 a year? He will get no benefit from
this. What about the man who sets up what
we will call a family company, and which
makes $5,000, $10,000, $15,000 or $20,000?
Such a company will receive no benefit from
the provisions of this bill. The only ones who
will get any benefit are companies making over
$20,000. And the amount of profits taxable
at reduced rates doesn't stop at $25,000; even
companies that make $1 million or more will
benefit. The big companies will benefit,
while the little companies remain the forgotten companies of Canada.
Honourable senators, this bill is a disappointment to me in respect of the benefits it
gives to the families of Canada. I am sure all
honourable senators recollect how during the
last election campaign we were told that
every family in Canada was being overtaxed
to the extent of $120 a year, and that that
situation would be righted if there was a
change of Government. We thought that a
budget would be brought down which would
right this situation. But, no, that bas not
happened. Comparatively speaking, very few
families are getting any benefit whatsoever
from the provisions of this bill; especially is
that true with respect to familles with small
incomes.
Honourable senators, the provisions of this
bill are such that a married man with two
dependants and an income of $3,000 saves in
taxes exactly $13. I remind you again that
we were told every family in Canada was
being overtaxed by $10 a month. This bill
means that the taxpayer finds he is being
overtaxed by only $1.08J a month. That is
what this bill comes down to. In order for a
man to receive a tax reduction of $120, he
would have to qualify as a married man with
two dependants and have an income of

SENATE
$30,000 a year. But, as I say, if he makes
$3,000 his reduction in tax is only $13.
Honourable senators, I will not go on at
greater length. I repeat that the provisions
of this bill with respect to reductions in
personal income tax benefit those who have
large incomes; and the reductions in corporation income tax benefit only those whose incomes are over $20,000. In both instances,
may I say, the little people of Canada are
being forgotten.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Honourable senators,
I would like to ask a question of the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Haig). Why is it that construction workers
are singled out for this most generous treatment, with no consideration being given to
other citizens of Canada who find themselves
in a like position? Would you answer that,
please?
The Hon. the Speaker: I must warn honourable senators that if the honourable Leader of
the Government speaks again he will close
the debate.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: Mr. Speaker, may I not
have my question answered?
The Hon. the Speaker: The Leader of the
Government may answer the question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I shall answer the question.
The bill provides that those engaged in the
building trade will be allowed to deduct
certain expenses for the cost of food and so
on while away frorn home, provided they still
maintain their regular establishment as well.
That benefit does not apply to people who
work in the woods or in other occupations.
The idea behind the provision, as I was told,
was that of getting contractors to build houses
where people live, and this was one way of
inducing builders to accept employment in
another area than that where they regularly
work. That is the answer.
Hon. Mr. Hawkins: There are a great many
people who all their lives have had to bear
such extra expenses as those that the construction workers are to be allowed tax
exemption on. I do not know whether the
Leader of the Government regards the answer
as satisfactory, but from my point of view
it is not.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
if no one else wishes to speak on the bill, I
shall close the debate.
I do not intend to indulge in any lengthy
reply to my honourable friend the Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). He
has cited the case of a married man with two
children, earning $3,000. That man at the
present time gets a basic exemption of $2,000
because he is married, and an exemption of

$100 for each child, making a total of $2,200.
Therefore, he pays a tax on $800 at 13 per
cent, which amounts to about $104.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He pays $13.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, he pays 13 per cent
on the first $1,000 of taxable income. I am
giving you the law as it now stands.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: In the example I
gave he was earning $3,000.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am taking the exemptions
off.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Then he pays $13.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, he pays 13 per cent on
the taxable income, which is $800.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not like to have
to interrupt my honourable friend, but I am
referring to a table that the Minister of
Finance produced in the other house on
December 6, which statement I am prepared
to accept, wherein he said that a married
man with two dependents and earning $3,000
pays a tax of $13.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is 13 per cent, not $13.
Under the new proposal that taxpayer is
allowed an extra $100 for each child to
start with. That means he will pay taxes
on $600, at the rate of 11 per cent, which is
$66.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I still accept the
statement made by the Minister of Finance.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Whether this is a tax for
the rich or the poor, it is interesting to
note that by its enactment 70,000 persons
will be taken off the tax roll. That is to
say, 70,000 taxpayers in Canada will go
off the tax roll; and they are not rich men
who are going off, they are little fellows.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: At $13 a year.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It makes no difference
about the $13. To one man $13 may be worth
as much as $1,000 is to another man. To
the millionaire $1,000 is not very much, but
to the man with a wife and family, on an
income of $3,000, a reduction of any amount
means a good deal.
Let us take the question of the private
company. The campaign has always been:
Why did the Government stop at $20,000?
Why not go on? The answer is that the
Government was trying to give protection
to the little man, which it has now done. It
has made the little man's crowd a little
bigger. That is to say, the fellow whose
company used to earn $20,000 a year came in
for the reduction and now the fellow whose
company earns $25,000 is included in that
class. Surely that cannot be said to be a
reduction for the capitalists. If I own a

DECEMBER 17, 1957
company that earns $100,000 a year, the
Government is not trying to protect me, but
if I have a company that earns $25,000,
under this proposed legislation I will not
pay any more than I formerly paid on
$20,000-I get the reduction.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The big company
gets the reduction.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Now, my friend, I left you
alone; you have had your talk.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My facts were
correct.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This is the situation: this
bill is framed to give the little fellow a better chance; that is its whole purpose right
from start to finish. If you read the bill
you cannot point to a single item where the
benefit has not been directed to the little
man. He is the man we want to protect.
As far as I am concerned-and I am speaking on behalf of the Government-I say quite
candidly to you that the theory of the present
Government is that it wants to give the little
man more protection. Any one who practises
law and who has clients come to his office in
the latter days of April to prepare their income tax returns, often wonders why Mr.
Smith or Mr. Jones has to pay income tax.
It may be only $25, it may be only $30, but
I want to tell you fellow members that that
represents a lot of money to a lot of people.
Those are real facts of life.
This bill cannot be criticized on the ground
that it is a capitalistic bill, for it provides
not one iota of assistance for the large taxpayer. You cannot find a capitalist in Canada
who will praise this legislation, not one.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Nor anybody else.
Hon. Mr. Haig: There is not a capitalist in
Canada today, outside of those who may be
anxious to help one political party or the
other, who will say that he likes this legislation purely from his own standpoint. No, he
will not praise this bill. But the little fellow
will praise it. The little fellow who is one of
the 70,000 people who will not have to pay incorne tax will praise the Government, of

course he will.
I can name several members in this chamber who have to pay considerable in the
way of income tax. Do you think there is
any benefit in this legislation for them? No,
there is not, and there is not supposed to be.
Some members have been calling for a
speech on the budget. Well, honourable
senators, we had one budget speech this
year; the former Government brought down
a budget and it estimated that there would
be a surplus of about $150 million. That is
what was forecast. That budget was brought

down, and the year in which it was brought
down is still with us; we are working in
that year right now. Nobody on the Government side, and I do not know how many on
the Opposition side, expected the former Government to be defeated. At least the Government itself did not expect to be defeated,
that's a sure thing, and I am not sure that
the Opposition expected to win, but the fact
is that it did win and now forms the Government. However, there was no provision in the
budget for a situation such as now exists,
in which the Government has only 113 seats.
The Government side is still gaining a little,
I see. In any event, nobody thought that the
new Government would have only that number of seats. There were people who said
that if the Conservatives got 90 seats in the
next Parliament they would be doing well.
Anyone who had said they would get 100
would have been laughed at and described as
"an old Tory who doesn't know any better".
I admit that I myself did not think we wouid
get over 100 seats. I could not see it. But
when I returned home in the month of April,
and certainly by the month of May, I knew
the storm was on. I saw the storm signals,
I saw them coming. I have run a lot of elections and I recognized the storm signals that
were flying at that time, but I did not know
who would be affected by them. However, it
was not very long before I could see that
the Government was going to have pretty
tough going.
But coming back to the budget: when the
budget was drawn up in the spring of 1957,
which is still this year, everything was provided for, and all that the present Government is doing or trying to do is to take care
of what was provided for then. For example,
the former Government agreed to pay the
Civil Service more money, and the present
Government implemented that promise. There
was a promise to pay the members of the
armed forces more money, and the present
Government accepted that promise. There
were other things of that nature, promises
which the Government accepted.
Then there were other matters of some importance that came up from time to time, and
the Honourable the Minister of Finance estimated on the floor of the other chamber we
would have about $80 million surplus instead
of $150 million.
Bringing down a new budget now would
not make any difference. What the Government has done is bring down a poor man's
budget. Honestly, I cannot understand why
men will rise and say that this bill is a rich
man's budget. I can find no evidence of it any
place within the covers of this legislation.

SENATE
Nobody has given me one illustration where
a rich man will save any money through the
provisions of this bill.
True, if my income is of the order of
$20,000 a year, I will pay only 11 per cent
on the first $1,000 instead of 13 per cent, and
on the next $1,000 I will pay 14 per cent
instead of 15 per cent. But, when you are
paying an income tax on $20,000, that saving
does not mean very much. Yet, some think
that this legislation is rotten.
If a person is paying tax on only $1,000 of
income, and gets 2 per cent off that tax, and
for every child or other dependent he is
allowed an additional reduction of $100 in
taxable income, I must say that the saving
in tax would mean a lot to him.
Those are the things I see in this bill,
and I am delighted, outside of politics altogether, that our new Minister of Finance
has shown such a human heart in preparing
this legislation on income tax matters that
he deliberately went out to try to help the
little fellow. The Lord knows we need to
help the little fellow in this world of ours
today; the little fellow needs help very badly,
not only in our country but in practically
every country in the world. So I congratulate
the Minister of Finance in drafting a bill that
will remove so many people from the tax roll.
The number may not be as large as he would
like to have made it, and I know it is not
as large as I would like to have seen it,
but that is the selfishness in me bulging out.
However, when I set aside the selfishness
and think of the other fellow I must say
that this a pretty good bill, for it takes a
lot of little people off the tax rolls. Last
spring a woman came to my office. She
had four children; her husband was working
and she went out cleaning offices at night.
She had to make out an income tax return,
although the total revenue of the both of
them was not $3,000. They had separate
incomes, so her husband had to pay some tax
and she had to pay some. It just made me
wonder when in the world the parliamentarians of Canada would relieve the situation
in which a family of two working people,
with four children, had to pay income tax.
I wondered when that would end. I have
now seen it ended, and I see some relief
for those little people in the future.
I hope the new Minister of Finance, if he
is spared and is still the Minister of Finance
when the next budget comes down, will continue to give reductions to the little fellow,
because the little man needs it and we need
him, and we need to have him prosperous.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Next sitting.
EDUCATION
NECESSITY TO MOBILIZE AND EXPAND
EDUCATIONAL RESOURCESDEBATE CONTINUED
The Senate resumed from Thursday, December 12, the adjourned debate on the
inquiry of Hon. Mr. Cameron drawing the
attention of the Senate to
the necessity for Canada to mobilize and expand
the educational resources of the nation with a
view to maintaining and strengthening her position
as a member of the world community.

Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I moved the adjournment of this debate on
behalf of the honourable senator from
Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr. Croîl).
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
I am prepared to go on at this time, but the
honourable senator from St. Albert (Hon. Mr.
Blais), who does not often address the house,
would like to speak now, and with your indulgence I will follow him.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
(Translation):
Hon. Aristide Blais: Honourable senators,
may I first be allowed to extend a most
cordial greeting to our Speaker and to congratulate him upon the great honour which
has been conferred on him. Mr. Speaker, you
must have had a fairy godmother, or perhaps it was your qualities which attracted
the magic wand. I hope you will enjoy for as
long as you please this great distinction
which reflects upon the whole Senate.
I hope honourable senators will excuse this
bantering which was suggested to me the
other day by the honourable member for
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), when he advised
us to use humour a little more freely in our
discussions, in order to break the monotony
and the austereness of this Chamber.
Honourable senators, I had no intention of
taking part in this debate, even though the
subject holds tremendous appeal for me, because I suffer from a paralysing fear when
it comes to expressing myself in public. But,
with the example of others, the tender grass,
and the temptings of some devil, I too shall
venture to graze a little in the ever green
pastures of education. Frankly speaking, I
am not qualified to do so. I hope that no
one who hears me at this time will be
tempted, like the animals of the fable to
raise a hue and cry over me. But, honourable
senators, in view of your kindliness there is
no limit to the liberties one can take. I shall
therefore proceed according to established
custom.

DECEMBER 17, 1957
Honourable senators, on this question of
education which is still the order of the day,
we have had a most interesting debate, from
the point of view of the value of the speeches
as well as of the personality of some senators
who have the gift of lending grace and colour
to everything they say, and I fear that at
this time, when the subject is well nigh exhausted my feeble contribution may act as
a damper after such an uninterrupted series
of beautiful speeches.
In listening the other day to the excellent
speech of the honourable senator for Banff
(Hon. Mr. Cameron), who opened the debate
with what one might really consider as a
treatise on education, so thoroughly had the
subject been investigated, my memory went
back over the years to that same University
of Alberta, where my honourable friend is a
highly esteemed professor. I have known the
University of Alberta since its foundation,
and had several friends there who were
shrewdly hand-picked by the unique and
lamented Dean, Dr. Marshall Tory who, later,
became one of the most authoritative representatives of education in Canada. One of
these professors, who became an intimate
friend of mine, was Dr. Edouard Sonet, professor of French language and literature. Dr.
Sonet impressed one at first sight by his military bearing and his liveliness. He was a
self-made man in the art of teaching, a real
disciplinarian in his line: you had to learn,
or else! One could very well see him, as a
Cyrano de Bergerac, pursuing fiercely whoever was guilty of misplacing a dot on an
"i" and distributing, right and left, fillips or
compliments to the cadets of Gascogne. His
students worshipped him for his ability and
his vim and he was most successful in his
teaching. He was a great friend of Dr.
Edmund Kemper Broadus who taught English
literature. Dr. Broadus had a most attractive personality and hid his great erudition
under an equally great modesty. He was the
author of a widely read and highly quoted
book, The Story of English Literature,which

From the day of that consultation, I never
ceased admiring this scholarly and very simple
man. What remained with me from our conversation that night was that Dr. Broadus
had the greatest admiration for Francis Bacon
whom he considered as a giant among scholars
and whom he called before his pupils "the
great ancestor of the reform and systematization of the teaching of arts and sciences", and
even, of "the philosophy of his time".
I mention Bacon's name in this discussion
not, believe me, through snobbishness or
literary pedantry, but because he became one
of the masters of his century through his
eloquence and his writings, the form and
substance of which dazzled his contemporaries.
Great men, moreover, are universal. They
are the heritage of the whole human race.
Ben Jonson, one of the keenest critics of his
time, considered Bacon as a genius and praised
his eloquence, his elocution, his chastened,
clear, precise and serious style.
(Text):

In his book entitled the Story of English
Literature, Professor Broadus gives a brief
survey of the life of Francis Bacon, and I
would like to quote from this work as
follows:
Bacon's chief object in his writing was to reorganize the various fields of knowledge and to
work out better methods of study and investigation
in these fields. In every branch of learning, said
Bacon, people were inclined to take too much for
granted. They assumed that every notion or idea
or principle or theory that had been handed down
from the ancients must be true, and that it would
be irreverent to question it . . .
If, Bacon contended, they would keep their eyes
open, and accept nothing that was not proved, and
develop their theories to fit the facts, then and
only then would they begin to get at the truth.
For the greater part of his life Bacon was pondering this problem of the systematization and advancement of learning. "I confess," he wrote to
his uncle, Elizabeth's chief minister, Lord Burghley,
in 1592, "that I have as vast contemplative ends, as
I have moderate civil ends; for I have taken all
knowledge to be my province." It was his hope,
he continued In this letter, to purge learning of its
faults of method and "bring in industrious observations, grounded conclusions, and profitable inventions and discoveries".
Thirteen years later he published the Advancement of Learning, In which, after a defence of the
high dignity of knowledge, he reviews the different
branches of human learning, history, poetry,
philosophy, and science, notes what the mind of
man bas accomplished in each department, points
out what tasks yet remain unperformed, and
analyses the faults of method which stand in the
way. The Advancement of Learning was intended
merely as an introduction to a greater work,

served as the pupils' manual in this subject.
One night, my friend Sonet who was
suffering from the grippe and felt congested
asked me to go up to his apartment on the
campus to examine him. I had the good
fortune to meet there the charming and modest
Dr. Broadus who, according to his habit, had
dropped in to see his friend. When I entered, they were discussing Francis Bacon,
whose teaching they still considered timely.
Feeling that the subject was beyond my depth
I started to take leave. But Sonet explained
his symptoms and after listening to him careInstauratio Magna . . .
fully Dr. Broadus and I both prescribed a
soothing draught, just as Bacon had done in
Well, honourable senators, this was the proborder to reform education.
lem of education in the days of Elizabeth I

SENATE
when Bacon made that survey of the
human knowledge, in proceeding by elimination or table rase as did Descartes, or
Montaigne (1533-1592), before sailing toward
new horizons.
When one compares these modest beginnings with the magnitude of the educational
problems of today, one is bewildered and
wonders if in the haste of producing so
many new teachers there will not be a
tendency to manufacture them in series, as so
many things are produced in the great
republic to the south. Teachers may be
very learned but colourless and lacking in
character and individuality. There will lie
the danger-replacement by robots whose
flame is gone.
We may not have sufficiently considered
the selection of professors and the qualifications required of a good professor. No matter
how many fellowships are created to help
the applicants improve their education and
skill, there is one essential quality which is
not sufficiently recognized and that is selfsacrifice. Teaching is not really a profession
but a vocation. The teacher must have a
perfect knowledge of the pupil's psychology,
his behaviour, his habits, he must be able to
make his course interesting so as to retain
the student's attention and he should constantly check whether his explanation has
been understood and not hesitate to repeat it,
even for the sake of one pupil. And above all
the teacher must gain the confidence of the
pupil; he must become his friend and consider him as the most important element of
the classroom.
Honourable senators, before closing I would,
after other senators, pay tribute to a most
sympathetic and respected figure in the
Senate, the honourable member for Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), for his excellent speech
of December 5, which moved us all so deeply.
We all had the impression of hearing a sage
from ancient Greece, such were the grace and
nobility with which he spoke. It is always a
pleasant surprise to find that, although they
lived so far apart and belonged to different
racial groups, our old parents led the same
kind of life, austere, religious and honest,
where discipline took first place in education
after the fear of the Lord. In those days,
there was little time for effusiveness, which
was considered a weakness of character.
Honourable senators, I beg your forgiveness for having trespassed upon a field in
which I have neither ability nor authority.
My doing so was prompted by the extra-

ordinary circumstances surrounding my meeting with Dr. Broadus and Dr. Sonet and I
hope I shall be forgiven.
(Text):
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators,
first of all I would like to thank the honourable senator from Rigaud (Hon. Mr. Dupuis)
for his courtesy in adjourning the debate and
then allowing me to go ahead. The honourable
senator from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron), in
whose name this motion stands, had intended
to close the debate but be was called West
on a matter of considerable educational importance. He thought he might be back today,
but in view of the possibility of adjournment
on Friday he could not return. He asked me
to make a few comments on matters arising
out of the debate.
We as senators ask ourselves what we can
do about present educational problems. Well,
we know we cannot build schools or universities, but we can contribute to an understanding of the problems and thus we can create
a climate of public opinion. That is what the
honourable senator from Banff has done, and
it was a delight to sit in the house and listen
to his speech that was so well and thoroughly
prepared.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Whether we agree with it
or not does not really matter. He did a considerable amount of research, and what has
been said here on the matter of education will
be read in our universities, high schools and
other places of learning by people who are
interested in the problem. That is a contribution that we in the Senate must not overlook.
I am not going to add to the multiplicity of
arguments. I adopt and I accept what the
honourable senator from Banff said, and the
contribution made by the honourable junior
senator from Winnipeg (Hon. Mr. Wall), which
was also a very good one. I am not minimizing
the other contributions that were made. In
any event, I think the debate has served its
purpose because it has helped it to focus
attention on a very important problem.
The honourable senator from Banff asked
me to reply to a few of the questions that
were raised during the debate. The honourable
senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
Roebuck) inquired how our high schools compare with the Russian high schools. The
answer to that is that the Russian high schools
are much tougher than ours. "Technicons", as
the Russian high schools are called, provide
a four-year course for students, half of whom
are required to have ten years of schooling.
The other half are admitted at the age of 14,
after only seven years of schooling. The
official aim is to limit entry to boys and girls
who have had ten years of schooling.

DECEMBER 17, 1957
One other question was: Why do so many
of our trained personnel leave Canada? The
answer is, because of higher salaries, more
job opportunities, greater scope, better opportunities for promotion. And something else:
there is the thought abroad that a Canadian
can join a large American organization in the
United States, work his way through that
organization, reach fairly high office, and then
find his way to the top of a Canadian subsidiary much more easily than if he had
started in that subsidiary. Yet, in Canada in
the spring of 1957 there were three jobs open
for trained people for every one such person
that was available.
I have a special word for the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig), who made a
great to-do about $3,200 being paid to a
university professor in 1901. He thought that
was pretty good money in those days, and
that the professor did not have much room
to complain. My good friend the senator from
Banff asked me to translate that to you in
today's currency. I agree with his calculations. The wholesale price index has increased
three and a half times since 1901, from 63.7 in
1901 to 226 in 1947. The consumer price index
-there was no consumer price index in 1901
-in 1913 was 49.2; in 1947 it was 123.3, or
two and a half times higher. I have the
figures for 1947, but not for 1957. Now, don't
forget that in 1901 there was no sales tax and
no income tax. You can easily see that in
today's currency that same professor should
be paid $17,650. Well, he doesn't get it. Thus,
it can be seen that salaries in the educational
field have not been maintained.
Honourable senators, there was a suggestion that the amount of money that we pay
on education is much too large. The figures
that were presented by the honourable
senator from Banff were not federal grants
alone, but for federal and provincial aid as a
supplement over and above special grants.
The total contributions to all forms of education in Canada during 1956-57 was $42J
million, and over the last five years it was
$143 million, or $281 million per year. If to
that is added $100 million for the Canada
Council, it makes a total of $243 million in
five years, or an average of $48j million a
year for the next five years. That is not an
outrageous figure. I hope that if there is one
lesson that bas been brought home in this
session it is that we shall not hear too much
talk about, "We can't afford this, and we
haven't got the money for that". I heard that
for a great many years in the House of
Commons and here. Suddenly money was
found available for old age security, for the
disabled and for veterans, and for better
superannuation for civil servants, and further
money to reduce taxes. It is not a shortage of
96702-27

money we are suffering from, but rather the
will to do what can be done with money and
what should be done.
Honourable senators, I am not going to
discuss the British North America Act or
the constitutional question. I am not a constitutional lawyer, and I am not an expert.
I have discussed the subject in the House of
Commons, where there are fewer experts
than in this house. I prefer to stay in my
own class. Every generation has its problems. I know something of political history,
and I faintly remember the problem we had
in the last generation when dealing with
the humanities and there came the cry from
this country, "You cannot do this, the Constitution will not permit it"; or, "This is contrary to the British North America Act." I
remember particularly, and I think all of
you will remember, that the old age pension
act was passed in this house in 1927. One
of the provinces, the good old province of
Quebec, for nine years refused to make
available to its people, or to accept, the old
age pension. That was its right and privilege,
yet Quebec was paying toward the old age
pension for other Canadians. However, that
was the viewpoint of Quebec, and there was
no argument about it.
I am an old municipal hand, and along
with a great many others I pressed the
Minister of Finance very hard to pay taxes
on Government property in the municipalities and the provinces, to stop this business
of being a freeloader. I recall the Minister
of Finance, now Mr. Justice Abbott, saying
to me-and it is a matter of record in the
other house-"You can't do that in Quebec;
Duplessis won't let them accept."
Well,
did he or did he not let them? I said at the
time it did not sound unreasonable to me,
and I suggested we try it. Well, we did
try it: they took it and no harm has come of
it. As a matter of fact, the university grants
were accepted by that province for one
year-under some subterfuge or other;
nevertheless, the money was paid out just
the same. In time Quebec will accept the
grants. Our job is to make them available.
I enumerate these things merely to indicate
that each generation has its own problem to
solve in the best way it can. No one is trying to impose solutions on any one: we are
trying to work out a solution that is
satisfactory to every one.
Our disregard for education and educators
is becoming somewhat of a national scandal;
and because we do not know where to begin,
we do not begin at all. We merely allow
the problem to increase and to intensify.
What we need more than anything else in
this country is to raise the prestige of
learning. The teaching profession is held in

SENATE

low repute by the public, and education is
not as highly regarded as it should be. In
that respect nowhere is a higher premium
put on education than in the province of
Quebec, particularly with respect to the
humanities. Of course we need more money
for education, but it cannot come from
increased taxation on homes. We are told
from all across the country that property is
now taxed highly enough.
Hon. Mr. Dupuis: May I ask the honourable
gentleman if he is still speaking on behalf
of the mover of this resolution?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I appreciate my friend's
calling that to my attention. Of course, I am
not now speaking on his behalf. What I am
saying now is my own. I was asked to
answer some of the questions raised, and I
take the responsibility for the answers I have
given. What I have been saying is obviously
my own.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: You do not expect that
the senator from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron)
will disown it, do you?
Hon. Mr. Croll: I do not think he will

disown it.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: But he may not be
willing to take responsibility for it.

Hon. Mr. Croll: Quite right.
Our teaching standards need to be improved.
I believe teachers ought to be paid according
to their ability, and not so much according
to their paper qualifications. There is no
denial that universities are overcrowded. But
we can handle even more students than we
are handling today if we build more facilities.
One thing we have to keep in mind is that
we do not have room for students who go on
to higher learning because of social or athletic
considerations, or because the university is
the right place to go. Such students have
to make way for those who are seriously
interested in education. In some of our
schools we may have to get along with less
chrome, and some of us may have to get
along with fewer country clubs, in order that
we may have more classrooms and better
paid teachers.
I do not say this, honourable senators,
because the electors cannot get at me in this
house. What I am about to say, I said when
I was a member of the other house, and I
repeat it now. In order to attain that which
we need in the interests of our country by
way of education, we shall have to pay more
taxes and not less taxes. It will become
necessary for us to pay more taxes. This
talk about our having reached the zenith of
taxation is balderdash. None of us are so

taxed that, in the interests of our country and
in the interests of education particularly, we
cannot pay what is required.
The youth of our country need greater
opportunity, greater incentive and greater
direction toward becoming educated men and
women. Certainly we have to aim at more
scholarships and bursaries; we have to inspire
the quality of education, from the elementary
grades to the university, and in order to do
so, we have to revise our attitude toward
teaching and teachers.
We have to respect the educators. One
way to show our respect for them is to pay
them a decent wage so that they can maintain
their own self respect. That we are not
doing. We have to build new schools and
colleges; we have to assess students' abilities
and opportunities; we have to view higher
education for what it is and what it is not.
These are the challenges that have been
thrown to us; these are challenges to the
North American continent.
There is no use in suddenly becoming
panicky and deciding upon a crash programthat we must do something tomorrow or the
very next day in order to emulate someone
else. Education will not respond to a crash
Unless education is intelligently
program.
and carefully developed and understood, it is
not likely to be of much value.
I said, honourable senators, I did not intend to multiply the arguments; I merely
wanted to answer a few of the questions my
friend asked me to answer, and to indicate
that this is a problem, like other problems,
that we have to solve.
Once upon a time many Canadian people
were opposed to the Unemployment Insurance
scheme. They said that such a program was
an infringement of provincial rights. Nevertheless, the details were worked out, the
problem was solved, and now our workers
are under Unemployment Insurance benefits
and are making their contributions. No one's
rights have been impinged. We are not here,
honourable senators, to deprive people of
inherent rights which they hold sacred to
themselves. We are here to solve our problems. One of the ways of doing so is to have
an intelligent electorate. In this respect education is important. We have ignored it. We
have neglected it because there is a lack of
understanding of and respect for education
in this country. In some instances the wrong
people are taking advantage of educational
facilities. We have to take the long view.
I remember well when we started talking
about a national health insurance plan. It
was said that as soon as we reduced the cost
of our national defence we would use that
saving in order to make contributions to a
national health insurance plan. It looks as

DECEMBER 17, 1957
though the cost of national defence, instead
of reducing, might increase appreciably and
yet we will find money for national health
insurance, whether it is $100 million or $300
million.
Education is a form of national defence in
its primary sense, far more important than
anything else. We must maintain national defence as our outward shield, but it is essential
also that we have that inward strength which
can come only from an educated electorate.
We owe that to our people. If we give our
children nothing else-and many of us give
them nothing else-we can give them an education. That is something which cannot be
taken away from them by taxing officers or a
depression, by a boom or a bust. That, they
have got. They can use it in this country,
because it is a new country, which has just
started to grow. Skilled people, semi-skilled
people, people who are willing to prepare
themselves for a lifetime of work, have a
great future ahead of them here. We, their
elders, must see to it that we leave to these
people opportunities at least a little better
than were left to us.
Now, my honourable friend from Banff did
not ask me to say all this. I said this on my
own. I do feel that education in Canada will
benefit from the contributions that have been
made to this debate. I hope that on another
occasion we shall have an opportunity to discuss this problem at even greater length and
with more benefit to the country at large.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
if no other honourable member intends to
participate in this debate at this time I would
now move, with the consent of the house,
adjournment of the debate until after the
New Year's recess.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Dupuis, the debate
was adjourned.
POINT OF ORDER

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, on a point of order: I think I should
rise at this time in view of the fact that on
December 3, when this debate opened, I
stated as will be found on page 320 of
Hansard:
I was going to say in the first instance that the
honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr. Cameron)
will be entitled to close the debate when all other
honourable senators who wish to take part in it
have spoken.

At that time I was under the impression
that this was a substantive motion, and that
therefore the honourable gentlemen would,
under the rules of this house, be entitled to
close the debate.
In the Minutes of Proceedings of December
2 notice of this discussion appears as Inquiry
No. 3. The notice reads:
96702-27J

No. 3.
By the Honourable Senator Cameron:27th November-That he will draw the attention
of the Senate to the necessity for Canada to
mobilize and expand the educational resources of
the nation with a view to maintaining and strengthening her position as a member of the world
community.

Now, honourable senators, it is evident that

that is not an inquiry, nor is it a motion.
There is, however, a provision for bringing a
subject of this kind to the attention of the
house. Rule 40 reads:
40. When it is intended to make a statement or

raise a discussion on asking a question, the
senator having such intention, as part of the notice
under Rule 21, gives notice that he will call
attention to the matter inquired into.

Rule No. 35 provides:
35. No senator may speak twice to a question
before the Senate, except in explanation of a
material part of his speech, in which he may have
been misconceived, and then he is not to introduce
new matter.

Rule 36 reads:
36. A reply is allowed to a senator who bas
moved the second reading of a bill, or made a
substantive motion, but not to one who has moved
an amendment, the previous question, an adjournment during a debate, a motion on the consideration of Commons' amendments, or an instruction to
a committee.

Honourable senators will thus see that
under Rule 36 there is no provision for a
reply on a matter such as has been raised by
the Honourable Senator Cameron.
I thought I should bring this to the attention of the Senate, lest in future some other
senator might think he had a right of reply
in a debate such as this and Mr. Speaker
would have to inform him he had no such
right. I did not want to get into trouble with
any honourable senator, and more especially
with Mr. Speaker.
The Hon. the Speaker: The honourable
senator from Toronto-Spadina (Hon. Mr.
Crol) was speaking more or less on behalf of
the honourable senator from Banff (Hon. Mr.
Cameron). But this discussion is not on a
motion, so I did not warn the house that the
honourable senator from Toronto-Spadina
would close the debate.
EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 199, to amend
the Export Credits Insurance Act.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Next sitting.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

HER MAJESTY'S BROADCAST OF
OCTOBER 13
SUGGESTED PUBLICATION FOR DISTRIBUTION
TO SCHOOLS

Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, with Mr. Speaker's permission I will
make another suggestion to the Government,
and I presume that it will be considered
favourably by all of us.
If we refer to pages 20a and 20b of the
Minutes of the Senate of October 14, and to
the appendix to Senate Hansard of that date
we will find there the only two publications
of Her Majesty's Broadcast of October 13.
It can be found nowhere else except in newspaper files. I wondered if the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig)
would convey to the Government the wish
of the Senate to have two million copies of
that broadcast printed in English and French
in order that it should be distributed to all
the schools in the country through the provincial Departments of Education. It is one
of the finest speeches that have been delivered, and it will be important for the youth
of our country to keep it in scrap books, or
otherwise retain it for further reference.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will convey the request
to the Honourable the Acting Prime Minister.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you.
INCOME TAX BILL
THIRD READING

Hon. John T. Haig moved the third reading
of Bill 231, to amend the Income Tax Act.
Hon. Wishart McL. Robertson: Honourable
senators, I would like to ask the honourable
Leader of the Government in the Senate
(Hon. Mr. Haig) a question with respect to
this matter, and perhaps, depending on the
answer he gives, make a few brief
observations.
In order to assist the honourable leader to
refresh his memory I might say that the
question I shall ask hini has to do with his
speech yesterday, in which he estimated what
the surplus this year would be as compared
with the original estimate of the former
Minister of Finance. Pertinent information
on that point is found on page 2003 of

Hansard the House of Commons of December
6. Yesterday, in the Senate, my honourable
friend, as reported at page 411 of the Senate
Hansard, in discussing the question of the
finances of the country and changes which
had taken place since the original estimate
was brought down, said as follows:
Then there were other matters of some importance that came up from time to time, and the
Honourable the Minister of Finance estimated on
the floor of the other chamber we would have
about $80 million surplus instead of $150 million.

I noticed the remark of my honourable
friend at the time, and have since refreshed
my memory in respect of it; and I have very
great difficulty in reconciling his figures with
the table which was brought down in the
other place.
As I understand, the circumstances are
The former minister of finance
these.
estimated that the revenue for the fiscal year
to end on March 31, 1958 would be $5,170
million, that the expenditures would be
$5,018 million, and the estimated surplus $152
Subsequently, I understand, the
million.
present Minister of Finance said that while
there had been some variation up and down
in respect of the revenue, he was prepared
to accept that figure of $5,170 million; but
material changes took place in regard to the
As my honourable friend
expenditures.
pointed out yesterday, among the increases
set forth in the statement were: pay and
allowances, about $100 million; old age
security deficit, $50 million; C.N.R. deficit,
$28 million; increased interest charges, $25
million, and three or four miscellaneous
items having to do with increased expenditures on social security, $7 million; or a
total increased expenditure of $210 million.
The minister further pointed out that, resulting from savings of one type and another,
as compared with the original estimates,
there was a reduction of $64 million, which
leaves an estimated net increase of $146
million instead of $210 million. Since the
minister's original estimate was $152 million,
and since the net increased expenditures
were $146 million, I cannot for the life of
me understand why the estimated surplus has
not been reduced to $6 million instead of
the $80 million which my honourable friend
mentioned yesterday.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The statement made by the
Minister of Finance was that he expected a
reduction of $80 million, so the report must
have omitted some of the items on which he
figured there would be a curtailment of
expenses.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: What are the items?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I do not know.
did not give them to me.

He

DECEMBER 18, 1957
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I did not expect my
honourable friend to depend too much on his
memory in things of this kind, and that is
why I have referred him to the particular
page of the Commons Hansard where the
estimate is set forth. Nowhere there do I
see anything as to an estimated $80 million.
I note that at another place the Minister of
Finance estimated, I think it is, $106 million;
but, as I say, nowhere can I find any estimate
of $80 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: My honourable friend can
go on and make his statement. Suppose the
amount is only $6 million; for all I care,
he may make his discussion on that basis.
I do not think that in the result it makes any
difference.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: What is $80 million!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am basing myself on the
figure the Minister of Finance mentioned
when I was present. I heard him speak of
$80 million.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: With all due deference
to my honourable friend, I am dealing with
the report in the Commons Hansard, and I
purposely suggested to him that he, or someone on his behalf, refer to the record to
refresh his memory. That was the only purpose of my suggestion, because I cannot find
that in any place the sum of $80 million is
mentioned.
Hon. Mr. Haig: To satisfy my honourable
friend's curiosity-I accept the statement of
my confrère of the House of Commons: make
your debate on it. My friend's figure is not
the figure I got; and I know it.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I will go on to say
what I have to say in this regard, but the
point I made is a very pertinent one, and it
was in order to avoid being unfair to the
honourable leader that I preceded my remarks by suggesting to him that he refer to
the record on this point. The fact of the
matter is that the Minister of Finance's estimated surplus is $106 million, and that is
what appears in Hansard, not $80 million.
I take exception to the way that the $106
million was arrived at, and if my honourable
friend cannot throw any more light on it
himself, I shall proceed to do so.
Now, in the items in which the Minister of
Finance arrives at the figure of $106 million
as being the estimated surplus, I will again
refer to the fact that in suggesting the increased expenditures, that amount included
among other things two items, namely: Increases in old age security fund deficit, $50
million-mark the word "deficit"-also, expected deficit on the C.N.R., $28 million.

The difference between the $106 million
and the $6 million, which I contend it should
be, was arrived at by a most curious form of
bookkeeping which was resorted to. A general asset reserve of $50 million is provided
for, which the previous Minister of Finance
had set up, and provision for reduction in the
amortized portion of the deficit in the superannuation account of $50 million; and by this
bookkeeping sleight-of-hand he shows a decreased expenditure, as far as this Government is concerned, as compared with the
previous Government, of no less than $100
million. I suggest to my honourable friend
opposite that unless there is some reason
whereby the liability which has accrued
under those two items, or at least the liability
under the item of superannuation deficit, has
not in some way or another ceased to exist,
then this is an entirely unfair and unreasonable method of bookkeeping and presentation
of the finances of this country.
My recollection is-and if I am wrong my
honourable friend opposite can point it out
-that the deficit which occurred in the superannuation account resulted from salary raises
to members of the civil service-and perhaps
the armed forces as well, but I am not sure
about that-which increased the future
liability against that account because there
were no corresponding payments at the same
time into that fund to bring it into a solvent
position; and that from time to time certain
amounts were transferred to that account in
the hope that in due course it would be put
on a solvent basis.
The previous Minister of Finance had apportioned and paid into this account, or earmarked for this account, a sum of $50 million,
which my honourable friends opposite now
take out of that account in order to make the
position appear that much better. I suggest
that is poor bookkeeping, and a poor basis
upon which to put the statements of this
country. The same applies, perhaps in a lesser
degree, to the amount set up as a general
asset reserve of $50 million which, however,
is not of as specific a nature as the other
item, because there is a liability under the
superannuation account which must be paid.
The withdrawal by my honourable friends
from the superannuation account in this particular year in order to make a better showing
in the finances is, in my opinion, the worst
kind of bookkeeping.
I said in this house on another occasion,
honourable senators, that sound and careful
governmental financing is one of the most
vital factors in our whole economy. I now
repeat that I have no doubt that the degree
of prosperity which Canada has enjoyed over
recent years has without exception shown
that the finances of our country were kept on
a sound basis.

420

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think it is a matter
of greatest regret that one of the first actions
on the part of my honourable friend's party
after it came to power was to revise that
policy. It is a serious matter, and strikes me
as a very bad foundation for public finances.
The details of the finances of this country
are multitudinous and cumbersome; indeed, it
would take one hours and even days to go
through them in any detail. Like other
honourable senators, I have been used to
depending upon the accuracy, shall I say the
intellectual honesty, of accounts as they stand,
assuming always that they have been properly
prepared, adequate reserves have been set up,
and that they are on a basis acceptable by the
business world today. It is therefore a matter
of deep regret that one of the first actions
of the present Government should have been
to borrow from those reserves in order to
dress up a financial statement.
Hon. John T. Haig: Perhaps I should say
a word or two, honourable senators.
My honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Robertson) forgets that during all the time his
Government was in power the annuities were
going behind every year.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, they were, and the
Government was trying to bolster them up.
There was always a deficit there, which was
not taken care of. True, they put in about
$186 million, which paid part of it, but it did
not settle all the arrears of the account. It
did not have a surplus last year or the year
before.
My honourable friend seems to think that a
paper statement of the finances of this
country bas something to do with its
prosperity. Let me say, I do not know what
caused the price of nickel at the coast to go
down to 20 cents a pound, but it went to
that price just a month ago. Anybody who
had stock in nickel companies knows that it
has gone down in value, and I do not know
of anything on earth that can stop it. I
noticed by the news recently that other
countries are cutting down on their production of nickel. Well, if you have any money
in nickel, you are out on the road.
But that has nothing to do with our
country's finances. The budget that came
down earlier this year was brought down by
the Government which my friend supported.
Now, we have a supplementary budget, or a
statement of what happened in between that
time and now. Between now and April 1
next the Government will have to have a
new budget to cover the current year; and
all the finances, whatever they may be, will

have to be shown on that statement. The
world will not come to an end because
between now and then no budget is brought
down. There is no question about that.
The opposition parties in the other bouse,
especially the party of my honourable friend,
bas shown no inclination to go to the people
now, not the slightest inclination. It is a
most ridiculous thing to watch what goes on
over there.
On a matter on which they should take
a stand, they run out into the corridors so
as not to have to poll their vote. That
indicates to meHon. Mr. Macdonald: Mr. Speaker, I rise
on a point of order.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to tell you why they
don't vote.
The Hon. the Speaker: On a point of order.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My friend is referring
to what bas taken place in the House of
Commons. It is irregular for him to refer to
it in any event, but there is no record to
which be can refer. What he says is, I
think, a reflection on that house, which
should not be made in this bouse.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.

improper.

Macdonald:

Hon. Mr. Haig: I am simply telling you
what anybody can see any time there is a
vote. All you have to do is go to the other
house at voting time, and see the peculiar
situation there.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Mr. Speaker, are we
to allow insults from this house to be made
against the other house?
The Hon. the Speaker: Order! I rule that
the honourable Leader of the Government
should not refer to the debates of the other
house, and should not qualify them as being
"ridiculous". I rule that the word "ridiculous"
be withdrawn, and that the honourable
leader desist from mentioning any debate
that has taken place in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Haig: If you would look up the
records of the other place, to which I have
a right to refer, you will find there was no
division on this question over there.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My point of order
was that the honourable leader referred to
certain actions and words in the other place
as being ridiculous, and be bas insulted that
house in other respects.

DECEMBER 18, 1957
The Hon. the Speaker: I do not think he
mentioned any other words. He mentioned
the attitude of the Opposition parties in the
other place. He did not quote any debates
that have taken place in the other house.
My ruling is that no reference should be
made to the debates of the other place, and
the word "ridiculous" should be withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have a right to say that
no vote was taken in the other place. That
has nothing to do with what happened over
there. The fact is that no vote was taken.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is all you should
have said.
Hon. Mr. Haig: They did not take a vote.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable
friend is just as much out of order in that
remark as in his earlier remarks.
Hon. Mr. Vien: On a point of Order, Mr.
Speaker. Once a ruling has been made there
should be no further reference to the subject.
A good deal could be said on this subject, if
we were allowed to pursue it.
The Hon. the Speaker: The ruling has
been given, and the matter should not be
further discussed. If the honourable Leader
of the Government bas anything further to
say on this debate he should proceed; otherwise, I shall put the question.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will not say anything
further on it. My honourable friend does
not want me to talk, so that is all right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is not a fair
comment. We want the leader to be in order.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I won't disturb my friends
in the Opposition any further.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We enjoy listening
to you.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will let them sleep for
the rest of the afternoon in peace and quietness. My honourable friend can enjoy himself for another afternoon.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I do not intend to reply to the remarks
of the Leader of the Government, except
to say that I am very disappointed in them.
I do, however, rise to say that I support
entirely what was said by the honourable
senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson).
I should like to repeat what I said yesterday, honourable senators, that it is most
unfortunate that a budget was not brought
down so that the country as a whole would
know where we stand financially.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We are flying completely in the dark. As my honourable friend

said, a budget was brought down last spring,
and the present Government has said that it
is adhering to the financial proposals which
were made at that time. Now it is making
changes in those financial proposals, which
means that there is a new financial statement somewhere. As my honourable friend
from Shelburne said, the Finance Minister in
the other bouse, just out of thin air, said
that there is going to be a surplus of $80
million. At one place he said it would be
$106 million.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The Leader of the
Government said it would be $80 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Leader of the
Government said it would be $106 million.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never said that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The Leader of the
Government here said there was going to be
a surplus of $106 million. I find that the
Finance MinisterHon. Mr. Robertson: The Minister of
Finance said $106 million and the leader here
said $80 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I must say, honourable senators, that the figures are very confusing. From the meagre statements before
us I defy anyone to tell us whether we are
going to have a surplus or a deficit.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It
difference.

does not make any

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What I have been
trying to find out from the leader of the
Government in this house is whether the Government is financing for a deficit. If it is
financing for a deficit we should know.
An Hon. Senator: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Yesterday when the
Leader of the Government was speaking he
said we were working under the same financial proposais that were made last spring. We
have the main estimates, we have the supplementary estimates, we have further supplementary estimates No. 1, proposed by the
former Government, and further supplementary estimates No. 2, proposed by the
present Government. We are working on all
those estimates. We all agree with that. But
until December 6 we were also supposed to
have been working on the budget, the financial statement which was proposed at the
time the budget was brought down. But now,
honourable senators, there is a new financial
set-up somewhere. I don't know where it is,
I don't know what it is, and no honourable
senator in this house knows where or what
it is. The honourable senator from Shelburne
(Hon. Mr. Robertson) tried to analyse this-I
won't say, statement of accounts, for it does

SENATE
not take up half a column in Hansard-this
new financial statement of $5 billion, and the
Government is asking us to approve all these
reductions in taxation. Why, of course we
approve of reductions in taxation, but when
we ask for a statement of how they are to
be brought about there is no statement
forthcoming.
I am going to repeat the request that I
made yesterday to the Leader of the Government. I know he has great influence with
the Government of the day, that he is listened
to in the cabinet. I am going to ask him to
make an effort in future never to allow the
Government to bring down a new budgethe called it a budget-without bringing down
a financial statement. Let the country in on
this, let us know where the money is coming
from, whether we are financing for a surplus
or for a deficit. I hope my honourable friend
will follow my suggestion.
The motion was agreed to, the bill was
read the third time, and passed.
EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE BILL
SECOND READING

Hon. Gusiave Monelie moved the second
reading of Bill 199, to amend the Export
Credits Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, I intend first
of all to make some remarks of a general
character on this bill.
First I am going to try to show that the
bill does not contain any new principle, nor
any change of principle, that it is only in the
amount of money that is going to be disposed of or approved under the bill that there
is a change.
The legislation which we are now discussing, and to which we propose an amendment, is known as the Export Credits Insurance Act, which created the Export Credits
Insurance Corporation. The purpose and
powers of the corporation are set out in
section 13 of Chapter 105, R.S.C. 1952 as
amended earlier this year by chapter 8 of
the statutes of 1957.
As amended, the purposes and powers of
the corporation may be summarized as follows: The corporation may enter into a contract of insurance with a person carrying on
business in Canada to insure him against
any risk of loss by reason of his failure, for
any cause not avoidable by him, to recover
any amount payable to the exporter under
or in respect of a transaction entered into
between him and a person carrying on
business or other activities outside Canada
and involving the export, manufacture,
treatment or distribution of goods, or the
rendering of engineering, construction, technical or similar services . . . and so forth.

The liability of the corporation under such
contracts of insurance is to pay to the exporter losses incurred by him through loss or
failure to be paid. I might mention a few
examples of situations that could be the cause
of non-payment: insolvency of the foreign
buyer; cancellation of import licence in the
foreign country; adverse changes in foreign
exchange regulations; blockage of funds;
transfer difficulties, etc.
The corporation was created for the purpose of issuing policies to cover those risks.
This legislation is in the public interest. It is
in Canada's interest to export goods, and it
was felt by the previous administrationand this law was introduced by the previous
administration-that there should be a sort
of guarantee of payment to the exporters.
That is why the corporation was created and
given power to issue insurance policies to
cover exporters against such risks as I have
mentioned.
The extent of the corporation's power to
issue policies of insurance is, in practice,
divided into two categories. Policies within
the first category may be issued by the corporation itself, and without soliciting any
additional authority from the Governor in
Council or from Parliament. The corporation
can issue policies within the monetary limit
set by the law; and if at any time it should
be in its judgment advantageous or necessary
to issue other policies exceeding the limits
set forth in the corporation's ordinary powers,
it would need for that additional coverage the
authority of the Governor in Council.
To summarize: the routine or ordinary
power of the corporation is to issue policies,
the aggregate sum of which shall be within
the limit set forth in the act, namely, ten
times the capital subscribed into the company
-which, by the way, is subscribed by the
Governor in Council-plus the then outstanding surplus of the company. The subscribed
capital being $15 million, ten times that sum
would make $150 million, and ten times the
statutory surplus of the company, set at $5
million, would make another $50 million,
the whole constituting the total limit of
$200 million within which the corporation
could issue policies. The maximum amount,
therefore, for which the corporation could
issue policies without obtaining other approval is $200 million. But there may be
particular cases wherein the corporation
would be faced with a demand to cover a
great risk, amounting to such a sum that the
board might not be prepared to issue a policy
under their ordinary powers. In these circumstances the corporation, as provided in section
21, would have to make a report and the
Governor in Council would have to approve
the issuance of the policy, even though the

DECEMBER 18, 1957
amount did not exceed the limit within which
the corporation ordinarily could proceed.
Therefore two sections are of especial
importance, the first being section 14, under
which the corporation cannot issue policies
for an aggregate amount over $200 million,
and the second being section 21, which provides for special cases whereby the corporation, with the approval of the Governor in
Council, can provide insurance for additional
amounts over the ordinary $200 million. The
total of such additional amounts, as set forth
in the law at present, is limited to $100
million. We have, therefore, the two sections, one embodying the ordinary power of
the corporation to issue insurance policies
covering export risks to the extent of $200
million; and the second providing that the
corporation, with the approval of the Governor in Council, may issue additional policies
to the limit of $100 million, which is additional to the ordinary $200 million.
This bill proposes not to amend the principle already embodied in the law, but simply
to extend from $100 million to $200 million
the limit within which the corporation may,
with the approval of the Governor in Council,
issue policies covering export risks. That is
the gist of the bill. The bill merely amends
subsection 3 of section 21 of the act by
extending policies from $100 million to $200
million; there is no new principle involved,
but only a change in amount, as will be
seen from the new section which reads as
follows:

ance has actually been issued to a total
amount of $98 million, and is now outstanding, so it would not be possible to issue
important additional policies under these
extraordinary powers unless the limit were
extended. What the actual reasons or needs
for the increase are I cannot explain in detail.
However, to give an example: I am sure
every honourable senator is familiar with
the policy of selling more of our wheat on
export markets. Maybe it could be sold to
different countries. However, serious difficulties may be encountered through foreign
exchange or otherwise, and in order to give
effect to the desire of the Government to
increase our exports, it is necessary to
provide ample protection for exporters against
non-payment of their accounts. Therefore
it is generally felt that the limit provided for
in the existing law should be doubled.

The liability of the Corporation under the contracts of insurance entered Into under this section
and outstanding shall not at any time exceed two
hundred million dollars and shall not be included
in the liability of the Corporation for the purposes
of section 14.

Hon. Mr. Monette: No, I have no information on those details.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Those details would be very
useful in determining to what extent the
additional amount is required.

The bill simply proposes to double the
amount by which the corporation may go
beyond its ordinary powers and issue special
policies, with the approval of the Governor
in Council.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Can the honourable senator
tell us how many policies were issued under
this law last year? The Government wants
the amount to be raised from $100 million to
$200 million. We are entitled to know what
was expended in the past twelve months,
and what are the demands which justify the
Government to raise the amount as provided
for in this bill.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Well, this question was
put in a somewhat similar way when the
honourable minister explained the bill
before the House of Commons. Under the
existing subsection 3 of section 21, which
permits the issuance of additional policies,
subject to approval by the Governor in
Council, to the limit of $100 million, insur96702-28

Hon. Mr. Vien: Is the honourable senator
in a position to tell us whether the amount of
$98 million that he has mentioned has been
covered by one policy or by several policies?
Has such a list been published or tabled?
Hon. Mr. Monette: I have not got that
information. I have only the declaration that
was made before the other house to the
effect that this extra $100 million for coverage
has been utilized to the extent of $98 million.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Does the honourable senator
know to what particular line or lines of trade
the amount has been applied?

Hon. Mr. Monette: The honourable senator
is right: it is important, and if further details
are needed the bill could be sent to a committee. I thought that, at this time my duty
was to explain the purpose of the bill, and
that it was sufficient to show that the bill does
not introduce any new principle at all. It
is only a question of doubling the amount of
the existing extraordinary limit. If the honourable senator feels it is necessary, he may
ask that the bill be sent to a committee.
My understanding from the answer given
by the Minister was that insurance to the
amount of $98 million has been issued under
the additional powers. That is to say, $100
million is the present limit to the amount of
insurance that may be issued under that additional power, and these provisions have already been utilized to the extent of $98
million.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Power: But no statement has been
made as to the extent to which the $200

otherwise.
Hon. Mr. Moneile: I understand a declaration was made that the extra power was

Hon. Mr. Monette: Honourable senators, I
cannot give that undertaking, for it is up to
the house to decide whether or not the bill
should be referred to committee. I am doing
what I honestly can in saying that the minister said, in front of members of Parliament
who were scrutinizing the bill very closely,
just what I said a few minutes ago. I cannot
give details as to the amounts of the divers
policies that have been issued and are still
outstanding under either the general or the
special power.

Hon. Mr. Monette: I do not know that. It
is supposed to be covered to a considerable
extent. Let me say there is a distinction
between the two categories of policy limits.

it is not the common practice of the Corporation to issue one or two big policies that

section 21 there might be circumstances where
a bigger contract would have to be executed.
In such a case the corporation would seek
the advice of the Governor in Council with
respect to getting money under the special
additional powers, so as not to affect the
original amount of $200 million which would
remain available generally to a greater number of citizens. Does that answer your

enable the honourable senator to understand
that new circumstances may arise which we
think actually justify the amendment. Moreover, it remains in the hands of the Governor
in Council to decide whether in a particular
case a demand for big coverage of insurance
should be justified and therefore acted upon.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators,
I think we can all support the general principle of this legislation, particularly inasmuch
as it is legislation which was introduced
originally by the Government of which my
honourable leader (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) was
a member.
We are very much obliged to the honourable
senator from Mille Isles for the clear explanation he has given of the bill. As he
explained it, the general purpose of the bill
is to facilitate trade by Canadian exporters,
by insuring them against loss on sales to
foreign countries.

As the honourable senator stated, the
maximum amount of insurance policies which
the corporation is allowed to issue under section 14 of the act is "ten times the aggregate
of the amount of the paid-up capital and the

DECEMBER 18, 1957

surplus of the corporation". As I understand my friend's explanation, this is now
$200 million.
Hon. Mr. Monette: Exactly; it is ten times
the paid-up capital and surplus both together.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Monette: The surplus and paid-up
capital is $20 million, and ten times that
amount is $200 million.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That is what I said.
Under section 14, it amounts to $200 million.
Hon. Mr. Monette: I am sorry to have interrupted you.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Then there is special
provision for exceptional policies which may
be issued under section 21, only with the consent of the Governor in Council, upon a report
of the minister. And it is in respect of the
limits upon the amount of policies that can
be issued especially under section 21 that it
is now sought to increase the total limit of
such policies from $100 million to $200
million.
I should like to refer for a moment to what
my friend from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)
said. If he will look at section 21 he will see
that the details of all these policies have to
be furnished in orders in council passed by
the Governor in Council, and that they must
be laid before Parliament during the session
or, if Parliament is not in session, at the next
ensuing session. So, the details with respect
to these special policies that have been issued
under section 21 are available now in the
public records of the country.
Hon. Mr. Vien: But are they available here?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: One would assume
that this Government, like the former Government, has complied with the provisions
of the statutes-that I do not intend to comment upon-and that the orders in council
have been published.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I thought that the honourable senator would file them or refer to them.
The act calls upon the Government to file a
statement of all the policies that have been
issued. Has this list of Orders in Council and
policies issued under the act been filed? I had
expected that the honourable senator would
make some reference to it, but so far he has
not done so.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: As I say, I can only
assume that the Government has complied
with the requirements of the act.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Has it or has it not?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: That I will leave for
the Government side to answer. But I certainly am able to say that on this side of the
96702-281

house there will be no objection to this proposed increase in the maximum amount of
insurance that may be contracted for from
$100 million to $200 million, particularly in
view of the statement made by the sponsor
of the bill that the total amount of the policies
issued up to the present under section 1 has
reached $98 million.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That is, outstanding?
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Outstanding, yes.
I would appreciate it if the Leader of the
Government or somebody could give us any
indication of any particular additional exports which may be in view, which the
Government may have in mind, which will
require the issue of policies with respect to
the additional $100 million. Of course, it may
not be in the power of the leader to give the
information. My honourable friend referred to
the possibility of additional sales of wheat to
other countries. Is the Government in any
position to tell us whether negotiations are
now under way with any other countries with
respect to possible sales of important amounts
of our wheat? As honourable senators realize,
that is a very important factor at the moment,
in the present economic situation of the
country.
Hon. Mr. Monette: The last question is
rather directed to the Government, and I am
not representing the Government here. My
answer was rather by way of an appeal to
the intelligence of honourable senators. Everybody knows that today, more than in the past,
there may be chances of selling our wheat as
well as other commodities, and therefore it is
felt that we should have this limit increased
by $100 million. If honourable senators wish
to know what the present Government has in
mind about future policies and future approvals by the Governor in Council, well, it may
not be permissible to disclose that information
at present. I do not know that, but in any
event the answer is not in my hands.
I did not mention to the honourable senator
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) that under
section 21 an order in council had to be
passed to authorize the issurance of special
policies under the additional powers. I did not
want to tell the honourable senator that he
could obtain that information for himself-I
did not think that would be polite, coming
from my side, though it might be more acceptable coming from the other side. Really, the
question asked by the honourable senator from
De Lorimier was correct, in my view, but under
the actual circumstances it seems quite reasonable to expect that this Government has in
mind not to miss any chance to sell more and
export more to other countries, in which it

SENATE
would be following the example of the previous Government; and if the present Government has a chance to advance that policy a
little more, that would be no matter for
reproach. So for the moment I simply say that
I took it upon myself to accept the declaration
made by the minister to the committee in
the other bouse, and I submit that the principle of the bill should be approved.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, I suggest that this bill be referred to one of the
Standing Committees of the Senate in order
that we may be informed by officers of the
department.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Would the honourable
gentleman from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)
be satisfied if the honourable gentleman from
Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette) who so eloquently and ably explained this bill obtained
and furnished him with a list of all the
policies that were issued up to date? The
reason I make that suggestion is this. I was
for many years, as you all know, sitting on
the opposite side of the house, and once or
twice during that period we had to deal with
amendments to this act. The impression I
then received was such that I did not want
to make too many inquiries into the transactions. The then Leader of the Government
gave me some particulars of transactions that
had been carried out, and ultimately I could
have had all that I wanted. I wonder if my
honourable friend would be satisfied if the
list of policies were obtained and passed on
to him by the honourable senator from
Mille Isles?
This is a very confidential matter, not as
between us, but as between buyers and sellers
whenever we are carrying on negotiations.
There are on hand large stocks of potatoes
and milk, including skimmed milk, which we
are trying to sell. There are guaranteed prices
on a number of commodities at this time and
no doubt the Government will do the best it
can to dispose of these surpluses. But one
cannot make deals of this kind if the public
knows about them. I do not believe the Government is trying to hide anything; in fact
this is information which, by law, it must
provide, and I think we can disclose at once
particulars of contracts already made. But I
hope we shall not be asked, "With whom are
you
negotiating
now?"
Because-quite
frankly-there are negotiations going on.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not want to
embarrass my honourable friend in any way.
If he is free to give some information,
obviously we should like to have it.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I would rather not have
the bill go to committee, where questions
could be publicly asked which might be
embarrassing to the negotiating parties. It
would not make any difference to the Government; it would just lose a deal. If we
supply the lists up to date within fifteen days
after Parliament opens, would that satisfy my
honourable friend? It would remove any possibility of information getting out as to deals
which may now be in course of negotiation.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I am prompted to accept
the suggestion of the honourable Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig), on the
assurance given by the honourable senator
who moved the second reading (Hon. Mr.
Monette) that the present Government would
follow the policies of the former Government. If it keeps going along these lines it
will be on safe ground.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is the very thing it
is trying to do. But-if I may be pardoned
for speaking a second time on this matterdifficulties have arisen in relation to several
of our commodities which have involved
some pretty hard struggles with certain other
nations. We do not want to risk losing
business through somebody else coming in
when we are negotiating a deal. The committee which is in charge of this policy of
insurance consists of the same persons who
served under the last Government. I do not
believe there has been any change; the same
crowd is in control. If you could trust them,
surely we can.
Hon. Mr. Vien: Could the honourable
Leader of the Government tell us when the
list which he bas mentioned will be made
available?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think we can get at once
the information about the contracts already
made.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Probably all of them
are tabled now.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In the other house. I assure
honourable senators that the statement will
be ready before the house opens again.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, it was ordered
that the bill be placed on the Order Paper
for third reading tomorrow.

OF THE SENATE

On the motion to adjourn:
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Before we adjourn,
could the Leader of the Government give us
any information as to what business, other
than the third reading of Bill 199, will be
before the house tomorrow?

Hon. Mr. Haig: I expect that there will be
third reading of the bill tomorrow afternoon.
The Governor's deputy will not be here until
Friday afternoon at one o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does the honourable
Leader of the Government expect to have
any further business?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes. I anticipate there will
be a short bill regarding the extension of
the railway line from Le Pas to Churchill.
The branch line runs now as far as Snow
Lake, which is where the International Nickel
Company is building a big plant. I believe
that 50 or 60 miles of road are to be built,
and authority to build is required.
Also there is a bill relating to the bridge
at Hamilton and a highway into the city in
connection with the new harbour improvements. Authority is required for this construction work. Those are the only two bills
which almost certainly will be before us. As
to one or two others, I am doubtful whether
they will be ready tomorrow. The House of
Commons will be sitting tonight and tomorrow
morning.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Can the honourable
Leader of the Government tell the house
whether honourable senators who live at a
distance will be allowed their expenses to

go home over Christmas and the New Year
and to return, travelling by air?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot answer that question, because I have not made inquiries. All
I know is what I saw in the press. It may
have been a wag story. Expenses home and
back will be paid as usual; the only question
remaining is, as somebody has said, will the
honourable senator from Blaine Lake, or
honourable senators from Vancouver, or myself, be provided with transportation by air.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is your interests
and their interests that I have so much at
heart!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I suppose that expenses by
air will be paid. However, I will inquire and
give an answer tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Baird: I understand it was
arranged that members living at great distances will travel by air.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Senators, too?
Hon. Mr. Howard: Sherbrooke hasn't an
airport!
Hon. Mr. Haig: I presume the Senate will
not be discriminated against.
I will find out, and bring an answer tomorrow.

NATIONAL HOUSING BILL
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 238, to amend
the National Housing Act, 1954.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
SECOND READING

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators, I
move that this bill be read the second
time now.
I trust I shall not take too long in discussing this legislation. The National Housing
Act, which was passed by the former Government in 1954, fhas worked, one may say,
reasonably well-much better, in fact, than
a good many people anticipated, even though
they favoured it. Under the act, the Parliament of Canada has power to grant to the
National Housing Commission $250 million,
and practically all this money has been
loaned out. In addition, a great many loans
have been made for housing purposes through
financial institutions such as life insurance
companies, banks, and trust companies, as
well as by private individuals. The question
now arises whether certain improvements
can be made in the act. It is the opinion of
the housing corporation that, by so doing, the
security of existing investments would not
be affected and the act would be made more
useful to a certain class in our community.
Loans through the Central Mortgage and
Housing Corporation are based on the loaning value of a building of the maximum value
of $12,800. No change of that figure is intended. The first change relates to loans by
the Government. To date, these have
amounted to about $250 million, and this
legislation seeks to make another $150 million available to the corporation for loaning
purposes. That of course will not cover the
money that is being loaned, but it will help
to induce other moneylenders to lend money
under the act. Originally the rate of interest
was 5 per cent, but a little over a year ago
it was raised to 6 per cent, and that rate of
interest remains as it was before this bill
was amended.

The question that first arises is how much
money can be loaned on a house. Let us say
that the house costs $12,800. Under the existing law a loan of 90 per cent of the value
can be obtained on the first $8,000, and 70
per cent on the balance. The remainder has
to be put up in cash. That gives rise to a
problem. Many people to whom such a loan
would be of great value in getting housing
accommodation have been unable to raise
the cash payment required, because there is
a proviso in the act that all a borrower can
pay by way of rent or principal on the
mortgage by way of interest and taxes in toto
is 23 per cent of his total income, and he
must be able to show that he qualifies under
that provision before he can make a deal. A
great many people of a deserving class have
not sufficient capital to do this, and various
ways to overcome that problem have been
attempted. For instance, the contractors have
taken a second mortgage back, and there
have been all kinds of trouble. Finally, that
had to be prohibited, because it imposed a
risk on the loan. The bill provides that 90
per cent of the first $12,000 can be borrowed.
A 70 per cent loan will continue to be available on the balance of the lending value.
The effect of these changes will be to
increase loans by as much as $800 in many
cases. For example, on a house with a lending value of $12,000 the maximum loan at
In future it will be
present is $10,000.
$10,800.
As I have said, at present it is required
that the amount a borrower pays in principal,
interest and taxes shall not exceed 23 per
cent of his income, unless he can obtain
special approval of a larger percentage. It
is proposed to raise the ratio to 27 per cent.
That is to say, the borrower must show that
his total income is such that 27 per cent of
it will be sufficient to pay at the same percentage rates as those required under the
present law.
It is the belief of the housing corporation
that this arrangement will meet the needs
of a large class of people whose needs
have not in the past been met. Indeed, the
response for this type of loan has been very
good. It indicates that a number of people
who could not take advantage of the previous
arrangement can take advantage of this
arrangement.
There is no change in principle proposed
under the present law. A man who lends
money on a property up to 90 per cent of
$12,000 will be able to get insurance covering
that loan from the Government just as fie can
under the present law. So, anybody who
wishes to help the building cause in this
respect can do so as well under the proposed
amendment as under the present legislation.

DECEMBER 19, 1957
For instance, if a building organization wants
to lend money at a certain rate of interest,
anything over 4 per cent goes to the housing
corporation, and the Government guarantees
the 4 per cent. That arrangement would
continue. The money required by old people
and by organizations would come under the
same regulations as have existed heretofore.
The only real change which this bill proposes is that the total amount of housing
loans be increased from $250 million to $400
million. The bill would not vary the present
law, except in the respect to which I have
referred. There will be the same inducements
for people to make loans, and for builders to
carry out housing projects. I understand that
since this legislation has been publicized
builders have indicated there is a greater
demand than they had expected for loans
under this arrangement.
The proposed legislation goes a little further, in that it gives the borrower the right
to refinance his housing loan, if he should
require money for any purpose. All those
arrangements are made through the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation, and it
would like to be able to deal with matters as
they arise.
Let me say quite candidly, honourable senators, I think this feature of the change in
percentage is a real advance in the progression of this legislation. I believe you will find
there is a bigger demand forthcoming for
loans on houses by people who really need the
help than has been the case heretofore.
There is still a demand for housing right
across Canada. This is especially true among
lower-income families. They require houses
that can be financed over a longer term than
the housing corporation is now offering.
Honourable senators, I have prepared a
statement which gives in a little fuller detail
what I have attempted to say to you this
afternoon. If it is the wish of the house, I
shall place the text on Hansard so that anyone here or outside the house can read the
full explanation; on the other hand, if honourable senators object to my filing it, I will not
do so.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
the honourable leader has given a clear exposition of this bill, and it seems unnecessary
to place a statement on Hansard.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Very well.
When the national housing scheme was
started, some years ago, I was afraid we
would get into difficulties, but I guess I was
wrong, because during the last three or four
years there has been a great development
along these lines.
I will say a word or two on the reason for
the proposed changes in the legislation. The

slowing-up in building did not begin just
two or three months ago. A little over a
year ago the number of new starts on bousing commenced to fall off and they continued
to fall off until around August, and the only
thing that stopped them from falling off
further was this scheme which was brought
forward then.
There is now general agreement among
builders all over Canada with this legislation. They say it is a good idea, and they
feel that housing loans will be even better
security than they have been before.
For all these reasons, honourable senators,
I move the second reading of the bill.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I am very glad that the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) has given
such a clear explanation of this bill. Of
course, he is very familiar with the legislation, but I would not want honourable senators to think that he has obtained his
knowledge of it during the last few hours.
If I remember correctly, he was one of the
severest critics of this legislation when it
was first brought before this house, some
years ago, so he should understand all
about it. I am glad that he bas been converted toHon. Mr. Howard: -good Liberal policies.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: -good Liberal policies
and belief in Liberal principles. Originally
this was Liberal legislation.
While I am on that subject, I might say
that practically all the bills brought down in
the Senate this year have been amendments
to legislation which was introduced in the
first place by the former Government-good
Liberal legislation.
Hon. Mr. Monette: But a more liberal
policy has been added.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, the government could not do better than try to improve
some of the legislation which the former
administration introduced.
While the Leader of the Government was
explaining this bill so fully I picked up off
my desk the file containing the bills that
have been passed this session. I find that
every bill that has come over from the other
house this session has been a bill amending
legislation which was introduced by the
former Government-every bill with the possible exception of the one to provide for
advance payments for prairie grain prior to
delivery thereof. I stand to be corrected if
I am wrong. Has the Government introduced
any new legislation this session, apart from
the bill to provide for advance payments
for prairie grain?

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is an amendment
to Liberal legislation.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is in accordance
with Liberal thought, but I think we must
admit it is a new bill which the former
administration had been working up but
which had not quite reached that stage.
Honourable senators, I will read a list of
these bills. The first was the finance bill,
for interim supply. As we know, that was
based on the former administration's budget,
which we think has been changed.
Now, the next billThe Hon. the Speaker: I think the honourable senator should refrain from discussing
other bills.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Mr. Speaker, may I
make my point clear? Today we have been
presented with this very important bill which
did not meet with approval of the Opposition a few months ago. Oh, I remember the
speech made by my honourable friend from
Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner). He was
not at all enthusiastic about this legislation
at that time. I do not know whether he is
enthusiastic about it now or not-he might
tell us before the day is over. But my point
is, Mr. Speaker and honourable senators, that
we are presented with this very important
bill today, on the 19th day of December, and
it is proposed, I understand, that this house
should meet tomorrow morning. If we do
meet then it will be absolutely impossible to
send this very important bill to committee.
True, this is legislation which was passed
last year and bas now been improved upon,
but we should be able to inquire into it. We
have had a general statement from the
Leader of the Government, but we do not
know the details about loans that have been
made, how many of them are outstanding,
if there have been defaults, and so forth.
This important measure comes to this Senate
on almost the very last day of our sitting
prior to the Christmas vacation and we are
asked to pass it, though knowing little about
it. Now, I ask you as good businessmen and
good businesswomen, is that the way to conduct the business of this country?
My honourable friends opposite may say,
well, we could not bring the legislation along
any faster. Honourable senators, the election was held on June 10. I remember it
all too well. The writs were returned, if
I remember correctly, about the 20th or 25th
of August. Why could we not have had a
session of Parliament opening in the latter
part of August? Oh, you say to me, we
wanted Parliament to be opened by Her
Majesty. True, we wanted Parliament to
be opened by Her Majesty, but why couldn't

we have had a session of Parliament opening
in August, continuing throughout September,
going into October, and then proroguing
about the 10th of October? We could then
have had a new session.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: The Government would
have had to bring in a budget if that was
done.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck)
says the Government would have had to
bring in a budget if that was donc. Well,
that is not a good reason for not having a
session of Parliament during the two months
before October 14* and then starting a new
session on October 14. I ask honourable senators, is there any reason why that could not
have been done?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: What about the Postal
Congress that was occupying this building?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, you wanted the
Postal Congress to put the Parliament of
Canada in second place?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I did not say that at all.
Arrangements were made for the Postal
Congress to occupy quarters in the Parliament Building before this Government was
elected.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
is this the only building in Ottawa where
the Postal Congress could have met? My
honourable friend from Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt) has been in Ottawa only a few
months, so he does not know the city very
well, but I can assure him there are many
other places where the Congress could have
met. The arrangements for it to use the
Parliament Building were no excuse for not
calling a session of Parliament in August.
The business of the country was more important than the Postal Congress and if
Parliament had met in August we would
have been able to consider this bill and other
measures as they should be considered.
Honourable senators, I say to you that in
the few hours we have at our disposal this
afternoon it is absolutely impossible for this
bouse to give this bill the consideration to
which it is entitled. If the Senate is not to
sit tomorrow morning we ought to have a
committee meeting at that time to consider
the bill; but of course, if it is intended that
the Senate shall sit, the bill cannot then be
considered in committee.
As far as I am concerned I will not be a
party to holding up the legislation. Let the
Government take the responsibility for rushing it through this house. I shall vote in
favour of it, but I reserve my right at a
future date, when the opportunity will arise,

DECEMBER 19, 1957
to discuss this legislation as it should be
discussed. I am voting for it at this time
only because I feel it would not be right to
have it held up during the two or three
weeks when we shall not be in session and
thereby delay people from obtaining during
that period the benefits which the bill provides. So I reiterate that I shall vote for
the bill, but under the strongest protest
against the manner in which it is being
presented.
Hon. R. B. Horner: Honourable senators,
I must say that I have been somewhat
amused by the speech of the honourable
Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald). For 22 years, when we who are now on
this side of the house were sitting on the
other side. I listened to the same complaint
when important legislation came before us,Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Never so important
as this.
Hon. Mr. Horner: -and the reply we received was: "Take it or leave it. It is going
through, anyway."
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Name the legislation.
Hon. Mr. Horner: That was the attitude of
the then Government when the honourable
leader on the other side sat on this side.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Never.
Hon. Mr. Horner: As to the time when Parliament was called, let me remind honourable
senators that the former Government promised to provide accommodation for the 14th
Universal Postal Union Congress. The honourable senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr.
Brunt) has not been with us very long, but
I have been a member of this chamber for
22 years, and I know that there is no other
place in Ottawa which equals the Parliament
buildings as an attractive setting for such a
conference. It was an inspiring experience to
walk down the main thoroughfare and see
the world's flags in so fine a setting, and to
identify them with their respective countries.
As I have said, the use of the buildings,
including the Senate chamber, was arranged
for by the last Government. In view of this
fact, how can any honourable senator say
that the present Government should have
notified the postal authorities, "We are going
to cancel this arrangement; get out; Parliament is about to meet"? It would also have
detracted from the success of Her Majesty's
visit if, as was suggested, one session had
been opened and quickly followed by
another.
So far as this legislation is concerned, I
give all honourable senators credit for a
thorough understanding of the bill. They
have debated this subject. They must

thoroughly understand what it is. They are
accustomed to the workings of the organization created by this bill; the changes have
been explained; and no interest, so far as I
can see, will suffer any injury if this bill
should receive royal assent tomorrow.
I admire the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) for his
speech: that is, I think he did the best he
could for a bad cause.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable senators, I should like to add a word or two
to what has been said apropos of this bill,
which was presented to us a few minutes
ago and comes directly from the other
chamber.
We have heard a good deal in other sessions
about the importance of having the Senate's
Finance Committee meet for the purpose of
inquiring into the extent of Governnent
expenditures in all fields,-federal, provincial and municipal. It was generally understood that such an inquiry made by the
committee which sat year by year under the
chairmanship of the honourable senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) would have a
moral effect on public opinion generally, and
possibly would be useful in an indirect way
in suggesting that Government expenditures
were reaching a pretty high level, not unrelated to an inflationary trend which was
becoming very definitely evident in many
ways.
I feel that in respect of this bill there are
two very important points, relating to the
financial welfare of Canada, which should
be made clear-much clearer than we in this
house can make them. It was my responsibility in previous sessions to present amendments to the National Housing Act; and I
clearly remember that in nearly every case
my good friend the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) took very strong
exception to some of those measures, largely
on the ground that they exceeded the bounds
of business expediency and sound business
practice. One feature of this bill which I
notice is that the limit of advances is to be
increased to $400 million from $250 million.
I recall that, upon the presentation of amendments of this act which were referred to our
standing committee, some of us, including
myself, held very definitely that the operations of the C.M.H.C. should not run to
unlimited mortgage commitments. Ten years
after this act came into effect in 1944-45
something like one billion dollars of public
money had been invested in the housing
field, secured by mortgages which amounted
to as much as 85 to 95 per cent of the principal carried by the Government through the
mortgage corporation; and we felt that we

SENATE
were reaching a state where we should be
very careful in promoting future developments.
For the same reason, I think at this time
that this bill should be the subject of examination by a committee of this house. I do
not see that there is any great need to rush
it through at one sitting. I am quite willing
to admit that the principle involved in the
bill is not new, and therefore we cannot
consistently oppose it. But certainly, when
we come to the details, I for one should like
to have a lot more explanation of the present
position of the Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation in this connection.
I do not want at this time to digress upon
inflation. We know that has been an overhanging threat. In fact, it was emphasized
in the last annual report of the Committee
on Finance which was set up in this house
to inquire into the subject. With that overhanging threat, I think it is the responsibility
of the Senate to function as it was intended
to, and make a closer examination into the
details of this bill. We should have officials
frorn the Central Mortgage and Housing
Corporation appear before us to give a complete statement of the amount of public
funds represented in housing mortgages
today, so that we can at least judge the
effects of this measure. I do not mind preparing for unemployment relief, but let us
deal with it as such, not under the guise of
its being a necessary amendment to the
National Housing Act. It is a question
whether or not the corporation be urged to
extend further facilities in the way of mortgages to a people who, if I am any judge of
present conditions, are carrying just about
as much in the way of 95 per cent liability
on mortgages as they are able to handle.
Hon. Gustave Monete: Honourable senators, may I add a word or two? As I understood the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald), he approved of this bill because
its principle as well as its details seem to
be fairly acceptable. The honourable gentlemen complained, however, about the delay
in bringing the bill before this house. Another
honourable senator said that we were not in
a hurry and could delay consideration of the
bill until we resume in the new year. Perhaps I can reconcile the two views.
This bill provides something good for the
ordinary man, and certain facilities and
advantages of which he can avail himself.
That being so, to pass it now would be to
give a welcome Christmas gift to people in
the lower-income group-a large part of the
community. As far as I am concerned, I
am willing to be a little inconvenienced by

shortening my own holidays, if thereby we
can hasten passage of this bill. I do not
think there is much in it that requires discussion. I am glad that the Leader of the
Opposition has approved of the bill, and I
am ready to vote for it.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
I rise on this occasion to do something to
which I am not accustomed, that is, to congratulate the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig) on the very clear and complete
explanation he has given of the purport of
this bill. I have the greatest possible respect
for the honourable Leader of the Government, on account of his years. The honourable gentleman lived in the full shade of the
Opposition for so many years that the office
he now occupies with great dignity in this
house is still somewhat new to him, and during this session we have sometimes had difficulty in getting the purport and the full
details of certain legislation. However, the
honourable leader has given us a very clear
exposition of the purport of this bill, and he
added, which I am sure was gratifying to all
honourable senators, that it changes nothing
in the fundamental principles of the legislation which was introduced year after year by
the previous Government. The bill merely
extends the principles already laid down.
The honourable senator from Blaine Lake
(Hon. Mr. Horner) said that when be and his
fellow senators were sitting on this side of
the house they complained that they were
sometimes pressed to adopt legislation too
quickly. I recall very clearly, when sitting
on the other side of His Honour the Speaker,
that we also complained that legislation of
great import was brought down to this house
at too late an hour. Honourable senators,
this legislation does not call for immediate
action, and I shall be quite satisfied if it is
allowed to stand over until the house reconvenes on January 7. I agree with my deskmate, the honourable senator from Ottawa
(Hon. Mr. Lambert), that we should give this
bill a little closer attention. When a question
of hundreds of millions of dollars is involved,
as in this legislation, I think the Senate owes
it to itself to examine the figures closely and
to go into the whys and wherefores of the
legislation, which is urged upon us. The
question involved is only one of quantum, for,
as the honourable leader has said, the principles of the act are unchanged. However,
at this juncture unemployment obtains in
Canada on a scale unknown prior to June
10 last. I am not accusing honourable senators opposite of being responsible, but I
recall that in 1930 Mr. Bennett often accused
the Government in office of being the cause
of the worldwide depression. I do not intend
to fall into the same pitfall. I am not going

DECEMBER 19, 1957
usually goes into these matters in great detail; it calls before it officials and accountants
to give all available facts. I presume its
treatment of the housing account would not
be different from that of others. I further
pointed out to the Chairman that I would
not be able to promise him any support by
way of time from our group, but that he was
free to call the committee together if he
wished to.
Honourable senators, I give you that background in order that you may know the true
picture, and I take my share of the blame
for not having the Finance Committee convened. As you can see, it would have been
absolutely impossible to have the accounts
gone into in the same way as the House of
Commons does it; indeed, that is a job of
great magnitude in that house.
Let me point out that this housing account was going up all the time under the
old Government. It was going up a year ago,
and it has been going up ever since. However,
at the same time, the number of houses being
built was falling off, not through any action
by the Government, but rather because not
as many houses were being sold as formerly.
Purchasers were unable to put up the cash
payment necessary to buy them.
Now, Mr. Speaker, I do not suppose you
will allow me to refer to what went on in the
other house in this respect?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would like to say a few
words about it, but I am not allowed to.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was not the Liberal party
that held up the bill in the other place.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,Hon. Mr. Macdonald: That should not be
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, said, but it is of course true.
if the honourable Leader of the Government
Hon. Mr. Bruni: "We love ourselves".
speaks again on this debate, it will have the
effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We all know what party it
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I was. Anyway, that is the situation we are
think I should give a few facts which might faced with in this country. We have done
help my honourable friends, particularly the our best to fight it through over there under
two gentlemen who have just spoken, to certain opposition. We have been trying
desperately hard to get the bill over here, and
better understand the situation.
The honourable Chairman of the Committee I must now ask the house to support my
I
on Finance (Hon. Mr. Hawkins) said some motion for second reading this afternoon.
do not think I am being arbitrary in asking
time ago that he was quite prepared to call
honourable senators to do that. I honestly
the Finance Committee together and have it think that this bill is for the assistance of
make certain examinations. Now, I must bear the little fellow, as my honourable friend
my share of the responsibility for the decision from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr. Monette) mennot to convene that committee. I pointed out tioned. And this is one time in the year when
to my honourable friend that the session we ought to think of the little fellow, and
would likely be short, perhaps not lasting realize that he likes to have a home as well
more than two months, and that it might end as anybody.
Let me tell you a story: I may have told it
before the committee could start to work. As
I reminded him, the Finance Committee before, but, if so, let me tell it again. In 1914

to accuse the Government which has been
in office since June 10 last of having caused
the recession which bas resulted in increased
unemployment in Canada on a scale which
is now recognized. There is no doubt that
the development of the construction industry,
as it relates to the building of dwellings, will
favour most effectively the relief of unemployment. If we can develop a house-building program which will give employment to
labour in all the trades, we will be providing
some relief to an immediate and pressing
problem facing the Government of Canada.
No doubt on the 10th of June last a cloud
of gloom and uncertainty fell over the
country; that condition has developed from
day to day and month to month, and unemployment has increased by leaps and bounds.
But we have to face that condition. If the
Government will express the opinion that the
principle involved in this legislation, which
over the years has been placed on our statute
books, is a good thing and should be extended to meet the conditions we are facing
today, I am in favour of it. But we have to
consider the methods by which the Government now proposes to extend that legislation.
Because this legislation involves increasing
the commitments of the country for housing
from $250 million to $400 million, I do not
believe that the Government is justified in
pressing this bill through the Senate in 24
hours, or even in 48 hours. We are quite
willing and prepared to consider the principle
of the bill today. But my feeling is that it
should then be referred to a committee, to be
convened and sit after the Christmas recess.
If that is agreed to, I have no objection to
the bill being given second reading now.

SENATE
I canvassed in Weston, that portion of Winnipeg where there lived a lot of English, Irish
and Scottish people who worked for the
Canadian Pacifie Railway. I was a young man
then, and I had the idea that my own children
were the only ones who met their father at
the door when he returned home from work
and who thought he was the best father in
the world. But I soon found out, when I went
to this area at 5 o'clock in the afternoon, that
the children of those working men met their
fathers at the door, just as mine did, and
each of them thought their father was the
best one in the world.
It was then I realized for the first time that
the men and women who lived in that area,
on relatively small incomes, had as much
right to a home for their children as the rest
of us had. Now my boys and girls are married and are able to look after themselves.
But many young people come to my office
trying to get loans to enable them to make a
down payment on a home. I have seen them
borrow on a second mortgage at as high a
rate of interest as 24 per cent a year, which
is allowed under the law.
Let me say quite candidly, honourable
senators, the Government is unanimous in
its desire to have this bill passed at this
time. My honourable friend from De Lorimier
(Hon. Mr. Vien) may be right in his insinuation that it is to help the unemployment
situation. Whether that is true or not, this
legislation is for the purpose of helping the
little fellow, who has as much right to a
home as anybody else.
The Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) was very fair in his remarks. He
feels that we are rushing him a little too
fast. I understand his position. I was Leader
of the Opposition for 12 years, and I thought
my term in that office would never end.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not think that.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You never can tell. As I
say, I sat in the seat my friend occupies
for 12 years, and I know what it meansit goes on and on, and seems never to end.
But then the worm turns, and it ends.
As I say, we want this bill, and we want
it very badly. The contractors are pressing
us for this legislation; they tell us they
can sell houses as soon as they are able to
build them, and they can only build them
under this new arrangement with respect
to the cash payment. That is the real crux of
the argument. I am not afraid of the expenditure of $400 million. That may be all gone,
and if it goes, it goes. What concerns me
is our ability to provide accommodation for
people who are unable to get it under the
present act. So, I appeal to my colleagues
in this bouse, for goodness' sake, to put the

bill through and let the Government carry
it out. You will know between now and
whenever the next election takes place, be it
one, two or three years from now, whether
or not the thing is a success. If it is not a
success, the Government will pay the penalty.
The people will remember, and they will
make us pay the penalty if we were wrong.
So you do not need to worry about that.
I cannot see how a study of housing can
be made without an exhaustive examination.
In order to make such an investigation we
would have to go into the valuation of buildings all over Canada. I know something about
the mortgage business. There is no way
you can get the whole picture other than by
close examination. Suppose, for instance, 500
houses were built in Winnipeg. You cannot
tell whether loans against those houses are
good investments or not. The answer to that
depends on the valuation of the bouse and
the condition of the districts in which they
were built.
For those reasons, I would press the bouse
very kindly to give us consideration and pass
the bill on second reading now.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable gentlemen, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move third reading now.
Hon. Thomas Vien: Honourable senators,
this bill is too important to be read a third
time at this sitting. I suggest that it be
referred to one of our standing committees.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion for third
reading of this bill. Is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is the honourable
senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien)
through with his remarks?
Hon. Mr. Vien: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I agree with what has been said by the two
honourable senators who spoke from this side
as to the importance of this bill and the
inadvisability of passing it without a thorough
examination. I say without hesitancy that
if this were not the second last day of the
sitting before the Christmas holidays I
would vote against the motion for third
reading of the bill today. I cannot see any
point in passing the bill today. Am I right
that royal assent will be given to bills
tomorrow?

DECEMBER 19, 1957
Hon. Mr. Haig: Royal assent will be given
tomorrow- to all the bills that have been
passed by that time.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Why can we not give
this bill third reading tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Tomorrow I may be held
up in the same way as I am today. I might
as well take a licking now as later.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am not going to
quibble about that, but I do say that if the
bill is held up it will delay construction of
buildings under its provisions until January
8 or 9, or probably the 10th. I think we
should try to avoid that if at al possible.
Hon. Mr. Lambert: May I ask the honourable senator a question? I did not hear the
earlier remarks of the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig), and I am unaware
whether or not the operations of the Central
Mortgage and Housing Corporation will be
brought to a dead stop if this bill does not
go through now. Are there no funds at all
available for its operations? Two previous
payments of $150 million were made to
enable it to go on with additional housing.
Am I to understand that all that is used up
and that no further operations can take place
until this bill becomes law?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not all used up, but
it is all contracted for. The corporation can
say, "Go ahead with those ten or twenty
houses", but it has not got the money to pay
the contractors when the payments become
due. I think there is quite a bit of money
left, but it is all contracted for except for a
small amount. What I mean to say is the
corporation has already promised to finance
so many houses and there is money available
for that construction work, but it has not the
money available for the financing of additional houses.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In other words, it cannot make new commitments?
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I think I can answer the question. My understanding of the position of the fund at the
present time is that, as the Leader of the
Government has said, practically all of the
money has either been used and disposed of
or else contracted for.
Besides that, honourable senators, I understand that the trust companies and banks
have also advanced as much money as they
deem it advisable to advance at the present
time for house building. In other words, I
think the funds from these institutions have
dried up.
Hon. -Mr. Bouffard: That is right.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Some honourable
senators are better informed on this question
than I am. The honourable senator from
Grandville (Hon. Mr. Bouffard), who is extremely well informed on that subject, agrees
with what I said. So the position we now
find ourselves in, so far as housing is concerned, is that the funds that were provided
by the act as it stands at present have been
used, or provision has been made for distribution of them, and the funds that the
banks and trust companies have set aside for
house building have been disposed of, and
at the moment there are no funds on hand
for future building under the National Housing Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators, I may
say that I have no information as to the loaning companies, but I doubt very much that they
have money available. However, the Government is terribly anxious to get the low-income
people into the house-buying business.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Well, that is the position of mortgage money in Canada today. I
think it would be most regrettable if the people
who need houses, and the builders who can
give employment, should be deprived of the
privilege of getting houses and of giving
employment by reason of our holding up
this bill until January 7 or 10.
I do not like the conditions under which
this bill has been brought here. I think the
Finance Committee could probably go into
this question after the New Year.
The
urgency which bas been impressed on us for
the passage of this bill prompts me to say
that I hope we will never have to face
another situation like it. But in spite of
that, I am going to vote for the third reading
of the bill.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, before this bill is read the third
time I wish to draw your attention and that
of His Honour the Speaker to Rule 63, which
is to the effect that no bill shall be read
twice the same day except by unanimous
consent.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not like to interrupt, but I would point out that a few
weeks ago rule 63 and certain other rules
relating to public bills were suspended for
the balance of the session.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: As the honourable senator
says, this is one of the rules that were
suspended some time ago for the balance of
the session.
Now, I find it unfortunate that the Government waited such a long time before introducing this bill in the House of Commons
that it reaches us in the Senate at almost the
last minute before the holiday season. While

SENATE

most honourable senators are willing to be
broadminded with regard to observance of
the rules of the house, I for one never thought
that housing legislation would spring up at
the last moment and in such an atmosphere
that it is very difficult to have any more information before voting on it. My idea of the
fulfilment of our parliamentary duty is that
any honourable senator is entitled to all the
information for which he asks, pertinent to
legislation which is before this bouse. I will
make no more criticism of the action of which
I have complained, but I hope that in future
the Government will see to it that the Senate
enjoys better consideration with regard to
legislation.
I join with the honourable senator from
De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) in complimenting the honourable Leader of the Government
on his approach to his colleagues with regard
to this legislation. We know that it is now
impossible to discuss every angle of it, but
on the other hand we expect that in future
the Government will correct this situation,
otherwise its legislation will be opposed, and
there will no longer be any unanimity. When
I say that there will be no unanimity, I
speak of myself alone, and, perhaps, for
others who share my views, with regard to
rushing legislation through this house. It
brings discredit to the Senate. In the House
of Commons they say, "We will pass legislation, the Senate will swallow it; we will pass
legislation, the Senate will vote for it with
closed eyes. No use to give them information." Many times have I stressed the importance of the Finance Committee, which is
composed of colleagues of high standing, men
who have done very well in the past, in
considering the estimates which were submitted to their attention. They have done
their work very well. Now, there are the
contractors, who are in a sad case; there are
the banks, which do not supply any more
money; there are the insurance companies,
which have gone the limit; but the Senate
must go right along and say, "Amen, amen;
it is very good, we will agree to that."
The honourable the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Hon. Mr. Haig) and all
other honourable senators must realize that
this is pure nonsense. I do not want to cause
any handicap to the building trade nor to
those who are constructing bouses for themselves; but now my Christmas spirit is nearly
exhausted and I hope the Government will
heed my very strong protest, and that the
honourable Leader of the Government will
tell his colleagues of the cabinet at its next
sitting that one senator and perhaps more
senators do not like their manner of dealing
with the Senate.

I have done my best since I have been here
to boost the Senate, to show what it can
accomplish for Parliament. In many ways
the Senate is ahead of the House of Commons:
it is an institution of progress. But we shall
not serve the cause of progress too well by
dealing hastily with legislation; we must take
our time, study it with care, give thought to
it, in order to improve it by a common study
of each problem which is confronting us.
Therefore, I serve warning to the Government
that after Christmas I shall be no longer,
perhaps, in a Christmas spirit to deal with
legislation.
Hon. Mr. Vien: In amendment, I move,
seconded by the Honourable Senator Lambert:
That this bill be not now read the third time,
but that it be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce for further study.
Hon. Charles B. Howard: Honourable

senators, if this were new legislation I would
agree with what has been said on this side
of the house. But, as my leader (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald) has said, this is not new legislation; that is, it relates to an act which has
been amended several times. The present
amendment goes part of the way to satisfy my
wishes in this respect, but I hope that it will
be still further improved either by this
Government or by a new Government in the
future.
Some years ago, when I was much younger
than I am now, I thought that in order to
prevent communism, which at that time was
in its infancy, from getting a hold on this
country, the best step a Government or anyone else could take would be to provide
homes for Canadians who did not have sufficient money to build homes of their own.
At that time, long before legislation of this
type was introduced, I made a speech for
which I was severely criticized by certain
private interests who did not accept my ideas.
However, I have watched the steady progress
of legislation of this order, and I think the best
thing we can do today is to pass the bill. I
object to the amendment and intend to vote
against it.
There are certain conditions which attach
to the provision of housing. When I built
50 houses in my home town, at my own
expense, with money from a trust company
which operated at that time in Sherbrooke,
certain rules and qualifications had to be
observed. These rules have been developed
by the National Housing authority and
brought up to a very fine point. I am sure
that everyone in this house compliments
Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation
for the job it has done in providing or making
available the necessary funds for the purchase
of homes by people who otherwise could

DECEMBER 19, 1957
not afford them. Let us not forget that these
people have as much right in this country
as we have. Possibly some of them are
more interested in this country than we are,
for they have no vested interest, which sometimes makes one's judgment biased.
In my earlier days the first question asked
of a man who wanted to build his own home
was how long he had been in his present
employment. If he had been in his employment for five years he was then eligible
to be granted a loan. He put up no portion
of the money required; he merely picked
from a magazine the design of a house he
wanted to build, let the contract to a contractor, and through a trust company the
money was furnished to enable him to own a
home. Every one of the homes in that
project have been paid for, and people are
living in them. I think this development has
not only benefited Sherbrooke and the community in general, but also that the whole
moral situation of our time has been benefited.
As time progressed the Government then in
office moved forward and amended the housing legislation, and I am happy that it is
going to be amended again.
Honourable senators, the one thing I find
fault with today is the architecture or exterior
design of some homes which, although the
interiors provide the necessary accommodation for the occupants, often detracts very
much from the beauty of our cities and
countryside.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Howard: I hope that some day
we shall be able to get legislation to improve
the appearance of homes in order that our
cities and suburbs will take on the pleasant
aspect they once had.
Honourable senators, I can see no reason
for even attempting to delay legislation which
is in the interest of not only the common
people but of every person in Canada.
Eventually, we shall have a larger population
in Canada, and we shall have to reduce the
amount required to buy homes in order to
provide more and better housing at a lower
price for certain income classes.
Honourable senators, I could say a good
deal more, but I am not going to do so at this
time.
I hope this bill will be passed
immediately.
Hon. Vincent Dupuis: Honourable senators,
I just want to add a few words about this
important question. First, let me say I do
not want honourable senators to be mistaken
in thinking that because I am seated on the
Government side of the chamber I always
share the views of the present Government. I
just happen to be on this side. no doubt

owing to the fact that our good friends were
too long on the other side. Anyway, I am
satisfied to be in good company.
In principle, honourable members of this
house should be above questions of petty partisanship, and we should be regarded as
the elders, as were the wise men of the nation
in the times of the ancient Hebrews. We
should prove that we deserve to be so called
by our wisdom and by our better judgment.
Having said that, honourable senators, may
I tell you that I share the views of the honourable senator from Sherbrooke (Hon. Mr.
Howard). I understand that those honourable senators who wish to give further study
to the bill do so on the principle of responsible government; they want to know more
about it-as the saying is, they want to know
how and why. They cannot be blamed for
that, for that is in accordance with the principle of responsible Government as I see it.
On the other hand, we have dealt with quite
a number of bills without being able to
study them fully, and therefore the principle
I have referred to has been infringed upon
many times by the present Government during
the present session. After all, the distinguished Leader of the Senate (Hon. Mr.
Haig) is a member of the present Government, and it will have to render an account
of its attitude so far as the principles of responsible government are concerned. Since
we have already swallowed-if I may use that
expression-other legislation without being
able to obtain complete details to justify our
attitude in passing it, I cannot see why the
bill now before us should not be allowed to
pass.
As was pointed out by the honourable
Leader of the Senate and also my good friend
and compatriot from Mille Isles (Hon. Mr.
Monette), many citizens who availed themselves of this legislation began to build houses
and did not have enough money to finish
them; they had to borrow money at a very
high rate of interest. In one instance, of
which I know personally, a friend of mine
was unable to finish his little home because
he did not have enough money. In principle
I think the law is good which enables such
people to build or purchase new homes for
themselves with less difficulty than they have
encountered in the past. As my good friend
from De la Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot)
said in the other house some years ago, "Let
our friends who intend to build now have
a little gift from Santa Claus"-who is now
represented by the present Government in cooperation with Her Majesty's loyal Opposition in this house.

SENATE
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I would like to join with my friend
from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien) in the very
generous remarks he has made about the
present Government. He said he did not
accuse the present Government of being responsible for the unemployment, the business
slump, the stagnation, the recession in which
we find ourselves.
I would like to be as generous as the senator from De Lorimier, but I find myself
unable to do so. At the present moment we
are talking about a matter of money for the
carrying on of the house-building industry
in this country. I very well recollect the
statements made by the then Opposition
members prior to the last election, about the
money that was coming from the United
States to Canada, a situation which seemed
to be highly regretted by these gentlemen.
They were afraid the United States was
going to buy Canada and carry it off in its
vest pocket. Responsible representatives of
the par'ty now in power made many statements highly discouraging to people across
the line who proposed to invest money in
Canada.
As we know, honourable senators, money
is a very shy commodity. It takes fright
very easily. People do not invest where
they are not wanted, and they do not enter
into business where they are not welcome.
It is the easiest thing in the world to stop
money coming into this country by just
expressing disagreement with the fact that
it is coming in and allowing those who are
responsible for its coming in to imagine that
the action is detrimental to their interests.
Not only were funds from across the line
deliberately dried up by the oratory of our
friends across the aisle, but in addition to
that, and supplementary to it, those gentlemen who addressed audiences from one end
of Canada to the other talked about destroying trade with the United States and carrying it to Great BritainHon. Mr. Horner: Mr. Speaker, I rise on
a point of order. What have these remarks
to do with the motion before the house? I
fail to see wherein they have anything to do
with this legislation.

house. I have said that the statements made
by these gentlemen, to carry trade from the
United States to Great Britain,The Hon. the Speaker: I have ruled against
any statement being made that has not strictly
to do with the motion before the house.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But it has strictly to do
with it.
The Hon. the Speaker: I have ruled against
the honourable gentleman on that point.

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: If my friend would
just listen,The Hon. the Speaker: I would ask the
honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
to refrain from debating any other subject
than the motion before the house, which is
to refer this bill to the Banking Committee.

Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators,-

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Or to pass it today. I
submit, Mr. Speaker, that my remarks are
directly applicable to the question before the

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Very well, I will not
say anything more. If I cannot discuss the
question before the bouse, I shall not trouble
the house further. But I do say, honourable
senators, that I do not discharge the Government from responsibility for the drying
up of money from the United States, which
I was proposing to elaborate on, but on
which I have been ruled out of order by His
Honour the Speaker.
That being so, I would like to join with
my two friends in their suggestion that there
should be further examination of this bill.
It strikes me, however, that whatever criticism I may direct to the Government along
the line I was proposing to follow, or on
the manner in which it has brought this bill
before the house, the persons who might
benefit by the legislation have had nothing
to do with the things we would criticize.
For my part, I am more concerned about
getting this bill passed than I am even with
getting information to which we are entitled.
I know enough about the nature of this
legislation to approve of it, so I intend to
vote for its passage. I thoroughly appreciate
the reasons for it; I also appreciate the
desirability of gaining further information,
and of taking the time and effort that is
necessary with respect to bills which involve
the expenditures of millions of dollars. I
thoroughly appreciate all that. But particularly do I appreciate what was said by the
honourable senator from Sherbrooke (Hon.
Mr. Howard) about the benefit that can be
conferred upon what the Leader of the Government has called the little man, in giving
him a home for himself and his family. So,
honourable senators, I am going to vote for
the immediate passage of this bill.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, if the Honourable Senator Vien speaks
again it will have the effect of closing the
debate on the motion before the house.
Hon. Mr. Vien: I must say that my motion
now before the house is not on the merits
of the bill, but only on the procedure to be
followed. I suggest that instead of the bill

DECEMBER 19, 1957
being given third reading today, it be referred
to the Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce, so that we might be able to study
thoroughiy a proposai which involves the
expenditure of $400 million of the Canadian
taxpayers' money.
I believe that the dîgnity and function of
the Senate require us to go into these matters
involving huge expenditures a littie more
carefully than might be necessary in other
matters. I therefore say to those honourable
gentlemen who have spoken of the urgency
of passage of the bill that the Christmas
recess will flot affect the situation which
this legisiation proposes to remedy. This bill
involves a principle that was adopted by
Canada some years ago. I am entirely in
favour of the underiying principle; and
therefore, I am also in favour of the principle behind the amendment which would
extend the facilities of the act along the line
suggested. At the same time, I think we are
entitled to have further information. As I
say, I feel the dignity of the Senate cails
for it. I do flot think the apprehension of
my honourable friend who would, in effect,
have the bill steam-roilered through the
Senate before Christmas, is aitogether
justified.
Our duty as senators and as members of
Parliament is to examihie and study details
of legisiation of this type. We should not;
commit the taxpayers of Canada to pay $400
million without adequate study, even though
the prînciple behind the legisiation may
already be on our statute books. We should
at least study the details before us and cali
upon the officers who are going to administer
the act to give us some assurance that the
taxpayers of Canada will be protected. I
do not believe that to refer the bill to committee would prevent the contractors or homebuilders of Canada from getting the relief we
are ail in favour of granting them by this
bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senatorsThe Hon. the Speaker: Order! The debate
is closed.
Honourable senators, in amendment to the
original motion for third reading of this bill
it is moved by the Honourabie Senator Vien,
seconded by the Honourable Senator Lambert,
that this bill be referred to the Standing
Committee on Banking and Commerce. Is it
your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Horner: No.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those against the
motion will stand and say, "Non-content".
Those in favour wiii stand and say, "Content".
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The members are not
ail here.

The Hon. the Speaker: Those in f avour wiii
stand.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: On a point of order,
Mr. Speaker. It is my understanding that
always before votes are taken the members
are calied in.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Nobody has asked that
the members be called in in this instance.
The Hon. the Speaker: I understand the
members are calied in when two members
stand up and request it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This is flot a vote
then.
An Hon. Senalor: A vote by voice.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those in favour of
the amendment will say "Content".
Somne Hon. Senalors: Content.
The Hon. the Speaker: Those opposed will
say "Non-content".
Some Hon. Sena±ors: Non-content.
The Hon. the Speaker: I declare the amendment rejected.
-And more than two senators having
stood, the senators were cailed in.
The Hon. the Speaker: It is moved by the
Honourable Senator Haig, seconded by the
Honourable Senator Horner, that this bill be
now read the third time.
In amendment it is moved by the Honourable Senator Vien, seconded by the Honourable Senator Lambert, that the bill be flot
now read the third time, but that it be

SENATE

Hon. Mr. Vien: On division.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the third time, and passed, on division.
CANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAY
COMPANY BILL
CONSTRUCTION AND PURCHASE OF LINES
IN MANITOBA-FIRST READING

the

The Hon.

Speaker informed the Senate

that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 196, respecting
the construction of a line of railway by Canadian National Railway Company from Optic
Lake to Chisel Lake, and the purchase by
Canadian National Railway Company from
the International Nickel Company of Canada, Limited, of a line of railway from
Sipiwesk to a point on Burntwood River near
Mystery Lake, all in the province of Manitoba.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon.

the

Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon.

Arthur

M.

Pearson:

Honourable

senators I move, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Brunt, that the bill be read the
second time now.
Hon.

Mr.

Roebuck:

Has

the

bill

been

distributed?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators,
this is the first time I have spoken in this
chamber. I should like first to congratulate
the Honourable the Speaker upon his appointment to his high office, and especially
upon his appointment in this historic year,
in which we saw the opening of Parliament
in Ottawa by Her Majesty the Queen. The
hour is late, and I do not want to delay the
Senate too long.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Before the honourable
senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr. Pearson)
proceeds, may I ask the honourable Leader
of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) if copies
of the bill have been distributed? I do not
happen to have a copy.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: The purpose of this bill
is to authorize the Canadian National Railway Company to construct and to purchase
lines of railway in the province of Manitoba,
and to authorize the guarantee by Her
Majesty in right of Canada of the principal
and interest on securities issued by the railway company to finance the construction
and purchase.
Branch Line Number 1 is a line to be constructed by the Canadian National Railway
Company, which runs west from Chisel Lake
52 miles to Optic Lake, on the Lynn Lake

line. The reason that this line is to go west,
instead of south to the Hudson Bay, which
is only about 30 miles away, is that freight
rates by the Hudson Bay railway would have
been higher. To build the line to the Hudson
Bay railway would have meant a longer way
around to get to Flin Flon. The cost of the
construction of the railroad is estimated at
$8,840,000, which is roughly about $180,000
a mile.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I

do not want to interrupt the honourable
gentleman, but this bill is not on my file.
This is the limit-to sponsor a bill which we
have not seen. In the House of Commons
there is a regulation to the effect that the
bill in both languages shall be tabled before
the house may proceed with second reading.
Often I have succeeded in having consideration of a bill postponed because it has not
been tabled in the French language; but here
we have nothing at all. I submit that we
cannot proceed to consider this bill until each
senator has had a copy of it. The least that
can be done is to provide copies. That is not
the fault of the honourable gentleman who
is introducing the bill, but I suggest that he
suspend his argument and that the debate be
adjourned until we have had an opportunity
to read the bill.
The Hon.

the

Speaker: The point is well

taken. We will postpone the discussion on
this bill until copies have been distributed
to honourable members.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps the discussion
could be adjourned until later this day, when
other items on the Order Paper have been
dealt with. We could then revert to it if
copies were available.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The bill has now been
distributed. This is the first time I have seen
it, and apparently, from what honourable
senators have said, the first time they have
seen it. I suggest that the honourable senator
from Lumsden could, if he wished to, make
his explanations now, and then, if the debate
were adjourned until tomorrow, there would
be time for us to study the bill.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You suggest that we proceed tomorrow morning?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My suggestion is that

the honourable member who has introduced
the bill should adjourn the debate until tomorrow. I would certainly not be a party to
giving this bill second reading today without having seen it.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I will accept that sug-

gestion, honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I

rise on a question of privilege on the second

DECEMBER 19, 1957
reading of this bill. I protest. It seems to me
I should have time to read it before discussing it. By looking at the title of the bill I do
not know what is inside. I want to read it
before expressing an opinion on it.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it bas been suggested that the introduction
of the bill be proceeded with, but that further
debate be adjourned until tomorrow.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Is that agreeable to my
honourable friend?
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Yes, surely.
Hon. Mr. Haig: All right.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: I am in a conciliatory
mood today.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators, I
must have been one of the privileged ones
to receive a copy of this bill. I have figures
marked on it which I made a week ago. I
cannot understand, therefore, why the bill
was not distributed. If I may, I will proceed
with the explanation of the bill.
This bill authorizes the Canadian National
Railway Company to construct a line from
Optic Lake on the Lynn lake line to Chisel
Lake, both in the province of Manitoba, a
distance of approximately 52 miles, at an
estimated cost of $8,840,000. It is estimated
that there are 3,500,000 tons of ore to be
mined in that area. The company which
would benefit from this line is the Hudson
Bay Mining and Smelting Company, which
undertakes to carry over this line 350,000
tons of ore per year for a period of ten years.
On the other hand, if they put in proper
machinery, or a mill, at Chisel lake, they will
carry 70,000 tons of concentrate at a higher
freight rate, which will work out at approximately the same revenue for the railway
company.
A shorter line of approximately 30 miles
is also proposed to be purchased by the Canadian National Railway Company from the
International Nickel Company of Canada,
Limited, running north from Sipiwesk to
a point near Mystery Lake, at an estimated
cost of $5,400,000, or $180,000 a mile. The
reason for the high cost of that particular line
is that owing to the development which the
International Nickel Company wanted to
make this year, it could not wait for the railway company to build the line, so they built
it themselves; and because they were in a
hurry it cost them a great deal more per mile
than it would if the line had been built in the
ordinary time.
Of course, there is a certain amount of
other building along the Une that the railway
company acquired. The Mystery Lake branch
will serve a large nickel deposit in that area

which the International Nickel Company are
in the process of mining. They are putting in
a processing plant at Thompson consisting of
a mill, a smelter and a refinery. In addition,
they are building a townsite for a population
of 8,000 people. There will be considerable
freight in and out over this line. Apparently
concentrate is being shipped out at this time.
The other line running west to be built by
the railway company will largely be for ore
that is being shipped out. There will be very
little in freight. Section 4 of the bill states
that the railway company is authorized to
purchase from the International Nickel Company, at a price not exceeding $5,400,000, the
railway branch line Number 2.
Section 6 of the bill reads as follows:
When ownership of Branch Line Number 2 is
transferred to the Railway Company by the Nickel
Company, the Railway Company may, subject to
the approval of the Board of Transport Commissioners for Canada, operate the railway line as a
part of the Railway Company's lines of railway in

Canada.
Honourable senators, I think that is a sufficient explanation of this bill.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Has the honourable
senator a map of the district showing the
railway?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Perhaps it could be laid
on the table so that it can be examined.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Certainly.
Hon. Mr. Power: Does any rolling stock
go with this railway?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: No, I do not think so.
Hon. Mr. Power: It is purely for a right of
way, then?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: To take over the right
of way, and I believe the railway company
is running the rolling stock on it now.
Hon. Mr. Power: Is that part of the
purchase?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: No, that is not part of
the purchase.
Hon. Mr. Power: Then may I ask whose
rolling stock is on the line?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That will be the railway
company's.
Hon. Mr. Power: The Canadian National?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Any railway, probably.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I speak as a private
member for the province of Manitoba?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: No.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Power: You are too important
for that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Before the honourable gentleman. speaks, may I ask him if
there is any objection to sending this bill to
a committee?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not really necessarythere is nothing to it. As a private member
for Manitoba, I would like to say something,
for once in my life, for my own province.
This road runs into the Hudson Bay railroad about half way between Churchill and
The Pas, and it runs down to the Nelson
River, where one of the largest power sites
in Canada is being developed by the provincial Government of Manitoba. About
half of the electricity will be sold to the
International Nickel Company, and the
balance will be sold to other industries going
in there. For instance, a pulpwood industry
is establishing itself there, and ultimately
the power site will be developed further to
bring the power into Winnipeg. It is about
400 miles straight north of Winnipeg. The
benefit to Canada is that this Hudson Bay
railroad, which is operated by the provincial
Government, will get all the business that
comes out of the area. We expect a population in the area of some 8,000, and with the
power development-perhaps we are a bit
optimistic-the number will grow much
larger. There will be considerable business
for the Government-owned railroad, which
will be operated by the Canadian National
system, although there is plenty of room
for other railroads to come in if they want to.
We feel this is one of the best developments Manitoba has had for many years. We
are very proud and happy that the International Nickel Company took over this undertaking in Manitoba. The railway part
of the venture is of course not being carried
out for our benefit. The Government of the
day got the nickel company to promise that
it would help them try to sell the idea for the
building of the railroad, which could be
operated only by the Canadian National
Railways.
I may say that the Canadian
Pacific Railway has a line about 300 miles
from this point, and that is the closest line.
We in Manitoba are very anxious that
this development proceed. You will pardon
the interruption, but this is the voice of
Manitoba speaking.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
I thought when the Leader of the Government rose to speak he was going to move
that this bill be sent to a committee. There
does not seem to be any urgency about it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I do not think there is.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It occurs to me that
we could give the bill second reading today,
and refer it to a committee to meet tomorrow
morning at 10 o'clock.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Agreed.
Hon. Norman P. Lambert: Honourable
senators, my understanding was that the bill
would be presented this afternoon, and the
debate on it would be adjourned until
tomorrow. However, it would, I am sure,
be to the advantage of all of us if the bill
could be given the second reading now and
be referred to a committee to meet tomorrow
morning.
I agree heartily with everything the honourable Leader of the Government has said
about the very promising prospects of this
mining area which will offer not only to
Manitoba, but to the western country and to
Canada as a whole, a great opportunity for
development.
I was fortunate in knowing quite intimately
the member from Churchill (Mr. Weaver)
who sat in the last Parliament. He was
directly connected with the Hudson Bay
Mining Corporation for many years, and was
an expert mining chemist and engineer; he
outlined to me this wonderful prospect of
the development of a nickel deposit in that
area. Such was his enthusiasm that he said
he believed it would outrival the old Frood
mine which was the base of such long term
operation at Sudbury.
So, honourable senators, there is no disposition on anybody's part to prevent the
extension of facilities for the development
of this area as quickly as possible. I am
sure it would be very enlightening to honourable senators if the committee room could
be supplied with a good-sized map of the
area concerned, in order that everyone might
get a clear picture of the location of this
new mining project.
I favour the bill being given second reading at this time and being referred to the
Standing Committee on Transport and Communications for consideration tomorrow.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators, I
move that the bill be referred to the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications.
Hon. Mr. Haig: May I just point out that
it is doubtful that the bill can be reported
back from
committee
tomorrow.
The

DECEMBER 19, 1957
officials of the Canadian National Railways
would have to be there and give their views.
I do not object to this, but I think it should
be known that the bill might not pass
tomorrow. I am only worried about one
thing. In that respect may I suggest to
honourable senators that if the officials come
tomorrow and tell us the situation is as we
have presented it, it would not be unfair for
me to ask that the bill be passed tomorrow?
I will leave it in your hands, subject to
what is said by the officials of the Canadian
National Railways.
Hon. Mr. Power: We certainly cannot enter
into that kind of bargain in advance. I am
quite willing to meet my honourable friend
at any reasonable point, but I do not want
to bind myself in advance on any such deal.
If the railway officials confirm the information as we have it, and I accept that, I shall
be quite willing to vote for the bill; in fact,
I think now that the bill should be passed,
but I am not going to guarantee its passage
in advance.
On motion of Hon. Mr. Pearson, the bill
was referred to the Standing Committee on
Transport and Communications.
HAMILTON HARBOUR COMMISSIONERS
BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 197, respecting
the Hamilton Harbour Commissioners.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators, I move the second reading of the bill.
In presenting this bill I shal take a few
minutes to make a brief statement about it,
and then go over it clause by clause.
Under this bill the Government seeks the
right to make a loan of $4 million to the
Hamilton Harbour Commissioners in order to
permit the Commissioners to participate in an
$8 million development program in connection with their harbour and shipping facilities,
with the hope that this program will be completed by 1960.
I may state that the shipping to and from
the Hamilton harbour, both foreign and
domestic, has steadily increased over recent
years. We now find that industries which
are established in Hamilton have definite
plans to expand. We also find that other

industries are proposing to move to Hamilton;
and recently the Hydro-Electric Power Commission for the province of Ontario made an
announcement that it proposed to construct
a large steam generating plant in Hamilton,
which of course will materially increase the
rate of water-borne traffic to that city.
As every honourable senator knows, the
completion of the St. Lawrence Seaway will
greatly contribute to the increased traffic into
this particular harbour.
If the bill passes and the loan to the
commissioners is made, they propose to spend
the money as follows: The first undertaking
they have in mind is to construct a new
transit shed at the Wellington Street terminal
of the Hamilton harbour. They hope to do
this work during the year 1958. Then, in
1959, they propose to build a new terminal
slip at Ship Street. It is felt that this slip is
necessary in order to provide increased
facilities for the harbour at Hamilton. This
work, just to reiterate, they propose to do
in 1959. Then, in 1960, they wish to construct
another slip at Strathmere Street. The construction of this slip will also further increase
the facilities of the harbour in Hamilton.
The Hamilton Street transit shed will cost
in the neighbourhood of $1 million, and each
of the slips which they propose to construct
will cost in the neighbourhood of $3 million,
making a total of $7 million. I think that a
cushion of $1 million was put in the original
estimate; that is, an estimated total expenditure of $8 million was provided. The cushion
of $1 million will cover any increase of cost
which may be incurred over and above the
original estimates that have been made.
Further, the commissioners are to pay onehalf of the estimated cost of this $8 million
program, and the Department of Public Works
is to pay the other half.
In addition to this $8 million expenditure
which is contemplated, the Department of
Public Works intends to carry out a large
dredging program costing approximately $1
million, which program is necessary in order
to have the slip at Strathmere Street operate
in an efficient manner.
At the present time it had been suggested
that a loan bearing interest at the rate of 4j
per cent per annum be made, the term of the
loan to be for 40 years. On this basis the
annual financing charge for the Wellington
Street transit shed will be approximately
$50,000, and the annual charge for each of the
slips which I have mentioned previously
will be approximately $75,000 each, making a
total annual charge of $200,000. In other
words, the commissioners of the Hamilton
Harbour will be required to repay this loan
at the rate of $200,000 annually and it will

be entirely liquidated, together with all of
the accrued interest thereon, at the end of
a 40-year period.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not see any
reference to that in the bill.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. This was given to me
by way of explanation. I thought the house
would be interested in this information.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: We are all very much

interested in it, but why is it not in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If you will leave that I
will endeavour to explain it as I go over the
clauses of the bill. I thought it would be in
the interest of the house to have this information now.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): Will
the honourable member permit a question?
I think the house is very much interested
in an explanation like this. I am sorry, I did
not catch what interest rate the honourable
gentleman said is likely to be attracted by
these bonds. And if I understood him correctly, there is provision for payment into
a sinking fund each year. Is that so? Could
the honourable senator break down the
amounts for payment on interest and payment into the sinking fund?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I can answer the first part
of the question: the rate of interest is 4 per
cent per annum.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Who decides that?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That will be decided under
the act. There is a clause in the act.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What clause?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Will you leave this until
I deal with the different clauses of the bill?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Al right. I suggest
the honourable senator deal with it in the
way he prefers.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am sorry, honourable
senators, but I have no figures as to how
much of the annual payment of $200,000 will
be used to pay interest, and how much to
retire the principal amount of the bonds.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I suppose I can take
it that the honourable senator is going to
move to have the bill referred to committee?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I do not think there is any
doubt that we will have to do so, because
there are a number of questions which I
cannot answer.
Now, I am advised that all of these projects
have been inspected by the Department of
Public Works, the Department of Finance
and by the Department of Transport; that
on-the-spot inspections have been made, and

all departments have given their support to
this expansion of the Hamilton Harbour.
The feeling of the Government is that this
money is required to be spent in order that
the Hamilton Harbour be developed and
kept up, with the amount of additional ship
traffic that has been going into the harbour
and which the commissioners expect will
increase as time goes on.
The bill itself bas five clauses.
Clause 1 simply states the short title of the
act: The Hamilton Harbour Commissioners
Act, 1957.
Clause 2 deals with loans to be made to the
Hamilton Harbour Commission upon application being made by the commissioners to the
Minister of Finance. No loan can be made
without the approval of the Governor in
Council. The loans are to be made out of the
Consolidated Revenue Fund, and, as I interpret this clause, I imagine that a series of
loans will be made, since the commissioners
will not require the entire amount of $4
million at one time. There is a ceiling
placed upon the amount of money that
can be loaned out of the Consolidated
Revenue Fund to the commissioners, fixed at
$4 million.
The Government, through the Minister of
Transport, will keep a certain amount of
control over the work that is being done in
the Hamilton Harbour, since under clause 3
of the bill all plans and specifications must
be submitted to the Minister of Transport,
who will have to approve of them, and also
the estimates in connection with the work to
be undertaken must be submitted to the
Minister of Transport for his approval. No
loan can be made to the commissioners of
the Hamilton Harbour until the plans,
specifications, and the estimates have all
been approved by the Minister of Transport.
Clause 4 deals with debentures. Under
this clause the commission or, in other words,
the corporation as it is called in the act,
upon receiving moneys under a loan are
compelled to issue and deposit with the
Minister of Finance debentures of the
corporation equal in par value to the
amount of the loan so made. The debentures
shall be for such amounts and repayable on
such terms and shall bear such rates of
interest as the Governor in Council determines. This is the clause under which the
rate of interest will be fixed; and the figure
of 4À per cent, which I took the liberty of
giving to this house, is a tentative one which
the officials of the Government and the Commissioners of Hamilton Harbour Board feel
is a fair rate to pay on the loan.

EXPORT CREDITS INSURANCE

BILL

THIRD READING

Hon. Gustave Monette moved the third
reading of Bill 199, to amend the Export
Credits Insurance Act.
He said: Honourable senators, yesterday
when I was explaining this bill I was asked
if I could give details as to insurance policies
issued by the Export Credits Insurance Corporation. The honourable Leader of the
Government promised that I would today
bring in a statement on the matter. I have
such a statement here, and if it meets with
the wishes of the house I shall table it. I
have already shown it to the honourable senator from De Lorimier (Hon. Mr. Vien). If it
is necessary to do so, I shall summarize it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Does the honourable
senator intend to table the statement or to
request that it appear in Hansard?

Hon. Mr. Monette: Either course would be
satisfactory to me.
Hon. Mr. Haig: We will put it on Hansard
if you want it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I think the statement should appear on Hansard. Is there
anything confidential in it?
Hon. Mr. Monette: No, there is nothing
confidential in it. With respect to details of
insurance which has not definitely been
arranged and which is under negotiation, I
do not think it would be wise to divulge them
at the present time. Otherwise, the details
are complete. I ask that this statement appear
on Hansard.
For statement see appendix to today's

The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.

December 20, 1957
Sir,
I have the honour to inform you that the
Honourable Patrick Kerwin, Chief Justice of Canada,
acting as Deputy of His Excellency the Governor
General, will proceed to the Senate chamber today,
the 20th December, at 12.45 p.m., for the purpose

Your obedient servant,
J. F. Delaute,

The Speaker of the Senate,

UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 240, to amend
the Unemployment Assistance Act.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The
Hon.
the
Speaker:
Honourable
senators, when shall this bill be read the
second time?
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I move, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Horner, the second reading of this bill.
I have prepared a memorandum on this
bill, which I am going to read because it
gives the facts and figures which I think we
all require to deal with the bill.
First, however, I want to say a word or
two about the bill itself. The problem is not
one of new money required for the
unemployed or unemployable, but of switching where the money comes from to pay them.
The present law provides that assistance is
not payable by the dominion Government

unless the number of these persons is .45 per
cent of the total population of a province,
which percentage has never been reached
yet. There has always been a dispute between
the provinces and the dominion Government,
as well as between the provinces and the
municipalities, as to who are unemployable
and who are not, and so on. The legislation
simply provides that the dominion Government take over one-half of the expense of
unemployment assistance to the people
entitled to receive it. That relieves the
provincial Governments and the municipalities of the payment of considerable sums of
money.
This legislation is to fulfil a promise made,
not in the election, but at the recent dominion-provincial conference, held in November,
at which the question of unemployment, and
principally the question of unemployables,
was discussed. In the past the municipalities
have maintained that there was no such
animal as an unemployable. The federal and
provincial Governments felt that there were
unemployable persons, but that no contribution toward their assistance should be
made until their number reached a certain
proportion of the population of the province
concerned.
If the honourable senators will permit me
I will read from a prepared text a resumé
of what this bill proposes to do. This brings
me to a question that has been discussed
on a number of occasions, the request of some
provinces for the removal of the so-called
"threshold" of .45 per cent under the Unemployment Assistance Act. Its removal
would have the result that the dominion
treasury would share the cost of all eligible
cases upon the relief rolls, whether employable or unemployable, and not just the numbers in excess of .45 per cent of the provincial population. We should then be avoiding
entirely this invidious distinction between
employable and unemployable persons, and
sharing the cost of providing aid to all those
in need, apart from the normal statutory
responsibilities of the provinces and in respect of mothers' allowances.
I am told that a change of this nature
would make it much easier for some suitable
arrangements to be made to assist the municipalities, which have been carrying most of
this burden of assistance to those in need,
apart of course from the bulk of the cost
being carried by unemployment insurance.
The benefits of removing this "threshold"
would be fairly equitably divided among all
the provinces that would be participating
in agreements under this act. That is the
first point.

That is the meaning of the amendment.
Outside of politics altogether, I am strongly
in favour of it, because I think it is very hard
on municipalities to have to take care of these
unemployment charges, which are incurred

whether the unemployed are in a rural community or in a city; and hitherto it has been
the law that, to be entitled to unemployment
relief, a person must have resided a year in a
municipality. The hardship which this stipulation created will be removed by the amendment, because the dominion Government will
carry the share which was formerly borne
by the municipalities. If there are any questions I shall try to answer them.

SENATE
I stated that Parliament should have been
called together in the latter part of August,
and sat during the balance of that month, the
month of September, and into at least the first
week of October. That session could then
have been prorogued, and a new session
opened by Her Majesty the Queen. Someone
on the other side of the house suggested that
because of the meeting in Ottawa of the
Universal Postal Congress a session could not
be held at that time. I think everyone agrees
that there are other places in Ottawa suitable
for the holding of the Postal Congress than
the Parliament buildings.
But even if that were the reason for not
having Parliament in session at that time, let
me read what the present Prime Minister said
in a telecast on May 22 last:
We believe the old age pension is inadequate.
We intend, this September, to call together Parliament, and there and then fix a fair and reasonable
amount for the old age pensioner, indeed for the
other pensions. . . .

My point, honourable senators, is that the
present Prime Minister on May 22 said that
he would call Parliament in September to
deal with this problem. He knew then that
the Postal Congress was going to meet here
in August and September, and it is no excuse now to say that Parliament could not
have been called when the Postal Congress
was in session. I am sure honourable senators will agree with me that no sound reason
has yet been advanced for not convening
Parliament in September.
However, this bill has come to us today. It
is a bill affecting pensioners, men who served
in the armed forces, wives and children of men
who served in the armed forces, and orphans
and widows of men who served in the armed
forces. I, for one, certainly would not hold
up the passage of such a bill. The Leader of
the Government has said it is an important
bill. Let me say it is not only an important
bill, but a lengthy one. Fortunately we have
in this house a former Minister of Pensions,
the honourable gentleman from Gulf (Hon.
Mr. Power), who I think knows more about
pensions than anyone else in either house of
Parliament, and I am sure he can assist us
in getting a full explanation of this bill.
I noticed when coming into the chamber
that Brigadier Melville, Chairman of the
Canadian Pension Commission, was in the
antechamber. My suggestion to the house is,
and I trust that the Leader of the Government will concur, that this bill, which should
be considered in commitee, be referred to
the Committee of the Whole, and that Brigadier Melville sit at a table in front of the
honourable leader who is piloting the bill
through the house and supply any information that is required. And, I may say, if he

does not have the information I am sure the
honourable senator from Gulf will have it.
I suggest to the honourable Leader of the
Government that when this bill has received
second reading, the house be resolved into a
Committee of the Whole for consideration of
the bill clause by clause.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I thank my honourable
friend for his suggestion, and I accept it. I
move that the house go into Committee of the
Whole.

say that I like the suggestion that the house
resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole
for consideration of a bill of this kind,
because honourable senators are used to considering bills in committee.

representative is due here at that time, and
I should like to have the bill receive the

With your permission, honourable senators,
I shall now read my prepared memorandum,
after which I shall move that the house
resolve itself into a Committee of the Whole,
and ask Brigadier Melville, the Chairman
of the Pension Commission to assist me in
answering any questions that are asked. I
am anxious to deal with this bill in the way
honourable senators would like it dealt with.
The proposed amendments to the Pension
Act provide, in the main, for extension of
the benefits contained in that act, and for
aligning certain of the benefits now provided
with the increased scale of pensions which
became effective last July.
The provision to continue disability pensions to the end of the month in which death
occurred, where additional pension for deIt
pendents is payable, is a new benefit.
will provide the distressed family with a few
extra dollars at a difficult time, and will
help to eliminate embarrassing overpayments
in cases where the surviving dependents are
not pensionable. The widow and children of
a disability pensioner are pensionable if death
was attributable to service, or if pension
was in payment at 50 per cent or more at
time of death.

DECEMBER 20, 1957
The bill provides for an increase in the
clothing allowances paid on account of loss
of limbs or the use of prosthetic appliances.
The new rates are $96 per year for leg
amputation cases, $42 for arm amputees and
up to $96 for other pensioners who wear
appliances which cause excessive wear and
tear of clothing. The present rates, which
became effective in 1952, are $72, $30 and $72
per year, respectively.
Increases are also proposed in the allowances for funeral and burial expenses, which
at present may not exceed $185, made up
as follows: $110 for funeral services, $25
for cemetery charges and $50 for the expenses
of the pensioner's last sickness. The rates
proposed are $150 for funeral services, $50
for cemetery charges and $50 for the last
illness, or a total of $250, to meet the increased cost of dying.
The proposed elimination of the limitation
on the payment of pensions for children born
after a specified date, or for wives married
after a certain date, is a new benefit affecting
a number of World War I veterans and their
dependents.
This measure was first introduced on May
1, 1933, and the restrictive date was subsequently advanced to May 1 of the years
1944, 1948, 1951, and to 1954, where it now
stands. It was never applicable to World
War II veterans or to those of the Korean
operation. Each year a number of aged
World War I pensioners marry, and there
will now be no bar to their receiving additional pension on behalf of their wives. The
monthly pension for a totally disabled pensioner is $150, and an additional $50 per
month is paid for his wife.
It is estimated that if these amendments
are enacted the annual liability under the
act will be increased by $386,500.
The
present liability for pension purposes is
approximately $150 million, and almost
200,000 pension cheques are issued each
month.
That is the official explanation of the bill.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
CONSIDERED IN COMMITTEE

On motion of Hon. Mr. Haig, the Senate
went into committee on the bill.

former section 24.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Pensions now end on the
date of death, but this provision continues
them until the end of the month in which
death occurred.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I understand that
previously if a pensioner died on the 8th
of the month the pension stopped on the 8th
of the month, or if he died on the 27th the
pension ceased on the 27th and so on.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: This amendment
provides that the pension continues until the
end of the month in which the pensioner
died.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Provided there are surviving dependents.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: And I take it dependents include widows and orphans.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Wife and children.
The section was agreed to.
Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 were agreed to.
On Section 15-pension to widow:
Hon. Mr. Power: Mr. Chairman, I think
this clause provides that the widow of a
member of the forces who married him after
the pension has been granted and therefore
had full knowledge of his disability-because
the pension had been granted-will now
receive a pension notwithstanding that the
marriage took
place both
after the
appearance of the disability and after the
pension was granted.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Power: There is, however, a
restrictive provision in this amendment to
the effect that if his death occurred more

SENATE
than one year after the date of the marriage
the Pension Commission shall have discretion to decide whether or not the pension
should be awarded to the widow, and I
think the commission will have a very difficult task. Should his death have occurred
less than one year after the date of the
marriage the commission may grant-I am
not quoting directly-a pension, provided the
commission is of opinion that at the date of
his marriage he had a reasonable expectation
of surviving his wife for at least one year
thereafter. That I would say is a very difficult task to put on the shoulders of the
commission. After the death has occurred
the commission will be the judge as to
whether at the time of his marriage he had
an expectancy of life of one year or more.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): After
his wife's death?
Hon. Mr. Power: No.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): That is
what you just said.
Hon. Mr. Power: Provided he was suffering from a disability at the time of his
marriage. At that time the widow may
obtain a pension if the commission believes
that at the time of his marriage be had a
reasonable expectancy of life.
Hon. Mr. Connolly (Ottawa West): For one
year?
Hon. Mr. Power: For one year only.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Is that provision not
intended to abolish the death-bed marriage?
Hon. Mr. Power: I am glad my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) brings that matter up. It has been
a matter of discussion down through the
years since pensions were first established for
military service as to what we should do
about the so-called death-bed marriage. We
have the horrible example of the United
States where, notoriously, old men, veterans
of the Civil War, have been cajoled or in
some other way induced to get married.
Someone in the other house has said, "Surely
we are not going to put a time limit on love."
Perhaps we in this chamber would be in a
better position to judge of that, than those
in the other bouse! In any case, it bas been
a controversial question all down the years
as to what steps should be taken to avert
that sort of thing. As I said on a former
occasion in this house, in 1936 or 1937 the
United States Government were still paying
pensions arising out of the War of 1812. In
the light of such circumstances, all Canadians
who were interested in pensions legislation
in the thirties were careful to try to avoid

the placing of a mortgage, so to speak, on
the treasury of the country in the interests
of people who possibly, and quite probably,
were not in existence at the time of the war,
and to whom we had no moral, legal or
financial obligation. However, as time went
on-I believe, in 1931 or 1932, at the time of
the depression-the Government of the Right
Honourable Mr. Bennett, later Lord Bennett
-proposed that as an economy measure pensions to veterans be severely restricted. A
sort of bargain or arrangement was entered
into between the Canadian Legion, as representative of the veterans, and the Government of the day, whereby a time limit would
be placed on eligibility for pensions by persons who were married after a certain date.
I think the enactment was that no pension
should be paid to the widow of a pensioner
who had married him after he obtained his
pension, if the marriage took place subsequent to 1935. My recollection is that when
I held the office of Minister of Pensions I
extended to 1944 the period within which
marriage of pensioners would be recognized
for the purpose of eligibility for pension.
Later, I believe, a further extension was
made to the year 1954 or thereabouts. The
proposal in this bill is that there shall be no
limit, but that if a pensioner marries after
his disability is known, the widow will be
granted a pension, provided ber husband
lives a year after the marriage, or if the
commission feels that under normal circumstances his expectancy of life would have
been not less than a year,-which, I think,
is a very difficult question for a commission
to decide. This, it seems to me, is the substance of the amendment now before us. To
my mind it leaves the way pretty wide open
for so-called death-bed marriages.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: I am interested
in what the honourable senator from Gulf
(Hon. Mr. Power) said about the death-bed
marriage. He remarked that the bill comes
very near to allowing a death-bed marriage;
I think it comes almost up to the bedside,
because, according to this provision, a woman
can marry a pensioner, and if he appears to
be in good health, or is not suffering from
a disease which is likely to kill him within
a year, and he drops dead within the hour,
she can still get the pension. So the way
is still open for a near death-bed marriage, if
I understood correctly the explanation of the
honourable senator from Gulf; and he nods
his head to assure me that I did correctly
understand him. I would like to ask the
honourable Leader of the Government if any
widows or married veterans of the Boer War
are receiving pensions at the present time,

DECEMBER 20, 1957
and would such widows, if they survived, be
entitled to the benefit of the provisions of
this bill?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Not widows of veterans of
the Boer War. None are being paid by us.
They are being paid by Great Britain.
Hon. Mr. Power: Canada supplements the
pension, though, does it not?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think Canada supplements it. If it amounts to, say, $20, and our
pension would have been $30, we pay the
difference.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Are we paying,
even by way of supplementary allowance,
pensions to veterans of the Boer War?
Hon. Mr. Haig: A few.

Hon. Mr. Power: So I would be correct in
saying that Boer War widows would not be
entitled to any relief under this legislation?
Hon. Mr. Haig: You are correct.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Unless they are entitled to a pension under the imperial act.
Hon. Mr. Power: But the British Government has never recognized these marriages
after the appearance of the disability. If my
recollection is right, it paid no attention to
any woman who had married a soldier after
he had a disability. Even if the disability
appeared before he got a pension she was
not entitled to a pension at all. The woman
was supposed to know he was an invalid, and
take her chances.

SEASON'S GREETINGS
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, before the house adjourns on this
our last sitting day before Christmas, I
take this opportunity of wishing you, Mr.
Speaker, and your wife and family, a very
happy Christmas. I am sure all honourable
senators appreciate the interest you have
taken in the work of the house and the
manner in which you have presided over its
proceedings.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I may be chided by the Clerk or the Clerk
Assistant for doing so, but I take this opportunity of extending to all of you best
wishes for a very merry Christmas.
I wish to thank you very much for your
kindness and assistance during this period
of transition-I know it was a period of
transition for some honourable senators, and
it also was for me.
The Senate adjourned until Tuesday,
January 7, at 8 p.m.

GOVERNMENT HOUSE
Ottawa

January 7, 1958
Sir,

I have the honour to inform you that the Hon.
Mr. Justice Robert Taschereau, acting as Deputy
of His Excellency the Governor General, will
proceed to the Senate Chamber today, the 7th
January, at 9.45 p.m., for the purpose of giving

APPROPRIATION BILL NO. 1, 1958
FIRST READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
a message has been received from the House
of Commons with Bill 242, for granting Her
Majesty certain sums of money for the public
service of the financial year ending the 31st
March, 1958, to which they desire the concurrence of the Senate.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon.

the

Speaker: Honourable senators,

when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable members, I
move, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Horner, that this bill be now read the second
time.
This bill is a supplementary estimate
largely to cover one-twelfth of the items
payable in this year. However, part of the
bill covers one-sixth of the items, because
interim supply legislation has been passed
three or four times-I think four, and this
is the fifth.
With the permission of the house, I intend
to read a memorandum prepared by myself

and another gentleman, which will give a
better understanding of the situation--not of
the bill itself, which is quite clear. If I give
the figures I think honourable members will
understand what I mean. This bill provides
for one-twelfth of all the items to be voted
in the main estimates, except certain items.
Section 2 of the bill would vote $257 million
odd.
In order that there will be no misunderstanding, I may say all these items will
come up in the final estimates which will
come before the house before this session
is closed. Any honourable senator has the
right to comment tonight, or whenever be
wants to, on the main estimates, and anything said by an honourable senator tonight
will not bar him from repeating it when the
main estimates come up. That is the usual
undertaking, and I now give it.
I have here a memorandum which I
thought would be interesting to all of us,
covering what has been voted and what has
been spent, and I intend to put it on Hansard
so that all honourable senators will have it.
For instance, the main estimates were $5,401
million odd; the supplementary estimates
were $19 million odd; further supplementaries (1), $94 million odd; and further supplementaries (2), $81 million odd, making a
total of $5,597 million odd. Of that amount
$2,172 million is statutory, leaving a balance
to be voted, including the bill now before
us, of $3,424 million. In some of the estimates the total vote has already been made
because they come in between March 1 and
November 1 and are of a seasonal nature.
Some of those items have already been voted
in these supplementaries; of course the large
estimates go by the year, and the season has
no effect.
This bill will vote a total of $272 million.
So the estimates are pretty well voted up
to date, but when the main estimates come
before us next week or the week after they
will show the total distribution of every item
in the estimates. I might mention that
some of these items were put there by the
former Government and some by this
Government.
I have drafted a small report giving a
summary of what each section of this bill
covers. The trouble, however, is that numbers have been used to identify excepted
items, so it cannot explain the details of the
bill. With the consent of the bouse I will
put this report on Hansard.so that anybody
can consult it in order to arrive at an understanding of the situation, and it will be
useful in this way. I had this statement
drawn up in my own way-that is to say

JANUARY 7, 1958
I told them what I wanted and they drew
it up in accordance with my request.
The last time I spoke on this subject I
was asked what money was yet to come on
the different items and I could not answer.
Now, honourable senators, when this report
is on Hansard you will be able to work out
exactly how much money has yet to be
spent on every item yet to come in.

The different items that were brought
down by the different Governments are
covered. The former Government brought
down the main estimates and two supplementaries, and the present Government
brought down two or three. That makes
four or five supplementaries. When we get
the main estimates honourable senators will
be able to check on this statement, and that
is why I suggested putting it on record.

Now, in addition to that I had a summary
of this bill made. If the house would like it
I should be glad to put it on Hansard too,
because it clearly sets out what the bill of
today covers and what is left out. Half a
dozen copies only were made of this statement; I gave one to the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) and to one or two
others, but I did not follow any definite

pattern. If honourable senators agree I will
put it on Hansard,so the two statements may
be considered together.
Hon. Senators: Agreed.
Hon. Mr. Haig: This gives a second summary of what the two Governments have
done with the money.

3,067,583.34
$272,372,511.08

When the main estimates come down we
will know exactly what has happened and
how much money is yet to be spent, and if
the bill is referred to committee members of
the committee will be able to ask intelligently
about the different items.
Honourable senators, I suggest a course of
action tonight that I hope the house will
accept. I do not think it is necessary to send
this supplementary estimates bill to committee, but I think that when the main estimates come down we ought to refer them to
a committee, for this reason: that two Governments have been handling this money.
The former Government brought down at
least two supplementary estimates as well
as the main estimates, and I think the new
Government brought down two supplementaries. By referring it to committee a good
chance will be provided for us to check, and
that procedure would not take very long. We
can have the officials from the Department of
Finance come and assist us, I can assure you
of that. I know they have assisted me. They
are very expert in this, and I know that they
know a good deal more about it than I do.
I had these statements made so that when

anyone wants to check the items he will
have the record of what we have passed, what
this bill covers and what the new estimates
will cover.
Hon. Mr. Farris: May I ask the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig)
a question? Is there any way by which we
can find out how much the reduction of taxes
has been under this Government?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot answer that until
the budget comes down. You may ask me
that when the main supply is voted. The
minister said in the House of Commons that
he anticipated a surplus of $80 million. I
think the previous Government estimated
$156 million, or some such figure as that.
There is a question about that. I am not
sure if the former Minister of Finance took
into account the increases that were promised
practically right after that-increases to the
civil servants and also to the armed forcespromises that have all been carried out. When
the final estimates come down they will show
what has been spent, and my honourable
friend will have the figures there before him.

JANUARY 7, 1958
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I wish in the first place to thank the
honourable Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig) for having given me this breakdown of the amount whicli is required by
the bill. As he states, the total is $272 million, which is a lot of money to vote in a
very short time. Our only consolation is that
some time next year, long after the money
has been voted, we shall be able to learn how
it has been distributed and whether we did
the right thing when we voted it. But we
shall have to look backward. At the present
time there is no opportunity to consider
whether these amounts should be spent.
I realize that this question is primarily
one for the other house, whose Committee of
Supply has the estimates before it at the
present time. If my memory serves me correctly, the estimates of only one departmentthe Post Office-have as yet been approved.
Hon. Mr. Haig: And the National Defence
Department.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, yes, the defence
estimates were approved on Saturday. But
all the other estimates are still before the
other house. I might point out that the grand
total amounts to $5,597,316,555. That is a
lot of money. Of course, of that sum
$2,179,000,000 relates to statutory disbursements, leaving $3,417,000,000 to be voted.
When this bill has been passed we shall have
voted $2,913,000,000, and we shall have done
so blindly. We have no details. There will
then remain to be voted, of that $5,597 million, only $504 million. As I have said, the
aggregate amount covered by the present bill
is, roughly speaking, $272 million. This, I
believe, is the sixth interim supply bill of
the current fiscal year. It is some cause for
satisfaction that there can be only two more,
because after the end of March we shall be
in another fiscal year, and the Government
has to get the balance of the money for
this year before that time. So the honourable
Leader of the Government can guarantee that
he will not be asking for money more than
twice again this year.
I believe that the Senate should give more
consideration to the matter of these expenditures. Admittedly it cannot increase them,
but it has the power to decrease them, provided that in doing so the balance of ways
and means is not disturbed. I refer of course
to ordinary expenditures, not to taxation.
But the trouble is that we do not receive
supply bills until the very last day, when,
of course, adequate consideration is impossible. All the Senate can do is to review
what has taken place and make recommendations-most of which are ignored-to

the other house. That is not too satisfactory,
but if we keep pounding away we may achieve
something.
Honourable senators, I have no objection
to this bill. It follows the practice that
has been established over the years, and
especially tonight I cannot have too much
objection, because most of this money was
provided by the former Government.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Right.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Although I am consenting to this bill being given three readings
tonight, I would like to see the practice
of rushing legislation through the Senate
discontinued.
Too many bills have gone
through this house too quickly during this
session. I feel that all legislation should be
presented to this house early enough to
allow it to be referred to a committee before
it is given third reading and passed. We
should be given the opportunity to study
bills in committee, where officials and ministers of the various departments can be
questioned. I appeal to the Leader of the
Government tonight to give up the practice
that seemed to be established during the
early part of this session of rushing legislation before this house at the last minute
and saying, "I want third reading tonight
because we are having Royal Assent in 15
minutes." That should not happen and I
hope it will not happen again, for I think the
honourable Leader would have a difficult time
in persuading this house to accede to his request. This house has always taken pride
in giving careful thought to any legislation
that bas come before it. It is a tradition
wxhich has been established over the years
and must not be broken. Therefore, in
agreeing to giving this bill second and third
reading tonight I do so on the understanding that no other bills, except perhaps interim supply bills, will be presented to this
chamber at the last minute with the request
that we give them three readings in the one
sitting.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move that it be read the
third time now. I will take to heart what
my honourable friend the Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) has said
about getting legislation over to this house
more quickly. However, I think he should
try to get his message across to the members
of the other bouse, not just to one group but

SENATE
to the whole membership. I agree that legislation is sometimes slow in getting here but
there is some excuse for this situation. There
are many new members in the House of Commons this session and they wanted to get
various bills through as soon as possible.
That made it very difficult and caused some
delay. I hope when the next federal election is held the party that is elected will be
given a good majority, for under our parliamentary system a minority government, no
matter who forms it, cannot carry on too
successfully. The United States are finding
terrific difficulty in dealing with certain
problems that come up under their system
of government. They cannot change their
chief administrator until the next election,
some two or three years hence. Our system
has an elasticity that permits us to change
our government at almost any time. I think
our democratic system, like that of Great
Britain and certain other countries, is by and
large the best system; but if we have a
minority government there is no disputing the
fact that it cannot carry on without having a good deal of trouble and delay, especially in a legislature where four parties are
represented. I am not speaking on behalf of
any party now but I hope when the next
election is held the people of Canada will
give whatever party they elect a good working majority. It would greatly facilitate the
work of the Government.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before the bill is given third reading may I
take a few minutes of your time to discuss a
matter which I intended to bring up as a question of privilege this evening? It has to do
with one of the items in the estimates, and
perhaps this would be a good time to air the
grievance I have with respect to it.
I was sorry that I was not present in the
Senate when the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) answered an
inquiry of mine which I had placed on the
Order Paper prior to leaving here to attend
to duties as chairman of the International
Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission. My inquiry actually consisted of two questions, and
I think that the attention of the Senate should
be particularly drawn to one of the answers
given by the honourable leader. In my opinion
the answer violated the privileges of the bonourable members of this body. I have before
me a copy of Senate Hansard of December 10,
1957, in which the honourable Leader of the
Government answered one part of my inquiry,
which read:
That there be tab!ed a copy of either the interim
or final report made by the British Columbia

Engineering Company in regard to their investigations concerning the possible hydro-electrie development of the Columbia River including the effect
of any diversion or diversions of the Columbia
River.

I am sorry to inform the honourable leader
that his answer to the question was inaccurate
and certainly not according to the facts as
placed before the House of Commons. As I
understand our rules, I am not permitted to
read from the Debates from the House of
Commons. In the Senate the honourable
leader, in answering my inquiry, said:
I suggest that this inquiry should be dropped.
The Government notified the House of Commons
on Friday that it had no complete report at all
on this matter and as to what they did have it
was not in the public interest that it be produced
or tabled in the House of Commons.
The same
answer would apply in this chamber.

Let me deal with that last sentence. Honour-

able senators, I do not think we should be
particularly concerned with answers given in
the House of Commons. We are a separate
body and answers given in the other house
need not be binding on this honourable chamber, or on the powers and privileges of the
Senate. The honourable Leader of the Government said the House of Commons had been
notified that there was no complete report at
all on this matter, but that is entirely at
variance with the statement made on December 3 in the House of Commons by the Minister of Northern Affairs and National Resources. I am not going to read what he said,
but if the honourable Leader of the Government in the Senate will turn to page 1771 of

the House of Commons Hansard he will see
that a question similar to mine had been
raised in the House of Commons and that the
minister had replied that the final report on
the matter had been received by the department concerned on December 2. Despite that
tact the Leader of the Government in the
Senate turned aside my question by saying
that the Government had received no such
report. Of course, that was just too much for
me to swallow. I intend to press this matter
further later on when dealing with the
privileges of honourable senators, for I have
always taken the view that once an appropriation passes Parliament it is the right of any
member to obtain a copy of any report regarding such an expenditure. I would point
out that in 1955 $280,000 was appropriated and
passed by Parliament for the carrying out of
separate investigations on the Columbia and
Fraser Rivers with regard to water power.
One matter I am particularly interested in
is the many misleading statements made by
General McNaughton before the External
Affairs Committee, during my absence-so
many that they have caused quite a furore.
Those misleading statements should be

JANUARY 7, 1958
answered. As one whose duty at the present
time is to preserve the salmon of the Fraser
River, I wanted, particularly, as Chairman of
the Salmon Commission, to see that report
which is now being denied to us. No
definite reason has been given for my not
seeing it, and certainly not by the Leader of
the Government, who says, first of all, that
there was no report placed before the Government-which is not correct; and, secondly,
that it was not in the public interest to
produce it-which is also not correct. I am
wondering how he got that information and
came to place such an answer on Hansard,
thereby eliminating the question which I
placed on the Order Paper asking for a copy
of this report. I want to warn him that I
intend later to make a stand to obtain that
report and thereby maintain the rights of
the members of this honourable chamber.
As long as I have been a member of Parliament, since 1930, I have realized that once
an expenditure is made and carried out, it
is then the right of the peoples' representatives to demand any report thereon. This
report now rests in the hands of the Government, who are hiding it for some reason or
other which has not yet been revealed. So
much for that.
Another inquiry of mine was thrown out,
too, though not for exactly the same reasons,
and I also take great exception to the answer
given in this instance. I must say that I speak
in very complimentary terms of the honourable senator from Inkerman (Hon. Mr.
Hugessen), who in my absence tried to defend
the question on the Order Paper. But according to the leader I am bound by the answer
given by the department.
Well, is the
Leader of the Government in this Senate
going to be dictated to and bound by an
answer by some departmental official? Is
that what we are to expect in this chamber?
I simply asked a straight question regarding
the price of natural gas which is being
charged at a higher rate to the people of
British Columbia than that to the people
of the United States. I want to place this
matter also before the Senate and to warn
the Leader of the Government that more
will be heard of this later, because I am not
going to accept those answers without some
greater protest by myself, not only in an
endeavour to obtain a copy of the report
and get definite answers, but also because of
what I believe to be the rights of this
chamber.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable members, the
honourable gentleman has mentioned me and
I feel I should give an explanation. As I
understand it, the practice is, and I was so
informed, that when an inquiry appeared on

the Order Paper I was to try to get the
answer from the department. I did this,
and the answer I presented here was exactly
the answer that the department gave me in
writing. I tabled the exact answer which
was given to me. I have no control over
the departments-I could not presume to
have control over them-and they do not
have to give me any information in any
way at all. Whenever I have received an
inquiry, in every single case I have never
hesitated to try to get the answer. I have
done that ever since I first occupied this seat.
In such cases I immediately take the Order
Paper, call my secretary in, and together we
discuss what department the inquiry comes
under, and if we do not know right away I
telephone the different departments to find
the right one. I then write to the man in
charge and ask for the information, and
when I get the answer I table it. There is
nothing else I can do. If my honourable
friend thinks I am trying to hide anything
he is totally wrong. In 31 years of public
life I have never tried to hide a document
from anyone.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Your answer is wrong.
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is not. The information
may be wrong.
Hon. Mr. Reid: It is untrue.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have passed on to this
house the exact information I received from
the proper sources. I can go no further.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the leader a
question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Would he not think it
proper procedure to try to get the answer from
the responsible minister of the department?
The minister may get it from his underlings.
Hon. Mr. Haig: In every case in which I am
doubtful I .call the minister and ask from
whom I can get the information.
Hon. Mr. Euler: He should be responsible.
Hon. Mr. Power: Surely the Leader of the
Government is not going to tell us that he is
not responsible for the administration of the
Government. Under any doctrine of responsibility he is responsible.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just a minute, my honourable friend. I have been in the house just
as long as you have, and in politics, and I
want to say thisHon. Mr. Power: That is not the point.
Hon. Mr. Haig: -that I never made any
misrepresentation. If the information I got
was wrong, I did not know it.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Power: That is not the point. The
point is, you should know; it is part of your
business to know.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The point is this, I know
of no other way to get it outside of the way
it bas been obtained since I became leader.
Hon. Mr. Power: Not at all.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The only way, if anyone
is not satisfied, is for the Senate to call a
meeting of the Public Accounts Committee,
or some other committee, and ask for those
documents to be produced and for the minister to be present at the meeting. You can
do that if you want to, and if you want that
done I will follow your instructions. But I
am not going to stand here and be accused
of something I have not even thought about,
let alone done. I never even thought about it
-I
didn't even know it could be done. I
thought when I was giving the answer it was
the truth. Apparently, my honourable friend
says I am wrong. I don't know.
Hon. Mr. Power: Surely my honourable
friend does not want to get away from his
responsibilities as a minister of the Crown.
If a departmental officer tells him he is not
going to give the answer he has to give the
reason.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I never said that. I said
I gave the answer in the usual practice of this
house. The honourable member from New
Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) says I brought
in the wrong answer. All right, I will accept
his word on that. But don't accuse me of
doing this, because I didn't do it, and you
know as well as I do that I didn't; so does he.
I am not that kind of a man. I don't do
those things, and I never did.
Hon. Mr. Power: We are saying that you
are responsible, and that you are avoiding
your responsibility.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Mr. Speaker, are you going
to maintain order or not?
The Hon. the Speaker: You are in order.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want a fair deal in this
situation.
Hon. Mr. Power: You are getting it.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not to be accused of
doing one thing wrong in connection with
it. This is the first time this has ever been
raised since I have been here about any
question. If the honourable gentleman (Hon.
Mr. Reid) had been in his place, which he
was not, when I made the report, he could
have made the objection then, and I could
have found out about it immediately. The
right way to do it is to call a meeting of
the Public Accounts Committee, or some
other committee, and ask for the men to be

brought before it. You have that power, and
that is the way to do it. But don't blame
me, because I want to say quite candidly I
am not guilty, and it never even entered
my thoughts at all. I can't see any reason
why I would want to hide it even if I
could; I don't see any reason for it. As a
matter of fact, I agree with the idea in the
back of his head, and I just told him so. I
am against the stand certain people are
taking, but that is not the issue in this house.
I want to say quite candidly, Mr. Speaker,
that I didn't do it, and if the report was
wrong, I assure my honourable friend that
if he gets the machinery going in this house
to call the men before it I will produce the
information and they can give their answers,
and I am persuaded their answers will be
the same.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Honourable senators, I rise
on a question of privilege. First of all, in
case someone takes up wrongly the statement which the honourable leader made regarding my absence when the reply was presented, I wish to make it clear that I left
here to perform a duty on behalf of the
country. I am chairman of the International
Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, and I
was obliged to leave to attend its two meetings held on the coast. I do not want any
inference to be drawn from what the honourable leader said that I had run out and so
was not in my place in the Senate at that
time. Secondly, a very definite statement
was made by a minister of the Crown, the
Honourable Alvin Hamilton, Minister of
Northern Affairs and National Resources,
that they had received the report on December 9-a definite "yes".
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I will have to rise again as a
peacemaker. I am very serious in saying
that.
Hon. Mr. Howard: As always.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Thank you.
I was not going to speak on this bill, but
my honourable colleague from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) bas opened the way.
The case I have to discuss is quite similar to
his own. He may be surprised, but I expect
to be successful in the long run-the run
may be long, but I expect to be successful.
Some time ago I asked some pertinent
questions about the National Gallery, and the
questions were not answered. I did not know
whether it was the fault of the Government
or of a bunch of bureaucrats, who are the
Director and members of the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery. But flnally I
had to speak loudly, and the following day
I got the answer. But the answer I got from

JANUARY 7. 1958
those contemptible bureaucrats was an insult
to Parliament. I had asked for the cost to
the country of each of the horrors and monstrosities, the pictures of which appeared in
the two last reports of the National Gallery.
After having spoken loudly, I got part of the
answer, not all.
Here is what I consider an insult to Parliament, and I submit it to your Honour and to
my honourable colleagues. I had asked:
... from whom was bought each painting, drawing,
etching, sculpture or statue illustrated therein and
how much was paid for each one of them.

I was not told from whom each item had
been purchased, but here is part of the bold
answer they gave:
The Trustees of the National Gallery are prepared to supply information regarding prices paid
and the dates of purchase (as previously reported
in Hansard, January 22, 1957). However, it is the
considered opinion of the Trustees that it is not
in the public interest to disclose from whom works
were purchased and they point out that to treat
such information as private is the standard
practice with all art galleries and museums.

This is an insult to Parliament, and here
is the means by which I will get satisfaction
from that group of individuals. They have
answered part of my question, but they refuse
to answer the second part. What will I do?
I will ask more questions until I know all
there is in it.
I have here a series of questions, which I
shall table later when the time comes for
notices of inquiries. The questions are:
1. Who were the members of the Board of
Trustees of the National Gallery of Canada from
the fiscal year 1955-56 inclusively until the present
time?
2. What were the qualifications of each one of
them in the arts of (a) painting, (b) drawing, (c)
etching, and (d) sculpture?
3. How many paintings, drawings, etchings and
sculptures made by each one of them are there in
any museum of Canada or any other country, and
what and where are they?
4. During the period mentioned in No. 1. how
many times did they meet and where?
5. How much was paid to each one of them for
their remuneration and their travelling expenses?
6. When was the present incumbent appointed the
Director of the National Gallery of Canada, and at
what salary?
7. What total amount has been paid to him,
from the date of his appointment, for his salary and
his travelling expenses?

This is the manner in which I shall try to
get some information when it is refused by
bold bureaucrats; and if I get the answers to
one-half only of my questions, my second
series of questions will be four times as long.
Hon. J. W. de B. Farris: Honourable senators, I am rather disappointed in my honourable friend who has just spoken. He said he
came as a peacemaker. Apparently he is
going on the theory similia similibus curantur.
If this is his idea of peace, I would hate to
see him when he declared open warfare. I
would like to take the matter up where I
thought he was going to deal with this point
of answers to inquiries, and make a suggestion to my honourable friend the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) with respect to his statement that there was nothing
more he could do.
With all deference to the leader-and I
want to assure him that I think the members
of this chamber in no way question his good
faith or honesty in his statement-when he is
confronted with an apparent inconsistency in
an answer he gave with an answer previously
given by a minister in the other house, I
would respectfully suggest that instead of
putting the burden on my honourable friend
from New Westminster (Hon. Mr. Reid) to
call a committee, he, the Leader of the Government, ought to get busy with the appropriate minister and find out what the trouble
1s.

Hon. Mr. Haig: Thank you very much; I
will do it.
The motion was agreed to, the bill was read
the third time, and passed.
BRITISH COLUMBIA CENTENARY
DESIGN FOR COMMEMORATIVE DOLLAR

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
before the Orders of the Day are proceeded
with, there is another matter that I would like
to place before this house.
As most honourable senators know, this
year British Columbia is celebrating the centenary of its founding. In that connection I
have one matter that I would like to place
Now this is the point, honourable senators, before the Leader of the Government (Hon.
Mr. Haig), in the hope that he will take note

to the public. It has to do with the issue of

British Columbia's one hundredth anniversary.
That is a very nice question.
First of all, may I say to him that I trust

opinion at least one million will be required
-and incidentally, I know of no easier way
for the Government to make money than by
minting silver dollars to sell at $1 apiece,
especially with the present low price of silver.
But what I have in mind, and what I would
like the Leader of the Government to take
note of, is the controversy that has arisen
regarding the figure on the silver dollar. One
of the leading Indians in British Columbia,
Mr. Guy Williams of the Native Brotherhood,
supported by Mrs. Ellen Neil of Vancouver,
who has given some study to the Indian
affairs, has come forth with the statement
that the totem on the silver dollar represents
death money in so far as the Indians are
He says it means Memloose
concerned.
chickman.
Immediately on my arrival here yesterday
I took the question up with the Master of
the Mint, pointing out to him that perhaps
first of all it was not a wise thing to engage
three wise men from the east to settle a
matter that should have been settled by
those who live in and know the west,
especially some of the Indians. This is the
information I received from him:
The upright near the centre of the design is
part of a totem pole representing "Gunarh", the
hero of the Indian version of the myth of Orpheus.
Above him stands the supernatural protector in the
form of a bird (eagle or raven). The background
is the scenery of British Columbia.

Great publicity was given in the press to
the statement made by the Indian, Mr.
Williams. Now, even in this enlightened age
there are still some people superstitious
enough to avoid walking under a ladder,
and those who will not go to sea on a Friday,
and so on. When such people read the
opinion of the Indian that the emblem on the
silver dollar means death moneyHon. Mr. Robertson: They will not take it.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I would not say they will
not take the dollar if they are offered it
free, but they might hesitate to buy the
dollar and keep it as a souvenir.
This year we expect thousands and thousands of people to come to British Columbia
to join with us in our centenary celebrations.
May I take this suitable opportunity of
inviting every honourable senator to be there.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Reid: There is one matter that
we cannot take all the credit for. It so
happens that 1958 is going to be the year
of the great Adams River run of sockeye
salmon, and those of you who care to come
to British Columbia in the month of September will in all likelihood see, we expect,
some two million four-, five- and six-pound
sockeye salmon all in a short length of river.

It will be a sight that you might never see
again, and the like of it cannot and will not
be duplicated in any province or country
throughout the world.
Of course, my main purpose in rising was
to ask the honourable Leader of the Government to have some investigation made into
the design on the commemorative dollar, and
if the statement made by the Master of the
Mint is correct I hope it will be given publicity or that an official statement will be
made by the Government. Personally, I believe it merits an official statement, because
the mere fact of my mentioning it here will
not stop some people from believing that Mr.
Guy Williams of the Native Brotherhood was
correct when he said the emblem on the
silver dollar was Memloose chickman or death
money.
ROUTINE PROCEEDINGS
CHANGE IN HEADINGS ON ORDER PAPER

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I have just noticed in perusing the
Minutes of the Proceedings of the Senate for
Friday, December 20, 1957 that the headings
under Routine Proceedings are different from
those which appeared in former years and
until the iith of December 1957. Up to that
date the headings were as follows:
Presentation of Petitions
Reading of Petitions
Reports of Committees
Notices of Inquiries and Motions.

From the 12th to the 16th of December
there were six headings:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.

Presentation of Petitions
Reading of Petitions
Reports of Committees
Notices of Inquiries
Notices of Motions
Inquiry.

On the 17th of December another change
was made, and since then the headings have
been as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Presentation of Petitions
Reading of Petitions
Reports of Committees
Notices of Inquiries
Notices of Motions.

Now, I would like to ask the Leader of
the Government, in the first instance, if
these changes were brought about by the
Standing Committee on Standing Orders.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Like the Leader of the
Opposition, I am a member of the committee,
but if it met I was not present.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: If the changes were
brought about by that committee I would
like to know when the report was tabled in

JANUARY 7, 1958
the house, and in any event I would like to
know why the changes have been made. Is
there any significance to them?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Ail I can say is that I did
flot even know they were made. I was flot at
any meeting of the committee, although if a
meeting was held I presumne 1 received a
notice. If you had not called my attention to
the changes I would not have known about
them. I think there must have been some
mistake in the printing.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It is not a mistake.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Well, I didn't do it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I would like to know
from the Leader of the Government to whom.
we can apply when we want information in
this bouse.
Hon. Mr. Haig: You can apply to the chairman of that committee. He ought to be able
to inform you.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I want to know from
the honourable Leader of the Government
whether it was that committee that made the
change; and if he tells me that it was, perhaps I can then ask him to call for an
explanation.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will answer the honourable gentleman. I have seen no report of
that committee tabled in this bouse; and 50
far as I know I have not missed one meeting.
That is ail I know about it. I had nothing
to do with the change; I gave no instructions;
I was not consulted. I wish some other
honourable senators, if they have faults to
find with me, will let me hear them now s0
that we can get over ail thîs on one night.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I arn not finding fauit
with the honourable Leader of the Government. My oniy objection is that he is not
answering my question and is not referring
me to anyone who can answer it. My request
ta him is that he will make inquiries and
ascertain why the change was made and
explain the matter to the bouse.
Hon. Mr. Haig: With pleasure. I promise
to do that. I know nothing about it, and I
do not believe any other bonourabie senators
know about it.
The Han. the Speaker: I think I should
explain the position. The Clerk informs me
that there is no change at ail as regards the
routine proceedings of both days. There
were no actuai inquiries on December 17 and
that is why "Inquiries" were not mentioned.
I understand this is the expianation. There
is no basic change in the proceedings nor in
the practice that is foiiowed.
Aithough
"Notices of Inquiries" and "Notices of
Motions" are mentioned, it is a fact that
there were no inquiries and no motions on the

Routine Proceedings. According to the Cierk
of the Senate, and I so state as Speaker of the
Senate, the proceeding is in accordance with
Rule 19, which is as foiiows:
19. At each daily sitting of the Senate, the Speaker
shall cal for, in the following order,1. Presentation of Petitions:
2. Reading of Petitions:
3. Reports of Committees:
4. Notices of Inquirles and of Motions:
5. Inquiries:
6. Motions:
7. Orders of the Day.

I believe that the practice is that when
there are no inquiries and no motions, those
items are not calied.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I shouid like to draw
Your Honour's attention to the headings
under Routine Proceedings for Tuesday,
December 10, 1957, in the Minutes of the
Proceedings of December 5. Those headings
are quite different from those of December
12, which again are different from, those of
December 16. I think I arn saf e in saying
that such a change neyer occurred previously.
The Hon. the Speaker: 1 believe that for
some time we have been calling "Notices of
Inquiries" and then "Notices of Motions".
In other words, we have broken up No. 4
into "Notices of Inquiries" and "Notices of
Motions". But as for the rest, I believe the
practice is the same and the procedure set
out in Rule 19 bas been followed. Although
there appears to have been a change on certain days under the Routine Proceedings in
relation to inquiries and motions, the reason
was that on those days there were no
inquiries and no motions. However, if honourable senators wish to have the items
printed even though there are no inquiries
or motions, I will speak to the Clerk of the
Senate and bave the matter corrected.
Han. Mr. Macdonald: I arn grateful ta His
Honour the Speaker for giving me this
information.
I desired to know why the
change had been made and who made it; but,
Mr. Speaker, I have complete confidence in
you.
The Hon. the Speaker: The bonourable
Leader of the Government is not responsible.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He is not accused.

Hon. Mr. Hardy: I would like to hear it.
BEECHWOOD POWER PROJECT BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon. ihe Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 243, to authorize a loan to the Government of New Brunswick in respect of the Beechwood Power
Project.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. ihe Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. John T. Haig: I move the second
reading now.
Fundamentally, this bill deals with one
matter, the loaning by the Dominion of
Canada to the Province of New Brunswick
of $30 million to develop a power site in
that province. The payments are set out
to be paid over a period of eight years at
a rate of interest not less than 43 per cent,
and both principal and interest are payable
together, so that one-eighth will be paid
each year.
As to the purposes of the bill, I wish to
read the following memorandum:
Honourable senators will recall that it has
been the declared policy of this Government,
both before and after it assumed office, to
take action to improve the economic wellbeing of those parts of Canada which, through
no fault of their own, have not fully shared
in the prosperity of the rest of the country
in recent years. The Atlantic provinces are
among these areas. One of the factors that
have been to their disadvantage in attracting
industrial development has been the fact that
power for industrial use has not been available in as large a quantity or at as low a
price as in other parts of Canada more
favoured in this respect. Among the most

important consideration of industry in selecting a location in which it will establish is
the availability of a sure supply of power
and at reasonably low cost.
It seems only fair and equitable that the
Government of Canada should take measures
to assist in meeting this basic requirement
of the Maritime provinces for industrial
growth, particularly since it is possible to
do so on a basis that is largely self-financing
and self-liquidating.
As forecast in Her Majesty's gracious
Speech from the Throne, the federal Government will provide aid which will have three
facets.
First, there is aid for the financing of
Beechwood. Secondly, there will be aid to
thermal plants and transmission facilities for
the four Atlantic provinces.
Third, there
will be provision for a coal subvention on
Atlantic seaboard coal used in the production
of thermal power in these Atlantic provinces.
Honourable senators are asked to consider
today the terms of the aid for the Beechwood
Power Project.
The contract is that the
Government will lend $30 million, at a rate
of interest not less than 4, per cent, or whatever the arrangement is at the time. It is
expected that the money will be drawn about
April 1, 1958, when the project will be
finished.
The Beechwood plant will be of great value
in making available a substantial block of
relatively low-cost power.
As honourable senators will realize, the
rate of interest will be the rate at which the
federal government normally advances funds
to Crown companies, such as the St. Lawrence
Seaway Authority. In this case the loan will
not be in excess of $30 million.
This is an attempt by the dominion Government to establish the development of a power
project in the Maritime provinces, and it will
be followed by an attempt to establish power
projects in Saskatchewan, and probably in
other provinces, as time goes on.
I can only call to the attention of honourable senators the wonderful development that
has taken place in my own province of
Manitoba. I well remember that in 1897,
when I was a boy going to school, there was
virtually no electricity there. The rich had
only one light globe in their halls, and the
rest of the people had oil lamps. At that
time the rate for current was 20 cents per
kilowatt
hour.
The Northern
Railway
brought power from the Winnipeg River to
operate the Winnipeg Electric Railway. The
rate is now three cents per kilowatt hour,
and the river has been harnessed extensively.
We are now looking to the Nelson River
farther north to take care of the demand.

JANUARY 14, 1958
That has all flowed from the original investment of the Canadian Northern Railway
owners, Mackenzie and Mann. The Winnipeg
Electrie received its power from that source,
but prior to that time the electricity had been
generated from coal. The people in the
house in which my brother and I roomed
in those days had lamps. I remember coming home one night and finding electric light
in the hall, and we turned it on and off for
five or ten minutes to see how it worked,
for we could not believe our senses, not
having seen it before.
Secondly, we lacked water in Winnipeg. It
is true that we had the Red River and the
Assiniboine River, and we also had wells
away out in the country, but all those sources
of water supply were poor. A man who was
elected as Mayor of Winnipeg, a civil
engineer, developed a power site on Lake of
the Woods, about 70 miles east of Winnipeg.
That water runs down hill to Winnipeg. It
does not come by any river-there is no river
there, the river runs further north-but by
natural gravity, and we have a plant furnishing 2,500 gallons a day, which is becoming
insufficient, and I believe aqueducts will have
to be built to bring the water to the edge
of the city. Another development was by a
merchant in the north end of Winnipeg. After
the C.N.R. had put in electric current for
their street railway he developed a power site
on the river to give electricity to the citizens
of Winnipeg.
Among the provinces of Canada, Manitoba
is now one of the greatest per capita users
of power-perhaps not as great as Ontario,
Quebec or British Columbia. My city of
Winnipeg has increased from a population
of about 35,000 people, in 1897, to an estimated population of 425,000, in 1957. That
has come about through these developments.
This year the International Nickel Company
has spent, I understand, about $175 million
on a new plant in northern Manitoba. The
provincial Government is going to build a
power site on the Nelson River, with roughly
half of the power to be sold to the nickel
company and the other half to be sold to
the people of the town, and the balance, if
any, to be sent to Winnipeg for sale there.
In other words, the creation of one development has led to the creation of other
developments.
I believe that is exactly what can happen
in New Brunswick. True, goods manufactured
at Beechwood cannot be sold as cheaply in
Ontario or Manitoba, but they can be sold
a good deal more cheaply than they are
being sold at the present time. This development will induce the establishment of other
industries that go along with it in that
province.

My other point is that the Province of New
Brunswick will be liable for the debt. We
are not giving the money to them. It is
simply a loan being made to the Province
of New Brunswick to develop a power project.
Similar loans will be made to other provinces
along the Atlantic seaboard. A similar loan
will be made also to Saskatchewan, where it
is badly needed.
Honourable senators, I believe this is a
step in the right direction. I have never
been in favour of giving cash money to a
province to do some development. It seems
to be throwing money away, unless the province itself stands the liability. But a province
cannot borrow money as cheaply as the dominion can, and cannot establish a policy
that will extend across the whole country.
I believe this is the first step in a policyand that it will be continued, no matter
what government is in power-which will
give certain parts of the country the same
opportunity to carry on their development
as Ontario, Quebec, and to some extent
Manitoba, have done. I do not suggest that
Manitoba has any need to borrow money
from the federal Government or any other
Government, in the ordinary course of events.
Its development has been going on very well.
The same is true of British Columbia. But
provinces like Saskatchewan and the Atlantic
provinces lack that kind of development.
This legislation is an attempt to meet that
situation.
For those reasons I hope the house will
pass this bill, and I hope it will come into
force during the present session. I feel sure
this is the first of a series of measures of
this kind to come before the house.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I ask the honourable
leader, is it not true that the plant is already
built, and this is just money to help the
provincial government?
Hon. Mr. Haig: The Government is borrowing the money, and it is to be repaid oneeighth every year, with principal and interest
combined; that is to say, there will be eight
payments of the same amount.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: May I ask the honourable leader a question on that point?
Clause 2 of the bill says this loan shall be
repayable in eight equal annual instalments.
Can he tell the house when the first of those
instalments will be payable?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is expected the first
instalment will be payable one year from
April 1, that the money will be paid over
on April 1. The money bas not been paid
out yet, but the work is going on; it will be
paid when the work is finished.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Robersion: May I ask my honourable friend in what way, if any, this
legislation differs from the proposals of the
previous Government?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot answer that question directly, because I do not know what the
proposals were. I do not live in the Maritime
provinces, and therefore I do not know that.
I understand promises were made. One difference is that there are no strings attached
to this help. It is a straight loan to the
Province of New Brunswick to do this job.
I think that arrangement is safer both for
the Province of New Brunswick and for the
federal Government. It is not a grant or a
gift of money to them at all.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: What strings were
attached to the other proposals?
Hon. Mr. Haig: We don't know; there is
no record in the legislation about it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
should like to ask my honourable friend a
question:
the date that was mentioned,
April ist, is that before or after the election?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I haven't got a vote at the
Liberal Convention, so I can't tell you.
Hon-. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators,
I would like to discuss briefly, if I may,
some of the background with respect to
power development in the province of New
Brunswick, with particular reference to the
Beechwood power development project and
the proposals that were submitted to the
federal Government for financial assistance.
May I say at the outset that I am not opposing this bill and intend to support it. I
would simply like to give some of the background in relation to the whole proposal and
what has taken place, in as brief a manner
as I can.
Frst, however, may I express my best
wishes to all honourable senators for the
year 1958.
May I also extend my congratulations to
you, Mr. Speaker, not only upon your
appointment to the high office which you
occupy but upon the dignity and grace with
which you have carried out your duties
and the fairness which you have extended
to every member of this assembly. I trust
you may have many years of service in this
assembly.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): Also I
would like to express my appreciation of the
splendid speeches that were delivered here
in the debate on the Speech from the Throne.
Unfortunately I was not present on the day
the mover and seconder of the Address spoke,
but I read both their speeches and I want to

compliment the honourable senators on them.
May I say that I have been in politics quite
a long time, and some of the most outstanding
speeches I have ever read or listened to have
been delivered right in this chamber.
Honourable senators, the first publicly
owned power development in New Brunswick
goes back well over 30 years, when the Government of the day, which incidentally was
a Liberal Government, passed an act known
as The New Brunswick Power Act, under
which a commission was set up, called The
New Brunswick Electric Power Commission,
for the purpose of developing and distributing electricity at cost to the people of New
Brunswick. The first project undertaken and
completed was a hydro-electric plant on the
Musquash River in the county of Saint John.
The second step in power development included a complete study of the Grand Falls
power possibilities, on the main stem of the
Saint John River. After complete and
thorough investigation the power potential of
this site proved to be the largest single power
producing possibility in New Brunswick, if
not in the Maritime provinces, at that time.
The Government of the day, after completing
the investigation of every aspect of this power
site, including shore rights and adequate water
storage on the upper reaches of the river,
decided to go forward with it. However,
before doing so, they were successful in negotiating satisfactory agreements with the State
of Maine and the Province of Quebec, after
which suitable legislation was passed both by
the Legislatures of Quebec and the State of
Maine authorizing the various bodies to enter
into this agreement. After this had been completed tenders were called and contracts
awarded for railway diversion at the site and
the construction of the main dam and power
house, together with the necessary transmission lines. Before the work got under way,
however, a provincial election was held and
the Government was defeated. This was in
1925. Shortly after the new Government came
into office, they decided against proceeding
with this power development as a public
enterprise and, as a consequence, all contracts were cancelled, shore and water
reservoir storage rights were given up, and
the agreements with Quebec and the State of
Maine were cancelled and the moneys returned to the respective governing bodies.
After all this had taken place, the power
potential of the Grand Falls site on the Saint
John River was turned over to the Saint John
River Power Company, and later to the
Gatineau Power Corporation. This to me was
the greatest tragedy of all times so far as
power development in New Brunswick is
concerned.

JANUARY 14, 1958
Hon. Mr. Farris: Will my honourable friend
state what Government did that?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: We know.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): That was
the Conservative Government, which gained
power at the election of 1925.
I think you will agree with me when I tell
you that the estimated cost of the total
project, including shore and water storage
rights, was approximately $10 million, and
the site itself carried a potential power
capacity of some 300,000 horse power.
I might say, too, that there is a complete
story in relation to this transfer which I do
not intend to enter into today.
Coming now to the present day and to
recent power developments in New Brunswick, the beginning of the present power
development on the Saint John River and on
its tributaries goes back to 1945, when the
Province of New Brunswick, through its
Resources Development Board, under the
Department of Industry, undertook a study
of the power possibilities of the Saint John
River, including its tributaries. During the
process of this study a detailed survey was
made of the Tobique River and its tributaries,
including storage possibilities. Following this
survey, the Board recommended to the Government of New Brunswick, of which I happened to be a member at that time, that some
further authority make a study of the possibilities of power development on the Tobique River and, as a result, the Power
Corporation of Canada was given the task of
making this complete survey; and it was on
the advice of the Power Corporation of
Canada, together with the recommendation
of the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission and the Resources Development
Board, that the then Government decided to
go forward with the Tobique hydro-electric
development program. At that time no assistance was asked by the New Brunswick
Government for this development, inasmuch
as the stream itself and the watershed contributing to the fiow of water were wholly
within the confines of the province of New
Brunswick.
Following this, the Government gave further consideration to the possibilities of
developing power on the main stem of the
Saint John River and, realizing that the
waters of the Saint John River were interprovincial and international in character, a
good deal of study was given to the course
that the Government should follow with
respect to further steps of development of
the power resources of the Saint John River.
Honourable senators, most of you may be
familiar with the fact that there is a treaty

in existence between Canada and the United
States known as the Boundary Waters Treaty
of 1909. Under this treaty provision was made
for the transport of processed lumber and
other commodities originating in the United
States down the Saint John River to the Bay
of Fundy. And, recognizing that any power
development on the river might interfere
with the terms of this treaty, and, due to
the fact that 35 per cent of the drainage area
of this river lies in the United States of
America, it was decided, after consultation
with the United States and Canadian authorities, to make application to the International
Joint Commission for a complete study of the
power resources of the Saint John River
Basin. This, incidentally, was agreed to and
recommended by the Chairman of the New
Brunswick Development Board and the
N.B.E.P.C. After a number of consultations
with the Maine authorities, the New Brunswick Government made application to the
federal Department of External Affairs requesting that the regulation and potential of
the Saint John River be studied by the International Joint Commission, which body, under
the Treaty of 1909, was given judicial, investigative and administrative powers to
carry out the aims of the treaty. Consequently, and in accordance with the procedure provided in Article IX of the Treaty of
1909, the Governments of the United States
and Canada, under date of September 28,
1950, united in the following reference to
the International Joint Commission:
1. In order to determine whether waters of the
Saint John River system could be more beneficially
conserved and regulated, the Governments of the
United States and Canada have agreed to refer the
matter to the International Joint Commission for
investigation and report pursuant to Article IX
of the Treaty concerning Boundary Waters between
the United States and Canada, signed January 11,
1909.
2. It is desired that the Commission shall determine and recommend, in its judgment, what
projects for the conservation and regulation of the
waters in the Saint John River system above Grand
Falls, New Brunswick, would be practical in the
public interest.
3. In making its recommendations, the Commission should indicate how interests on either aide of
the boundary would be benefited or adversely
affected thereby and, should estimate the cost of
such works or projects, including remedial works
that may be found to be necessary as well as
indemnification--

I should like to emphasize this aspect of it.
for damage to public and private property and
should indicate how these costs should be apportioned between the two Governments-

That is, of Canada and the United States.
4. In the conduct of its investigation and otherwise in the performance of its duties under this
reference, the Commission may utilize the services
of engineers and other specially qualified personnel
of the technical agencies of Canada and the United

SENATE
States and will so far as possible make use of
information and technical data heretofore acquired
or which may become available during the course
of the investigation, thus avoiding duplication of
efforts and unnecessary expense.

I would also like to point out that the scope
of the reference was enlarged by both Governments on July 7, 1952, and additional reference was made as follows:
2. It is desired that the Commission shall determine and recommend in its judgment, what
projects for the conservation and regulation of the
waters in the Saint John River system above tidewater near Fredericton, New Brunswick, would be
practical in the public interest.

At an executive meeting of the International Joint Commission held at Detroit,
Michigan, on October 20, 1950, it was decided
that the engineering studies in connection
with the investigations under the Saint John
River reference should be conducted by a
board of four engineers, two from Canada and
two from the United States; and the Commission, accordingly, appointed what is known
as the Saint John River Engineering Board.
The study was begun immediately and an
interim report by the International Saint John
River Engineering Board was made to the
International Joint Commission on April 6,

1953.
Honourable senators, it should be noted
that the application for a study of the Saint
John River possibilities was initiated and got
under way by the Government of which I was
a member. However, typical of the fortunes
of politics, an election was held in 1952 and
our Government was defeated; therefore I am
not in a position to know what action was
taken by the new Government, until the
month of April, 1953, at which time there was
an interim report, released by the I. J. C.,
which contained several recommendations:
At that time the Commission issued a press
release stating that its studies showed that the
Beechwood Power Project in the Lower Saint John
River in New Brunswick under consideration for
development by the New Brunswick Electric Power
Commission is consistent with the comprehensive
plans for the development of the entire Basin.

In their conclusions, in the same press release, is found the following:
Among the more favourable possibilities for meeting increased power demands are:
1. Inter-connection of existing and future transmission systems on both sides of the boundary.

That is between Canada and the United
States.
2. Construction of the Beechwood Power Project
on the main stem of the Saint John River in New
Brunswick and provision of from 500,000 to 600,000
acre feet of reservoir storage at sites upstream
from Grand Falls, New Brunswick.

Commission for analysis and comment within the
framework of the reference of September 28, 1950,
as amended, or for action under the Boundary
Waters Treaty of 1909 when required.
2. Studies under the reference be continued by
the Commission as may be warranted by the need
for water resources development in the Saint John
River Basin.

Following the publication of this report,
as far as I am aware, no further representation was made to the International Joint
Commission with respect to this whole matter; therefore, we knew little about what
transpired concerning the recommendations.
During the session of 1953, however, a
brief was prepared by the Province of New
Brunswick to the Government of Canada on
the need for financial assistance to develop
the hydro-electrie power resources of the
Saint John River. This was under date of
April 27, 1953, and was tabled in the Legislature. The brief outlined the need for
increased power facilities by the New Brunswick Power Commission, and in it, too, will
be found an application to the Government
of Canada for financial assistance in the development of the Beechwood project, including the building of the dam and power
house, provision for storage and the building
of transmission lines, and it will be found
on pages 5 and 6 of this report.
Then, again, on page 32 of the same report
will be found the detailed proposals of the
Province of New Brunswick to the Government of Canada in which is outlined:
1. The urgent need for cheaper power in order
to improve the general economy of the province.
2. The urgent need for a reserve power if any
expansion of the economy is to take place.
3. That suitable sites with sufficient potential
power are available and practical.
4. That the Commission is not self-sustaining
without increased facilities for the production of
cheaper power.

All of which I concur in, and did at the time.
Having pointed these various factors out,
particularly to the Government of Canada, the
following request was made:
In view of the above, it is requested that the
Government of Canada agree to advance to the
Province of New Brunswick, as the work progresses, sufficient funds, interest-free, to permit the
development of the Saint John River Basin with
repayment at the rate of 11 per cent per year,
starting one year after each unit of plant goes
into operation.
Interest savings on repayments
to be retained by the Commission. If an interestfree loan is not possible, it is requested that the
advance be interest-free during construction and
bear interest at a rate nut exceeding 21 per cent
per annum thereafter.
(Signed)-Hugh John Flemming,
Premier of the Province of
New Brunswick.

Following their conclusions, the I.J.C. made

JANUARY 14, 1958
Following this application, detailed study
was given to it by the Government of Canada,
after which they advised the Province of New
Brunswick that since the Premier of the
province had stated on various occasions that,
if necessary, the province could and would
go forward with the project alone, the Government of Canada felt that it was not necessary to grant assistance for the Beechwood
development on the basis requested but that
they would give consideration to any proposa]
for further development of the power resources of the river.

Premier Flemming that I have referred to was
made in the provincial Legislature on April 14,
1954, and is as follows:
It has already been announced by the Chairman
of the Power Commission that the province on its
own behalf can and will begin the initial development of Beechwood.

He also stated on several occasions that the
only reason for requesting federal assistance
was to obtain cheap money to lessen the cost
of power to be produced.
While the Engineering Board of the International Joint Commission, together with other
engineering authorities, has stated that the
Beechwood project was feasible on the run
of the river basis, I have always felt that
without the necessary storage, as recommended by the Commission, cheap and firm
power would not be available at Beechwood.
This contention, I still maintain, is a correct
one by reason of the variation in the flow of
the Saint John River.
To indicate to you what I mean in this
regard may I say that the following is taken
from the dominion report called Water Discharge Data at Grand Falls, which bas to do
with the c.f.s.-cubic foot per second-of the
river and shows that the maximum water
flow in c.f.s. in a full month for a period of
12 years averaged 51,192, compared to the
minimum full month for 12 years amounting
to only 3,231 c.f.s. That indicates the variation in the flow of the river.
Honourable senators, you will realize from
these figures that firm and cheap power will
not be available at Beechwood unless up-river
storage is provided.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): There is a
great difference between a plant that may
be feasible on the one hand and, on the other,
one that will produce firm and cheap power.
I have always maintained that cheap power
will never be produced at Beechwood unless
the recommendation of the Engineering Board
of the International Joint Commission is carried out in respect to storage water. That
has not been done up to the present time.
96702-31

To indicate to you that I arn not alone in
my analysis of the Beechwood project, I intend to quote from the report of none other
than Dr. H. J. Rowley, Director, Research
Branch, and Chairman of the New Brunswick Resources Development Board, and also
a member of the New Brunswick Electric
Power Commission. His statement is found
in the 1955 Annual Report of the Department
of Industry and Development of the provincial Government, in which he stated:
Until large water storages are constructed in the
upper reaches of the Saint John River watershed in
Maine and Quebec, such firm or continuous power
will not be available from sites that might be
developed on the main river. With ample water
flowing, as during the spring runoffs and with rainy
autumn periods, Beechwood will afford periods of
firmness in supply. The smaller winter and summer
flows will afford energy for some hours each day
only to care for peaks when system demand is
high.
Consequently new sources of continuous
power must be afforded and these are most likely
to be steam plants burning that fuel which will
most effectively yield power at the lowest cost.

Honourable senators, no doubt negotiations
continued following the decision of the federal
Government. However, early in 1954 a decision was reached by the Province of New
Brunswick to go forward with the building
of the Beechwood power project on its own.
In the early part of the summer of 1954
properties around the head pond and properties which were acquired for railway and
highway diversions were expropriated. Contracts were let for both highway and railway
diversions. Tenders for two 45,000 h.p. turbines had been called. Tenders for two
generators and two power transformers were
called. Also, the tenders for the general
contract for the major structures of the dam
and power bouse were called, to close on
March 31, 1955. And I would like to point
out here that the lowest tender on this main
contract was not accepted even though it
was submitted by one of the largest and
best-known construction firms in Canada. As
a matter of fact, it was the firm that had the
general contract for the Kitimat power project
in British Columbia and, at the time the
tenders were called it was in the course of
completing the Canso Causeway. However,
this tender was not accepted and the contract
was awarded some six weeks after tenders
closed to a contracting firm at $1,200,000
above the low tender.
Hon. Mr. Reid: Was any reason given for
rejecting the low tender?
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Weslmorland): Yes, reasons were given for it. I can go into that
matter if my honourable friend wishes me to.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It would be interesting.

480

t I Z.

SrN J ATEý

Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): Tenders
were called and closed on a certain date.
The firm whose tender was not accepted
tendered on the basis of completing the dam
in two phases and by providing two dormitories to house the men working on the job.
This firm was informed by the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission that the
dam had to be built in three phases and that
there must be twelve dormitory units for
housing the men.
I made this statement on the floor of the
house in Fredericton-and it has not been
contradicted as yet-that the firm which had
tendered the lowest had continued negotiations for a period of five to six weeks and
was willing to accept the contract and the
consequences in relation to it, building the
dam to the perfect satisfaction of the Government and the New Brunswick Electric Power
Commission, but that on the basis of its tender
the dam had to be built in two phases. I
have already stated that this company had the
main contract for building the power project
at Kitimat, and I think it will bo agreed that
the company knew something about hydro
power development projects. In any event,
it was told that the project could not be built
in that way, but negotiations went on for
some six wecks before finally the company
withdrexv its bid.
I made another statement on the floor of
the Legislature in Fredericton, and this stateI
ment also has not yet been contradicted.
said that the power dam at Beechwood was
in fact built in two phases and not in three,
and that although 12 dormitories were built
only three were used during the whole construction period of the power project.
Honourable senators, all this was done without making provision for the necessary storage to make the Beechwood project one that
would produce cheap and firm power. After
further negotiations by the Province of New
Brunswick and the Canadian Government,
the Minister of Northern Affairs and National
Resources reuested from the Province of
New Brunswick further information in regard
to their future requirements and their proposals with respect to future power development. This, I believe, was in October, 1955,
and it wvas not until January of 1956 that the
Province of New Brunswick submitted to the
Government of Canada a plan for future
development which included the requirements
of the province up to and including 1966; in
other words, a ten-year program. This included an additional unit at Beechwood,
together with another hydro plant or plants
on the Tobique River, with storage above the
proposed plant or plants, and included a
hydro project on the main Saint John River at
Hawkshaw below Beechwood. However, the

major portion of this new development was
to be thermal units established at various
points in New Brunswick, the estimated cost
to be over $200 million.
In their submission with respect to the
Tobique River hydro plant and water resources, the following will be found on page
23 of that report. First, I quote that part of
the report dealing with the power site itself:
. . . three potential dam sites-two of them on the
main stem of the river between Plaster Rock and
the Forks and the third on the Little Tobique
branch just above the Forks.
It must be emphasized that the following site
descriptions and calculations are based on very
preliminary and meager information and therefore
many figures quoted will be subject to revision
following further investigation . . .

I wish to quote again from the report, on
page 24:

reference to the Ledges site:

All of which indicates that there had not
been a complete survey that would give any
group, including the Goversnment of Canada,
any as-urance that the possibilities were even
o-rth considering.
After giving this application and report
thorough consideration, it was feit by the
Government of Canada that, as yet, no concrete, defimite proposal had been submitted
to it by the Province of New Brunswick for
assistance in a program for long-range power
development including further developrment
of the Saint John River which the Government
of Canada could accept. As a malter of fact,
Premier Flemming himself admitted it later
on, in a letter addressed to the Minister of
Nortlern Affairs and National Resources,
under date of March 28, in which ho said:
A telegram went forward to you yesterday in
this coinection which stated that it might te
advisable to postpone specific consideration of the
auestion of Tobique storage in view of general
financial conditions at the present lime. This view
is endorsed by the contents of your letter.

As a result, therefore, the Federal Government, through the Minister of Finance and
the Minister of Northern Affairs and National
Resources, proposed that the Federal Government would embark on a power development
scheme to produce thermal power to both
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, provided

JANUARY 14, 1958
the proposals were approved by the Governments of both Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. This plan envisaged, first, interconnection transmission lines of the power resources
of the two provinces; secondly, the building
of large thermal plants at the most favourable
sites, having regard to the areas most in
need of power and the proximity to fuel.
To be more specific with respect to this
program of power development, I beg to
quote the relevant paragraphs in the budget
address of Mr. Harris, which had to do with
this proposal:

Brunswick that he did not wish this to
become a political issue, but, apparently for
reasons best known to himself, in the election
campaign he decided otherwise, because
speaking in Moncton on June 5, as reported
in the Telegraph Journal of that date, he is
quoted as saying:

. . . it is suggested by experts in the field of
electric power that advantages would result for
Nova Scotia and New Brunswick from the interconnection of their electrical systems. Such interconnection would reduce the requirements for
standby capacity and would permit the most advantageous location of thermal plants and the
building of larger and more efficient thermal units.
If the Governments of Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick agree and in order to help reduce the
differential in the cost of power between those
provinces and certain other parts of Canada, the
federal Government would be prepared to provide
the main interconnection facilities within and
between those provinces, and to build and operate
such large thermal plants as may be needed either
to replace existing ones, should efficiency so indicate
or to meet the requirements of growth and
industrial development.
Under this proposal, the transmission lines would
be rented on a non-profit basis and the power
would be sold at cost to provincial electric systems.
The purpose would be that the plants and other
facilities built under this program can be acquired
by the provinces at any time on payment of their
amortized cost.

The Honourable Hugh John Flemming told a
political gathering at The Rocks, Hopewell, that
the Liberal Government is doing an about face
in its campaign by making vague promises just
before election time by building thermal electrical
units. He said the Liberal Government now had
offered to build thermal power units in the Maritime provinces but still had given no definite
facts in relation as to what the cost would be if
the province accepted the offer.

We have not been able to find out how much this
power is going to cost. Have we not the right to
question the cost?

Then again, speaking at a meeting at
Hopewell in Albert County on June 4, as
reported by the Telegraph Journal as follows:

The quotation is as

Premier Stanfield, speaking on the power proposal said it is obvious that the federal Government
is not yet prepared to say how much federally
produced power will cost. The Province could not
talk business on that basis.

unusual situation, since Premier Flemming,

Hugh John Flemming
Premier of New Brunswick.

Honourable senators, I am only quoting
this to indicate that the proposal outlined by
the then Minister of Finance was accepted
by the Premier of New Brunswick as well as
the Premier of Nova Scotia. However, just
prior to the election of June 10, 1957, we
were all amazed, both in New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia, with public statements made
by both Premiers Flemming and Stanfield by
reason of the fact that Premier Flemming
had indicated to the members from New
96702-311

1. A $30 million federal loan at 4j per cent interest
to New Brunswick for additional construction of
the Beechwood hydro-electric power project on the
Saint John River.
2. Federal construction of steam power plants
and interconnecting transmission lines in the two
provinces. These will be sold to the provinces.

Further on the Prime Minister is reported
as saying:
This offer of the Government of Canada carries
the full and enthusiastic support of both Premiers
Stanfield of Nova Scotia and Flemming of New
Brunswick.

First, may I point out that under the
proposed $30 million federal loan to the
Province of New Brunswick, it is referred to
as additional construction of the Beechwood
hydro power project on the Saint John River,

SENATE
which I believe is totally misleading, by
reason of the fact that the Beechwood hydro
project is now in operation, according to
a statement made by the Chairman of the
New Brunswick Electric Power Commission,
In a press
the Honourable Mr. Fournier.
statement which appeared in the TelegraphJournal on November 30, 1957, datelined
Fredericton, the Honourable Mr. Fournier announced that:

Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): Very little.
However, I do not have the figures here.

The turbines of New Brunswick's multi-million
dollar Beechwood hydro project have started to
churn out power. Within the last few days the
big plant on the Saint John River, near Perth, has
given power to the Maine Public Service Company,
Presque Isle, Maine.

Hon. Mr. Howard: You are doing pretty
well; keep it up.

As a matter of fact, it is well known that
this $30 million federal loan to the province
is to cover the advances made to the Power
Commission by the banks of New Brunswick
on treasury bills and does not envisage at
the present time any additional construction
at Beechwood.
Hon. Mr. Reid: That is what I thought
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): May I
again refer to the fact that on various occasions the Premier of New Brunswick has
stated that the only reason they requested a
loan was to secure cheap money, or an interest-free loan from the federal Government,
in order that cheap power might be produced.
It now appears that cheap money is not
available and that the province must pay 4per cent interest on the $30 million federal
loan, and it must be repaid in a period of
eight years.
This, again, is a far cry from the request
that Premier Flemming made to the former
federal Government in which he demanded,
first, an interest-free loan and, if this would
not be available, a loan to carry an interest
rate not exceeding 22 per cent and to be
repaid over a 66-year period.
My own opinion of this is that had the
provincial Government issued their own bonds
from 1954 on, they could have secured the
money at a lower interest rate than 43 per
cent. My reason for making this statement
is due to the fact that, according to the
records, New Brunswick floated bond issues
from April, 1954 to April, 1956 as follows:
$ 9,232,000
April 15, 1954 ............

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Will the honourable gentleman permit a question? Were any of those
bond issues sold at a discount and, if so,
how much?

Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think you will find that
they were sold at a discount.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): Very little.
As a matter of fact, I did not think this bill
was coming up this afternoon, so I do not
have with me a lot of material that I could
have brought. But I can get the material.

Hon. Mr. Taylor (Westmorland): You will
note that this totals almost $60 million, or
twice the cost of Beechwood; therefore, it
would appear that the shortsighted approach
of the Government of New Brunswick is going
to cost New Brunswickers a considerable
amount of money, based on the recent federal
off er.
Under this legislation the province will be
required to pay in interest and principal over
the 8-year period an annual amount approximating $5 million and, as I have stated before,
that is far from being cheap money, and far
from the original request of the Premier of
New Brunswick with respect to the repayYet, he apparently is comment period.
pletely satisfied, as I take it he is, from a
statement made by the Prime Minister when
he announced this program, and in which he
is quoted as saying:
It carries tne full and enthusiastie support of both
Premiers Stanfield of Nova Scotia and Flemming of
New Brunswick.

Honourable senators, may I again point
out that, to me it is most unfortunate that
this power development project has been
thrown so wantonly and deliberately into the
political arena. This is not only confirmed
by what I have already said, but by the fact
that both Premier Stanfield of Nova Scotia
and Premier Flemming of New Brunswick, in
their public statements before the election,
referred to the fact that they could not enter
into any agreement with the federal Government with respect to power resource development unless the federal Government would
tell them the exact cost of power which would
be made available.
As against that, under the present plan, or
plans, no reference whatever has been made
to the cost of power to the Province of New
Brunswick under either plan-which, again,
emphasizes the degree that politics have
played in this whole power development.
The present legislation authorizing a $30 million loan to the Province of New Brunswick
is again one that appears to be entirely satisfactory to the Premier of New Brunswick,
even though it will cost the people of NewBrunswick considerably more than it would

JANUARY 14, 1958

have cost had they carried out the Premier's
own statement to the effect that they could
and would finance it themselves.
Having said all this, it is not my intention
to oppose this bill, by reason of the fact that
apparently there is no alternative; but I do
so with a certain amount of reserve because
I feel the Beechwood project has been badly
handled by the Flemming Government from
the beginning and that the neglect and delay
of the New Brunswick Government in arranging suitable financing will aggravate and
increase for all time the cost of power which
will be developed in this particular plant,
and we will still be without cheap power.
Honourable senators, I regret that I have
taken so much of your time in explaining
some of the background of the Beechwood
Power Development; however, I felt that in
order to understand the meaning of the bill
now before us, you should know something
about the history of it.
In conclusion, and also in summarizing the
present situation, I wish to emnhasize, first,
that the project was undertaken without
making suitable financial arrangements.
Secondly, that no provision was made for
adequate reservoir storage, as recommended
by the International Joint Commission, that
would not only give firm and cheap power
at Grand Falls and at Beechwood, but the
same water would also give firm and cheap
power at two other sites below Beechwood
that have also been recommended, namely,
the Morrell and Hawkshaw sites.
And, lastly, that the recent power development of the Saint John River basin has been
made a political football by the New Brunswick Government and, as a result of a combination of these circumstances, the people
of New Brunswick will not be getting cheap
power at Beechwood.
To indicate the degree to which pai'y politics has entered into this, may I again remind
you that the only proposal the New Brunswick Government placed before the Liberal
Government at Ottawa, or would accept, was
an interest-free loan, or if an interest-free
loan was not possible, a rate of not more
than 2, per cent per annum, the loan to be
repaid over a period of 66 years; whereas it
appears to be entirely happy to accept a loan
from the present Government with money
costing 4e per cent per annum and which
must be repaid in eight years.
Surely, honourable senators, if this Government wants to assist New Brunswick in
power resource development, it could at least
have granted this loan, and in particular with
terms of repayment commensurate with normal financial arrangements of hydro-electric

developments in Canada, and thus undo some
of the damage created by the present Government of New Brunswick.
Hon. Mr. McLean: Honourable senators, I
would like to ask the distinguished Leader
of the Government how this rate of 41 per
cent was arrived at. Looking at the history of
interest rates over the past half dozen years
or so, 4. per cent is out of line with the
average rates.
Hon. Mr. Haig: When the deal was made
the rate the Government was paying for its
money was 41 per cent, or 4-2/8, and it added
one-eighth of one per cent for the financing
arrangements. The rate has gone downHon. Mr. McLean: Will the Province of
New Brunswick get the benefit if the rate
goes down?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes, certainly it will.
Hon. Mr. McLean: The way things are now,
we have a jumping-jack bank rate. The situation here is worse than in any country in
the world. The Bank of Canada, instead of
giving us leadership, has become a follower.
The bank was organized by the late Prime
Minister Bennett to give us leadership, but
it is not doing so.
Hon. Mr. Reid: I wonder if the honourable
Leader of the Government would mind
checking on his earlier remarks. As I listened
to him I thought I heard him say at least
two or three times that the interest rate was
not less than 21 or 3 per cent. That may have
been a slip of the tongue, but I wonder if he
could be good enough to check on it. We have
the bill before us, and it says 41 per cent.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I said the interest was not
less than 41 per cent. That probably will be
adjusted. That was the rate the Government
was paying for public money at that time.
Now, if money gets cheaper these people will
get the benefit.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, just
in order to make the position perfectly clear
to myself, may I ask a question? I understood
although I had not gone into the matter too
deeply, that this loan of $30 million was for
the purpose of constructing the Beechwood
Power enterprise. However, apparently the
whole thing has been finished and this bill
merely says that we provide the money that
had been provided through other lending
agencies, banks and others, thus replacing
one loan by another. Is that not the case?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No. The Government assured the banks that if they lent the money
the Government would finance the project.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Reid: But it has already been
built.
Hon. Mr. Euler: It has been built, and the
building of it must have taken money.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Let me explain matters.
The deal was being negotiated and the province wanted to get ahead with the project
as fast as it could, so it decided to borrow
money, at the same time assuring the banks
that legislation would be put through Parliament at a later time to lend the province up
The federal Government
to $30 million.
said it would not go beyond $30 million,
and now it is undertaking to do just that.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am afraid that is not
my point. This power development was
completed with money borrowed from the
banks, and J suppose that money is owed by
the Province of New Brunswick to the banks,
and now the Government of Canada is providing this loan of $30 million, which will be
used to discharge the obligation to the banks.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No.
Hon. Mr. Euler: What else does it mean
then?
Hon. Mr. Haig: It was all arranged before

the project was started, before the banks were
interviewed at all, that the federal government would lend up to $30 million, that
any money borrowed by the province up to
$30 million would be taken care of by a loan
from the federal Government.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Then this money is not

to finance construction at all, it is to pay the
bank loans off.
Hon. Mr. Haig:

I think the honourable

senator is playing on words.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): Honour-

able senators, may I attempt to clear up
the matter? I attended the official opening
of construction, or let us say the first blast

awarded in 1954 for railway diversion and
highway diversion. Tenders were called in
April 1955 for the building of the main
power dam and the power house. They were
closed in early summer of 1955 and work
got underway, I believe, on the 16th of July
1955.
I think you will recall that I read to you
a statement made that appeared in the Saint

John Telegraph-Journalof November 27, 1957,
wherein the Chairman of the New Brunswick

Electric Power Commission said that the
turbines of the multimillion dollar power
development had begun to grind out power
and that Beechwood was now supplying
power to the Maine public utilities. I believe

that referred to the first unit only. The
second unit is not yet in operation; it is
expected to be in operation by mid-January.
But at least the first unit has been operating
and producing power since November 27,
1957.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I am not clear, and maybe
I am dull at comprehension, but this bill
that is before me now says that this $30

million is to cover the cost of the Beechwood
Power project.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That is right.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But that project is completed, I take it?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Just about.
Hon. Mr. Euler: So it had to be paid for,
and in order to pay for what is now a completed project money had to be borrowed

from banks and other institutions.
what is the $30 million for, other than to
pay back those who had lent the money to
the Province of New Brunswick?
Hon. Mr. Burchill: That is it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: While I am on my feet I
would like to ask another question. Perhaps,
however, the question is not in order, because
this money is not being provided to pay for
any further construction whatsoever, I understand. The question I have in mind is this:
Will any money be provided by Parliament
or by the Province of New Brunswick to
complete water storage facilities, lack of
which might prevent the whole development
from being an efficient operation?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators, I
think we can resolve the difficulty that we
are discussing if we change the title of this
bill. It is not a bill dealing with a power
project at all. The bill, No. 243, is intituled
"An Act to authorize a loan to the Government of New Brunswick in respect to the
Beechwood Power Project". I would suggest that the word "Power" be struck out and
the word "Bank" substituted, so that the
title would read "An Act to authorize a loan
to the Government of New Brunswick in
respect to the Beechwood Bank Project". It
is a bank project.

Hon. Mr. Euler: That is more like it.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is a bank project.
The Hon. the Speaker: Is it your pleasure,
honourable senators, to adopt the motion for
second reading of this bill?
Hon. Mr. Reid: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time, on division.

JANUARY 14, 1958
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read a third time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move the third reading
of the bill now.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, no.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
surely an important bill such as this, running
into $30 million, should at least be referred
to our Standing Committee on Banking and
Commerce for further discussion.
In explaining the bill the honourable leader
(Hon. Mr. Haig) mentioned time and time
again that this legislation would affect the
Maritime provinces, and he referred particularly to the province of Nova Scotia.
The bill itself does not indicate any such
thing; it is a bill dealing entirely with the
province of New Brunswick. Coming from the
province of Nova Scotia, as I do, I know that
in future years there will be large movements of electric energy between Nova Scotia
and New Brunswick. Now, in the one province there is a power commission, an entirely
provincial power commission, the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission. In Nova
Scotia we have both the Nova Scotia Power
Commission and an exceptionally strong
privately-owned power company, Nova Scotia
Light and Power Company Limited. No doubt
in time there will be an interchange of power
between the two provinces. This particular
bill does not deal with that phase of the
subject, but I should think the Leader of the
Government would say, as he has so often said
on other occasions, "By all means let the bill
go to committee", to thresh out any questions
which might arise in the minds of members
from other parts of the Maritimes. So I move,
as an amendment, that this Bill 243 be
referred to the Committee on Banking and
Commerce.
Hon. R. B. Horner: It seems to me, after
having listened to the honourable senator
from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) that
honourable senators opposite have surely got
all the political kudos which they can hope
to gain by any further discussion. There is
one point on which I should like to have an
explanation from him. Presumably a Liberal
Government was in power for many years in
New Brunswick, as in Ottawa, because it was
supposed that under their administration
everything would be all right. If that is so,
why were not the needs of the provinces
attended to at that time? All that is now
intended is that Nova Scotia, and other provinces as well, shall receive some "coal-burning
assistance". This is the policy of the Government. Honourable senators opposite are likely
to be very busy during the rest of the week,

and I can see no purpose in sending the
bill to a committee. There are some who may
pretend not to understand it.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Order.
Hon. Mr. Horner: However, I think they do
understand what it is all about, and to send
it to committee would accomplish no purpose
whatever.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: I would ask the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner)
where in this bill there is any mention of coal.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think I can help the
honourable senator from Halifax-Dartmouth
(Hon. Mr. Isnor). Another bill, which covers
the whole problem, is being debated this
afternoon in the other place, and it should be
here by the first of next week. It has to do
with a union of the three provinces. Personally I am quite content that the bill before us
shall go to committee, if that is the will of
the house. But if it is sent to committee we
shall sit tomorrow and the next day and until
we get it through. We can take our time. I
will not hurry my honourable friends. The
Minister of Finance will attend when he has
time to come here. If the house wants to go
to committee it will vote that way. We will
meet tomorrow morning in committee, and
again on Thursday morning, and the discussion
can go on until every phase of the probhem has been fully dealt with by my honourable friends. What I find odd about the
speech of the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) is that most of
the conditions on which he based his argument existed before 1956, yet at the provincial
election in that year the Government of New
Brunswick was sustained by a substantial
majority. So I am not worried about the
political aspect. However, I repeat, if the
house wants the bill to go to committee, that
is all right with me.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Why the hurry? The
Leader of the Government has already made
a motion that the house shall adjourn until
next week. Why has he now withdrawn it
and insisted that we cannot adjourn unless
the bill is passed tonight?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I have not made a motion,
although I was ready to do so. But that
proposal is withdrawn.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You always threaten.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: The Leader of the
Government threatened us with the alternative, that if the bill was sent to committee
the house would be kept here until it had
been finally dealt with. Why cannot the bill
be referred to committee and dealt with next

SENATE
week in the ordinary course? What is the
urgency of the matter? Surely the banks can
wait.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am instructed that the
Government wants the bill to be passed this
week.
Some Hon. Senators:

Why?

Hon. Mr. Haig: The reason is that it wants
to be in a position to pay the bills. Nobody
knows what is going to happen in the other
place. There is a set-up there the outcome of
which no one- can foresee. One newspaper
editor forecasts one way, another guesses the
reverse. If, before this measure had had third
reading, the Government were defeated, no
further action could be taken until after the
next general election; and that would be too
long to wait. As I have said, I am happy to
let the bill go to committee if that is the
wish of the majority. I am in their hands,
because they are the majority, but they know
the price which will have to be paid for
delay. I have asked that the bill shall be
passed. But the price which shall have to be
paid is that we must continue to sit. I want
to get the bill through, and I think my request
is reasonable. The Government bas promised
to take action in this matter, and it is now
faced with a possibility of defeat on the floor
of the House of Commons. If that comes
about, the Government must resign, and then
all legislation will be dropped; nothing can
be done until after the election. So, because
it is important legislation and the Government wants to get it through, I am pressing it.
Hon. Mr. Euler: I would like to remind the
Leader of the Government that no one here
has protested more vigorously than he
against rushing legislation through. The
amount involved in this bill is $30 million,
and I do not think he should say that unless
the second and third readings are put
through immediately there cannot be an
adjournment now.
His argument as to
urgency does not register with me for one
moment.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I understood the
Leader of the Government to say that the
first payment of interest and principal will
be on April 1. That is two months away.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: It is out of order; you cannot move. I want to say quite candidly that
I have no ill will to my honourable friend.
Why would I have? I have no reason to. We
can meet tomorrow morning in committee.
The minister will be there, and we can meet
in the house tomorrow afternoon and pass
the Beechwood Power Project Bill. Now, if
honourable members of the Opposition don't
want to do that-they are in the majority.
I have said that before, and I say it again
now. I never made any challenge to the
house-I never told the bouse anything else;
all I said was that I have to pass the bill
over the hurdles. I would not last 50 minutes
as Leader if I did not press for legislation
to go through. It is my duty, my solemn
duty, to press to get legislation through.
Hon. Mr. Euler: But not to rush it through.
Hon. Mr. Haig: As soon as you vote me
down my responsibility is gone, but up to
that moment I have my responsibility, and
my followers say, "Now, press this bill
through-the Government tells you to". Now
you have voted for the bill to go to committee. I don't dispute that, I never disputed
that. I am ready to go to committee tomorrow morning, and I expect to have the minister there to make his answer, and I expect to
sit in the house tomorrow afternoon and pass
the legislation. Goodness gracious! If this
country is not willing to let me do that, the
sooner the people of Canada understand the
situation the better. I am trying desperately
hard, under a difficult situation, with six or
seven members on this side, and 80 on the
other side, to run a house. You have to be
a miracle man to do it, and I am not a
miracle man, I am just an ordinary fellow.
Hon. Mr. Reid: You have mind readers on
that side.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I want to do the best I
can. I love the Senate. Make no mistake
about it. I have always loved the Senate,
and I have always been honourable to it, to
the best of my ability. I make lots of mistakes, and maybe you do, too, but again I
am telling you that I love the Senate, and I
honour my appointment very, very highly.
I have given service to my country in the
best way I can. I am trying to do this thing
the best way I know how, and if I do not
do it well enough to suit you men I cannot
help it. I am representing the Government
of this country, and I am trying to remember
that, and to remember that there are 80 members on the Opposition side, and six or seven
on this side. I recognize that, and I am in
difficulty now. If the bill goes to committee
tomorrow morning, then I am going to give
the report of the committee in the house
tomorrow afternoon, and I hope you will

adopt it. That will be the end of it. There
is nothing there to hurt anybody at all. It is
true that members will have to stay over
tomorrow, but we members from the west
and from the east have to stay over all the
time, anyway. Honestly, I have no intention
of insulting the house, not one iota. I say
quite candidly to you that I am trying my
best to carry this on as a man with the
responsibility I have should carry it on. If I
have done it wrongly, it is my fault, not
yours. I am going to ask the house to adjourn
now, and we will sit tomorrow morning in
committee, and tomorrow afternoon in the
house and pass the bill. That will give everybody an opportunity to do whatever they
want to do.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Honourable senators, I
realize that a motion to adjourn is not
debatableHon. Mr. Haig: It is not.
Hon. Mr. Euler: -but if I may be permitted I would like to say that while I was
opposed to rushing this bill involving $30
million through first, second and third readings at one sitting, I think the statement
now made by the Leader of the Government
is quite in order. The bill will go to committee tomorrow morning and if it is
approved of there-it might not be, but I
think probably it will be-we can give it
third reading in the house tomorrow
afternoon.
Honourable
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancourt:
senators, may I add a few words to what has
been said?
When the Leader of the Government says
that we should not try to run the Government, I think those words are too strong.
During the past few weeks I have thought
that sometimes the Leader of the Government was trying to run this side of the bouse,
and doing it roughly at times.
Last week when I was returning to Quebec
City by train I saw in a newspaper a twocolumn headline to the effect that the Senate
had no work to do that day. But that very
day our Natural Resources committee sat
for two hours discussing a problem that
every province of
affected practically
Canada. In that 17-page newspaper the only
news about the committee was a very small
item; and, as I have said, on the front page
it set out in headlines that the Senate had
no work to do.
If some members of this chamber want
further explanation on a bill involving the
expenditure of $30 million, I think that is
fair. We do not want to run the Government, we want to be able to explain to our
people why so much money is being spent. I
think that is a fair proposition, and there is

JANUARY 14, 1958
no need to worry about it. We are in a
democracy, and we believe that every person
is free to ask for an explanation without
being treated too hard. We do not want to run
anything, but we want to protect our people;
and before answering any questions, it is
necessary to have a full explanation. That
is all I have to say.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not calling a meeting.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: You said you would call a
meeting tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not calling a meeting;
I never called a meeting in my life.

BEECHWOOD POWER PROJECT BILL

The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the Bill (243)
intituled: "An Act to authorize a Loan to the
Government of New Brunswick in respect of the

the order of reference of January 14, 1958, examined
the said bill, and now report the same without any
amendment.

The report was adopted.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators. when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move the third reading
now.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, before this bill is read for the third
time I would like to express my views about
it. It is a kind of legislation that applies
to one province with the understanding that
there is another bill for the benefit of the
other Atlantic provinces. In the course of
his remarks the honourable Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) said that something might be done also for the province
of Saskatchewan, meaning probably by that
the often-heard-of South Saskatchewan River
Dam. What is particularly interesting in this
kind of legislation is that its purpose is not
to enable a province to do a work but to
lend money after the work has been nearly
completed--to use the words of the honourable Minister of Finance before the committee this morning.
Honourable senators, if the same thing is
not done for each province of Canada it
will constitute a very dangerous precedent.
I have no objection at all to any province
being helped by the Government of Canada,
but in this case a province has been singled
out from the others in order to have a
monetary advantage of some kind. And the

"kind" is big money-it is $30 million. Now,
honourable senators, I find that this needs
thought. One may have any view about the
value of money, but when we come to $1
million, it takes some time to count it; $2
million, it is still more; $10 million, it is still
more; and $30 million, it is much more. I am
very glad that this demonstration seems to
be agreed to by you, my honourable
colleagues.
Now, the Province of New Brunswick is
a beautiful province, and a province which
has tremendous possibilities. Actually, the
term "poorer provinces" has not been used
by the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig), although I have heard it
very often from the time of the Rowell
Report.
There was a distinction between
the self-supporting provinces and the socalled poorer provinces. I wonder what my
honourable friends from New Brunswick
would say if we called them "our poor colleagues", or "our country cousins"?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Poor relations.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Poor relations, country
cousins.
I will never use such an expression.
The Almighty has been most
generous to not only one part of Canada, but
to every part of Canada. And it was absurd
for the representatives of those provinces
which may be smaller in area and in population, but just as great in resources and good
men as any other province in Canada, to be
designated as poorer provinces. I protest very
strongly against such a designation being
applied to sturdy Canadians belonging to a
beautiful part of the country, wherever it is,
and I find it most unreasonable and unjust.
If we had called those representatives of
the poorer provinces-to use their own language-beggars, they would have been insulted. But it was the expression that they
chose themselves, to get more financial aid
from the Government of Canada.
The Rowell Report was drafted many years
ago and is covered with dust. But on the
other hand, the financial arrangements which
were made in virtue of it still exist. In the
minds of some people, they come to Ottawa as
to a wealthy relative, ignoring the fact that
the money paid out by Ottawa comes from
the same individuals who pay provincial
taxes. This is just as true and well-founded
in fact as the demonstration I made about the
increasing amounts
of money, going to
$30 million.
Now, some people may say: "Senator Pouliot is opposed to a grant to that great old
province of New Brunswick.
Is it not a
shame?"
This will be the reaction on the
part of some newspapers and even in the
minds of some so-called intelligent persons.

JANUARY 15, 1958
In my view, honourable senators, all Canadians should be on a footing of equality, and
all provinces should be on a footing of equality-the provinces of the east, the provinces
of the west and the central provinces-especially after the most illuminating speech that
was made by our honourable and dear friend
the senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr.
Taylor). What he said has left many question marks in my mind. I wonder how it is
that the Government of New Brunswick
comes to Ottawa and gets a guarantee of $30
million for a work that has been, to use the
words of the Government, nearly completed.
This morning at the meeting of the committee I was most interested to listen to
what the honourable the Minister of Finance
had to say about the project. When I told
him what happened, and that there were
three big books published by the Government about the same matter-naturally, they
were mimeographed, but nevertheless they
were books just the same, and big ones-he
did not seem to know anything about it.
Honourable senators, I will tell you what
is behind this scheme. As one of my distinguished colleagues pointed out, "What is
the use of spending so much money building a power house if there are no water
storage facilities?" And if anyone in this
chamber knows about that problem, well, in
all modesty and humility I may say that I
am the one, because those natural storage
facilities are located precisely in the county
of Témiscouata which I had the honour to
represent for 31 years in the House of
Commons.
And what happened? When the Premier
of New Brunswick asked the Government of
Canada for a study to be made of the water
storage capacity in that area, countless
engineers, not only from the International
Joint Commission but also from the Department of Mines and Technical Surveys, from
the Department of Natural Resources and
from the Department of Public Works were
sent to the county of Témiscouata to take
possession of the land. And when General
McNaughton came there, he came as a conquistador to take possession of the soil on
behalf of the International Joint Commission.
I had to protest. It was my duty to protect
the interest of my people, as much as I
could, because years before, in 1928, after
the Conservative Government of New Brunswick had sold that wealth,-the Grand Falls
power-to the International Paper Company,
there was an understanding that the county
of Témiscouata could buy 1,500 horse power
at the boundary of New Brunswick at the
same rate as paid by consumers in New
Brunswick. That would have permitted us

to electrify the whole county of Témiscouata
a long time before it was dono.
Well, honourable senators, that never came
about. The provincial Government of the
time-30 odd years ago-refused to accede
to that request, which was the request of
the county council of the whole county of
Témiscouata, who wanted to have that in
compensation for water storage rights that
were already given.
We must be very careful about it, because
I do not see that one part of the country
should be exploited, without due compensation, for the benefit of any other part of
the country. I could speak at great length
and explain what was done with regard to
the Thomas Seigneury, which bordered to a
depth of two leagues-approximately six
miles-Lake Témiscouata, which is 27 miles
long and two miles wide.
All who have travelled between Rivière
du Loup and Edmundston have seen the
Madawaska River-which is the outlet of
Lake Témiscouata-jammed with logs originating in the county of Témiscouata, P.Q.,
being fioated down to the Fraser Company's
mill at Edmundston, N.B.
New Brunswick has received tremendous
advantages from the county of Témiscouata.
All the pulp and paper that was and is
still manufactured at Edmundston came out
from the forests of Témiscouata. Many of
you, honourable senators, have crossed the
county from north to south and from south
to north. You have seen in summertime
the Madawaska River jammed with logs,
and the huge piles of pulpwood which are
adjacent to the mill at Edmundston. These
were cut on private property; and some
years ago I insisted that the seigniory be
expropriated by the Quebec Government. I
would have liked to have had the land
divided between forest reserves and farms,
so that the farmers of the old parishes alongside Lake Témiscouata would have their
children near them, and established on the
good farmlands of the seigniory. Nothing
was done, but that was not my fault. There
is no use of crying over spilt milk; it is a
thing of the past. But unfortunately the
fact was never taken into consideration that
the county of Témiscouata and the province
of Quebec have supplied with their own
products the paper industry at Edmundston.
I will summarize my argument, honourable
senators, by saying that what is good for
New Brunswick should be good for each
and every province. I do not see why, if
the Government is willing to advance large
sums of money to New Brunswick, the same
thing should not be done in respect of the
hydro projects of the province of Ontario,

ATLANTIC PROVINCES POWER
DEVELOPMENT BILL
FIRST READING

The Hon.

the

Speaker informed the Senate

that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 244, to provide
Assistance in respect of Electric Power Development in the Altantie Provinces.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon.

the

Speaker:

Honourable sen-

ators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. William R. Bruni: Honourable senators, I move that this bill be read the
second time now.
I would like first to make a few general
observations, and then briefly to go over the
bill clause by clause. As honourable senators
are aware, this particular bill is known as
an act to provide assistance in respect of
electric power development in the Atlantic
provinces.
When the present Government decided that
it would aid in the development of power
in four provinces, namely, New Brunswick,
Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland, which provinces are defined in
this bill as the "Atlantic Provinces", it set
up four main points under which it hoped
the plan of federal aid would be worked
out.
Last week this house dealt with the first
main point when it passed a bill authorizing
the federal Government to make a loan to
the Government of New Brunswick in order
to reorganize and complete the financing of
the Beechwood hydro-electric project. Under
that bill Parliament made it possible for the
Government of New Brunswick to borrow
money at lower interest rates, which of course
resulted in a reduction of the cost of producing power.
This bill deals with the second, third and
fourth points in the plan of the federal
Government. Briefiy, these points are as
f ollows:
(a) Aid in the building of steam generation
plants.

(b) Aid in the building of transmission
lines under which a provincial distribution
system for power can be set up by any of
the Atlantic provinces.
(c) Subsidizing Maritime coal at a rate
whereby its price to the provincial power
commissions or the provincial governments
will be the same as that paid for United States
coal bought and used by the Ontario HydroElectric Power Commission. This is a most
important part of the bill. We all know that
the responsibility for providing electric power
is one that belongs to the provinces, the
municipalities and private industry. However, there are in Canada areas, such as the
Atlantic region, which do not enjoy the same
good fortune as other parts of Canada for the
production of low-cost electrie power in
quantity. Such being the case, the present
Government has recognized that some form
of assistance is required, and such assistance
for the Atlantic provinces is provided by this
bill.
Under the provisions of the bill now before
this honourable bouse for its consideration
three things would be done.
First, the dominion Government would
build for and sell to such Atlantic provinces
as desire such aid, thermal plants for the
production of electric power.
Secondly, the dominion Government would
build and sell to provincial power commissions or provincial Governments main or
trunk line transmission facilities, as may be
agreed upon between the dominion Government and each province.
Thirdly, this bill makes provision for the
granting of a subvention on all coal produced
in the Atlantic provinces and consumed for
the production of power in the said provinces.
This subvention would be so calculated as to
eliminate, as far as possible, the differential
in price between coal produced and used in
the Atlantic provinces for production of power
and coal imported from the United States and
used in the province of Ontario for production
of power. The cost of each would as far as
possible be exactly the same.
I understand the Government has received
from the provinces of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia their estimates of the cost of
the construction program for the fiscal years
1957-58 and 1958-59. For the province of
Nova Scotia the estimated cost of this program is about $3.4 million, and for the province of New Brunswick it would amount to
approximately $9.3 million, making a total of
approximately $12.7 million in order to carry
out the program which these two provinces
have in mind for the two fiscal years that I
have mentioned.
Now, in addition, in order to carry out and
complete the immediate program that has

JANUARY 21, 1958
been embarked upon by these two provinces
it would appear that it would cost another
$3.5 million for the province of Nova Scotia
and an additional $8.5 million for the province of New Brunswick, making a further
total of $12 million. So in all, the total
foreseeable expenditure in connection with
the development of thermal power and the
erection of trunk transmission lines for the
provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
would amount to approximately $25 million
at the present time.
The bill provides that all the moneys expended by the federal Government on the
construction program of thermal plants and
transmission lines will be refunded with
interest. This phase of the scheme is selfliquidating, so that in the final analysis it
will not cost the federal Government
anything.
There is no doubt that in the future other
programs for the development of thermal
plants and the building of transmission lines
will be submitted, not only by the provinces
of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia-the only
two provinces which have submitted plans
up to the present-but also by the remaining
two Atlantic provinces, namely, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland. The extent
of the future programs in these provinces cannot be estimated at this time. However, the
rate at which plants and transmission Unes
are built will depend upon the extent and
rate of industrial development in the
Atlantic area.
I mentioned that the bill provides for a
subvention on coal produced in the Atlantic
provinces and used for the production of
thermal electric power there. The annual
cost of such subvention is currently estimated
to amount to approximately $1.7 million.
This cost will, of course, vary from year to
year, depending upon the actual amount of
coal that is used in the production of power.

the present Government feels that the industry promoted and developed by this subvention, which of course leads to the providing
of cheaper electric power in ail the Atlantic
provinces, will be worth many times the
amount of money so expended, in view of the
fact that it will give these provinces an
opportunity to bid for industry and compete
with such provinces as Quebec and Ontario,
where power is now provided at cheaper
rates.
The bill which is before the house will
not in itself appropriate the expenditure of
any specific sums of money. Rather, it may
be classed as enabling legislation, since under
it agreements between the federal Government and the various Atlantic provinces can
be made for the carrying out of the program
I have outlined. The funds required each
year in order to carry out the program for
that particular year will be sought from
Parliament in the normal fashion and included in the estimates of the proper department. Furthermore, the Minister of that
department shall, at the end of each fiscal
year, provide Parliament with a full report
of all proceedings taken and agreements made
under this particular measure.
To deal specifically with the provisions
of the bill,Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would the honourable
senator, before he deals in detail with the
bill, answer two simple questions on matters
about which I am not quite clear?
As I
recall, he said, in substance, that all coal
produced and used for the production of
power in these provinces is included. That
is settled, is it?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The coal must be produced
by and used in the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: So long as it is used for
power purposes the subsidy is paid.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: As to the figure of $1.7
million which you just mentioned, is that

Hon. Mr. Isnor: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The bill is not a long one.
The first section simply provides a name for
the act-the Atlantic Provinces Development
Act.
The second section is an interpretation
and one which is very necessection
sary to the act. In this section you will
find a definition of "Atlantic provinces",

"minister" and the term "power project" are
also defined. These definitions are necessary
because all these words are used throughout
the act, and it is important that we know
just what they refer to.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would the honourable

senator permit me to ask a question?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: If Nova Scotia coal is
used for the development of power in New
Brunswick, would that coal qualify for the
subvention under the act?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is correct.
Hon. Mr. Reid: May I also ask a question
before the honourable senator passes to
another section of the bill? In the explanatory
notes the words "in a suitable quantity and
at lower cost" are used. In view of the
assistance to be given, has it been worked out
to what extent the price will be lower compared with the cost of electricity being produced at present?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I understand that in working out the price they are going to endeavour
to work out a plan so that the cost of coal
used for producing power in the Atlantic
provinces will not exceed that which is paid
by the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of
Ontario for American coal. I think that is
what they are aiming to do, as far as possible.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: The price of coal used

in Ontario must vary. The price must be
quite different for coal used in one part and
coal used in another.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think you will find that
in Ontario our big thermal plants-and the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) will correct me if I am wrong-are
located on or very close to the lake. For

instance, there is a big thermal plant in
Toronto. The coal is brought across Lake
Ontario by boat, as will be the coal for a big
thermal plant that is being built in Hamilton.
This is the price the Government has in mind
in trying to arrive at a price for coal for use
in the thermal plants in the Atlantic
provinces.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Is it the cost of the
electricity at the thermal plant or the cost
of the electricity to the Ontario consumer?
The cost at the thermal plant will naturally
be higher than the cost of hydro power.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I do not think the Government is going to do anything to try to directly
fix the cost of power. What it will do is to
provide the thermal plants in the Atlantic
provinces with coal at the same price that is
paid for coal in Ontario.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: That is American coal.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes, coal that is brought
into Ontario from the United States.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Will the same apply to
American coal landed at an Atlantic port?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No. I think it is recognized that thermal power is produced in
Ontario more cheaply than in any other part
of Canada on account of the fact that we
are able to bring coal across the lake in large
quantities. That is the price the Government
is going to endeavour to set up for coal used
in thermal plants in the Atlantic provinces.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I would like to ask the
sponsor of the bill a question. The Maritime
Electric Company covers practically all of
Prince Edward Island. I do not think any
additional plants will be built there. They
are using oil at the present time.
Would
these plants qualify for this coal and, if so,
would the price of the coal in Prince Edward
Island be the same as that paid for coal in
the plant near Nova Scotia, or would it be

higher?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: It should be the same. That
is the purpose of this subvention, to provide
a uniform cheap price for coal.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: But Prince
Island would not qualify for that?

Edward

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, yes, very definitely.
Any plant in the Atlantic provinces would
qualify, and Prince Edward Island is classed

under the act as an Atlantic province. Prince
Edward Island would very definitely qualify.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Is that the case whether

a plant is privately owned or publicly owned?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Oh, yes. They are all
treated the same. They must be put on
the same basis for the production of power,

JANUARY 21, 1958
because if you did this only for publiclyowned plants it would be just a short time
before the privately-owned plants were forced
out of business.
Hon. Mr. Molson: May I ask the honourable
senator if the price for coal is the price per
ton, or does the price take into account the
B.T.U.'s and the different qualities of coal?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I will be frank and admit
that I cannot answer that question. That will
have to be asked in committee.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: I think I may be able
to help a little on that.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: All right.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Usually coal supplied
to power plants is sold on the basis of B.T.U's,
and I think the comparative price in this
case would be based on the same thing. If
there were fewer B.T.U.'s the price would
have to be lower.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Thank you.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: There is one point I
would like to have clarified. The sponsor of
the bill has said that this subvention will
be for the benefit of all plants whether
privately-owned or publicly-owned. I have a
doubt about that for section 3(1) of the bill
reads:

Hon. Mr. Bruni: It was my understanding
that the bill applies to all plants, whether
privately-owned, municipally-owned or provincially-owned.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, then, the subvention
will have to apply. It cannot be otherwise
or all the private plants would be forced out
of business.
Subsection 1 of section 3 gives the Government the necessary power to enter into an
agreement with provincial power commission and/or with provincial governments.
Subsection 2 of section 3 sets out in some
detail the various provisions and clauses
which are to be included in any agreement
entered into between a provincial authority
and the federal Government.
Under paragraph (a) of subsection 2 the
matter of the construction of power projects
by the Dominion Government and the transferring of such power projects to the provinces
upon the provinces undertaking to pay the
cost of the project is dealt with.
Under this act the Dominion Government
can build a power project, then after it is
built it is turned over to the province and
the province pays for it. The province does
not have to pay a cash lump sum; payment
can be spread over a number of years, so that
the profits derived from the operation of the
plant or of the transmission system in time
would pay off the cost of it.
Hon. Mr. Wall: May I ask the honourable
senator a question? What does the word
"cost" include? Can the honourable senator
define the word "cost"?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The cost will be the entire
cost of any plant; it cannot mean anything
else. You start out on the basis that the
purchase of the land will be so much, the
erection of the building will be added to it,
and then the cost of the equipment will be
added.
Hon. Mr. Wall: The actual cost?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The entire cost of erecting
any plant or of building any transmission
line.
Paragraph (b) of subsection 2 of section 3
deals with the extension and completion of
power projects and the payment thereof.
Under paragraph (c) the province is compelled to give an undertaking to operate the
power project so constructed.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: And whether they are
built or are being built?

Hon. Mr. Farris: Where is the power given
to operate a private corporation?

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes; but I do not thinkand I say this subject to correction-there
are any thermal plants in operation now.
Does any senator know of any? What I think
you will find is that all the plants that are
being built or that will be built will be
constructed by provincial power corporations.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: No.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, the act is for all
plants producing thermal power.

With the approval of the Governor in Council,
the Minister may, on behalf of the Government
of Canada, enter into an agreement with the government of any of the Atlantic provinces to provide
assistance to the province . . .

It does not appear from that that the bill
would in any way apply to any privatelyowned plants.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I think you will find
that section 3(2)(e) covers that.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I do not think so. It
does not look that way to me. I would like
to find out if it is applicable to all these
plants, no matter whether they are constructed by a province or by a private
company.

Hon. Mr. Farris: Then why is (c) necessary?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Any province must come
into this, whether the thermal plant in question is built by the province or by private
industry. The government will deal with the

SENATE
province, and the province in turn will have
to deal with the private industry that builds
the plant.
Hon. Mr. Farris: It does not say so.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: It is referred to in

Hon. Mr. Bouffard: I am not yet convinced.
That paragraph does not touch the construction of the plant.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes, but a private power

Hon. Mr. Bruni: I would say they would
not. This is a bill that has been passed to
assist the Governments of the Atlantic provinces to develop cheap power.

provincial commission under an agreement by
which the amount of money which has been

Hon. Mr. Hayden: Will the honourable
senator permit a question? I notice that
paragraph (d) of subsection 2 of section 3
provides that the province is entitled to collect the subvention in relation to all coal
used in the generation of power, whereas in
paragraph (e) of that subsection the undertaking that the provinces may give as to

JANUARY 21, 1958
paying the operators is only in relation to the
use of coal for industrial purposes.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Is that what is intended?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The last portion of paragraph (d) reads:
...
including
provisions for
establishing the
amount of the subvention and prescribing the
method of calculation.

Under that clause I do not think it could
be limited to industrial users.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I do not agree.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: How will the two be
separated?

Hon. Mr. Bruni: If they are to be separated
I think it would be done on the basis of the
amount of horsepower used by industry and
the amount used in the domestic service. All
companies which produce electrie power
charge a different rate for industrial users
than for domestic users. That is true of
Ontario. However, that is an engineering
question and it would have to be answered
by an engineer qualified on the subject.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Would the honourable
senator tell me, does the province that receives the subvention have to disburse the
full amount of it in the year in which it is
received?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I have no information as
to when it would have to disburse it.

I now go on to subsection 3 of section 3,
which is an important part of the bill, since
under this clause the construction, extension
or completion of a power project in any province cannot be proceeded with until the minister has, first, approved of the need for the
project-that would prevent the indiscriminate
construction of power plants when they were
not needed; secondly, until the minister has
approved of the location of the plant; thirdly,
until he has approved the use and type of
the project; and finally, until he has approved
the time of construction, extension or completion of the project.
Under this subsection the federal Government really controls the construction of power
plants in the Atlantic provinces. If the Government feels at any time that such a plant
is not necessary, the minister will withhold
his approval, no agreement can be made and
no money will be advanced.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Would my honourable
friend be good enough to enlarge on the two
words "need for"?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I think it goes further
than the need of any province. It might
even get down to the need of a particular
locality. For instance, if the Government of

Nova Scotia requests that a plant be built in
Halifax, and upon a survey being made it was
found that no additional power was needed in
that area, the minister would not consent.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: There would be no need
for it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right. A survey
would have to be completed by competent
engineers.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Can the honourable gentleman tell us whether an application for energy
to a customer in the province of Nova Scotia
has ever been denied?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I could not possibly answer
that question. One would have to know the
entire history of the production of electric
power in the province of Nova Scotia, and
that is something I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the honourable gentleman, does this section cover the
soundness of the proposition with respect to
sufficient quantities of water and the flow
of water?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That does not enter into

the consideration of this bill, because the
bill deals only with thermal power, which is
produced by coal. In this measure we do not
run into the criticism which was raised in
connection with the Beechwood Project Bill.
Section 4 of the bill provides that two
commissions-the Northern Canada Power
Commission, which I understand is a com-

mission set up by the federal Government,
and the Dominon Coal Board-shall have the
necessary power to carry out and enforce all
agreements which are entered into between
the federal Government and any of the provincial Governments or provincial commissions in the Atlantic region.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: When was the Northern
Canada Power Commission organized?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: We will have to get that
information when the bill is considered in
committee.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I think I am familiar with
various Crown companies that have been
set up around the country by the federal
Governments of the past, but this is the first
time I have heard of this one.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I can assure my honourable
friend we can get an answer to his question
when the bill goes to committee.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): Honourable senators I notice that the Minister of
Northern Affairs and National Resources at
the previous session, when he proposed the
federal offer at that time, said:
Honourable members will recall that at the last
session of Parliament-

SENATE
That would be the session in 1956, I presume-an
amendment to the Northwest Territories
Power Commission Act was passed changing the
name of the commission to the Northern Canada
Power Commission.

That amendment was, I believe, made at the
session of 1956.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Does that answer the
honourable senator's question?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: All right.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Section 5 of the bill gives
authority to the Parliament of Canada to make
all of the necessary expenditures involved in
carrying out any of the agreements to be entered into under this bill.
Section 6 of the bill requires that an annual
report shall be made by the minister, who in
this case is the Minister of Northern Affairs
and National Resources, and that such annual
reports shall be made to Parliament.
Honourable senators, that is all I have to
say on the bill. If there are any further
questions I shall endeavour to answer them,
but I will not promise to do so.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: I should like to ask a
question. Will the advantages of this bill to
the Maritime provinces be available to any
other province in Canada, should it request
it?

Hon. Mr. Bruni: The answer is no, because
this bill specifically provides assistance in
respect to the development of electric power
in the Atlantic provinces, and under the bill
"Atlantic provinces" is clearly defined as
Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward
Island and Newfoundland.
Someone just said "and not Manitoba"?
Hon. Mr. Haig: We don't need it.
Hon. Mr. Wall: Honourable senators, in
view of the fact that this bill is to provide
for all Atlantic provinces, would the honourable senator care to comment on the possibility that one of the provinces, namely
Newfoundland, which generates about 92 per
cent of its power now from hydro-electric
projects, and which in the near future is not
likely to develop thermal plants, will benefit from this legislation?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I can project into the
future and say that possibly industry will
develop so rapidly in Newfoundland that
within five years time they may need thermal
plants because they will not be able to
develop sufficient power by water.
Hon. Mr. McKeen: Honourable senators, I
would like to ask a question.
The Hon. the Speaker: Order. The honourable senator from Northumberland-Miramichi
(Hon. Mr. Burchill).

Hon. G. Percival Burchill: Honourabie
senators, New Brunswick has been concerned
with the question of electric power for upwards of half a century. Provincial Governments over the years have given this subject
first priority and have recognized the vital
importance of a supply of power at reasonable cost for the development of our industries. The problem has been the subject of
much study by many engineers and by the
New Brunswick Electrie Power Commission, whose chairman is a member of the provincial Government.
My colleague the honourable senator from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) in his remarks on Bill 243 on Tuesday, January 14,
touched on the early beginnings of power
development in the province and brought
honourable senators up to date on current
happenings. It is not my purpose tonight to
enlarge upon what he said but I want to refer
to a moment to some remarks made by my
honourable friend-he has gone out of the
chamber-the honourable senator from De la
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) on the motion
for the third reading of that bill.
I hope the honourable gentleman was not
serious when he questioned the justification
of New Brunswick's claim for assistance. I
know he is too wise and intelligent about

Canadian affairs not to realize that we in the
Atlantic provinces are on a different level of
economic activity as compared with the
whole of Canada.
I am not going to take up the time of this
chamber tonight by talking about Maritime
economy. Parliament is well aware of the
situation on the Atlantic seaboard. Commission after commission bas been appointedthe White Commission, the Duncan Commission, the Rowell-Sirois Commission and, re-

cently, the Gordon Commission-all of which,
after thorough investigation, made unanimous
reports to federal authorities which show
beyond any question of doubt the lower level
of earnings and income in the Maritimes and
Atlantic provinces as compared with the

Canadian level, and the resultant exodus of
our young men and women all through the
years to seek their living in other parts of

Canada and in the United States. Federal
authorities of all shades of politics are aware
of that condition and have recognized, I think,
by public statements, the claims of the
Atlantic provinces.
In 1926 the average per capita income of
people in the Atlantic region was 38 per cent
below the national average. In 1955, 30 years
after, the per capita income of the Atlantic
region was 37 per cent below the national
average for Canada.
Hon.
Mr.
improvement.

Howard:

That

was

an

JANUARY 21, 1958
Hon. Mr. Burchill: Surely I need say no
more. I wish my honourable friend from De
la Durantaye was present just now, for surely
he needs no more convincing evidence that
the Atlantic provinces have a strong case for
aid and assistance in that they lag behind the
rest of the nation and have a lower standard
of living.
In the matter of power, the average in
1955 in New Brunswick was about .26 horsepower per capita, while the average for Canada
was 1 horsepower per capita. How different,
honourable senators, might that picture have
been and how different might the story of
New Brunswick's history have been if the
plans of the Honourable Peter Veniot, Premier
of the province of New Brunswick in 1925, and
father of our distinguished colleague the
honourable senator from Gloucester (Hon. Mr.
Veniot), for the development of power had
materialized. He envisioned a great power
development at Grand Falls on the Saint John
River estimated by engineers of that day to
have a potential of 300,000 horsepower, based
on water storage facilities in the province of
Quebec and in the state of Maine. The cost
of the development was to be $10 million.
The rights to develop Grand Falls were to be
purchased from the International Paper Company for $1,250,000 and an agreement was
made with the Province of Quebec providing
water storage areas for the sum of $10,000,
which was to be paid in gold.
These plans, however, did not materialize,
because opposition developed, and the people
voted in the general election of 1925 on an
alternative plan, put forward by our friends
of the Conservative party, who at that time
induced the late Honourable J. B. M. Baxter,
then federal Minister of Customs, to come
down to New Brunswick and lead the opposition. The opposition consisted in an offer
by the International Paper Company to develop the falls themselves; to build a paper
mill in New Brunswick; reserve certain blocks
of power for the Fraser Companies to enable
them to build a pulp mill, and at the same
time provide the New Brunswick Electric
Power Commission with power needed for
general domestic use in the province. The
people voted on that proposition and accepted
it. They put the Conservatives in power, and
Mr. Veniot's plans "went down the drain".
The company went ahead with its plans and
power was developed, but instead of 300,000
horsepower the installed capacity is 80,000,
and during the winter months of low water
production drops, I believe, to 20,000 horsepower. I understand that in one instance it
went as low as 11,000 horsepower. All this,
on account of the fact that the storage
facilities on which the Premier had depended,
vanished, and private interests took over the

construction of Grand Falls. Industry in the
province of New Brunswick was therefore
obliged to turn to steam-generating plants,
and the New Brunswick Electric Power Commission, in order to take care of the demands
of domestic users, also developed coal-burning plants across the province to generate
power.
However, as the honourable senator from
Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) told us the
other day, the Saint John River, with its
potential water power sites, has been ever
since then the subject of study and examination. He has told you the story of the efforts
over the years of the McNair administration
in New Brunswick, of which he was so long
a member; of the development on the Tobique, and of their plans for storage areas
in the state of Maine through the International Joint Commission-which facilities, if
secured, would restore to our great waterway its original power potential, and more,
through the use of additional sites along the
river for multiple developments.
The result of all this is that the electric
power plan of New Brunswick is an integrated
system of thermal and hydro on a basis, for
the last few years, of about 60 per cent
thermal and 40 per cent hydro. We have
coal-burning plants at Minto, Saint John and
Chatham, producing about 132,500 horsepower, and hydro developments at Musquash,
Tobique and Beechwood-all commissionowned plants-producing 36,000 horsepower,
plus the new development at Beechwood,
which has an installed capacity of 90,000
horsepower.
In addition, there are private sources of
power for industrial plants which also sell
power to the commission when power is
available. These plants generate 113,000 horsepower from hydro and 87,000 horsepower
from thermal.
New Brunswick's normal increase in demand for power has been about 10 per cent
per annum over and in addition to that of
late years. The mining development in the
northern section of the province, if it is to
benefit the province at all, will require substantial blocks of power. The bill before us is
enabling legislation permitting the Government to make certain agreements with any
of the Atlantic provinces to produce power
by steam-generating plants and to construct
transmission lines.
As the honourable senator who introduced
the bill has told us, it also sets out to provide
a subvention on coal used in the plants. The
estimated cost of construction will be $12.7
million in the next two years, and another
$12 million to complete the program. The
Northern Canada Power Commission, acting
on behalf of the federal Government, will

SENATE

construct the plant and the transmission
lines, but the operation is to be in the hands
of the provincial hydro-electric commissions,
and the plant and lines, when completed, will
be purchased by the provinces, which will be
given,-as was stated, I understand, by a
member of the Government in the other
house-a term of 60 years to pay for them.
The original legislation proposed by the
late administration was different in that the
plan covered by that legislation was designed
to permit the Northern Canada Power Commission to operate these plants and sell the
power to the commission, but under the
present plan the operation is in the hands of
the provincial commissions, who will own
the plants. From reading the debates in the
other house I understand that the reason
for the change is that the provincial Governments and the hydro commissions want the
project to bc set up that way. They desire
to hold and operate their plants. If that is
the case, why should I object?
As a representative of the province of
New Brunswick, I support this bill. Evidently
its terms are satisfactory to the present New
Brunswick Electric Power Commission. I
know something of the work of the commission and of the job they have done over the
years in our province. Being interested in
the telephone business, I have some knowledge of the difficulties and problems which
any transmission body, be it power or communication, experiences in operating in our
province, with its few large centres of population and its wide-open unoccupied areas over
which lines have to be carried.
For that reason I know something of the
cost and the hazards; and I welcome this
legislation as being helpful to New Brunswick and to those of us who are interested
in providing industry for our people there.
Hon. Wishar± McL. Robertson: This legisla-

tion, honourable senators, is most welcome,
has interesting possibilities and is most
timely. As honourable senators know, it is
intended to assist in the industrial development of the Atlantic provinces by the provision of cheaper power.
When this proposal was first mooted, a year
or so ago, I was not impressed. That it would
be of some assistance to existing industries
goes without saying. On the other hand, as
long as the fiscal and trade policies of Canada
remain substantially as they are now, and
as they have been for as long as I can remember, it would take more than a reduction
in power costs to make any material difference. In a Canada that sought to be selfcontained industrially, the simple truth is
that Nova Scotia is too far from the centres of
population to attract industry seeking only to

serve the Canadian market. Despite various
efforts to make water flow uphill, disappointments have followed disappointments. Problems of distance and transportation have
provided insurmountable barriers, and the
proof of it bas been that during the past
ten years while new industries and capital
in untold billions have been flowing into
Canada they have largely passed us by. The
number of new industries establishing in
Nova Scotia could be counted on the fingers
of one hand; nor under existing circumstances
is there a much brighter prospect for the
future. There is growing evidence that as a
result of the boom conditions of recent years
the establishment of secondary industries in
Canada has been overdone. The Gordon Report says that as a result of corporate rivalries in the United States, a more rapid expansion of the manufacturing facilities of
subsidiaries has taken place than the size
of the Canadian market would warrant. Already some of them are camping on the
Government's doorstep, seeking increased
tariff protection to maintain their very
existence.
But from now on, honourable senators, the
situation may be
quite different. The
rapidly changing conditions as respects
international trade are such that I believe
the possibility is that in the not far
distant future Canada and Great Britain will
have entered into a trade agreement to gradually remove the trade barriers between the
two countries. As this develops, Nova Scotia
will gradually move from a position geographically on the fringe of a trading area of
17 million people into the very centre of one
of 70 million. Halifax is about equidistant
from Vancouver and London. Both of the
major political parties in Canada have agreed
to give the British proposals careful consideration, and on reflection I believe they
will decide that our need of markets is such
that these proposals cannot be turned down.
I need hardly remind the bouse how
strategically placed Nova Scotia is, under a
trade arrangement such as this, to attract
British industry interested in both the
Canadian and expert markets. Its ports are
ice-free the year around; they are near the
great trade routes of the north and south
Atlantic; we have coal, and vast deposits of
iron ore immediately adjacent. Already there
are evidences that these potential advantages
are being appreciated. British capital has
recently acquired the controlling interest in
DOSCO, our huge steel and coal corporation.
The Atlantic provinces have recently decided
to appoint jointly a representative in London
to point out the great advantages of the
Atlantic provinces for British capital. I

JANUARY 21, 1958
repeat, this legislation is most timely and
all that is needed now is larger quantities of
cheap power.
However, there still remains one feature,
the question of supplying the cheapest possible power, that may or may not have
escaped the notice of the Government. In
case it has I would like to draw it to the
attention of the Leader of the Government
in this house (Hon. Mr. Haig). The Prime
Minister in announcing these power projects
stated that the basis of paying subventions
on coal used to produce energy is to equalize
the cost as between the producer in the
Atlantic provinces and those in Ontario.
This basis of equalizing the cost of power
as between the two areas seems reasonable,
but under existing circumstances there is
another factor that materially increases the
price to the user in Nova Scotia at least, as
compared with Ontario. In Ontario the price
to the user does not include any element of
corporation tax paid to the federal Government, whereas in Nova Scotia it does, for
two-thirds of the power generated and distributed there is done by corporations.
I do not know the exact figures, but it is
my guess that the federal Government is currently collecting from these corporations an
amount of upwards of $1 million a year,
which of course must be passed on to the
users. It is true that as partial compensation
the federal Government is rebating half of
this amount to the Government of Nova
Scotia, but these amounts are simply taken
into the consolidated fund of the province
and form no relief whatever to the consumer
in the way of lower rates.
My proposal is that the federal Government increase the rebate from 50 per cent
to 100 per cent in order to place us on the
same basis as Ontario, but on condition that
the province not only pass it back to the
corporations concerned but see to it the ratemaking authorities take it into consideration
in making the rates.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
senator permit me a question?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Yes, certainly.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would you not have to
limit, then, the profits of these private companies that are producing power? Would
they not have to be limited as to what they
are making now? Otherwise, the companies themselves might derive quite a benefit
that would not be passed on to the people
who purchase the power.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: These matters are
controlled by the Public Utilities Board. All

I know is that the federal Government coliected $1 million from the users of electricity.
This money does not come out of the air.
It comes from the users. What I am suggesting is that the amount of rebate of 50 per
cent be increased to 100 per cent, that it not
go into the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the
province but go back to the corporations from
which it originally came, and that the ratemaking authorities see to it that ultimately
the users get the benefit.
Hon. Mr. Bouffard: In Nova Scotia is the
rate paid by consumers on electric power
produced by private companies différent from
that paid on electric power produced by
public utilities?
Hon. Mr. Robertson: We have a very convenient arrangement in Nova Scotia, at least
it is convenient to some. All of the power
in the larger areas, what are called the more
profitable areas, is distributed by private corporations, and the Nova Scotia Power Commission distributes power only to the outlying regions. I do not think you could draw
any comparison.
May I point out to my honourable friend
the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that unless this is done his Government will be in a most awkward position.
The subventions that they contemplate paying, I would think, from the figures my
honourable friend (Hon. Mr. Brunt) gave,
are in order of $1 million, as far as Nova
Scotia is concerned. If with one hand they
pay these subventions to reduce costs, but
with the other hand take $1 million in corporation income tax out of the pocket of
the users, they will be in the position of an
"Indian giver". I confidently hope they will
see the point and make the necessary arrangements. This legislation bas great possibilities,
and as far as I am concerned, the sooner it
becomes law the better.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor: Honourable senators, I do not intend to take up very much
time to discuss this matter in detail now. I
think it will be remembered that I discussed briefly some aspects of it a few days
ago when the other bill was before us. However, I would like at this time to make one
or two general observations, and also to ask
a few questions of the sponsor of the bill.
First of all, may I say that I am in favour
of the proposed legislation, but I regret that,
like the earlier proposal by the former Government of Canada, the development of hydro
projects is not included in this program. I
regret it exceedingly, because in our province
we have on the Saint John River a great
potential of power that bas not been developed. For instance, down the river below

SENATE
Grand Falls, we have the Morrell, Beechwood,
and Hawkshaw sites with close to a halfmillion horsepower, at an estimated cost of
approximately $50 million. While it is true
that at the present time the full potential of
those three sites cannot be utilized by reason
of the fact that no substantial storage is
provided above Grand Falls, I recognize the
difficulty, or perhaps the impossibility, of
developing adequate storage at the present
time. I am referring to the province of
Quebec, the state of Maine, and the interprovincial waters. Sooner or later-and it
may be sooner than we expect-there is a
possibility of a development on a branch of
the Saint John River in Maine on the site
known as Rankin Rapids where the dam
itself can provide a million acre feet of
storage. With that provision, and with the
other three sites I have mentioned, cheap
power could be produced. For that reason I
regret very much that hydro is not included in
this program. I am not criticizing this Government any more than the former Government,
because the same provision was made in the
proposal of the former Government, but I
hope that, if not during this session, then
probably during a subsequent session, provision may be made for the extension of this
offer and that hydro may be included.
There is one aspect of this proposal in the
bill before us which I think is superior to
the former one, that is the provision for coal
subventions. I think that is an improvement,
and I congratulate the government and the
sponsor of the bill in relation thereto. However, the sponsor of the bill indicated that
this was not going to cost the Government of
Canada a cent.
May I repeat that I regret very much that
the terms of this loan, and the Beechwood
loan as well, will be based on the rate of
interest of the borrowings of the Government of Canada.
I think honourable senators will agree
with me, as I indicated, I believe, a few days
ago, that the three engineering bodies that
gave a complete study of the Saint John
River potentialities, namely, the Shawinigan
Engineering Company, the H. G. Acres Company, and the Power Corporation of Canada,
estimated the Beechwood project on the run
of the river basis, as follows: If money could
be secured at 5 per cent interest, even on the
run-of-the-river basis, the cost of power per
kilowatt hour is estimated at 6.92 mills. If
the money could be secured at 2 per cent
interest the cost would be reduced to 4.76
mills. If interest-free money was available,
the cost would be only 2.61 mills. These
costs are based on power delivered to load
centres.

That is just one reason why I do not agree
that this is quite as favourable a proposal as
that of the former government, in that the
Province of New Brunswick must pay the
entire cost of all of the development, plus
interest charges. Under the former proposal,
as I understand it, the Northern Power Commission of Canada would operate these plants,
build the transmission lines, and build the
plants and operate them at cost to the province; they would sell to the province at any
time on a depreciated basis, which means that
if the province was not in a position financially to start paying the loan or paying the
cost of these power developments they might
buy the power. The former Government of
New Brunswick tried to negotiate with the
Province of Quebec to buy power, and I do
not sec that any autonomy was taken away
from the province. If you buy power from
Quebec or from the Commission, I do not
think this proposal is quite as good as the
other. However, to me the bill has possibilities, and I am hopeful that in years to come,
in the not too distant future, amendments
might be made to provide for the things I
have mentioned.
There are one or two questions I should
like to ask. First of all, is there any limit to
the amount of money that will be spent on
these projects in the Atlantic provinces?
Secondly, what will be the cost to the provinces when they begin to pay, and on what
terms will they have to meet the payments?
I understand that the operation of the coal
subsidy will be negotiated as between the
bodies in the Atlantic areas and the federal
Government by the Dominion Coal Board,
and that the power development itself, or the
project, will be handled by the Northern
Power Commission. With this arrangement I
heartily agree.
Again, honourable senators, I say that I
regret exceedingly that hydro developments
have not been included in the bill, and I do
not want it to be thought that I am saying
this because I was a member of a provincial
Government for so many years. The hydro
power possibilities of the Saint John river
have been very close to my heart for a great
number of years. If storage is provided there
are great power potentialities, and cheaper
power will be available.
Hon. Mr. Howard: And it would save
subsidies.
Hon. Mr. Taylor: According to the Montreal
Engineering Company's report, if there is
interconnection between New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia the cost through these thermal
plants will be slightly cheaper than if each
province goes on its own. May I ask a question on this point? Is there a possibility of

JANUARY 21, 1958

arrangements being made for the interconnection of the two systems in the province of
New Brunswick and the province of Nova
Scotia? If negotiations have not been carried
out in this respect, I think every effort should
be made to do so, because it will mean
cheaper power for both provinces.
Honourable senators, I do not intend to
speak further on the bill at this time. There
are some other questions which I should like
to ask, but I realize the honourable senator
who sponsored the bill cannot answer them
all. He bas had a good many thrown at him
tonight. I shall ask my questions in
committee.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators, I shall be very brief in my remarks
because the honourable senator from Shelburne (Hon. Mr. Robertson) has placed the
position of Nova Scotia very fairly before us.
As he and the senators from New Brunswick
who spoke said, we in the Maritimes are in
accord with the thought back of this bill,
and naturally we intend to support it.
I am glad to hear that the sponsor of the
bill intends to refer it to a committee, because we had a very good discussion on a
previous bill the subject-matter of which was
closely associated with this one. No doubt this
bill also will be referred to the Banking and
Commerce Committee. If that is so, I would
like to ask whether the sponsor intends to
have a public hearing and to call expert
witnesses. This is a very important piece of
legislation, by reason of the benefits which
I hope will accrue from it with respect to
coal subventions. As you know, Nova Scotia
produces coal, and we in that province want
to make the best possible use of that product.
I can quite understand that the senator
from Northumberland-Miramichi (Hon. Mr.
Burchill) is strongly in favour of the bill,
because it means for his province an expenditure of $17.8 million for construction, as
compared with $6.9 million in the province
of Nova Scotia. I asked the question earlier
as to how those figures were arrived at, and
I shall ask the question again in committee.
I am wondering whether that total amount
will be necessary.
T was particularly pleased to learn that
this measure does not only make provision
for power commission projects, but that its
benefits will be extended to private companies which to a large extent supply power
to the important centres of Nova Scotia. I
have been assured that the bill will treat the
private companies on the same footing as
the provincial power commission.
I may have something further to say in
committee and on the motion for third reading of the bill. In the meantime perhaps the

sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Brunt) would
assure me that he proposes to have a public
hearing in connection with the consideration
of this bill so that experts will be on hand
to give their opinions on it. My honourable
friend shakes his head. If he is not going
to have experts called to express opinions,
then perhaps he would be good enough to
table before the committee meeting the
report made by the Montreal Engineering
Company, so that we could study it and be
in a position to ask intelligent questions
when the bill is in committee.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Honourable senators,The Hon. the Speaker: I must remind honourable senators that if the honourable
senator from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt),
the sponsor of this bill, speaks again, it will
have the effect of closing the debate.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Mr. Speaker, I have
simply asked a question in connection with
the functioning of the committee. Would
my honourable friend be good enough to
answer it?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If any other senator
desires to speak on the bill, I have no desire
to close the debate at this time. But with
respect to the question of referring the bill
to a committee, I will propose that it be
referred to the Standing Committee on
Banking and Commerce, where we will have
a hearing similar to the one we had on the
Beechwood Power Project bill. I think in
that way we can accomplish what is necessary, and I see no necessity for having a
public hearing. The Government is most
anxious to get the bill through Parliament
and into operation.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: When the Beechwood bill
was considered we had only the Minister of
Finance before the committee. On a bill as
important as this one, we should hear from
someone who knows about power.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I am quite willing to
advise the minister that he should bring
with him whatever experts are available to
give information with respect to this bill.
Hon. Mr. Emerson: The minister concerned
with this bill would be the Minister of
Northern Affairs and National Resources,
not the Minister of Finance.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Yes, he is the minister
concerned with this bill. The Minister of
Finance apeared in respect to the Beechwood
Power Project Bill.
Hon. Jean-François Poulioi: Honourable
senators, the purpose of this bill is to empower the Government to give some subsidies to the eastern provinces. I am not

SENATE
now expressing an opinion on the bill; I shall
wait until we are before the committee and
we have a little more information about it.
But I do not see what help the experts can
be in this matter, because it is not a question
of technical information; it is simply a question of giving money. All the applications
made by the four eastern provinces were for
subsidies. The Government seems ready to
pay certain sums of money to each province
to help them carry on the undertakings.
Hon. Mr. Isnor: It is very much broader
than that. The coal subsidies are estimated
at $1,700,000, while the expenditures in connection with this development for the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia
would amount to $24.7 million.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Well, it is more important, and we must go much deeper into
our study of the legislation. I am pleased
that my honourable friend has been so outspoken and sincere in expressing his views.
I did not ask him the question but, like a
mind reader, he realized what I had in mind
and what I wanted to know. Certainly $20
million odd is much more than $1,700,000.
I do not criticize the help that is given any
province, but here again it could be done
without the expenditure of one cent from
the Government at Ottawa. If the taxation
powers of the Maritime provinces were restored they would then have the right to impose their own taxation.
My honourable friend from the Maritime
provinces will remember that some 20 years
ago I opposed gift legislation. I mean by
that, that the expenditures made by each
Government should come from taxes collected
by that Government. I find that the policy
of granting to the provinces moneys that
have been collected by the Government of
Canada is bad, because all the odium of
taxing is a burden to the Parliament of Canada, and to senators and members of the
House of Commons as well.
In this respect the very eloquent address
recently made by the honourable senator
from Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar) was illuminating. He expounded the problem so
weil that I shall not pursue it further. I
must tell honourable senators that I am open
minded with respect to assistance given to
the sister provinces, to all of them. But there
is a certain way of accomplishing the same
end which would be more beneficial to the
provinces themselves and would not be so
exacting for the Canadian Parliament.
Hon. Mr. Moneite: Honourable senators, my
understanding of the bill is that it provides
for temporary assistance to the Atlantic provinces, at the minimum possible cost, but they

will have to refund the money advanced to
them. So the money will not be definitely
granted to the provinces, and therefore the
bill does not establish any principle of federal
Government or Parliamentary interference in
the rights of the provinces.
Hon. Mr. Howard: Question.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time.
REFERRED TO COMMITTEE
On motion of Hon. Mr. Brunt, the bill was

referred to the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce.

HON. MR. ASELTINE
FELICITATIONS ON RETURN TO SENATE
CHAMBER

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. Cyrille Vaillancouri: Honourable senators, before the orders of the day are called,
may we extend to our good friend the honourable senator from Rosetown (Hon. Mr. Aseltine) a very hearty welcome on his return
to our midst, and say that we are happy
indeed to see him again in good health.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: For some weeks
past we were very sorry not to see you in
your accustomed place and we worried about
you. We are delighted by your return. We
hope that you have fully recovered from your
illness and that you will long be here to
work with us in the same spirit as in the past.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
Hon. W. M. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I appreciate very much the kind welcoming
remarks of the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Vaillancourt). I know he is
most sincere in his remarks, as were the
many members of this chamber who have
greeted me since I came back to Ottawa yesterday. I appreciate the fact that I was
probably missed a little bit, and I hope ta be
able from now on to resume my place in this
chamber and do my part.
I may tell honourable senators that I did
not know about the contents of the cablegrams that were sent from India about my
health until I saw them for the first time last
Sunday night. I do not wonder that my

friends were worried about my illness; indeed, when I read the reports I almost had
a relapse.
Let me say also that I was mighty glad ta
step off the plane in Montreal the day before
Christmas. I was reminded of the poem in
the old Ontario school reader about love for
one's native land:
Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land!
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd
As home his footsteps he hath turn'd,
From wandering on a foreign strand?

I repeat, I was mighty glad te be back.

I want ta say this also ta honourable senators. We people in Canada think we have all
kind of troubles, trials and tribulations, and
we complain about this and that, but you
only have ta go ta the countries which I
visited and learn of their problems to came te
the conclusion that our troubles do not
amount ta anything at all. You will return
ta thank God that you live in a place like
Canada.
Hon. Senators: Hear, hear.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: I move that the house
adjourn.
Hon. Mr. Vaillancouri: Will the honourable
Leader of the Government state what is the
work for tomorrow?
Hon. Mr. Haig: To tell you the truth, I do
not know. I think the house should sit because certain committees are ta meet tomorrow morning. I understand that the Banking
and Commerce Committee will not be able
ta meet before Thursday, so the Senate will
have ta sit on that day. The leader in the
other place said he thought that more bills
will be passed tomorrow, but as ta this I am
not sure; however, I shall give the house
notice as soon as I cari. There may be legislation before us tomorrow, and almost certainly there will be on Thursday, but that
depends on the progress made in the House
of Commons, as ta which the judgment of
other members is as good as mine, and
perhaps better.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: I should tell the honourable Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Haig) that the Banking and Commerce Committee will try ta convene tomorrow morning
ta consider the bill which has just been
referred ta it.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at

ATLANTIC PROVINCES POWER DEVELOPMENT BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Arthur L. Beaubien, for Hon. Mr.
Hayden, Chairman of the Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented
the report of the Committee on Bill 244.
The report was read by the Clerk as
f ollows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the Bill (244)
intituled: "An Act to provide assistance in respect
of Electric Power Development in the Atlantic
Provinces", have in obedience to the order of
reference of January 21, 1958, examined the said
bill, and now report the same without any
amendment.

The report was adopted.
THIRD READING

Hon. William R. Brun±: Honourable senators, I move that the bill be read the third
time.
Hon. A. B. Baird: Honourable senators,
before the bill is read the third time I would
like to say a few words regarding it.
We in Newfoundland, unfortunately, have
no coal. A few years ago we thought there
was a potential at South River, close to Port
aux Basques. Honourable senators all know
Port aux Basques: it is a place very close to
North Sydney. A great deal of money has

been spent on it.
named the William Carson which we are still
unable to make use of there. While we do
not have coal, we have a water power potential at Grand Falls, on the Hamilton River,
and we hope that in the near future that
With such a
potential will be developed.
development we would hope to be able to
sell power as far west as Montreal, as well
as supplying it to Newfoundland and undoubtedly to New Brunswick and Nova
Scotia.
The provinces of New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia are very fortunate in having
coal. This bill indicates that they are mighty
good salesmen, and they have made a good
sale of their present and future coal potential.
I am in favour of the bill, but I would not
like to think that Newfoundland, with its
immense water-power resources, would be
the only province that did not benefit from

the measure. Undoubtedly we shall be heard
from later on. As the minister outlined at
the committee meeting this morning, he had
had an inquiry from the Premier of Newfoundland, who was anxious to know if the
proposed scheme included hydro power, to
which the minister replied that it did; in fact,
he said the development of hydro power
would be given consideration.
I hope that
eventually the Newfoundland Government
will avail itself of the opportunity presented
by the bill.
As I have stated, honourable senators, I
am in favour of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I would like to ask
the honourable senator a question before
he sits down. Can he tell us if the province
of Newfoundland has not sold or given away
to a large company the rights to develop the
Grand Falls on the Hamilton River?
Hon. Mr. Baird: Yes, that is so, but to
what extent they have been given I do not
know. I presume that these rights will still
be beneficial to Newfoundland when power
is developed.
Hcn. Mr. Aseltine: How could you expect
the Parliament of Canada to give to this
private company moncy to develop those
resources there?
Hon. Mr. Baird: That is being done in the
other provinces.
Hon. David A. Croll: Honourable senators.
I listened to the speech made yesterday by
the honourable senator for Shelburne (Hon.
Mr. Robertson), but did not get the full
import of what he said until I read the
speech in Hansard. As a result a question
comes to my mind which I would like to
raise at this time.
I quote the honourable senator from
yesterday's Hansard, at page 503:
The Prime Minister in announeing these power
proicets stated that the basis of paying subventions en coal used to produce energy is to equalize
the cost as between the producer in the Atlantic
provinces and those in Ontario.

A little farther on he said:
In Ontario the price to the user does net
include any element of corporation tax paid to
the federal Government, whereas in Nova Scotia it
dees, for two-thirds of the power generated and
distributed there is done by corporations.

I continue to quote:
I do not know the exact figures, but it is my
guess that the federal Government is eurrently
collecting from these corporations an amount of
upwards of $1 million a year, which of course must
be passed on to the users.

Now, a final quote:
My proposal is that the federal Government
increase the rebate from 50 per cent to 100 per
cent in order to place us on the same basis as

JANUARY 22, 1958
Ontario, but on condition that the province not
only pass it back to the corporations concerned but
see to it that the rate-making authorities take it
into consideration in making the rates.

Then:
Hon. Mr. Isnor: Ilear, hear.
What then occurred to me,-although, as
I was not sure it was a proper question, I
did not ask it,-was this: When the honourable gentleman was asking for this subvention, did he give consideration to the obvious
and assured remedy for existing conditions,
namely, public ownership?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: I recognize the force
of the honourable gentleman's observation,
but I have no intention at this stage of being
drawn into an argument about it.
Hon. Paul H. Bouffard: Honourable senators, I do not intend to speak at length, but
I want to state that I am very muci in
favour of the bill. This morning a discussion
took place in the committee on clause 6 of
the bill, and it nearly happened that an
amendment was moved to provide that any
agreements made between the federal Government and any of the Atlantic provinces

the opportunity to be present. I think we
came away from the meeting reasonably well
satisfied, but there is no verbatim report of
the proceedings and honourable senators who
did not attend are deprived of the information
that the rest of us received. True, there bas
been a little debate on the bill here this afternoon, but in my opinion the discussion that
took place in committee this morning was very
important and pertinent, especially to the
principle of the bill, and I am indeed sorry
there is no record to which honourable
senators might refer in the future.
Now I come to the point that I want to

make. It frequently happens that after a
bill is introduced and read the first time in
the Senate it is-just as was the bill before
us-given second reading on the sarne day and

then referred to a committee-say, the Banking and Commerce Committee or the Committee on Natural Resources. The bill may
have to do with something about which many
honourable senators know very little, but
members of the committee are then in a
position to obtain information on all the details
of the bill and so can ask intelligent questions
about it. I believe a verbatim report should
be made of these committee meetings, so that
would be produced in Parliament, not merely every honourable senator may know exactly

or two of his senior officials were there and apparent as we examine the policy context

information about the bill. I am not a member which this bill has been designed to meet.
There is a linear relationship between this
of the committee, but as no other committees
of which I am a member were sitting I took policy context and the bill as we have it, but

SENATE
I submit that this relationship is limited and
it will not benefit all Atlantic provinces
equally.
I wish to explain briefly what this policy
context is. In the Throne Speech the present
Government stated:
My ministers believe that a national development policy carried out in co-operation with the
provinces, and in the territories, is needed to
enable all regions of Canada to share in the
benefits to be realized in developing the resources
of this great nation.

On November 14, 1957, the Prime Minister
made in the other house an official Government policy pronouncement respecting this
national development policy in regard to the
power situation in general, and in particular
the attitude of this Government toward the
situation in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. As I understand it, the policy of the
Government subscribes to the concept that
national financial resources should be utilized
in a general national development plan to
ensure proper, adequate and orderly development of our natural resources in all provinces of Canada, and that action be takenI quote from the Commons Hansard, page
1101:
to improve the economic well-being of those
parts of Canada which, through no fault of their
own, have not fully shared in the economic growth
of this country in recent years.
The Atlantic
provinces are among these areas.

One of the factors which have retarded
this economic growth has been insufficient
power for industrial use in adequate quantity and at low price. The Prime Minister
went on to say, as reported on page 1101:
It seems only fair and equitable that the Government of Canada should take measures to assist
in meeting this basic requirement of the Maritime
provinces for industrial growth, particularly since
it is possible to do so on a basis that is largely
self-financing and self-liquidating.

The statement goes on to develop the actual
projects that are going to be undertaken. I
will not enter into them.
This morning the minister's explanations to
the Standing Committee were very welcomc
indeed, and we had a very profitable discussion of the bill's basic principles and its
probable future specific applications. We were
pleased to note that this general enabling
legislation-I want to stress the words "general enabling legislation"was extended to
include all four Atlantic provinces, that is,
the larger logical concept of potential future
developmental needs in this whole region
prevailed. In other words, the intention of
this bill is to try to give to this whole area
of Canada cheaper power in adequate quantity to attract industrial development.
This larger concept looks toward probable
developments of nuclear power projects which,

because they will be of a thermal character,
will be an integral part of this enabling
legislation. But, as this legislation now stands,
and because its definition of power projects is
delimited to thermal projects, it may not in
fact do what its title suggests. The title reads:
"An Act to provide assistance in respect of
electric power"-it does not say what kind of
electric power-"development in the Atlantic
Provinces". Then the explanatory note says:
The purpose of this bill is te assist in making
available in the Atlantic provinces electric power
for industrial purposes in a suitable quantity and
at lower cost.

I regret that it does leave me with the
conviction that, as general enabling legislation whose stated purpose is to give a broad
framework for new power development policy
in the whole Atlantic region, it does not go
far enough, because it leaves out hydro development projects, which also are very expensive to build for these Atlantic provinces,
and which also can be used to provide electric
power for industrial purposes in a suitable
quantity and at lower cost. Its likely effective
effect does seem to be that no effective assistance can in fact be given to at least one of
these Atlantic
provinces,
Newfoundland,
whose foreseeable future power projects are
likely to be in the hydro-electric fleld. In
this sense, because of this exclusion of hydro
projects in the definition of "power project",
there is a danger that the bill will discrirninate, in a relative and comparative sense,
against this particular province, which wili
not be in a position to avail itself of the
kind of national financial help being provided.
I want to make myself perfectly clear. I
accept the principle of this bill, and I support
its provisions as far as they go, but because
the bill is of a general, long-range enabling
legislation nature to meet the general policy
context which I have briefly indicated, I regret
that it does not, in my opinion, complete
effectively the linear relationship which I had
previously mentioned.
Hon. Gordon B. Isnor: Honourable senators,
just a word in support of the point raised by
the honourable senator from Westmorland
(Hon. Mr. Taylor). I made a motion in committee in support of his contention, because I
felt that this bill was so important that we
should have a record of the committee's
proceedings. That is why I bring up the question again. Unfortunately, perhaps in its wisdom, the committee decided otherwise, on a
recorded vote. I think that in future whenever an important bill is sent to a committee
we should have a verbatim report of the committee's proceedings. In the other house, as
also in this house when we are in doubt,

96702-33

On the Orders of the Day:
Hon. William M. Wall: Mr. Speaker, with the
consent of honourable senators I would like
to bring to the attention of this house the
fact that today, January 22, marks the
fortieth anniversary of a signal event in the
glorious and tragic history of the Ukrainian
people, an event which is celebrated by freedom-loving and politically free Ukrainian
people throughout the world. For on January 22, 1918, there was issued by the Government of the Ukrainian National Republic a
declaration, somewhat akin to the American
Declaration of Independence, which stated:
As of today the Ukrainian National Republic
becomes the independent, free, and sovereign state
of the Ukrainian people.

I believe that the Ukrainian Canadians
living in Canada would have me stress how
vitally important it is that the peoples of
the free world know the historical record of
the momentous events which preceded and
followed this Ukrainian declaration of
sovereignty and independence, so that the
true hopes and aspirations of those submerged peoples be not glossed over or sublimated by, shall we say, incomplete and
misleading communist propaganda.

Honourable senators, it does not require extensive documentation to show that the
present "Ukrainian Soviet Government" in
Kiev is not what we understand by the
words "national republic", because its constitutional competencies and practical governmental acts prove it to be really a provincial
colony within the U.S.S.R. Nor does it require much imagination to realize that Soviet
authorities fear the continuing internal and
external challenge to further liberalization of
their form of minority and colonial government. The dynamics of the existing national
liberation ideals-before which Moscow's
centralism is on a continuing defensive-can
be assessed in the light of the recent announcements of the Praesidium of the Soviet
Communist Party of further measures of
decentralization, the granting of more powers
to the national republics of the U.S.S.R., and
repeated declarations about their ostensible
sovereignty. For the forces of democratic

honourable senator is required to ask for the
consent of the house.

CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION REPORT

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I have the honour to inform the Senate that
I have received a report from the Civil
Service Commission.
The report was read by the Clerk as
follows:
To the Honourable the members of the Houses of
Parliament.
The Civil Service Commission, in accordance
with the provisions of sections 11 and 62 of the
Civil Service Act, is pleased to join with the
Library of Parliament in recommending the following change in compensation, effective January
1, 1958:-

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Dispense.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this report be taken inta
consideration?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Next sitting.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Let us hear the figures now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It occurs to me that
if consideration of this report stands until
tomorrow we will at that time have the full
text of the report in our records and can
study it. However, if any honourable senator
wishes to hear the figures read at this time,
I have no objection.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Let us hear them now.

The motion was agreed to.

for the stabilization of the prices of agricultural commodities.
The bill was read the first time.
SECOND READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the second
time?
Hon. Arthur M. Pearson: Honourable
senators, I move the second reading now.
Tonight I have the privilege of sponsoring
a bill which in the opinion of the Government will be a great help to the farmers.
This Canada of ours has made tremendous
strides in the past 50 or 60 years, and the
great developments in any line, whether mining, forestry, building, manufacturing, or
farming, tie in each with the other, for all of
them -are branches of our way of life. In the
past 10 years we have gone ahead at a rate
undreamed of in history. But in making this
great advance we are in many ways leaving
agriculture behind, especially in so far as
prices are concerned. This to my mind is
a very serious situation and we cannot allow
it to continue too long. Agriculture must
receive its fair share of the national income
or it will become very inefficient and, in the
end, there will not be food enough for all
in our own country. No one yet has found
a way to eat refrigerators or cars or tractors,
and so we must bring our farm economy up
to the same level as the rest of our economy.
The imbalance of any one line of activity in
our dominion will eventually adversely affect
all other activities. For that reason the
present Government bas introduced Bill 237.
Honourable senators, before explaining the
bill I want to point out some of the
problems which continue to beset agriculture.
In 1955, at a conference of agricultural
economists held in Helsinki, Finland, Mr.
J. E. Bellerby, of the Agricultural Economics
Research Institute of the United Kingdom,
had this to say, in part:
In the exchange between agriculture and industry, the income received by agriculture has been
relatively low per head at all times except during war and periods of scarcity caused by war.

In other words, all through Europe and in
North America agriculture bas more or less
been dragging behind other activities. Is
that not just what has been taking place here
in Canada? Honourable senators, if you
have not been too engrossed with your work
here in this city or in the cities from which
AGRICULTURAL STABILIZATION BILL you come, you have seen that happen in all
parts of Canada. But, honourable senators,
FIRST READING
the Senate this disparity of income bas become much

SENATE

that has taken place in industry. Labour,
through its unions, has been able to keep up
with the industrial expansion and get a fair
share of the wealth created. This, however,
has left the farmer in the very awkward
situation of having his implements of production leap up in price, in keeping with the
products of other industries, since those who
manufacture farm equipment must receive
an equal share of the wealth with other
labourers.
So, honourable senators, we see two main
things confronting the farmer in Canada.
One is that his cost of production is high.
Some of the items entering into the cost of
production are the farmer's implements,
repairs, farm fuel, oil, freight rates and
taxes. The second main item is farm labour.
It is getting more difficult to hire and keep
a man for work on a farm where there necessarily have to be irregular and long hours.
This is due to stiff competition for labour by
industry, where the hours of work are
shorter and where there usually are better
living conditions
and greater security
through pensions, unemployment insurance,
etc.
People who process or handle farm commodities are living in this age of high economy and necessarily are receiving a high
wage comparable to that of other wage earners. They live at a very much higher
standard than they did ten or fifteen years
ago, and so they buy the primary products
from the farm as cheaply as possible and
then have to raise the prices before they
reach the consumer, so that they can keep
up with the rest of our people whose standard of living is high. On the farm you get
a slow expansion of agricultural products,
but when industry starts to expand it does
so rapidly. The same pertains to prices.
Prices of agricultural products are slow in
rising, but the prices of industrial products
rise fast. Then the same thing happens in
reverse. Industry can contract rapidly-for
instance, it can close down or reduce the
output of paper mills, mines, and so on,
and thus prevent a surplus from being built
up; but agriculture, having expanded, finds
it very hard to slow down, and continues to
build up an unwieldy surplus, as may be
witnessed in western Canada's present wheat
situation.
In western Canada, in the great cereal
growing areas, a great transition is taking
place today; the western farmer is overcoming the handicap of the hired man by
mechanization, and is purchasing larger and
fewer types of machinery. Depending on the
size of the machinery and the kind of work
he is engaged in, a farmer today can usually

handle 50 acres per day alone. As in business, so in farming in western Canada, the
man who hustles and plans at the same time
has been able to make a success of farming.
One man of this type who gets out early in
the morning and hustles can handle between
800 and 1,200 acres of land in a season. That
may sound a little exaggerated, but it is
being done in western Canada today. Of
course, be has to put in long hours, and bas
to be a good manager as well as a mechanic.
Over the years he has bought more land from
the smaller farmer who for a variety of
reasons bas had to sell out. By and large,
the farmer in western Canada is making
progress, and, like people in all lines of
business, be is adjusting himself to the new
conditions. He has two main problems now:
first, markets; secondly, a price spread in the
other products besides cereal grains. This
has all been taking place in the area designated as the "Canadian Wheat Board Act
area".
Where a farmer must use a more intensive
type of cultivation, due to topography, type
of soil or cost of land, or the kind of products
to be raised, he must have more modern
machinery. In fact, he has to become as
nearly mechanized as possible to overcome
the difficulty of having to hire help. A hired
man needs much higher wages than formerly,
but in most cases the farmer's sale price for
his products is not sufficient to enable him
to offer the same wages and living conditions that a man can get from industry, nor
to enable him to modernize his farm operations where be is farming a small acreage.
The farmer must now use a great deal of
fertilizer as his land gets older, and especially
in cases where the fertility of soil is running
out.
The farmer over the whole country is much
alive to his needs. He knows be has to pay
more for his land, more for machinery to
modernize his farm, more for his help, more
to keep up the fertility of his soil, and finally
be needs more markets and better prices for
his commodities, if be is to survive.
Now, in Bill 237 the present Government
is taking steps to clear away some of the
farmer's difficulties. Let me emphasize the
word "some", because this bill does not pretend to cure all the farmer's troubles; it is,
however, a further step forward and a very
good step, in farm legislation.
This bill supersedes the Agricultural Prices
Support Act of 1944, which was a first step
in this type of legislation and probably
served its purpose. At the same time, most
people could see that there were a number
of weaknesses in the old Agricultural Prices
Support Act, which weaknesses Bill 237 will
attempt to overcome.

JANUARY 28, 1958
Honourable senators, I would like to give
you some figures set up by the Canadian
Federation of Agriculture in a brief submitted by them on March 5, 1956, to the
Royal Commission on Canada's Economie
Prospects. This has to do with the estimated
total consumer expenditure for Canadian
produced-food and the estimated total cash
received by the farmer for this food. The
information I have gives the total consumer
expenditure for four years, but does not include expenditures for fish. It is as follows:

Year

1,495

3,066
1,533
50

From that table honourable senators can

see that the farmer's share of the consumer
dollar is getting less as the years go by. I
understand it is now down to about 49 per
cent.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask my friend a
question? Who received the difference between the 50 per cent and the 100 per cent
of the consumer's dollar?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: It would be received by
the distributors all the way along the line
from the farm until the products were placed
on the retailers' shelves.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Can you give the percentages?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: No. These figures are
comparable to similar data prepared in the
United States;.and, while they are not absolutely accurate, the trend is exactly the same
in that country as it is in Canada.
This tendency shows a continuing lessening of the share of the consumer dollar going
to the primary producer. That is why the
present Government, in consultation with
farm organizations and others, formulated the
bill now under discussion.
The principle of Bill 237 is to establish a
flexible agricultural price stabilization program which will provide, first, a guaranteed
yearly price for any agricultural commodity,
for which such a, guaranteed price may be
required; secondly, an ultimate security feature which will ensure that, so far as the
pine key agricultural commodities are concerned, a mandatory floor will be in effect at
all times. Both these levels of support,
guaranteed. prices. and mandatory floor, are
to be related to a moving average formula.
This moving average, ormula is based
on a ten-year average price and forms what

is called a base price. This is the first difference between this bill and the Agricultural Prices Support Act.
The second difference is that this legislation provides for an advisory board, composed of a chairman and from six to nine
members, made up of farmers or persons
from farm organizations; so the members of
the advisory board must all be farmers. It is
mandatory that they meet twice a year.
Under the old act the advisory board consisted of 19 members, 10 of whom were
appointees from provincial Governments, and
the balance were farmers. They did not get
paid for their services, they met on a voluntary basis.
The third difference in this legislation is a
guaranteed set price within the first three
months of the year, to hold for the ensuing
twelve months. Under the old act the price
was set when there was a meeting of the
advisory board, and they decided that some
particular agricultural product should be
supported.
The fourth difference provides for ultimate
security by establishing a mandatory floor
under nine named commodities.
Now, if honourable senators wish to ask
any questions, we shall endeavour to answer
them. For your benefit, possibly, we would
like to have this bill considered in committee. This, we think, is quite within reason.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I understood the promoter of this bill to say that the price would
be set in the first three months of the year.
Is that the fiscal year or the calendar year?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: The base price of a
commodity will be the average price of a
product over a ten-year period. Taking the
years 1948 to 1957, inclusive, and working
out the average price of a product over those
years would give you the base price for
1958, and the price would be set as near as
possible to January 1 of the calendar year.
There are, however, some exceptions. In
an emergency situation, when a particular
agricultural product needs special support
it can be supported, accordingly as the
advisory board suggests.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: As I understand thé
legislation, an advisory stabilization board
consisting of three persons is set· up, and
there is also to be set up an advisory com7
mittee consisting of seveni or more, persons.,
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Six or more.
Hon. Mr. Barbotir: But none of these bodies
have any authority under the" bill? It-Ï
the Governor in C6uncil ýwhich has ail
the authority under the bill, and he may
or may not listen tÔ-the advisors, is that
right?

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Yes, I think your statement is quite right. The Governor in
Council has the final say, and it must necessarily be so because the Government is
spending the money.
However, there is one point on which the
board can act in an emergency without
reference to the Governor in Council, but
only one point.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: There is another matter I would like to ask about. In my province, Prince Edward Island, potatoes form
a very important part of the cash income of
our farmers, and that is so also in the province of New Brunswick. Why are potatoes
not included with the other products
mentioned in the bill?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Potatoes are covered
in this bill. They are referred to as a
designated commodity. In the interpretation section of the bill, on page 1, clause 2,
subparagraph 1, (a), (ii) reads:
In this Act, "agricultural commodity" means any
other natural or processed product of agriculture
designated by the Governor in Council as an
agricultural commodity for the purpose of this
act, hereinafter called "designated comniodity".

And that includes potatoes. Now, if potatoes
happen to become a product which is not
saleable the advisory board brings this
matter to the attention of the Governor in
Council.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Does that term include
apples?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That includes apples.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: I wonder if the honourable member could explain to us just
what price is going to be arrived at here.
Eighty per cent of the average over a term
of ten years is mentioned, and it is proposed
to set a price near 80 per cent of that
average. Where will it be set? Under the
Agricultural Prices Support Act it could go
up as high as the present prices are or in fact
as high as there is money in the treasury to
pay for the goods.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: The information contained in your question is not quite correct.
The 80 per cent has reference to a base price.
Now, 80 per cent has to do with only the
nine key products called the named commodities; those are cattle, hogs, sheep, butter,
cheese, eggs, wheat, oats and barley not
produced in the designated area as defined
in the Canadian Wheat Board Act. If the
commodity is a designated product, like
apples, there is no limit to that, either up or
down; there is no percentage of 80 per cent
earmarked with regard to a designated
commodity.

Hon. Mr. McDonald: I understand that
there were some amendments made to Bill
237 in the other place.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Those amendments are
included in the bill before us.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: The amendments made
in the House of Commons are included in this
bill. I checked that this morning.
Hon. Thomas Reid: Honourable senators,
may I ask a question with regard to this 80
per cent base price? On page 2 of the bill
it is stated that "prescribed price" means,
(i) in relation to a named commodity, eighty per
cent of the base price thereof, or such higher percentage of the base price thereof as the Governor
in Council prescribes ...

Does that mean that the Governor in Council
may set a price higher than 80 per cent?
Hon. Mr. Brunt: Absolutely.

Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is right. Eighty
per cent is only a sort of security to underwrite the base price of the product, but the
Governor in Council can set a higher price
for the product.
Hon. Mr. McDonald: Why, then, do you
insert in the bill a percentage figure?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: As a security figure, so
that the base price cannot get below that.
Hon. Mr. Golding: I would like to know if
honey is included in the products mentioned
in this bill?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Yes; it comes under
items referred to as designated products.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: I understand, the
original bill that was presented in the House
of Commons had a number of amendments
made to it, perhaps nearly a dozen in all. I
wonder if that 80 per cent has any relation to
parity prices which we have heard a great
deal about in the last year.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I do not know how anybody could answer that question in relation
to parity prices. What is parity? Eighty per
cent of an average price, yes, that can be
arrived at; but there are four, five or ten
different types of parity. Which one do you
refer to?
Hon. Mr. Barbour: When the Prime Minister went through the Maritimes last spring
he promised the farmers parity prices. As
he is the Prime Minister I would think he
would want to have parity prices here in
some relation to what he is going to pay the
farmers.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I have in my hand a
copy of the policy of the Prime Minister
since 1949, and there is nothing in it regarding parity prices.

JANUARY 28, 1958
Hon. Mr. Golding: 1949?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is when it was
originally started. It was announced last
year.
The question of parity prices has been
under discussion by all types of organizations, not only in relation to food production, but nobody has been able to give a
definition of a parity price, and it is not
referred to in this program here.
Hon. Mr. Farris: I should like to ask my
honourable friend a question concerning
clause 10. Subclause (1) reads:

their difficulties, the handicaps they are under
in comparison with other sections and industries in the community. But I am bound to
say that he did not discuss, even in a general
way, the principle upon which this bill is
based, if indeed a principle can be found

Parliament has passed since the end of the
war. There was the Agricultural Prices Support Act, which was adopted in 1944. But
that act, which by the way is repealed by
this legislation, was for a purpose and had
a provision entirely different from anything

in. Council exceeds anything that I have ever
known in ail my experience in Parliament.
How will this work out in practical application? After ail, I do think it is the business
of Parliament to try to pass clear, understandable, workable legislation. I think the
prpamble to the bill is worth reading. It

conmences:
*Whereas it is expedient to enact a measure for
the purpose of stabilizing the prices of agricultural
coammodities in order ta assist the industry of
agriculture to realize fair returns for its labour
and investment, and to maintain a fair relationship between prices received by farmers and the
costs of the goods and services that they buy, thus
to provide farmers with a fair share of the
national income; . . .

If that has any meaning at ail at least it
answers the question of the honourable
senator for Prince (Hon., Mr. Barbour) who
w&ês talking about the establishment of a
parity price. We have borrQwed this term
"parity price" from the United States. That
is where it originated, I think honourable
senators are familiar with it, but very
briefly the parity principle in the United
States was established in this way. After
the end of the last war an agitation for the
stàbility of prices was raised by United
States farrhers, and their economists worked
out a formula. They took the prices of a
cansiderable list of the necessities that
farmers required to purchase between 1910
and 1914 and they made an index of this.
Then they took the prices farmers received
for all their main agricultural production
during the same period and they made an
index of this. Then they established a
parity between those two prices. After the
war the ingenious economists of the United
States farmers said, "we want that parity
established now". And it was established.
Il dare say it is a natural feeling of human
nature, to which this Government is no
more immune than any other, that the questipn of votes comes into the matter.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: No!
"Êon. Mr. Horner: Surely not!
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Both parties in the United
States vie with each other in support of the
parity principle, and votes are the main consideration. We have had a demonstration,
not, greatly different from that, in recent
days in this country.
Now, this legislation establishes first that
certain commodities are protected. The board
will take over the agricultural commodities,
as defined, at 80 per cent of their value on
the ten-year average, should prices. decline
below this point. The price may go 50 per
egnt below that, but the board still has to
t4ke it over. That is why the board must
hâve the powers given to it under this bill,
96702-34

the powers not only to act as the agent of
Her Majesty, but to purchase, that are set
out in section 10, which was referred to by
the honourable senator from Vancouver South
(Hon.i 1r. Farris).
Honourable senators, what will be the result of this? Let us consider it for a moment.
The prices that farmers in the Prairie provinces get for barley, oats and wheat have
no guarantee behind them at all-none.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: They have received initial
payment that is made each year; they are
sure of the initial payment that is fixed by
the Wheat Board at the beginning of each
crop year.
Hon. Mr. CFerar: Fixed at $1.40.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: That is right, and it does
not go below that figure during the year.
Hon. Mr, Crerar: Just a moment. Supposing
the Wheat Board operated at a loss for the
last year, and under, the legislation the
Governor in Council had to fix the base
price for wheat, or. the advauce price as it
is allëd, for the following year, do you think
they would fix it at $1.40?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, I think the Wheat
Board has fixed the price in the past years
at a loss.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: There is no authority in
the act for them to do so; there is no suggestion of guarantee on prices, absolutely none.
But in this proposed legislation farmers are
guaranteed a price, except those farmers who
produce wheat, oats and barley in the Prairie
provinces. If the average price over the last
ten years is, say, $1 a bushel for oats, the
Ontario farmers are guaranteed 80 cents a
bushel under this legislation, no matter what
quantity of oats they produce or to what
point the price falls. If the oats from
western Canada invade Ontario and the
market declines below the guaranteed price,
then the Board pays the difference to the
fortunate Ontario oat growers.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: But if the average price
for the last ten years of oats in Ontario was
50 cents a bushel, then he is guaranteed only
40 cents per bushel, which is below the price
guaranteed to western farmers.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Quite true, if that were
the case. But let us face the facts. The
prices of these commodities are at the lowest
in ten years. Anybody wbo knows anything
about the market knows that. The honourable senator -from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr.
Horner) is aware of that.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Not the prices of these
cornmodities in eastern Canada.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Well, it is unfortunate that
we are not going to have the opportunity to
get the information regarding the ten-year
average, but the effect of that will be inevitably, in my judgment, the piling up of
surpluses in Canada. Supposing the guaranteed price for oats is a better price than
the market price, do you not think the Ontario
farmers will grow it in preference to anything
else? What do the United States farmers do?
Just that. When they piled up huge agricultural surpluses the Government of Washington devised something called a "soil bank".
Hon. Mr. Horner: May I put a question to
the honourable gentleman? Is it not so that
in this bill the provision is for one year only,
that it is not going to continue into future
years?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend is
quite right in the sense that this is a moving
average. As each year passes the base price
will be on a descending scale; I quite agree
with that. But what happened in the United
States? The Department of Agriculture there
said, "We will have a soil bank". They first
guaranteed the farmers a price under the
parity principle; then when the agricultural
surpluses piled up they said, "Now we will
buy them off; we will give them money
to take land out of production to lower the
acreage of wheat production, particularly,
and put it into grass." This was the soil
bank. The farmers took the money, and
what did they do with it? The honourable
senator from Blaine Lake knows what they
did with it: they bought fertilizer and used it
on their good land and grew more wheat
than ever.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Will the honourable senator
permit a question? If he will look at section
7 of the bill he will find that these prices are
tied in to the cost of production. Is the
honourable senator arguing that the farmer is
not entitled to a price that is tied to the cost
of production?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: My honourable friend
from Hanover does not for a moment, I hope,
think he is going to catch me on that kind of
a question. I say to him, as I say to the
house, that you cannot determine any reliable
cost of production. You can have one farm
here, and another farm there, with the sun
shining and the rain falling on both alike and
each having soil that is alike, and there will
be all the difference in the world between the
cost of production on those two farms. Those
are intangible factors. My honourable friend
shakes his head, but those are intangible
factors, and that is why it is utterly impossible
for the government or any board to carry
out with any degree of accuracy at all the

provisions laid down in the preamble of this
bill. It just cannot for practical purposes be
done.
Of course, this proposed legislation will go
through, and I dare say it will be acceptable,
but I point out to my honourable friends
and to the house that this is a departure
entirely from the old pricing system. If we
are going to give protection to farmers in
this respect, are we going to deny it to others
who may need it? I may be old fashioned,
and I may be out of step with modern notions
altogether, but I do believe this, that legislation should be based on some principle that
is applicable to all. What about the 2,000
bankruptcies-the little merchants, and others,
who failed in business last year because they
found competition too keen? Is the Government not entitled under this principle to
come to their assistance? What about the little
sawmills up in northern British Columbia
which had to shut down, and some of which
sold out because they were bankrupt? If
Parliament accepts the principle that it is
the social responsibility of government to
come to the assistance of any who are in
distress, whether they are farmers or others,
then I say that sooner or later that principle
must have general application.
That is my main quarrel with legislation
of this kind: it does away with the age-old
laws. As a matter of fact, the principle upon
which this legislation is based, if it can be
called a principle, is found in the Marxist
philosophy.
My honourable friend shakes
his head. One of the things that Marx
taught was that the price system was one
of the devils of capitalism and had to be
destroyed; and along with that he taught
that all religions were an opiate of the people
and had to be destroyed. Are we here not
taking a long step forward in a socialistic
experiment?
Hon. Mr. Horner: Marx did not believe
in the devil.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: Now, take the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner),
there was a great free enterpriser! I thought
he was a pillar of free enterpriseHon. Mr. Horner: I hope so.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -but here he is supporting these nebulous, socialistic doctrines. And
as for my old friend the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig), I know his
views-or at least I knew what they were
-on the socialistic theories. I am not so
sure that I know what his views are now.
Admittedly the farmer has serious problems, but they are due more to inflation than
to anything else. The farmer who bought
a farm tractor 18 years ago paid only half

JANUARY 28, 195982
what it would cost him today. He has been
caught in a squeeze between the price of the
things hie selis and what hie pays for the
things he buys.
Hon. Mr. Aselfine: We are trying ta
rectify that situation.
Han. Mr. Crerar: The only sound basis for
a solution is ta attack the cause of the
trouble. What are we doing about it? What
are the causes of inflation? I would say,
first, the tendency on the part of ceompanies,
if they have the opportunity-and many
have-to secure an unreasonable margin of
profit on the handhing of their goods. It is
only human natureHon. Mr. Harner: There is more to it than
that.
Hon. Mr. Crerar: -ta get as large a degree
o! profit as possible. Next, an important
cause a! inflation are the increases in wages
that powerful labour unions are able ta
secure, and that I suppose is human nature
too.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: How would you correct
that?
Hon. Mr. Crerar: You see it reflected in
rnany ways. The railway men get an increase
ini wages, the raiways get a boost in freight
rates, and that is reflected in every store
and shop, large or srnahl, throughout the
whole o! Canada, and apparently we cannot
avoid it.
The next cause is the huge govermnent
spending we have meekly accepted. I
criticized. the late Liberal administration on
more than one occasion in this house because
of its spending, as my honourable friends
here wull recail. But what are we ta say
today in the face o! Government expenditures? Supplementary estimates arnounting
ta, $226 million were brought down today.
Our total budget expenditures this year are
very nearly $5,800,000,000. 1 ask this house
in ail seriousness, how in the world can we
ever control inflation or hold it in check if
we are going ta have Govermnent spending
rnaintained at this high level and the almost
certain deficits that will follow? It just cannot; be done without higher taxation, and who
wants that?
Let me tell you what will happen. This
legislation may give a little palliation for the
moment, but if the inflationary processes
continue, believe me, it is not; going ta satisfy.
What must be done with a problern of this
kind is to attack it at its source. If we could
have had contrai of inflation, even moderately, over the past 20 years we would not
have had ail the troubles we have today.
But when you think of the fact that a suit o!
96702-34J

521

clothes that a man could have purchased in
1939 for a certain price will cost h.ir twice
that amount today-and the price of every
cornmodity bas increased proportionatelyone can see what the inflationary process has
meant ta the multitude of aur people who
have done the useful job of saving and are
dependent on their savings.
Where is this inflation going ta end? That
is the important question. I feel strongly
that the farmers of this country are caught
in a squeeze, but I believe in the end they
will find the wise and sensible way out of
that trouble. This legislation will of course
go through. But unless Providence in His
wisdom gives us crop failures or sornething
of that kind, it is going ta bring in its wake
a trail of trouble.
I very much disllke making predictions,
but I look with grave doubt; indeed on creating conditions in this country even in a
rnodified way, that wull reproduce conditions existing in the United States today,
where they have more than $8 billion
invested in surplus agricultural praducts by
the ýCommodity Credit Corporation, at a cost
of more than $1 million a day in carrying
charges. With aur budgets where they are
today, honourable senators, we cannot afford
and should not take any chance of landing
in a sirnilar situation in this country.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Hanourable
senators, we have indeed listened ta an outstanding address by the honaurable senator
frorn Churchill <Hon. Mr. Crerar). He has
made certain predictions as ta what will
happen in the future. Frorn his vigour and
vitality, both physical and mental, I arn sure
he will be here ten years from now ta see
whether the predictions he has made tonight
corne true.
Hon. Senalors: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I should like ta congratulate bath honaurable senatars who have
explained this bill. I arn sure we ail have
a better understanding of the purpose of the
legisiation than we had when we came into
the house. However, there was not rnuch
excuse for our flot understanding it, since the
bill was debated in the other place for at
least a week. Personally, I had plenty of
tirne ta follow the debates there, and no
doubt other honourable senators did toa. A
number of amendments were rnoved-I think
about nine altogether-three of which are
incorporated in the bill. When the debate
was concluded the bill, as amended, met with
unanimous approval in the other house. That
does not necesarily mean that it should meet
with unanirnous approval here.
I for one will insist that this bill go ta a
comrnittee. Questions have been raised in

SENATE
this house by the honourable senator from
Churchill and other senators which have not
been satisfactorily answered. We are entitled
to full answers to these questions. The
honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr.
Pearson), who sponsored the bill, intimated
that he would not oppose a motion to send
the bill to a committee. I hope he will make
the motion himself.
The honourable senator from Churchill is
an experienced man in agricultural matters,
and there are other members of this house
who have wide experience in that field. We
have in the Senate a number of members
who were ministers of agriculture in their
provinces, and they understand this problem
as well as any members of any other legislature or of the House of Commons. Therefore,
I will not presume to take the time of this
house by discussing the bill in detail-although, after having been in the House of
Commons for 18 years and in the Senate
for five years and having heard many debates
on wheat and agriculture, even a lawyer must
have some knowledge of farmers' problems.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The sponsor of the
bill stated that the advisory committee must
be composed of farmers. Well, honourable
senators, in reading clause 5 I find that that
information is not quite correct. The clause
reads as follows:
5. (1) The miniater shall appoint an advisory
committee, consisting of a chairman and at least
six, but not more than nine, other members composed of farmers and . . .

Notice this, honourable senators.
-representatives

of farm organizations.

Hon. Mr. Pearson: That is what I said.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: My honourable friend
says that is what the said, but he actually said
they had to be farmers. However, if a farm
dranization appoints a lawyer as its representative, he will be eligible to sit on the
committee.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Do you think they will
do that?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not know, but if
appointeçi he would be eligible to sit on the
committee.
Honourable senators, in Ontario one man
cannot farm such large tracts of land as he
can in some other part of the country. The
honourable senator from Lumsden, if I heard
him correctly, said that one man can farm
anywhere from 800 to 1,200 acres. Well, I
will say that in Ontario one man cannot farm
anywhere near that acreage in mixed farming.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: He was not referring to
mixed farming.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: He was talking about
farmers.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: I was talking about the
cereal growing areas in western Canada.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: When my honourable
friend made the statement be was speaking
generally about farmers. Now, honourable
senators, in only very few provinces can one
man farm land to that extent. Even a
lawyer knows it is impossible elsewhere than
in -the Prairie provinces for any one man
to farm anything like 800 to 1,200 acres of
land.
The honourable senator from Churchill
pointed out that this bill repeals the Agricultural Prices Support Act. As he said, that act
was put on the Statute Book by the former
administration in

1944, and the purpose of

the act was to assist in maintaining prices at
a reasonable standard during the transition
from war .to peace. Well, that took a long
time. Indeed, it occurs. to me that probably
we are not completely at peace yet. The present is certainly a cold-war period. Prices
are not pegged now as they were during the
days of the actual war, but we are still
living in very difficult times.
I know something of the problems which
the farmer has to face and I think every
honourable senator is anxious to help the
farmer. But, honourable senators, does this
bill actually help the farmer? The honourable
senator from Lumsden said that it is not a
cure-all for the farmers' troubles, but in his
speech be intimated that it is almost a cureall for the farmers' problems. He said the
bill would be a great help to the farmers.
Well, if that is so I think we should stop now

and say, "Yes, we will put it through." But,
be did not convince me tonight that it is
going to be a great help to the farmers. I am
not sure that it is any better than the present
legislation, and I do not think be persuaded
many members of this house that it is. This
is one reason why the bill should be referred
to a committee where experts can be examined.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: We are going to refer it
to a committee, there is no argument about
that.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: One question that
I will ask the experts to answer is, in what
way this bill is a better piece of legislation
than the present act is for helping the
farmers. I am not the only one who is concerned with this problem. This bill has not
been accepted generally. The sponsor (Hon.
Mr. Pearson) gave the impression that this
bill has met with the general approval of
the Canadian Federation of Agriculture. Well,
I have not seen anything to that effect in the

JANUARY 28, 1958
press. I know that before the bill was
amended many members of the Federation
of Agriculture opposed the bill and I have not
yet read that they have approved of it. I
read with some concern the Canadian Press
dispatch that appeared in this morning's
papers and I am going to quote it now to
show the honourable senator that there are
many people in Canada, including some who
have an expert knowledge of farming, who
are very concerned about the effect of this
bill. The article, which is dated Montreal,
January 27, states:

have not too limited a discussion, not to rush
the bill through committee, but let it be
considered very carefully to make sure that,
if passed, it will be in the interests of the
farmers.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: The only objection I
have heard to the bill is that it does not go
far enough.
Hon. Mr. Horner: I want to correct one
statement made by the honourable Leader of
the Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) with
regard to one farmer handling 800 to 1,200
acres. In western Canada methods are entirely different from those down here. One
man would crop only half his acreage each
year; the other half would be in summer
fallow, prepared and ready for seeding the
next year. The practice is different from that
in Ontario.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not want that kind
of help.
These remarks about my own experience
are aside from what I hope to say before I
sit down. I appreciate the problems of the
farm and of the farmer. His business is
developing, it is in transition, and he has
been up against the problem of keeping up
with the times. Old methods have gone by.
Now a large acreage, with very expensive
agricultural machinery, is needed, whereas
formerly a man with a very small investment and couple of horses, and perhaps a
wife and some children, could carry on a
business which at least gave him a living.
Today it is very questionable whether the
small farmer can keep going. Certainly he
cannot do so with only field crops; he must
carry on mixed farming as well.
This I have said merely to express my
interest in the farmer and my knowledge of
the problems he faces. But what I want to
speak about today is the principle of this
bill. I come from the cities, and I know
something of the problems of the towns as
well as of the country.
The honourable senator from Churchill
(Hon. Mr. Crerar), in the magnificent speech
he gave us, referred to the number of bankruptcies which have taken place in recent
times. I know very well the position of the
men in the cities who face keen competition,
high prices for the things they buy and low
prices for the things they sell. I say that
the principle of this bill is all wrong. It is,
in my view, no function of government to
take from those in business who make a profit
in order to give profit to those who show a
loss. That course is disastrous as far as the
whole community is concerned. So I object
to the bill in that it is intended to give to
the Government, or a committee proposed
or appointed by them, power to arbitrarily
set prices and then tap the public treasury
to increase, to a figure they set, the normal
competitive price. It is all wrong.
We in this chamber have had a little
experience of interference of that kind. The
issue is not entirely political. Both parties
have attempted to woo--or otherwise-the
farmer by interference with natural laws.
My criticism is not political, it is economic.
We recall when the Government attempted
to set the exchange price of the dollar as
between Canada and the United States. I
opposed that proceeding frorn the first, and
continued to do so until at last it was forced
upon the attention of Parliament that the
country, by this foolish arrangement, was
losing money hand over fist. When the war
ended we had American gold to the value
of a billion and a half dollars in the treasury.
By arbitrarily fixing the price of the dollar,

and paying the difference when importations
were allowed, we poured more than a billion
dollars down the drain in the course of a
couple of years. Finally these very smart
men in the Department of Finance realized
that this proceeding had to come to an end,
so they imposed a number of import restrictions, which handicapped trade with our best
customer. But even that wore out and finally
they did what they should have done in the
first instance, relied upon freedom and the
good sense of our people in their competitive
efforts. Well, it was a rather disastrous experiment we conducted at that time and I
should think it would have been enough
to teach us to keep our fingers out of private
business. We should allow businesses which
make a profit to go on and prosper; and those
which cannot justify their existence by
making a profit should either change their
methods or go out of business. The usual
answer is to change the method.
The honourable senator from Churchill
blamed inflation for the difficulty in which
the farmers find themselves. I do not follow
him in that. Of course, there are so many
meanings attached to the word "inflation"
that I do not know whether I am thinking
of the sarne thing that he was. I understand
inflation to be a change in the purchasing
power of the dollar, and I should point out
that that has not always been to the detriment
of the farmer. Sometimes it has been to his
benefit. I do not want to go into this subject
at length tonight, though I should like to
do so at some future time. What I think the
honourable senator from Churchill had in
mind was the phrase he used later when he
talked about the high price the farmer pays
for the things he buys and the low price he
gets for the things he sells; and he suggested
we should attack the cause of these things
rather than try to correct their result. One
reason for the high price that the farmer
pays for goods is that he buys In a protective market. The price of everything the
farmer buys is increased by our protective
tariff s.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I don't agree with the
honourable senator.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That is all right.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Does he realize there
is no tariff on farm implements of any kind?
That is a big item.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: But is there a tariff on
the things that go into the manufacture of
f arm implements?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, we produce our own
steel right here.

JANUARY 28, 1958
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: We have a high tariff
on steel, yet we import steel in the face of
that tariff. The price of steel in Canada is
increased by our tariff.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Well, if farm implements
are cheaper in the United States they can
come in here without the payment of any
duty.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There is a drawback
on steel going into the manufacture of farm
implements.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, yes. At the same
time the prices of a great many other things
that go into the making of farm implements
are increased by tariffs.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would you please elucidate
and nane them? What are they?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Are you asking me to
enumerate them?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: It is beyond the power
of anybody when making an offhand speech
to enumerate such things. I would say that
the price of everything the farmer buys, from
toothbrushes to shoes, is increased by tariffs,
just as is the case with a great many of the
items that go into the manufacture of farm
implements. My honourable leader (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) called my attention to the
fact there is a drawback on steel. Well, there
are many other items that increase the cost
of manufacturing implements and everything
else. I know that my friends across the way
are high-tariff men. They are protectionists,
and they were simply appalled at the suggestion that we decrease tariffs between ourselves and the United Kingdom, notwithstanding the fact that they indulged in all kinds
of oratory on the platform about increasing
trade between Canada and the United
Kingdom.
One way in which to decrease the price
of the things the farmers buy would be by
removing protective tariffs. In the things he
sells the farmer has to compete with world
prices, but he has not the same freedom
in the buying of the things that he requires.
This creates a jug-handled situation so far
as farmers are concerned. Aside from all that,
I am totally opposed to interference by government in business in this way, taking
money from those who make a profit and
giving it to those whose business does not
pay. What is the result? The honourable
senator from Churchill made it clear. It
means that these commodities which are
favoured by this board will sell at a higher
price by reason of the board's favour; then
the competitive price will be on the things

that the farmers produce in greatest profusion, and we will have in Canada exactly the
same results as we read about in the United
States: great surpluses, serious depletion of
the treasury and piling up of unused commodities in government storehouses. Then,
perhaps, there will be interference between
nations when we try to dispose of these
unused commodities-as occurred when the
United States gave away wheat and interfered greatly with Canadian trade.
Honourable senators, I am a free trader.
I believe in freedom always, and the right
o! the individual to guide his own business
to make a profit by his wisdom and skill,
and not to draw his profits from the public
treasury. So, as a matter of principle, I am
opposed to this bill, and this is the time to
state my opposition, on the second reading
stage, when we consider the principle of the
bill, not the detail.
As I said at the outset, I am not in a position to discuss agricultural problems, for I
am not a farmer nor am I engaged in agricultural pursuits. But I do know principles
when I see them. I see a bad principle in this
bill and I am opposed to it.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators, I
moveThe Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
I would remind the house that if the honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr.
Pearson) speaks now he will close the debate.
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators, I
move, seconded by the honourable senator
from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), that this bill
be now read a second time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, the question is on the motion of the
Honourable Senator Pearson, seconded by
the Honourable Senator Brunt, for the second
reading of the bill. Is it your pleasure to
adopt the motion?
Some Hon. Senators: Carried.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: On division.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill was
read the second time, on division.
REFERRED TO COMMrrTEE
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Pearson: Honourable senators,
I move, seconded by the honourable senator
from Hanover (Hon. Mr. Brunt), that this
bill be referred to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce.

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Croll: May I make one observation before the motion is adopted? I understood from a recent discussion in this house
that if any honourable senator wished a
stenographic report to be made of a committee meeting he would be accommodated.
Will this be done?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will answer that. First of
all, I want to extend an invitation to every
member of the house to be present at tomorrow's committee meeting, and I can assure them that they will be free to ask
questions of the witnesses. The Deputy Minister of Agriculture and his two leading
officials will be present tomorrow morning at
10.30. Tomorrow afternoon at 2.30 the minister himself will be available. He cannot be
earlier because he has to address the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, in Montreal,
at its annual meeting tomorrow morning.
Hon. Mr. Farris: What about the stenographic report?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I will try to have that
arranged; thank you, very much.
Hon. Mr. Croll: No-not try.
Hon. Mr. Haig: Arrangements will be made
to have the committee reported tomorrow
morning.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Until what time shall
we be adjourning tomorrow? I understood
the Leader of the Government to say that the
minister would be present at the committee
at 2.30.
Hon. Mr. Haig: The minister gets in at
2.30 tomorrow, and will be present at the
opening of the other house. At 3 o'clock he
will be with us. I ask honourable senators if
they will agree to, say, four o'clock, or half
past four, if that is reasonable. Of course, 1
am in the hands of this house. I am especially
anxious that the minister should be there.
First, he had intended to go away by train,
but he agreed instead to go and return by air,
in order to be at our meeting tomorrow. May
I ask the Leader of the Opposition (Hon. Mr.
Macdonald>if 4 o'clock will be all right?
SMon. Mr. Macdonald: I have no objection.
I was going to ask if there are other bills
before the house at the present time.
Hon. Mr. Haig: No, there are none.
Hon. Mr. Davies: Are we to understand that
the house is to adjourn until 4 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon, or that the committee is
to meet at that time?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: It has been suggested
that the Minister of Agriculture appear
before the Banking and Commerce Committee at about 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

Accordingly, it has been suggested that this

house should reassemble at 4 o'clock instead
of 3 o'clock in the afternoon, so as to give

honourable members an opportunity to hear
the minister in committee.

The motion of Hon. Mr. Pearson for reference of the bill to the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce was agreed to.

3. How many paintings, drawings, etchings and
sculptures made by each one of them are there in

4. During the period mentioned in No. 1, how
many times did they meet and where?
5. How much was paid to each one of them for
their remuneration and their travelling expenses?
6. When was the present incumbent appointed the
Director of the National Gallery of Canada, and
at what salary?
7. What total amount has been paid to him, trom
the date of his appointment, for his salary and his
travelling expenses?
8. Is he entitled to a commission on the purchases
for the National Gallery of Canada and, if so,
what is it?
9. What price was paid for each one of the
purchases for the National Gallery of Canada, from
the date of the appointment of the present incumbent as its director, what was each one of them,
with its catalogue number, and from whom was
each one bought and when?

Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
I have the answer to the honourable gentle-

man's inquiry. I would like to suggest to him
that he should be made a member of this
board. This is a very important matter, and
it takes a great deal of time to deal with it.
For text of answer see appendix to today's
Hansard, p. 528.
NATURAL GAS PRICES, EXPORT AND
DOMESTIC
INQUIRY AND ANSWER

Hon. Thomas Reid inquired of the Government, pursuant to notice:
1. Are there regulations governing the sale of
natural gas?
2. Is Westcoast Transmission Gas Co. selling gas
to purchasers or use.rs in the United States?
3. Is natural gas produced in the Province of
Alberta being sold at a lesser price to purchasers
or users of natural gas in the United States than
to purchasers or users of natural gas in Canada,
by Westcoast Transmission Co. or by any other
company?

JANUARY 28, 1958
Hon. John T. Haig: I have the following
answer to the honourable gentleman's inquiry:
1. The sale of gas within Canada is subject
to the regulation of the province within which
it is produced or sold as the case may be.
Export sales of gas are subject to the Exportation of Electricity and Fluids and Importation of Gas Act, the regulations thereunder, and the conditions established for
the permit which is required under that act
for any export of natural gas.
2. Westcoast Transmission Company Limited is selling gas to Pacific Northwest Transmission Company at Huntingdon, British
Columbia, on the United States border.
3. The Government of Canada has no official information on or control over the
prices charged for Canadian gas in the United
States by companies which purchase such gas
from Canadian transmission companies at the
United States border. The relationship of
export prices to domestic prices is governed
by regulation 9 under the Exportation of

Electricity and Fluids and Importation of Gas
Act which reads as follows:
Export Price
9. The price charged by a licensee for
power or gas exported by him shall not be
lower than the price at which power or gas,
respectively, is supplied by him or his supplier in similar quantities and under similar
conditions of sale for consumption in Canada.
The application of this regulation in relation
to existing export permits and internal prices
charged by holders of such permits is presently under scrutiny by the legal officers of
the Crown.
ADJOURNMENT
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I suggest that the
house adjourn until 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon, and then it can adjourn at pleasure?
Hon. Mr. Haig: All right. I move that the
house adjourn.
The Senate adjourned until tomorrow at
3 p.m.

THE SENATE

Wednesday, January 29, 1958

The Senate met at 3 p.m., the Speaker in
the Chair.
Prayers.
CANADA-AUSTRALIA INCOME TAX
AGREEMENT BILL
FIRST READING
The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the
House of Commons with Bill 170, to implement an agreement between Canada and
Australia for the avoidance of double taxation
with respect to income tax.
The bill was read the first time.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the second time?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Next sitting of the house.
AGRICULTURAL STABILIZATION BILL
REPORT OF COMMITTEE

Hon. Salier A. Hayden, Chairman of the
Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, presented the report of the committee
on Bill 237.
The report was read by the Clerk as
follows:
The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce to whom was referred the Bill (237)
intituled: "An Act to provide for the Stabilization of the Prices of Agricultural Commodities",
have in obedience to the order of reference of
January 28, 1958, examined the said bill, and now
report the same without any amendment.

The report was adopted.
THIRD READING

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: On behalf of the honourable senator from Lumsden (Hon. Mr.
Pearson) I move the third reading now.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Honourable senators,
last night I asked a question here as to
whether potatoes would be included with the
other products mentioned in the bill. That
question bas now been answered. I had the
privilege of sitting in the Standing Committee
on Banking and Commerce this morning and
hearing the bill explained. As far as I can
see, it will not help our farmers one bit at
the present time. As regards the 80 per cent
provision, at present the prices received by
our growers are substantially higher than the
ten-year average contemplated in the bill.

The Government has been so pressed for
time that it couldn't meet the provincial
Premiers and talk over the interprovincial
agreements, but it spent six days on a bill
that has not improved the existing Agricultural Prices Support Act one bit.
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Question.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I do not want to take the place
of anybody but I have some remarks to make
after attending the sitting of the committee
this morning. In the first place, this bill
is entitled "An Act to provide for the
Stabilization of the Prices of Agricultural
Commodities". The purpose of the bill is
to replace the Agricultural Prices Support
Act, which is to be repealed by this bill.
It reminds me of tweedledum and tweedledee: it does not make any difference. When
the bill was before committee it struck me
-as was pointed out by the chairman-that
in the act generic expressions are used to
designate the commodities, while in this bill
there are specific terms to designate the
same commodities. It does not make a great
difference. By the way, when the bill was
discussed in the House of Commons it was
said by many of those who took part in the
discussion that there was practically no difference between the bill and the present act.
I wonder what is the real purpose of this
bill, if it is not to give the farmers the impression that they will get more on account
of this legislation than they have in virtue of
the legislation that is in force now and will
remain in force until it is repealed by this
bill. I wonder if it is not the intention of
the Government to paint the edge of dressed
meat, and all that, with dollar signs in order
to make the farmers believe that the signs
that appear on the edge of the dressed meat,
etc., etc., are dollars in their pockets. But the
matter is much more serious than that. This
is hasty legislation; and legislation of this
kind, which might have such importance if
it were better drafted, might give the farmers
the illusion of having more than they will
really get.
Another complaint I have is about the
drafting of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph
(a) of clause 2, in which it is mentioned that
"agricultural commodity" means "any other
natural or processed product of agriculture".
It should be "any other natural or processed
food product of agriculture", otherwise this
bill might apply to hides, leather, boots, wool
and woollens, timber, pulp and paper, and the
products of sawmills. It is a small amendment
that I am suggesting and I hope that the
Government will accept my suggestion this
time to insert the word "food" before the
word "product" in that subparagraph (ii).

JANUARY 29, 1958
There is another thing that strikes me and word "food" were put in. For that reason
which I want to mention now. It is that the the committee agreed that the clause should

called agricultural products, which would

SENATE
or earlier, a statute called the Agricultural
Products Board Act, under which "agricultural product" has a very broad interpretation. It means:
Livestock and livestock products, poultry and
poultry products, milk and milk products, vegetables and vegetable products, fruit and fruit
products, honey, maple syrup, tobacco, fibre and
fodder crops, and any product of agriculture
designated by the Governor in Council as an agricultural product for the purpose of this act.

The powers of the board established under
that act include specific powers to buy
agricultural products for purposes of sale or
delivery to the Government of another country or an agency thereof, and also the power,
broadly stated, to buy, sell or import agricultural products. So under the scheme of the
Agricultural Products Board Act there is
authority to do these things that are now
being provided for, and possibly the language
in this bill has been borrowed in part from
that statute. There the scheme is that you
have named products and products of agriculture that may be designated, and I do not
think in a general way you can find a product of agriculture that could not be designated
under that existing law.
So in the interest of expedition, and so
as not to amend this bill in any way that
would require it to be sent back to the
other house, where there might be some incident of delay in dealing with it, or where
it might provoke a lot of speeches, we are
asked to pass something which is obviously
much broader than is intended in any policy
decision of the Government at this time,
and we are asked to do it because that is
the way the bill has come to us.
That bothers me a bit, but I can only hope
that those who administer the law will not
start to feel pulsating in them all the authority that the bill actually gives them and
start asserting themselves in that fashion.
It is possible that the minister may hold them
down, or that the Governor in Council may
do so, although pressures are strange things.
In the years that I have been here certain
legislation has come in for the same criticism
that I am making in relation to this bill.
We were told that it was not the intention
of the Government to administer that legislation in accordance with a broad interpretation of the powers set out therein, but
strange as it may seem I have found afterwards, when the law is on the Statute Book
and the occasion arises, that the Government
keeps reaching in and taking more of the
powers inherent in the act. I certainly have
found that to be the case time after time
in income tax legislation where we were
told that amendments were designed to deal
with a particular situation which the Govern-

ment was experiencing. I can tell you from
actual experience that afterwards the interpretations and applications were broadened
very considerably so as to cover a wide range
of things that were not even discussed or
imagined at the time the bill was before us.
As regards the present bill, we are told that
the Government has no intention of going
beyond a certain boundary. That may very
well be, but no one can say what the pressures will be in the future-for pressures may
come. If the bill is designed to apply to food
products, processed and otherwise, why are
we afraid to state that? Why is there this
very broad definition, which covers such
an infinite variety of agricultural products
that the board and the Governor in Council
could, if they wished, extend the application
of the statute to almost any product?
I pointed this out this morning, but the
committee seemed to feel, "Well, we will let
the bill go the way it is"; and as there is not
much satisfaction in being a single voice crying in the wilderness I therefore decided that
I would present my views on third reading.
However, the problem of having similar
authorities outstanding in two statutes bothers
me a bit.
Somebody may say that the purpose of this
bill is to stabilize prices or to maintain prices.
But how do you do that? To a very large extent you do that by buying products when
there is a surplus and holding them off the
market so as to influence an upward trend in
prices, and when the market is in short supply
you hope
you offer to sell those products, and under the
to get out with a whole skin. Now,
Agricultural Products Board Act there is
authority to buy and sell. True, it is not
stated in that act that it is for the purpose of
maintaining or stabilizing prices, but in that
aspect it is broader than the bill before us.
But in any event, we find these two statutes
are going to run along a common path. Ahi
we were told in committee this morning by
the Deputy Minister of Agriculture-who, by
the way, gave a very able, clear and frank
explanation of all the items, and answered the
questions as fully as he could and, I think,
to the satisfaction of the committee-was that
when the Agricultural Products Board had
finished its job of buying these products and
selling thern to an agency of a foreign Government it started to stand by, and it is really
looked on now as a stand-by board, the directors of which are officials in the Department
of Agriculture.
Well, whatever the board is, is a matter of
choice of those who are administering the
statute. If they wanted to have it spring into
action all they would have to do is snap their
fingers and issue a command, and that statute

JANUARY
would be reactivated. If they wanted a better
board they could, I am sure, easily get a
better one. If they wanted stabilization and
maintenance of prices in a particular way as
a function of the board under the statute,
they would only need to add a very simple
declaration to the bill. However, we have a
new bill. Maybe the idea was just that, to
present a new bill, even though it incorporated 95 or 98 per cent of what is contained
in existing legislation.
Having said this, having had my moment
in court, I do not feel badly because nobody
has endorsed the views I expressed this
morning. After one has been here as long as
I have one is astonished at the views which
are accepted, and more so at those which are
not accepted.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, I have very little to add to what I
said on the motion for second reading. I am
opposed to the whole principle of the bill,
and therefore I am not particularly concerned about the details which the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden) has mentioned. We sat in committee the whole morning, listening, as the
honourable senator says, to an able explanation of the bill but I confess that I find no
reason to change the views which I expressed
before we had that explanation.
Unfortunately, the previous administration is responsible for legislation in the
form of the Agricultural Prices Support Act
which is somewhat similar to the measure
now before us. It was passed in 1944, but
it did not come into actual operation until
1946. From that year until October last, and
under the powers given by the bill, some
$600 million have been expended. That is
the estimate by a Government department
of the cost of purchasing agricultural products
which were sold later. The important fact,
as one views the future in the light of the
past, is that the loss occasioned to the
Exchequer of Canada has been in the neighbourhood of $100 million. That is to say,
under legislation similar to that before us,
and which, I am sorry to say, bas been on
the statute books since 1944, we have
dipped deeply into public funds to pay to one
business the profits of other businesses.
This practice, of course, I do not like and
cannot approve. I think it is wrong in
principle; I believe it will work out badly
in practice.
Our committee not only asked departmental officials what the previous legislation
had cost the Canadian people, but invited
them to estimate what the present bill, if
enacted, will cost. The deputy minister,
with that frankness to which my friend bas
96702-35

29, 1958
referred, replied that it is impossible to make
any guess,-utterly impossible to know what
will be involved to the taxpayers of this
dominion. It depends very largely on the
administration of the provisions, which are
as broad as the world and as high as the
skies.
friend from De la
My honourable
Durantaye (Hon. Mr. Pouliot) spoke about
the illusory character of the promise to the
farmers. If it were illusory I would not
have the objections to it which I am now
expressing. Unfortunately it is far from
being illusory. It gives the administration
power to set any price on any agricultural
product,-not 80 per cent, which is the
minimum amount, and the minimum only,
on certain named commodities. There is no
maximum. The department, controlled by
the Government, may set whatever price it
likes for any commodity which it chooses,
and pay that price to the producers, no matter what relation it may have to the actual
value of the product at the time. So we
who are now passing this legislation have
no idea of what it is going to mean, whether
in administration, in payments to the farmer,
or in cost to the taxpayers.
I regret that there bas been previous legislation of this kind. I regret that now we are
going further in the same direction. We are
to increase from $200 million to $250 million
the fund in the hands of the department. I
do not know that these figures matter very
much, because when the amount is exhausted
the department can come back for more
money. But it illustrates the greater liberality
which is evident in the application of this
kind of legislation. It means a great deal that
the officials, under the power of the executive,
are given the right to set any price they like,
and then to pay in accordance therewith, to
those who lose money, the difference between
the competitive price and a price arbitrarily
set, with no limitation whatsoever on the
cost to the people of this dominion. That is
wrong in principle. I suspect that it is a
carrot to be dangled before a certain class of
our voters in the election which is not very
far distant. It is part and parcel of the recklessness with regard to money which has been
exhibited by this administration since the day
it took office. I am opposed to the bill in
detail; I am opposed to it in principle; it is
bad legislation.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: Honourable senators, I
move in amendment, seconded by the Honourable Senator Fraser, that the word "food" be
added before the word "product" in the first
line of subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a)
of clause 2 of this bill.

Hon. Mr. Haig: On a point of order, the

reading of the bill.
Hon. Mr. Farris: That does not preclude

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, if it is desired to amend this clause I
think the bill should be referred back to
committee for reconsideration of the clause.
I do not think the bill can be amended in
a detail such as this on third reading.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Oh, yes.

Honourable senators, I do not believe the
bill will be of any more advantage to the
farmers than the present act is. I say this
with the assurance that the bill is not being
accepted by the farmers of Canada. I have
not read in the press that the farmers have
accepted it, nor have I heard authentically
it is acceptable to the Canadian Federation
of Agriculture or any other large body of
Canadian farmers.

is now before the house for consideration on
third reading. I hope honourable members
will pass it. It is the dying end of the session.
In the other place there is a group, composed
of two political parties, which is desperately
opposed to this legislation. One of these
parties is not the Liberal party, for only two
of their people voted against the bill there,
and not one member of the Conservative
party voted against it. The rest of the members in that house were against it.
As to the acceptance of the bill by an
authorized farmers' agency, the Winnipeg
Free Press of January 27 contains the statement that the executive members of the
Interprovincial Farm Union Council are satisfied with the legislation and have accepted
it. I understand that the Canadian Federation
of Agriculture, which is meeting in Quebec
today, has already accepted the legislation
and is supporting it.

I want to make my position clear on this
bill; if I failed to do it before. In my judgment the bill is a bad bill, and an unsound
bill. I do not think it will achieve the purpose
it was intended to achieve. Moreover, except
for the preamble to this bill-and it is a fine
facade, a fine bit of window dressing-the
Government has all the power it needs, as
the honourable senator from Toronto (Hon.
Mr. Hayden) pointed out, under the Agricultural Products Board. Therefore, if my
honourable friend from De la Durantaye had
moved, instead of this amendment, that the
bill be not read the third time now, but this
day six months hence, I would have supported
his motion.
Some Hon. Senators: Question.
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
It is moved by the Honourable Senator Brunt,
seconded by the Honourable Senator Pearson,
that the bill be now read the third time. In

Senator Pouliot, seconded by the Honourable
Senator Fraser, that the word "food" be added
before the word "product" in the first line of
subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (a) of clause
2 (1) of the bill. The question is on the
amendment. Is it your pleasure, honourable
senators, to adopt the amendment?
Sorne Hon. Senators: No, no.

The motion was agreed to, and the bill was

PROCEDURE-AMENDMENTS TO BILLS ON
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
in support of my ruling, I wish to draw the
attention of the honourable Senator from
Churchill (Hon. Mr. Crerar), to Bourinot on
third readings of bills.
Apparently it is not the general practice in
the House of Commons to move amendments
on third reading; but when important amendments are moved, the bill under consideration
is referred back to the committee. I quote
from page 531 of Bourinot's Parliamentary
Procedure, (4th Edition):
In the Senate bils are constantly amended on
third reading without going back to the committee.

Honourable senators who spent many years
in the House of Commons are imbued with

these rules and know of the general practice
in that house. In the Senate, however, it has
been the practice to amend bills on third
reading.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: A further reason for
the difference between the rules in this house
and in the House of Commons is that there
they go into Committee of the Whole, and
here we seldom do. We usually refer bills
to a standing committee. Therefore, we
widen our rules governing the third reading
stage.
The Hon. the Speaker: That would be an
additional reason for my ruling.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, may I say that it is perfectly proper
in this house to go into Committee of the
Whole. The only reason why instead we
generally refer bills to one of the standing
committees is that in such a committee we can
direct our questions to the officials who attend
from the appropriate department, and they
can answer directly; whereas, in the Committee of the Whole, an official of the appropriate department sits in front of the Leader
of the Government, who, if be wishes, may
consult that official before answering a
question. The official cannot answer questions directly in the Senate. Therefore, in
general we have deemed it advisable to
send bills to standing committees, and I
think that is a very good practice.
Hon. Mr. Croll: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: However, I do think
that from time to time it might be advisable
for us to go into Committee of the Whole
instead of calling a meeting of a standing
committee. May I also point out that there
is nothing irregular in sending a bill to a
standing committee and, after the bill is
reported back to this House, referring it to
the Committee of the Whole for further
consideration.
Now, Mr. Speaker, if I may be permitted,
without questioning your ruling in any way
whatsoever, I would like to say to honourable
senators that the practice which has grown
up-and it bas indeed grown up, as His
Honour has pointed out-of amending bills
on third reading in the Senate is not a good
practice. For one reason, on third reading
the principle of the bill must be discussed
and a member can only speak once. No
member can speak more than once on third
reading. If we were going to amend the bill
that is before us today I am sure there are
20 questions that I would like to ask someone. Therefore I would have had to speak
20 times, and I would have been out of order
19 times. I can say now that I would have
voted in favour of an amendment to refer

SENATE
this bill back to the committee for further
consideration, because I was in sympathy to
a large extent with the views of the honourable senator from De la Durantaye (Hon.
Mr. Pouliot). I think if we had sent the bill
back to the committee we probably could
have worked out a wording satisfactory to
the sponsor and the Government and to ourselves, but in the Senate I was prevented
from discussing it.
I think honourable senators will agree that
when an amendment to a clause is proposed
it is better to go into Committee of the Whole
or else to a standing committee, where we
can all ask as many questions as we like,
with a view to amending the clause as we
think best.
I accept most graciously the ruling of His
Honour. I know what the rule is in the House
of Commons, for I presided over that house
for some years, but I must say I did not
realize that a contrary practice had been
established in this house. I would suggest
that whenever we follow that practice we
should be very careful to give full consideration to the proposed amendment.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable senators, may I have your indulgence to say just
a word, because the subject under discussion
has a good deal of interest.
In the Commons the practice of referring
bills to the Committee of the Whole operates
most advantageously. Bills are introduced
and sponsored in that bouse by the minister
who is responsible for their preparation. In
Committee of the Whole he has by his side,
as a rule, his Parliamentary Assistant, and,
seated in front of him, two senior members of
his department. He is therefore in a position
to answer all questions that may be put to
him.
But how different is the situation here!
We have one member of the cabinet in the
Senate. Usually the Leader of the Government in the Senate is a member of the cabinet,
who is generally, but not always, a minister
without portfolio. No matter how industrious
he may be it is impossible for him to occupy
the position successively, bill after bill, of all
the ministers in the other house. He is not
able to answer questions as they are. In consequence of that, and I think this is the main
reason why we act as we do, we refer legislation to a standing committee, where we are
free to question the minister of the department concerned, or the deputy minister, and
departmental officials. We are also open to
hear representations from the public at large.
In that way our facilities for the examination
of legislation are at least equal to those
enjoyed by members of the other house.
I have frequently heard compliments paid
to the Senate for the courtesy with which we

conduct our standing committee meetings,
and I am impressed also that we are very
effective indeed as we sit around the table
at these standing committees and discuss
terms of the bills and the conditions which
have brought them about.
For the reasons I have stated we usually
do not refer bills to the Committee of the
Whole. We can do so; and, as was pointed
out earlier, we can send a bill to a Standing
Committee and later refer it to the Committee
of the Whole, but that procedure does not
work very well. Since I have been in this
house we have sometimes gone into Committee of the Whole, but the result was not
as satisfactory as it is in the other house,
and therefore I think our present method is
very good.
I hope there will be no movement to draw
the rules too tight in regard to amendments
of and discussion on bills reported back to
the Senate from standing committees. We do
not need rigid rules in this house because
every one of us here is an experienced parliamentarian. We sit as long as we like, there
is no rule on the length of our speeches, and
I do not think I have ever known a speech
here that was really too long. The courtesy
with which we carry on is not only delightful
to ourselves but I think it is approved by the
country at large.
Hon. Jean-François Pouliot: Honourable
senators, I appreciate the fact that there are
several standing orders of the Senate with
regard to the sittings of the Committee of
the Whole in the Senate, and I regret not to
share the views of those who have said that
bills should not be brought before the Committee of the Whole. It is an institution that
we have established by our rules. Nothing
prevents a minister of the Government or any
official from coming to the Senate to answer
questions which may be put during a sitting
of the Committee of the Whole. About onehalf of the senators who do not belong to the
Banking and Commerce Committee are discriminated against when a bill is submitted
to that committee instead of to the Committee
of the Whole. To that objection it is answered
that members may attend the committee and
they will be allowed to ask questions. It is
not a right, but a certain permission which
is given.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, it is a right.
Hon. Mr. Pouliol: They are not at ease, they
are not in the same position as if they were
members of the committee. The purpose of
the Committee of the Whole is to enable all
honourable senators to get illuminating
answers from the Government or from the
officials.

JANUARY 29, 1958
Last year I spoke of the importance of this
type of committee. However, since the opening of the present session no bill has been
submitted to the Committee of the Whole.
To my mind that is unfortunate, because
honourable senators are deprived of an opportunity to become better acquainted with
the legislation which is put before them.
With regard to the ruling of the Honourable
the Speaker, I stand by him as though he were
the Rock of Gibraltar. I say the same of my
honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber (Hon. Mr. Macdonald),
in reference to his Speakership of the House
of Commons. But in practice the Senate rules
as interpreted by our Speaker are superior to
those of the other bouse, for he never quotes
Beauchesne! I am satisfied with the rulings
of the Chair, even when the Chair does not
support my contention. I may be wrong at
times-seldom, if you like, honourable gentlemen-but I admit that human nature is
weak and occasionally I may be led into
error. Here in the Senate we are fortunate to
have a good Speaker. We have not to lean
on the practice nor on the rules of the House
of Commons; we have our own. They are not
perfect, and some improvements may come
in due course-as to that, nobody knowsbut as they are, our rules are better than
those of any other Parliamentary institution.
We must stand by them, and at all times they
should be applied with clearness and tolerance, as His Honour our Speaker does.

reports available to members of Parliament?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand that certain
temporary reports have been handed out,
but I do not know that that is so. My
information, like my honourable friend's, is
derived from newspapers. It never came in

National Gallery. They will realize that very
few have been bought directly from Canadian
artists. I have been told that for several years
the practice of the National Gallery has been
to buy the works of Canadian artists through
an agent, who gets a commission of 30 per
cent on each purchase, besides the commission that is paid to the gallery which sells it.
I hope the Government will inquire into that
practice and stop it, and that it will buy more
works from Canadian artists, and directly, in
order to encourage them to the utmost
possible.
I have two suggestions to make. One is
that Their Honours the Speakers of both
houses of Parliament should be ex officio
members of the Board of Trustees of the
National Gallery. The second is that the
name "Lorne Building" for the building that
is being constructed across from the Lord
Elgin Hotel to house some paintings, sculptures and works that belong to the National
Gallery, should be changed to the name of
a Canadian artist. There are many of them
to choose from-Maurice Cullen, Clarence
Gagnon, Horatio Walker, Suzor Côté and
many others. The choice would be very
easy, and it would be an inspiration for
everybody and an indication that in future
Canadian artists will have better encouragement from the National Gallery.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Pouliot: The name Arthur Roebuck also could be given to it.

proceeded with, may I ask the Leader of the
Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) if it is his
intention to move at this time that when
the house rises today it stand adjourned
until Monday night or Tuesday night? I
think it is customary at this stage of the
proceedings on Thursday afternoon to make
such a motion.
I note the bills which have come from
the Commons at this sitting dispose of all
the legislation to be considered by the Commons today, with the exception perhaps of
a bill to amend the Indian Act.
Hon. Mr. Haig: That bill is here now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Looking at yesterday's Hansard of the House of Commons I
see that house will be proceeding today with
the estimates of the Department of Citizenship and Immigration and then will go on
to the consideration of the estimates of other
departments. This work will doubtless continue in the Commons tomorrow, in accord
with the custom there, and on Saturday.
Therefore no further legislation could reach
us until Monday, and in any event there is
very little legislation on the Commons Order
Paper which could reach us. I suggest to
the Leader of the Government that we should
adjourn this afternoon until, say, Monday
night or Tuesday night, as apparently there
will be nothing for us to do in the meantime.
Hon. John T. Haig: Honourable senators,
first of all I understand that His Honour
the Speaker will receive notice that the
Deputy of the Governor General is coming
to give assent to bills at a quarter to six
today or tomorrow. I am looking after two
bills which will be called for second reading
very shortly, and as soon as they have been
dealt with I will go over to the House of
Commons and make the necessary inquiries,
then come back and explain the situation
to this house.

CANADA-AUSTRALIA INCOME TAX
AGREEMENT BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. John T. Haig moved the second
reading of Bill 170, to implement an agreement between Canada and Australia for the
avoidance of double taxation with respect
to income tax.
He said: Except to some of our more recent
members, legislation of this kind is not new.
In former sessions we have passed measures of the same character to give force
to agreements between Canada and the

country. It has worked well as between us
and the United States, and ourselves and
Great Britain, and I am sure it will work
well with Australia. The agreement bas been
signed by representatives of both our countries, and all that remains is to ratify it. I
cannot give nearly as brilliant an explanation
of the contents as the honourable senator
from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) did in connection with a similar bill. I thought that
bill was very complicated and intricate, but,
having got used to legislation of this kind
I am now fairly well informed on the
subject.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden:
Honourable
senators, I shall not detain you very long
with any comments I make on this bill. It
is a type of legislation which is beneficial
to Canada, particularly as regards tax conventions with countries where Canadian
businesses and corporations are carrying on
any substantial amount of business.
For those who may be in a reading mood
I suggest that a reasonably complete explanation of the provisions of the present bill
may be found in the Senate Debates of 1956,
when we were considering a similar tax convention with Dennark. Beyond one or two
very general comments I propose only to indicate to you the differences between this
agreement and the last convention of the kind
which came before this house.
In general, of course, the basis of taxability under this agreement is whether or
not the Canadian enterprise or the Australian
enterprise, for what it does in the other country, maintains what is called a permanent
establishment. The definition of "permanent
establishment" is given in the agreement; the
explanations are there, they are very plain,
honourable senators have heard them several
times, and I do not propose to repeat them.
I should point out that the scheme of the
legislation is that the bill appends or attaches the agreement, to which it gives the
force of law; and it provides that, where
there are any inconsistencies between the income tax provisions as contained in the
agreement and the general law of Canada or
of Australia in relation to income tax, the
law as contained in the agreement shall
govern the transaction. So we have agreements
which are given the force of law and enter
into and form part of our general income
tax law.
Some exemptions are provided. Those
which are uniform, in the sense that they
appear in most of the tax agreements into
which we have entered, I do not propose to
refer to now. There is one change which I
regard as significant. Under prior agreements,
if the federal Government maintains a representative in the other country for purposes of
96702-36j

Government business in that country, the
income which that agent received was exempted from income taxation in the -country
where he was working. This concession was
limited to the Government agent or representative of the federal Government. In this
agreement, for the first time, there has been
incorporated this additional provision: that not
only the federal authority but the agent of
any province of Canada or any state in Australia shall have the same exemption. I am
sure this will confer benefits in some cases.
I should point out too that there are certain omissions. Previous agreements contained a specific provision whereby students
and apprentices who went from Canada to
the country with which the agreement was
concluded-Denmark, for instance, or Sweden
-for the purposes of studying in relation to
their school or university work or their apprenticeship, were exempted from taxation
in respect of income from home received by
them in the country where they were so
studying or serving apprenticeship. That provision is omitted from the present agreement.
There is another omission from the present
agreement as compared with the convention
with, for instance, Denmark. Under that
agreement each country retained the right
to impose a withholding tax up to 15 per
cent on dividends which are paid from that
country to persons resident in the other
country. It was provided that if the dividend
was passing from a subsidiary in Denmark
to the parent company in Canada-by "subsidiary" I mean that the parent company
owns more than 50 per cent of the sharesthe withholding tax, instead of being 15 per
cent, was limited to 5 per cent. This latter
provision for reducing under these circumstances the withholding tax from 15 to 5 per
cent bas been omitted from the present
agreement.
There is only one other thing to which I
wish to direct attention. The tax agreement
with Denmark went into considerable detail
in dealing with exchange of information for
purposes of avoidance of fiscal fraud, and the
secrecy which should attach to that information. It also dealt rather fully with the
purposes of avoidance of double taxation, in
that each country would devote its energies
to reducing, wherever the situation might so
expose itself, any incidence of double
taxation. This elaboration does not appear in
the present agreement. I do not think that
fact is significant. To my mind it is only
"prayerful", anyway: the same result is
likely to occur whether or not the specific
language appears in the statute.
Many things that I said when we were
discussing the agreement with Denmark I
do not think it necessary to repeat. However,

SENATE
there is one strange situation which could
occur under all these conventions. For instance, an Australian citizen in Canada, earning income subject to Canadian taxation,
might conform in every respect to the tax
laws of Canada in relation to his returns;
but notwithstanding this, if his home country
suspected that he was not making a full
return, or if it just wanted to know whether
he was paying or not, it is entitled to request
all necessary information in relation to his
earnings in this -country. To me that seems
to be giving a sort of extraterritorial sanction
to the taxation law and possibly the criminal
law of the other country. I have expressed
this view when similar agreements have
been before us but nothing bas happened; the
Government has -continued to make agreements with exactly the same provision in
them. Of course, by the time the agreements
come to us they are in settled form and have
been signed by the authorities of both countries. So we either give them the force of
law or we do not; we cannot amend the
agreements.

where they can get a complete exchange of
information without regard to underlying
effects or how shocking it may be to one's
sense of individual rights. It bothers me a
bit when, in relation to a person who has
been well behaved in Canada, we lend all the
facilities of our law for the gathering of information about him and furnish it to another country to such an extent that we
assist that country in the administration of
its laws. However, beyond saying this, I do
not know if we can do anything about it.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: I should like to ask
the sponsor of the bill (Hon. Mr. Haig) if the
legislation applies to exchange teachers and
students who are in other countries.

Hon. Mr. Hayden: I think I can answer
that question. In the case of our teachers
and professors who go to Australia on a teaching mission for a temporary period not exceeding two years, the income they receive
by way of remuneration in Australia is
exempt from taxation in that country and
they are subject to tax only in their country
of permanent residence, Canada. This proviHon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable sion is similar to one contained in the income

JANUARY 30, 1958

to pass the necessary laws to implement those
agreements. That is the procedure which
has been in effect here and in Great Britain
for many, many years. Instead of doing
that with respect to these tax agreements,
the Government comes to us and dumps the
whole agreement into our laps and asks us
to make the agreement law. Now, the agreement is phrased in the language of agreements, and, as such, is the language of
negotiation and compromise. It is not
couched in the language of statutes, the kind
of material which people read in order to
understand their rights and obligations.
It is almost an impossibility for the
ordinary citizen to read the law in this
expanded form and understand the tax law
as affecting himself as a result of agreements between Canada and other countries.
I do not wonder that the honourable
Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig)
passed the task of explaining the bill to the
honourable senator from Toronto (Hon. Mr.
Hayden), who has made an intensive study
of the provisions of previous tax agreements.
I fancy he is the only person amongst us
who could answer questions on this subject
expeditiously. The agreement is a mass and
tangle of words, words, words.
I am not going to vote against the bill. It
is in the form that the authorities have
adopted in the past, and which I suppose
they will follow in the future, but may I
express the hope that when our tax authorities have entered into all the agreements
desired, and we, under the compulsion of the
circumstances, have ratified them, serious
consideration will be given to my proposal
to turn them all into a uniform statute. Let
us carry out the terms of these agreements,
but let us do so by the enactment of a
statute common to all these countries. Let
us codify and clarify this tangle of law.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Would that not breach the
agreement?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, not at all. These
agreements are all entered into on the understanding that the Crown must get the consent of Parliament before they become law.
How they become law is not a matter for
the other country to consider. The other
party's concern is only that the substance of
the agreement becomes law. I have no objection to making the substance of this agreement into law; I do not like the method we
are adopting to do so.

the differences as between the varlous countries, but, in those agreements where the
terms are identical the statute could apply
to all of them. Where you have made some
exceptions you might have to add a paragraph. I trust that this proposal will be
seriously considered by our law-making body.
Hon. Mrs. Fergusson: Honourable senators,
I should like to pursue my first question and
ask the Leader of the Government (Hon. Mr.
Haig) if he can tell me why the provision
regarding students has been dropped from
this agreement, when it was contained in the
one with Denmark a couple of years ago.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I cannot answer that. The
agreement with Australia was drawn by the
minister and was agreed upon. I think the
number of students going either way is
very few, anyway.
Hon. A. K. Hugessen: Honourable senators, the discussion on this bill has very
distinct echoes of the discussion which took
place on the bill implementing the agreement
with Denmark in 1956. As most of the other
honourable senators who expressed their
views at that time have already spoken on
this bill, I am going to contribute my little
piece.
The way I look at legislation of this
character is that, regardless of any holes we
may pick in any details of the particular
agreement which we are discussing and which
we are asked to approve, the general purport
of the bill is relief from double taxation, and
to the extent to which it does relieve the
citizens in both countries from double taxation I think it should be warmly encouraged.
The only objection which some honourable
senators might raise is that it does not go
far enough. Well, as has been explained
this afternoon, in the form in which this
legislation comes to us we can do only one of
two things. We can either reject it or accept
it. We cannot amend it. If we accept it, even
if we consider it to be insufficient, we to that
extent benefit those residents of Canada who
carry on business in Australia, and equally
those residents of Australia who carry on
business in this country.
I read over the provisions of this agreement and I noticed, as other honourable
senators noticed, and as in particular the
honourable senator from Fredericton (Hon.
Mrs. Fergusson) noticed, that it omitted a
provision which was contained in the Denmark agreement, and I think in some of the
other agreements which we have approved

SENATE
away. Well, I suppose it might have been
advisable to insert a provision of that kind
in this agreement, as it was in the agreement
with Denmark, but, after all, honourable
senators, when we think of our student days
we recall that we were pretty indigent at
that time and had very little income of any
kind. So even if we had inserted the provision in this agreement I rather doubt that
it would have had any material effect.
I have just one further word, in connection
with the argument which my honourable
friend from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr. Roebuck) advanced this afternoon, as indeed he
did when we were considering the treaty
with Denmark. There is much to be said for
his view that general legislation, such as income tax legislation, which affects practically
everybody in the country, should not be
amended in an indirect way such as this.
But I do point out to him that the only way
in which the alternative that he suggests
could be carried into effect would be by
making a series of amendments to our Income Tax Act, and there would have to be
a separate series of those amendments for
every agreement which we make with another country. The provisions of our Income
Tax Act are, in all conscience, complicated
and difficult enough as it is.
An Hon. Senator: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: I shudder at the
thought of increasing by perhaps almost 50
per cent the content of the present Income
Tax Act by adding thereto all the income
tax agreements that we have with other
countries.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: That does not mean that
we would have to amend every section of
our act, as it applies to Canada.
Hon. Mr. Hugessen: Oh, I think you would
have to amend every section which in itself
amended the general law; that would be the
only clear way of doing it.

Hon. Mr. Haig: I move that the bill be referred to the Committee of the Whole. I will
explain why. I want to have one word in the
bill changed. The year 1957 is stated in the
short title of the act and it should be 1958;
the draughtsman in the other house made a
mistake.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Honourable senators,
yesterday I took exception to amending bills
on third reading, and I stand by what I said
then. I had in mind any amendment that goes
to the principle of a bill. I think if honourable senators will re-read my remarks of
yesterday they will agree generally with
what I said regarding the practice of amending a bill on third reading. But the amendment now proposed is a mere detail, and as
far as I am concerned I would consent to
having this amendment made on third
reading.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am quite willing to have
it done on third reading, but I am in the
hands of the house. The mistake is only one
of drafting.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: That is with respect to
section 1?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Why do you not move

Hon. Mr. Haig: I am in the hands of the

FEDERAL-PROVINCIAL TAX-SHARING
ARRANGEMENTS BILL
SECOND READING
Hon. John T. Haig moved the second reading of Bill 247, to amend the Federal-Provincial Tax-Sharing Arrangements Act.
He said: Honourable senators, this bill has
two features: First, it provides for grants by
the federal Government to the Atlantic provinces; and secondly, it provides for an amendment of the tax rental agreements with
respect to contributions by the federal Government to the provinces. I shall deal, first,
with the federal contribution to the provinces
generally; and secondly, with the grants to
be made to the Atlantic provinces.
At present the agreement between the
dominion and the provinces requires that 10
per cent of the income tax collected in a
province shall go to the province, that 9 per
cent of the corporation tax shall go to the
province, and that 50 per cent of the succession duties shall go to the province. That is
the general law today. The first amendment
in this bill would change the provincial
portion of the income tax from 10 per cent
to 13 per cent. At present the Province of
Manitoba, for instance, gets as its share 10
per cent of the income tax collected in that
province. Under this amendment, if the bill
passes, the province will get back 13 per cent.
That arrangement will apply to every province in Canada.
This question arose out of discussions on
whether the extra money should come from
corporation taxes or from income tax. I am
one of those who held the view, and I still
hold it, that in fairness to the province it
should come from income tax, because the
income is earned in the province.
Let me illustrate. If I own some stock in
the Bell Telephone Company of Canada-a
company that is, for the most part, located
in Ontario and Quebec, and to some extent
in the Atlantic provinces-the income I get
from that stock goes to me in Manitoba, and
I make a return on it as part of my income
in that province. It is Manitoba money which
is invested in the Bell Telephone business and
which helps to keep it operating in these
other provinces. Under this bill, instead of
my province getting 10 per cent of that
income it will now get 13 per cent. And,

r sC, 1958

557

as I have said, that arrangement will apply
to every province. That is fair distribution.
It has always been argued that the big
corporations have their head offices in Ontario
or Quebec, and to some extent in British
Columbia, and that when money from
Saskatchewan or the Maritime provinces is
invested in these corporations the benefit of
the taxes goes to the central provinces where
the head offices are located. There has always
been a dispute about that. However, it does
not apply to the income tax feature of the
bill. Whatever portion of the income tax is
given back to the provinces, it represents a
percentage of its own money; it was not
earned anywhere else but in that province.
If the income figures remain as they were
last year, the increase from 10 per cent to
13 per cent will mean an additional contribution to the provinces of $62 million in
the coming fiscal year.
As honourable senators know, the federal
Government had a conference with the provinces last December. There was to have
been a second conference, but as the present
session has lasted much longer than was expected it has not been possible for the federal Government to meet since then with the
provinces. Therefore, an arrangement was
made to increase the contribution to the
provinces, and passage of this bill will put the
new arrangement into effect. It is made at
this time of the year when the provinces
are preparing their budgets, so that they
will have the money on hand to deal with it
in their own provincial affairs.
Hon. Mr. Euler: May I ask the Leader of
the Government a question?
Hon. Mr. Haig: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Does the figure which he
gave with respect to the amount of money
that will go to the provinces represent the
first figure given out by the Minister of
Finance or the -corrected one?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I am not in on the secrets
of the Government, and I cannot answer
that question. I am only giving you the
figure that I have.
Hon. Mr. Euler: Which one is it?
Hon. Mr. Haig: These were the figures
given on the floor of the house, though they
may be a few dollars out one way or the
other. They are based on the anticipated
income tax collections.
The other feature of the bill is that the
federal Government will grant to each of
the Atlantic provinces of New Brunswick,
Nova Scotia and Newfoundland the sum of
$7.5 million a year for the next four years,

SENATE
including this year, -and to Prince Edward
Island $2.5 million, making a total of $25
million a year. This amount added to the
$62 million, makes some $87 million, based
on the estimates, to come out of the federal
treasury. I am not going to argue the question of whether the Atlantic provinces should
have the money or not, but I have no hesitation in saying quite candidly that if any part
of Canada deserves consideration it is the
Atlantic provinces.
Hon. Mr. Barbour: Hear, hear.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I say that because when
I first came down here as a member of this
house my eyes were opened by a very distinguished senator-he is here with us stillfrom the province of Nova Scotia. After
hearing him describe the situation in his
province I wondered whether or not he ever
flew the flag on Confederation Day. I asked
him, and he said he did, but that he
had memories every time he did it.
The western provinces do not have that
record behind them because they all came in
as purely new countries; whereas, the Maritime provinces came in under an agreement,
and they claim-I have no doubt it is truethat conditions were much better with them
before than after Confederation.
This is not a party question at all. It has
been the striving of all political parties to
try to give to the Maritime provinces a better
deal in Confederation, and especially the
the Atlantic provinces. Now I am not sure
about Newfoundland. I have just as much
love for the people of Newfoundland as I have
for those of any other part of the Atlantic
area, but it must be remembered that Newfoundland came into Confederation under
known conditions. It knew what the conditions were; it knew what had happened in the
provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and
Prince Edward Island. So it may be said
that Newfoundland came into Confederation
with its eyes open. But the other Maritime
provinces came in under an appeal of loyalty
-loyalty to Canada and to the British Empire-which may have influenced their business judgrnent, a judgment that would not
have been influenced under other conditions.
* I have no hesitation in saying that as
Leader of the Government in this house I am
happier in proposing this bill than any other
piece of legislation that I have had the honour
to deal with since my appointment. I think
I express the feeling of this house when I say
that the situation in the Maritime provinces
is probably better known in this house than
anywhere else in Canada. Here we are among
men and women from the Maritimes, and we
come to understand how they feel and what
they think; here there is a spirit of family

union that conveys to us the idea of what
people in the other parts of Canada think
about the problems in the Atlantic area.
I am sure the first part of the bill meets
with general approval; and as to the second
part, I think it is a step in the right direction.
We still have a grave problem with us. The
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) may say that we are spending too much money, that the time will come
when we will not have as much income as
we now have. Whether that is right or wrong,
I do not know, but I do know that we are in
one of the queerest periods in the world's
history that we have ever known. You
have only to read your daily newspaper to
come to the conclusion that we seem to be
spending ourselves to the edge of an abyss,
and what is going to happen next nobody
knows. Our Minister of Defence has said,
as other ministers before him have said, that
we are spending too much money on war
preparation. But the other day that quiet,
unassuming man with a cool sense of judgment said that we must be ready for anything that may happen.
The United States is now being told by
people who think that it is a great country,and I say so myself,-that their instruments
of warfare will be of no use if Russia attacks
first. Now, honourable senators, that may
be true or not, I do not know; but I do know
that we are in difficult times. Our taxation
has risen tremendously by reason of our
defence expenditures, and I do not know
any way of stopping them. When your boys
are on the battle front, nothing counts but
getting them back, or at least arming them
so that they have a chance of winning.
I ask the house to pass this bill. It is a
step in the right direction. It is recognition
by the Parliament of Canada that we are
going to do something-first, for the Maritime provinces, because they deserve it; and
secondly, for the other provinces, in order
to give them a chance to receive at least a
little more money to carry on the government
of their provinces.
For these reasons I would urge the house
to give second reading to this bill.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: Honourable senators,
may I ask the honourable gentleman a question? I am not as familiar as I might be
with this bill. Why is the period over which
payments will be made to the Atlantic provinces limited to four years?
Hon. Mr. Haig: I think the four-year
period is largely a parliamentary term. I
did not pay any attention to that feature.
Actually, I think the Prime Minister said

JANUARY 30, 1958
that it was intended to have another federalprovincial conference later on, but this session of Parliament has lasted so long that it
has not been possible to do so. Furthermore,
a conference could not be held now, in any
event, because all the provincial legislatures
are in session. It was thought, therefore,
that by this means we could give them something to go on with for the next four years.
As the Prime Minister pointed out, further
conferences will be held to try to reach
further agreement on the whole proposition.
Hon. Salter A. Hayden: Honourable senators, I want to say a few words on this bill,
but only in reference to the second part of it.
I have no quarrel at all with contributions
that are proposed to be made to the Atlantic
provinces.
So far as the second part of the bill is
concerned, anything that I have to say relates to the principle. I do not see how the
difficulty which I experience could be resolved by reference of this bill to committee,
even if there were committee meetings for
the next month, because, for me, the problem
is a basic one. Maybe I am one of the few
rather than one of the many, but it has
always been my view that the spending
authority and the taxing authority should be
as close together as possible, because in that
way there could be real responsibility as
between the taxpayer and his representative,
which is the levying and collecting authority
and also the spending authority.
I believe that, on account of the special
situation which prevailed during the period
of the war, tax rental agreements at that
time could be justified. But since then I
have never been able to satisfy myself that
it is a good thing that the federal authority
should act as a conduit pipe and levy taxes
upon the people of Canada for purposes
which have no relationship to ordinary
federal spending or for particular objects
of national developrnent, but solely in order
to syphon off the product of the increased
taxes for provincial purposes. I think it is
a bad thing for the provinces to get large
sums of money in this way. It may be said
that people know that taxes are collected for
the purposes of giving the money to the
provinces, but they would know it in a different and much more realistic way if their
particular province were imposing the taxation to provide revenue for necessary services
and developments within the province.
There would then have to be some relationship between the ability of the province to
tax and its available revenues, and it would
have to budget accordingly and spread its
expenditures over the period required to
raise the necessary moneys to take care of

these expenses. It is a negation of the idea of
responsible government that a federal authority imposes taxes to hand the money over to
a provincial authority. I can understand that
the federal authority might impose taxes for
a variety of reasons which are not very
closely related to its specific activities. A
recent example is the provision of special
contributions to the Atlantic provinces. One
may find a basis of this action in the understanding which was reached at the time those
provinces came into Confederation.
Certainly they did so on the basis that their
position was not to deteriorate over the
years, as compared with what it then was,
and in the light of the opportunities which
their situation afforded them; so there is a
federal obligation to improve the economic
picture in the Atlantic provinces and to
endeavour to maintain it on a basis which
bears some equality with what the position
would have been if they had never come into
Confederation. I also recognize that some
developments in a province may be national
in their character, and that federal taxation
to provide money, either for direct spending
on these developments or through the
medium of the province concerned, would
be justified. But it seems to me that the
chain of responsible government breaks
completely when federal revenues are collected merely to be handed over to the
provinces. I venture to say that our corporation tax, instead of being 47 per cent, could
be reduced by 10 or perhaps 15 per cent if
the federal government collected revenues
from this source merely for its own purposes
and the provinces looked after the imposition
and collection of corporation taxes for their
specific purposes.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Would the honourable
gentleman permit a question?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: Yes.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: If less is to be collected
which government would have to get along
with less, the federal government or a provincial government?
Hon. Mr. Hayden: My friend bas posed a
question which is really very simple to
answer. What I say is that the federal Government is now collecting, and bas collected
for all the years the tax agreements have
been in force, vastly more in taxes than it
needs for its own budget and fiscal spending.
The reason it bas done so is that it has
been making these contributions to the provinces for their own use. Therefore, I say, if
the federal authority looked after its own
business and such additional obligations of a
national character as it might have, including
also contributions for certain developments

SENATE
in this or that province, the federal taxation
would be less, the federal revenue would be
correspondingly less, and the provincial
authorities would be left to impose taxes of
their own to the extent necessary to cover
such provincial expenditures as they felt
they could afford. I have added to the permissible federal obligations certain expenditures so far as the Atlantic provinces are
concerned, and also developments beyond the
capacity of a province to handle but of a
character which could be said to have some
national character of importance. But in my
opinion the system of responsible government breaks down when you interpose a
conduit pipe between the taxpayer and the
spending authority, and that is exactly what
the continuance of these tax agreements is
doing. Whether the percentage of personal
income tax which the federal authority gives
to a province is 13 per cent or 10 per cent,
it means that the federal authority has to
find somehow or other more revenue, whether
out of existing taxes, or by increasing taxes,
or by reducing its other expenses in order to
make these additional payments to the
provinces.
So I repeat, upon the principle I have
enunciated, whether the percentage is 10 per
cent or 13 per cent does not matter; the
principle of that kind of giving is wrong,
and when we persisted in continuing these
rental agreements after the war emergency
had passed, it certainly was a retreat from
reality. It is a non-realistic approach to the
taxpayer. From the point of view of the
federal authority it is bad business, because
the federal authority is viewed as a taxgouging ogre, levying high rates of tax,
assembling large revenues, and doling out
money in a miserly way to the provinces, who
are yelling all the time that they are not
getting a fair share of their own dollars for
their own purposes. The very simple way
out of that situation would be for the federal
authority to step out of the field of taxation
in income tax and corporation taxes except
to the extent that it needed money for its
own federal purposes, and then say to the
provincial authorities, "There is the field you
want; there is the field you say is yours; go
ahead and tap it to any extent you dare for
the purposes of provincial development."
I should point out that this amendment is
for the year 1958-59, during which time it is
proposed that the provinces shall get 13 per
cent instead of 10 per cent. I do not pose as
an economic prophet but I believe I possess
ordinary powers of observation and I have
had a little experience in this field. In looking ahead I do not believe it would be a
difficult or irrational conclusion that, based
on present rates of taxation, the revenues

which the federal authority will collect by
way of personal income tax in the year
commencing April 1, 1958, will produce a
smaller amount in dollars than the amount
collected in the tax year which has just concluded. In my view, the 13 per cent increase
will produce less revenue next year than the
10 per cent produced during the past year.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: The Government is just
trying to be equitable.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: The interjection of my
honourable friend is well meant and I always
welcome interruptions, for they give me
something to hang a statement on. If he is
satisfied with the philosophy that it is nice
to be generousHon. Mr. Bruni: Just equitable.
Hon. Mr. Hayden: -and
to give people
more of less, why, then, I can understand
the situation, for next year there is going to
be less. He is saying the Government is being
equitable by giving the provinces more of
less, which means the federal Government
will have less from which to give. Its revenues will shrink because, among other things,
we have increased certain exemptions and
reduced certain rates of personal income tax.
In any event, even if the overall revenues
are buoyant, the Government will not get
the same revenue from the personal income
tax field that it got during the past year. It
may sound as though the provinces will get
more because their share is being increased
from 10 to 13 per cent of the amount of personal income tax collected, but in my opinion
when they ,come to calculate in dollars the 13
per cent on this year's revenue it will amount
to less than the 10 per cent produced from
last year's revenue.
That brings me to a rather interesting explanatory note, which reads in part as
follows:
The purpose of the proposed new section 12 is
to increase the percentage to thirteen for the fiscal
year 1958-59, thus increasing the payments to be
made to the provinces in that year.

I seriously question that statement. I do
not think it is correct. If

after the words

"thus increasing the payments to be made to
the provinces in that year" there had been
added the words "over what they might otherwise get on the existing basis of 10 per cent,"
I could understand that; but, on an overall
basis they are going to receive less from a
13 per cent share in the coming year than
they did from a 10 per cent share last year.
So we speculate and make provision in
the supplementary estimates for an amount
totalling some millions of dollars, and we
find the Premier of Ontario singing in a
little sweeter note-

JANUARY 30, 1958
Hon. Mr. Bruni: He is a good singer.
he thinks
Hon. Mr. Hayden: -because
more bank notes are going to come to his
province. But if I were in his position I
would not do any spending or embark on a
single additional project in the expectation
of getting more money, for in my view there
will not be any additional revenue by reason
of this change from 10 to 13 per cent.
I was curious about one expression used
by the honourable Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig) when he was explaining the
bill. He and I have been very good friends
since I came to this house. I always enjoyed
listening to him when he was Leader of the
Opposition, and I like to peck away at him
now that he is Government Leader in this
chamber. That is why he is sitting there, just
so we can peck away at him. He said something or other about us standing on the edge
of an abyss and I wasn't quite sure whether
he said "abyss" or "Abbott" or just what he
said, and I was wondering what he was referring to.
He also went into the question of the risk
of war and how our children might go overseas and never return. Well, we all have
very serious thoughts about these things,
but of course they have nothing to do with
whether the provinces should get a 10 or 13
per cent share of the federally-collected income tax revenue. It is up to the federal
authority to provide for armament and to
make defence expenditures, and no part of
the provincial share of income tax revenue
is going to be spent on defence matters. It
will all be spent on provincial matters.
Having expressed my views on the principle of so-called tax rental agreements, I am
not concerned as to whether this bill should
go to committee. As a matter of fact, I see
no reason why it should. This legislation
may be a stop-gap or designed to provide
an interim payment intended to pacify the
storming provincial premiers so that a federal-provincial conference will not have to
be called in the immediate future. Whatever
the purpose, I am not concerned with it at
the moment. I am concerned, however, with
the principle of rental agreements, and I
think we will all be better off when the
provinces get back to collecting their own
tax revenues, and we get rid of this business
of putting a conduit pipe into the taxpayers'
pockets and funnelling his dollars through
that pipe to the federal authority and then to
the provincial authorities. The sooner we
get rid of this systerm the better.
Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable senators, I do not intend to delay the house
on this bill. I agree to a large extent with
the remarks just made by the honourable

gentleman from Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden).
I agree, generally speaking, that it is a very
bad principle for one administration to collect
tax revenue and for another to spend it.
However, we have the difficulty in Canada
of some of our ten provinces being, as they
say, more wealthy than the others. Something
has to be done to try to provide the same
The former
standard for all provinces.
administration introduced what was known
as the equalization principle, whereby the
provinces having a lower per capita income
would receive special federal grants designed
to bring the standard of those provinces up
to the same level as that of the others.
I am pleased that this legislation recognizes
the equalization payment formula and that
these special grants will be made under the
legislation now before us.
The honourable gentleman from Waterloo
(Hon. Mr. Euler) asked the Leader of the
Government whether the figures the leader
quoted were from the first or second statement that was given out. Well, when we
realize that two figures were given out, we
must also appreciate that this is very hasty
legislation. It is important legislation, yet
it cannot have received the consideration by
the Government to which it was entitled
before it was presented to the people. Imagine
how the people of British Columbia feel
about this. On Saturday last the Minister
of Finance announced that under this new
legislation the province of British Columbia
would receive $5,563,000 more than it has
been receiving up to this time.
Hon. Mr. Farris: There were big headlines
in the Vancouver papers.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I suppose, then, that
all the people of British Columbia would be
disappointed.
Hon. Mr. Farris: No.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I did not think all
the people would have had an opportunity
of reading the first announcement, but if it
was in big headlines everyone would be
disappointed when they heard on Monday
that instead of $5,563,000 more they would
receive only about half of that amount, or
$2,842,000.
Well, honourable senators, if that is an
indication of the consideration that has been
given to this legislation, I do not suppose that
we can be expected to give too great consideration to it at this time, because we cannot hope to get much information. I do
know that under the former administration
there was given to the provinces $630,878,000.
Under this legislation-and I am not referring to the $25 million being given to the
Maritime provinces-there is being given

SENATE
to the provinces in addition $62,203,000. So
that the provinces now under this legislation
will be receiving $693,081,000.
Hon. Mr. Leger: They may be receiving it.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I am talking of the
contributions under this legislation. The
additional amount is made up of $62,203,000,
under the second clause of this bill, plus $25
million under the first clause, which makes
the total amount $87,203,000.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Even persons other than
the Minister of Finance are having trouble
with figures.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not see why the
Minister of Finance should have difficulty;
he deals with nothing but figures. I never
deal with figures in this amount, except
when I am speaking on legislation of this
type.
The suggestion was made by the Leader
of the Government that it was impossible
to have a dominion-provincial conference
because the provincial legislatures are now in
session. Well, the legislatures only went
into session this week. All of January was
free, and a conference could have been held
then. Oh, my friend will say, Parliament
was in session during January. But honourable senators will recall that many
dominion-provincial conferences have been
held while Parliament was in session. There
is no reason whatsoever why there could not
have been a dominion-provincial conference
early this year, as the provinces expected.
Honourable senators will recall that during and immediately before the last election
the Province of Ontario said, it must have
at least $100 million more. In fact, if my
memory serves me correctly, Mr. Frost
wanted $118 million more, and he said that
he could not get along with less. Well, under
this legislation he gets $22 million, which is
a long way from $118 million. Of course,
it is something, yet it is not one-fifth of the
amount which he almost demanded. Whatever amount he gets, honourable senators, I
think we should know a little more about the
source from which this money is to come.
It is most unfortunate that there has not
been a complete financial statement of this
country presented to Parliament. Why have
we not had a budget? Why have we no
budget now? In the past, expenditures of
this kind have never been made unless a
budget was presented first. Here we are
today passing a bill providing for $87,203,000,
and we do not know whether there is that
amount of money in the treasury to make the
payment. Why? Because there is no budget.
Would it be difficult for the government to
say, "Here, we have this money"? We do

not know whether we are in a sound position at this time to make the payment-no
one knows. We are just voting this money
in the dark, for we are completely in the
dark as to the financial condition of the
Dominion of Canada. Yet we have to go
along with the bill.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: No, we do not have to.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, yes, we do; there
is no doubt about that. We have to go along
with it; we are not going to vote against it.
I am not going to vote against it.
Hon. Mr. Bruni: Surely you are not going
to vote for it?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Oh, surely I am going
to vote for it. The Government must take
the responsibility for providing this money;
it is not going to turn that responsibility
over to anyone else. But the Government
has another responsibility which it is not
fulfilling at this time: it is in not presenting
to this house a financial statement which
would enable us to vote intelligently. If the
Government does not want to do that, it
will have to answer for it.
Honourable senators, the Leader of the
Government referred to world conditions, and
mentioned how uncertain everything was and
how near we may be to the brink of war.
I think we all feel that way. He intimated,
and I think we all agree, that our defence
expenditures must continue. There are two
ways in which we can raise this money,
either by taxation or by reducing expenditurcs. To reduce expenditures we must
reduce materially the expenses of the Department of National Defence. That is completely
inconceivable at this time, in view of the
condition the world is in. Therefore, there
can be no material reduction in our expenditures, and the money can come from taxation
only.
Now we come back to the point raised by
the honourable senator from Toronto-Trinity
(Hon. Mr. Roebuck)Hon. Mr. Euler: The money can be raised
by borrowing, I suppose.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: To borrow is to put
us into debt. If the money cannot be raised
by taxation, that means that eventually it
will have to be raised by borrowing, and
that in turn would result in taxation. No,
honourable senators, I see no way of providing this money except by taxation. The
danger is that when the Government taxes
and raises the money and gives it to a provincial Government, the people of that
province which receives the money are apt
to feel they are getting something for nothing.
Of course, no province will get something

JANUARY 30, 1958
for nothing, because the people are going
to have to pay. The day of payment may be
put off, but it will arrive sooner or later.
It may be that the Government is prepared
for deficit financing. But deficit financing
cannot go on for ever; the day for payment
will come. Although I am going to vote for
this bill, I do so with regret, feeling that
we should have more information.
I agree with the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden) that there is no
purpose in sending this bill to a committee.
If it were sent to a committee, the question
I rould ask is, "Have we got the money?"
But if the Minister of Finance was not able
to answer the question in the other house,
I am sure we could not get an answer here.
Honourable senators, in closing I wish to
say that although this money is going to
the provinces, neither the provinces nor the
people are getting something for nothing;
some day we are going to have to pay.
Hon. Austin C. Taylor (Westmorland):
Honourable senators, I wish to say only a
word or two and to ask a couple of questions
in connection with the bill. I regret that my
voice will not permit me to speak so that I
can be heard by all.
I should like also, Mr. Speaker and honourable senators, to express iny regret at being
absent yesterday when the Agricultural
Stabilization Bill was considered. I did want
to speak on it, but sickness overtook me during the weekend, and it was not possible for
me to be here. Perhaps I should not be here
today.
I should like to express my views with
respect to the tax rental agreements. First of
all, may I say that I am one who agrees with
the principle of the tax agreements. The
honourable Leader of the Opposition (Hon.
Mr. Macdonald) said a few moments ago that
one of the purposes of this bill is to try to
equalize the income of the various provinces
across Canada. I think we will agree that
the present tax rental agreements do to a
degree equalize the per capita income, or the
conditions which permit the income of certain provinces to be more on a par with that
of the wealthier provinces.
The sum of $25 million wbich will be voted
by the first part of this bill will assist in
bringing up the Maritime provinces to the
average per capita income across Canada; it
will at least bring it up closer to the average,
or, in any event, will be some help in doing
so.
Let me say this with respect to the industrial central provinces, that we must not
forget the fact that the Atlantic provinces
and some other provinces are contributing to
their wealth. Alnost everything we il the

Maritime provinces buy is manufactured in
Quebec or Ontario, and thus we contribute to
the wealth of these provinces.
The tax rental agreements probably did not
go far enough. They were an attempt to
equalize the share of wealth among those
provinces-probably I should not call them
"have-not provinces"-which have not found
it possible to share to the same degree as
some other provinces in the economic development of the country.
Having said that, I should like to ask one
or two questions. First, on the basis of this
grant to the Maritime provinces of $25 million
-made
up of $7J million each to New
Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland,
and $2 million to Prince Edward Islandwas it the result of any formula or principle
on which the Government can hang its hat,
or was it just a figure that was pulled out of
the air which represents an amount that
might be satisfactory to the Governments of
those provinces?
My second question may have been answered by the honourable senator from
Toronto (Hon. Mr. Hayden). It is with
respect to the second clause of the bill, which
refers to the fiscal year 1958-59. Am I right
in assuming that the payments will begin in
the fiscal 1958-59 and continue indefinitely,
or does it cover only the fiscal year 1958-59?
Hon. Mr. Haig: In answer to the first question asked by my honourable friend, I may
say that was just the estimated amount that
the Government ought to give. It is purely
an estimate..
On the second question, the grant is for
the fiscal year 1958-59, which starts on April
1, the date on which all the agreements start.
The Prime Minister has promised that there
will be a conference within the year, so
before the year ends the matter can be fairly
settled.
Hon. Mr. Robertson: My honourable friend
the Leader of the Government did not answer
the question as to what formula was used
to arrive at the amounts being contributed
to each province.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I understand it was by
negotiation with two of the provinces-my
friend's province, and one other-and perhaps all, four of them. That was the amount
éstimated to be a fair contribution, considering' the whole situation.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wes±morlandh May I ask
the honourable leader whether the amount
of $71 million to be paid to New Brunswick
is the restilt of negotiation with the Government of that, province, and whether that
Goverùment 1s satisfied with this amount?-

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would not like to say that
it is satisfied. That is the amount that was
decided upon as a fair contribution to the
province, to be paid each year over a period
of four years.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): But it was
not determined by any particular formula?
Hon. Mr. Haig: No; that is a straight contribution.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Honourable senators,
may I ask the honourable senator from Westmorland (Hon. Mr. Taylor) if he justifies on
the grounds of equalization the payments of
millions of dollars every year to the provinces of Ontario, Quebec and British
Columbia?
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not think
Ontario gets an equalization payment.
Hon. Mr. Taylor (Wesimorland): As I understand it, there are no equalization payments to the provinces of Ontario and Quebec. These are payments to the Atlantic
provinces to equalize their position with that
of the richer provinces.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I do not think the bouse
has followed the significance of my question.
The only justification, or attempted justification, for these payments by the dominion
Government to the provincial Governments,
is on the basis of equalization. How can you
apply that principle of equalization to the
payments to the richest provinces?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: May I interject a word,
honourable senators? I think the honourable
senator should keep before him the fact that
there are two parts to this bill. One part deals
with the equalization payments and nothing
else; that is the first section, which provides
for payments to the Atlantic provinces. The
second part of the bill deals with an increase
from 10 per cent to 13 per cent of the province's share in the income tax collections and
has nothing to do with equalization payments.
That is an additional payment to all
provinces.
Hon. Mr. Euler: An additional subsidy.

we have been doing that ever since the
session began: enactment after enactment has
been passed during this session, imposing a
heavy drain on the federal treasury amounting to many millions of dollars. Yet I cannot
recall one single piece of legislation of a
constructive nature that is going to help meet
the drain of this succession of attacks on the
treasury. I would like to ask my honourable friend the Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Haig), or any honourable member of this Senate, if anybody bas made a
serious attempt to add up the total expenditures by which we this session are increasing
the drain on the federal treasury? I spoke
here last fall on this question. A lot of
legislation bas since been passed. At that
time I pointed out that what we were doing
was putting our hand into the pot of gold
that had been provided by previous Governments and spreading it around.
Honourable senators, I think the time has
come for the Government to tell us, either
by a budget or a frank statement, how many
millions of dollars the performance of this
session is going to cost the country. Then,
after we have been told that, I think we
ought to be told how the Government is
going to look after it. Will the Government's
action be consistent with the promise of
decreased taxes or merely a postponement
of the evil day?
It seems to me honourable senators, that
these are vital questions that cannot lightly
be passed over, and they should not be headed
off until after there is an election.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Bruni: There is no equalization
payment in this bill for British Columbia,
Manitoba or Quebec. It is only in respect of
the four named provinces.

senator from Toronto-Trinity (Hon. Mr.
We are now at about the end of the session Roebuck) that although he did not like the
and we are passing legislation that imposes principle of the Agricultural Stabilization
heavy demands on the federal treasury. But Bill, which we passed yesterday, I feel sure

JANUARY 30, 1958
he will agree with the principle of this bill
and that it will be more palatable to him.
Honourable senators, this bill is one to
provide vacations with pay for employees
who do federal work and are employed in
federal undertakings.
The legislation will
benefit employees in works and undertakings
connected with shipping, navigation, railways, canals, telegraphs, interprovincial pipe
lines and other interprovincial activities
which of course include ferries, aircraft,
radio broadcasting, banks, one or two
specified industries such as uranium, and
certain industries that are specified in the
bill. With respect to a specified industry,
the best example is the Hudson Bay Mining
and Smelting Company, which bas a mine
in operation on the border between Saskatchewan and Manitoba. That company on
that operation bas been specified under this
bill because at times the workers are engaged
underground in Manitoba and at other times
they work undergound in Saskatchewan.
Both provincial Governments asked to have
that particular industry specified under this
bill.
The purpose of the bill is to provide
minimum vacations with pay for the people
who are engaged in these particular industries. There is no desire here to fix
any maximum benefit but rather it is the
purpose of the Government to fix a minimum
which will enure to each employee.
, Roughly, the bill provides that any person
who has been employed for two years or
more by the time this bill comes into force
shall be entitled to two weeks' vacation with
pay. The bill is retroactive. Supposing it
comes in force on January 31 this year, an
employee who had been with a firm for
a year up to that date and then continued
on for another year after the act came into
force-thus having been employed for at
least two years-would be entitled to two
weeks' vacation with pay. Persons who have
been employed for only one year shall be
entitled to one week's vacation with pay.
The employee who has worked two years
or more will receive 4 per cent of his annual
earnings as vacation pay; the person who bas
been employed for a period of only one year
of course shall be entitled to receive half
of that amount, namely, 2 per cent.
The bill contains two definitions of a year
of employment. The first definition may be
stated as follows: Year of employment means
continuous employment of an employee by
one or more employers for a period of 12
consecutive months beginning with the day
the employment began or any subsequent
anniversary day thereafter. For instance, if
an employee goes to work on January 31,

1958, the year of employment would be up
on the 31st day of January, 1959. That is one
definition of a year of employment.
The second definition of a year of employment is any calendar year or any fiscal year.
There -are a number of firms throughout the
dominion of Canada that do not operate their
business on a calendar year basis but rather
on a fiscal year basis, so the year may run
from April 1 of one year to March 31 of the
following year. But before any company can
use that definition the consent of the minister must be obtained.
Once the bill becomes law it will apply to
*a year of employment which has begun
before the commencement of the act but bas
been completed after the bill becomes law.
In other words, once the bill becomes law,
employees will be given credit for past
services. It applies to the year of employment, if the employment bas begun before
the bill becomes law and is completed after
that time. It also bas application to a year
of employment begun within two years prior
to the passing of this bill, if the employee was
continuously employed thereafter with one
employer.
There are many special features, which I
do not intend to go into in detail, but I should
like to mention a few. For instance, if an
employee is entitled to a week's holiday with
pay, and a statutory holiday-such as Labour
Day-falls within that period, he shall be
paid for that day in addition to his week's
holidays. But it must be a recognized statutory holiday for which firms usually pay
wages. However, if a firm allowed its employees a holiday on Armistice Day, November 11, but witbout pay, an employee whose
week's holiday occurs in the period covered
by Armistice Day would not be entitled to
the extra day's pay.
It also is provided that the employer must
grant the holiday period not later than 10
months after the completion of the year's
work. In other words, the holiday period
cannot be delayed longer than 10 months
after the end of any year. An employee can
actually work a maximum of 22 months before he gets any vacation with pay.
Another provision is that if a business is
transferred from one employer to another the
purchaser of the business must assume all
liabilities in respect of holiday pay which
existed at the time of transfer. This, of course,
is fair and necessary.
It is further provided that, where employment is terminated before the completion of
a year of employment, the employer shall
pay any vacation pay then due for a prior
year of employment. For instance, if the
employee had worked 14 months and had not

SENATE
had any vacation with pay, he would be entitled to receive it for the prior 12 months
and also for the further two-month period.
The bill does not take effect until a person
bas worked at least 30 days for one employer.
It was the feeling of the department and the
Government that an employee should be employed for 30 continuous days with one
employer before he could benefit under the
bill.
Some honourable senators may wonder why
the Government, in this connection, has
adopted a policy which is popularly known
as one year, one week's vacation with pay;
two years or more, two weeks' vacation with
pay. It was learned that this formula is in
operation in five provinces; in two provinces
there is the two-week formula effective after
the first year; and three provinces have no
legislation relating to this particular subject.
The bill further provides that where any
employee, under a collective bargaining
agreement or any other labour agreement, is
entitled to greater benefits with respect to
vacations with pay than are provided for in
the bill, such collective bargaining agreement
or other labour agreement shall apply. In
other words, this bill provides a minimum
benefit; and if an employee has any greater
benefit, it is preserved for him.
By a further clause, regulations can be
made by the appropriate administration, and
the drafters of the bill have taken the trouble
to set out in detail nine or ten subjects on
which they believe regulations will be
necessary. There was also inserted a general
clause under which regulations can be made
with respect to any other matter which may
arise; this is to make the measure flexible,
so that the bill can be properly and efficiently administered.
Finally-and this, to me, is a very interesting clause-it is provided that any employer
who violates the provisions of this legislation is subject to a fine with a maximum of
$500. Further, the criminal court which hears
the charge may make a further order directing that any amount of vacation pay due to
the employee concerned shall be paid, and
if it is not paid the defaulting employer can
be committed to prison.
The bill also provides that the employee
shall have one year in which to lodge any
complaint that he has with respect to any
employer.
Under the Criminal Code the
time limit is six months, but it was felt that
employees should have the full period of one
year in which to make their complaints. I do
not think I have anything further to add.
I have been provided with a brief by the
Department of Labour and I think I can

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: Would the honourable
senator tell us what conference bas been
held between the drafters of the bill, himself, as sponsor, and the labour leaders?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I made inquiries as to
that, and the procedure which was adopted
and followed was this. The bill was drafted
and then sent to labour unions and employers,
who made a study of it. Certain discussions were held between labour unions and
various employers, and then, I understand,
the bill came out in its final form. However, there was one important amendment
made to the bill in the House of Commons
yesterday, and I might call it to the attention of the Senate. This was an amendment
to section 3 of the bill, which originally had
only one clause. A second clause was added,
which reads:
This act does not apply to employment under a
collective agreement entered into after the coming
into force of this act and containing provisions,
approved by the minister, for the granting of an
annual vacation with pay.

It is agreed by everyone that no minister
would ever approve of a collective bargaining agreement that contained fewer rights
for employees with respect to vacation with
pay than are contained in this bill. That is
why that clause was added.
Hon. Mr. Wall: I wish to ask a question.
It is not intended to detract from the value
of this legislation. To what extent does this
bill give statutory validation to conditions
which now exist? To what extent are vacations with pay, as foreseen in this legislation,
actually being given now? Is this merely a
statutory validation of existing conditions
or can the honourable senator tell us what
conditions with respect to holidays with pay
this legislation is designed to meet? How
many people will be affected?
Hon. Mr. Bruni: I cannot say how many
people will be affected, but the purpose of the
bill is to provide that every employee engaged
in federal works, undertakings or businesses
will be assured of a minimum annual holiday
with pay. You cannot give these employees
any less than the minimum, but this is not
by any means to be considered as the maximum. For instance, railway employees will
come under the act but they will not use it,
because their benefits are greater now under
a collective bargaining agreement than they
would be under the act. All those rights are
preserved under this bill, which does not
take anything away from labour. It ensures

Hon. Mr. Roebuck: I am not going to

of this kind of thing from this administration.
Every bill which has come to this house
lately has been delayed until the last
moment. We are on the verge of rising, and
we are asked to pass bills which are full of
detail, and give them three readings in a
single sitting. Perhaps representations might
be made to us concerning them. I do not
like it.
Hon. Mr. Brunt: May I say to the honourable senator that I am quite willing to have
this bill referred to a committee.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: The bill can be placed
on the Order Paper for third reading
tomorrow.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: Honourable senators,
I appreciate the welcome I received the other
day, as I also appreciate the applause with
which you greet me at the present moment.
I am very pleased indeed to be able to take
part once more in the work of this chamber.
I assure honourable senators that this bill
which I am sponsoring will not give them
very much difficulty, and I doubt very much
if the bill will need to go to a committee.
Perhaps it might also receive third reading
today. I say that because this legislation,
I am informed, was in contemplation by the
previous administration, but had not been
brought down before the election.

I have the honour to inform you that the Honourable Patrick Kerwin, P.C., Chief Justice of
Canada, acting as Deputy of His Excellency the
Governor General, will proceed to the Senate
Chamber today, the 31st January, at 5.45 p.m., for
the purpose of giving Royal Assent to certain
bills.
I have the honour to be,
Sir,
Your obedient servant,
J. F. Delaute,
Secretary to the Governor General.
(Administrative).
The Honourable
The Speaker of the Senate,
Ottawa.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask a question
of the Acting Leader of the Government
(Hon. Mr. Aseltine)? If the Deputy of His
Excellency is coming here for any other purpose than is stated in the letter just read,
shall we receive prior notice of that? Or may
he be coming here this afternoon for another
purpose than is stated in the letter?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: Don't ask me; I don't
know anything about it.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: May I ask a supplementary question of the Acting Leader of the
Government? Does he expect the Leader of
the Government (Hon. Mr. Haig) to be in his
place this afternoon and able to give me that
information?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not know what
information he will give you, but he will be
here a little later on.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Thank you.
CANADA-AUSTRALIA INCOME TAX
AGREEMENT BILL
AMENDMENT CONCURRED IN BY COMMONS

The Hon. the Speaker informed the Senate
that a message had been received from the

The Standing Committee on Banking and Commerce, to whom was referred the Bill (249)
intituled: "An Act to amend the Northwest Territories Act", have in obedience to the order of
reference of January 30, 1958, examined the said
bill, and now report the same without any
amendment.

The report was adopted.
THIRD READING
The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
when shall this bill be read the third time?
Hon. Mr. Aselline: I move the third reading now.
Hon. Arthur W. Roebuck: Honourable
senators, all here will remember the remarks
made in this chamber on second reading of
this measure. The bill was referred to committee, and was considered at some length
this morning. The Minister of Northern
Affairs and National Resources, who has
jurisdiction over the Northwest Territories,
and Mr. MacLeod of the Department of
Justice, were present, and the points I raised
yesterday were discussed.
Honourable senators will remember that
the bill would give the commissioner certain
powers for the borrowing of money for territorial, municipal or local purposes and for
the lending of money to municipalities and
school districts in the Territories, and that
under the bill he would require the approval
of the Governor in Council for borrowing
money but not for lending. I expressed the
view in committee, as I did in this chamber
yesterday, that he should not be empowered
either to borrow or to lend money without
the approval of the Governor in Council.
The minister pointed out that in the past the
commissioner has performed these services,
and moreover that it was the desire of the
present administration, as indeed it had been
of the last administration, to give to the local
authorities in the Territories a greater
autonomy than they have enjoyed hitherto,

JANUARY 31, 1958
and, in fact, to develop them for the complete management of their own affairs. Well,
that of course is quite satisfactory to me. I
can foresee the time when they will be
required to take over the management of
their affairs, and in a democratie country that
is good.
Nevertheless, I do think it should have
been clearly stated that loans should not be
made by the commissioner, but by the commissioner in council, and I so proposed.
However, we were, I think, good natured
about the matter in committee, and the bill
has come back to the bouse without any
amendrnent. I still hold the view that we
should have cleared up beyond all preadventure that loans are made by the commissioner in council and not, as expressed
in this bill, by the commissioner.
But the other section of the bill, section 2,
I look on as being much more serious. There
has been a movement among people who are
informed in these matters-I am one of
them-to increase the status and so on of
our police courts. In the province of Ontario,
when I was Attorney General, we appointed
only barristers as police magistrates and
we made a change requiring that they should
be stipendiary magistrates, that they should
not carry on any business other than that of
a magistrate and thus should not be subject
to outside influences. They are judges just as
much as are the presiding officers on the
County and Supreme Court bench. They may
decide cases that are of more importance to
humanity than do some of the superior courts.
The act as it now stands provides that a
magistrate in the Territories shall live therein
and shall be a stipendiary magistrate, not
carrying on the practice of law or engaged
in any other business. That is the rule now,
and it is a good rule.
Of course, there must be this qualification,
that at times it is necessary that a magistrate
be replaced by a temporary substitute. In
the Northwest Territories it is imperative on
certain occasions that the administration be
able to send the magistrate to some remote
town, or possibly out into the wilds on a
particular job; and should the present one
magistrate fall ill or for any other reason
be unable to carry on his duties, it is essential
that a substitute be appointed to take his
place. But these would be temporary
appointments.
I have no desire to prevent the administration from appointing a temporary magistrate
who is a practising solicitor and allowing
him to carry on his business. We do that in
the province of Ontario; it is satisfactory
so long as it is temporary. But this bill seeks
to provide that deputy police magistrates
may be appointed and that the provisions of

the act as it now stands requiring residence
within the Territories and prohibiting the
carrying on of a law practice shall not apply
to these deputies. I do not like that, because
it is obvious that as population increases in
that territory the one magistrate who is now
sitting will, in the very nature of things,
have a deputy. That deputy may be and
likely will be a permanent appointee. At
some time in the future he certainly will be.
The bill opens the way for the appointment
in the Territories of a permanent deputy magistrate who is at the same time a practising solicitor.
I do not look upon my protest in connection with this measure as entirely futile or
unfruitful, because it is my impression that,
as a result of what has been said, the administration will be much more stringent
than the act, and if a deputy magistrate is
appointed by the department it will likely
be required that during his term of office
he shall not carry on his profession as a
solicitor. I hope so; but if that is the result
it will be due to the good sense of those in
the department rather than to our care in
the passing of this bill. The bill permits appointments without that requirement, and
it is just too bad for us to pass it.
Hon. Mr. Farris: Will you propose an
amendment?
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: No, because someone
moved in committee that the bill be adopted
as it stands, and the motion was agreed to.
I suggested that it be amended. I, however,
pointed out that the amendment should be
drawn with a good deal of care, because I had
no desire to interfere in the matter of residence. I was unconcerned whether an appointee resided in or outside the Territories;
I was interested only to prevent the appointment of a permanent deputy magistrate or a
magistrate who during his tenure of office
would be allowed to practise as a lawyer.
During the discussion of the form of amendment, somebody moved that we approve the
section as it stands. That seemed to be the
will of the committee, and approval was
given. That, however, does not prevent me
from expressing, as is my right, my opinion
when we are on third reading. I intend to
vote against this measure so that it shall be
on record that, I, at least, disagree with
the giving of this power to the administration.
At the same time I express the hope that if
the bill is carried the actual administration
will be better than the act.

unable to provide for themselves in a white
community. Consequently, they drifted back
to Indian reserves, where they were allowed
to remain, although not legally entitled to
do so, and over the years they and their
familities came to be recognized as treaty
Indians.
Section 5 of the Indian Act provides for an
Indian register, consisting of band lists and
general lists, in which shall be recorded the
name of every person who is entitled to be
registered as a Indian. The section is short,
and I will read it:
An Indian register shall be maintained in the
department, which shall consist of band iats and
general lists and in which shall be recorded the
name of every person who is entitled to be
registered an Indian.

Section 7 of the act provides that the
registrar may at any time delete from a
band list or a general list, which together
make up the Indian register, the name of any
person who is not entitled to have his name
included in that list. Subsection 1 of section
7 reads as follows:
The registrar may at any time add to or delete

from a band list or a general list the name of
any person who, in accordance with the provisions
of this act, is entitled or not entitled, as the case
may be, to have his name included in that list.

Subsection 2 provides:
The Indian register shall indicate the date on
which each name was added thereto or deleted
therefrom.

Section 12 sets out certain classes of persons not entitled to be registered as Indians,
and includes a person who has received or
has been allotted half-breed lands or money
scrip, and his descendants.
Subsection 1
reads:
The following persons are not entitled to be
registered, namely, a
(a) a person who
(t> has received or has been allotted half-breed
lands or money scrip,
(iI) is a descendant of a person described in
subparagraph (i).

persons to whom the list relates and in all other
places where band notices are ordinarily displayed.

Section 9 of the act provides for a period
of protest, six months in extent, during which
time the council of the band or other memabers may protest the inclusion or omission
of any name. This section alse provides that
the registrar shall investigate such protests
and render a decision, which is subject to
appeal for three months to a county court
judge. Honourable senators will remember
the dispute which arose about a year ago
among the Hobbema Indians and which went
before the courts.
Arising out of the original posting of membership lists in 1951, there were 409 protests
against inclusions and 220 against omissions.
These were investigated by the registrar and
decisions were rendered. In 100 cases requests were made to have the registrar's decision referred to a judge for review. This
was done in each case, and the final result
of the protests and appeals was that 2,245
individuals were found to be entitled to be
registered, and 21 individuals were not entitled to be registered. Of the latter group,
12 were found not entitled to be registered
on account of non-Indian paternity, and 9
because they descended from persons who
had received scrip.
Now I come to the bill itself, which is
very simple. Section 12 of the act provides
in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph
(a) that persons who have received or have
been allotted half-breed lands or money scrip,
and their descendants, are not entitled to be
registered as Indians. The purpose of the
amendment proposed in the bill is to make
this provision inapplicable to persons who
are now registered and to their descendants.
I hope the amendment will meet with the
approval of this chamber.
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: May I ask the sponsor
of the bill if there are any persons not
registered under the act, but who desire to
be registered, and will not therefore benefit
by the bill? Are there any persons who have
the same right to be registered as those who
are registered? Does the bill go far enough?
Hon. Mr. Aseline: This only goes so far
as to certify to the list as it stands at the
present time. If there are any persons not
on the list I cannot see how they can get on,
because they had three months in which to
make their appeal.

Section 12 contains other provisions, but
these are the important ones pertaining to
this bill.
Honourable senators, the purpose of the
proposed legislation is to revoke the authority which the Registrar of Indians has
under section 7 of the Indian Act to delete the
name of a person from the Indian register,
on the ground that he received half-breed
lands or money scrip or is a descendant of

SENATE
Hon. Mr. Roebuck: This bill satisfies the
representatives who would speak on behalf
of the Indians, does it?
Honm. Mr. Aseltine: Every one who is entitled to be on the register is now on.
Hon. Mr. Golding: May I ask the honourable senator a question? Was the legislation
that he is now seeking to amend brought into
effect as the result of an inquiry made by a
committee which spent a lot of time inquiring
into the Indian situation some years ago?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think so. These
amendments were brought in as the result
of the court proceedings which took place on
appeal by the 100 persons who said they were
entitled to be on the list but were left off.
Hon. Mr. Golding: It will be recalled that
that committee sat and carried on its investigation over a lengthy period. It made certain
recommendations that are now being changed.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I do not think that is
the only reason why this bill is presented.
It was not put forward until after certain
appeals were taken. Whether the decision
to introduce the bill was made as a result of
the judgment which was delivered by the
court that heard the cases, I am not sure.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the second time.

Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I did not say the bill
was involved; I said it was quite simple. It is
really intended to bring into effect the judgment of the court which decided that these
Indians were entitled to be on the register.
That is all it amounts to, and I can see no
reason why we should go into the whole
Indian Act to see what other amendments
should be made. This bill provides one simple
amendment.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: I do not think the bill
should get third reading today. No reason for
urgency has been shown. I feel very strongly
that third reading should stand until we have
had an opportunity to read today's Hansard,
and then, on Monday night or whenever the
Senate sits again, the bill could be given third
reading.

THIRD READING POSTPONED

Hon. Mr. Vien: Honourable senators, on a
point of order: Under the rules of the house
the bill cannot receive second and third readings on the same day, except with unanimous
consent. I am quite sure there would be
unanimous consent if it were shown that there
is urgent need for passage of the bill today.
If the Senate is going to sit on Monday and
Tuesday of next week there is no reason why
the third reading could not stand until that
time; but if there is an important reason why
we shall not sit on Monday and Tuesday we
might agree to the third reading today.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators, when shall this bill be read the third
time?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I move this bill be read
the third time now.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is there any urgency
requiring the third reading of this bill now?
Why can it not be allowed to stand until the
next sitting?
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I thought it was such
a simple measure that there would be no
objection to giving it third reading now.
There will be a Royal Assent at 5.45, and
I can see no reason why this bill should be
put over for another sitting.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: There will more than
likely be another Royal Assent to bills shortly.
A number of questions were asked here this
afternoon about the bill, and I think it should
go to a committee. I do not insist on that,
but I feel the bill is of sufficient importance
that we should have an opportunity to read
the remarks of the honourable senator who
explained it. It is quite an involved measure,
and unless there is some very good reason
why it should be given third reading at this
time I suggest that it be allowed to stand
until the next sitting.

The Hon. the Speaker: Honourable senators,
it has been moved by the Honourable Senator
Aseltine, seconded by the Honourable Senator
Horner, that this bill be now read the third
time. Is it your pleasure to adopt the motion?
Hon. Mr. Farris: With deference, I submit
that the bill cannot be read a third time now

Hon. Mr. Roebuck:

That rule has been

senators,

Hon. Mr. Vien: If the honourable senator
from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner) will
yield for one moment, I may say that the
Clerk of the Senate has just advised me that
the rule governing notice for the third reading
of public bills has been suspended. That
being so, my remarks are unfounded.
But even though the rule has been suspended, there remains the question whether
there is any urgent reason why this bill
should be given the third reading now. I
agree with the honourable Leader of the
Opposition (Hon. Mr. Macdonald) that if
there is no substantial reason for urgency we
should have an opportunity to read what has

JANUARY 31, 1958
been said on the motion for second reading of
the bill. We should be allowed a day or two.
Hon. Mr. Horner: Honourable senators,
I live within a few miles of two Indian
reservations, and I can go a little further in
commenting on the effect of the provisions
of the bill than did the honourable senator
who explained it.
Many Indians who never considered themselves of pure descent were faced with the
threat of banishment from their reserve.
Some of the reserves have become quite
valuable property, by reason of the discovery
of oil, and the threat of banishment of these
Indians caused considerable difficulty. They
appealed to the court for assistance, because
there was considerable ill feeling on the
reserve.
As has already been said, this bill could be
referred to a committee, but we would not
get any more information there than we
now have. It is a simple and straightforward bill to implement the direction of the
court that those Indians who are recognized
and are in the band shall not be removed
from the register.
I think this is one of the simplest bills
that have come before the Senate in my time.
It satisfies the Indians, and one can see that
there is some urgency attached to it. There
is drilling for cil on some reserves, and passage of the bill would prevent quarrelling
among the Indians. I fail to understand
what necessity there is for holding the third
reading of this bill over for another day.
,Hon. Mr. Farris: Honourable senators, I
am beginning to think there must be a
necessity. I have been in this house almost
as long as has my honourable friend who
has just spoken, and I do not recall any
occasion, whether the rules had been
suspended or not, when the ordinary rule of
allowing at least one day to intervene between
the second and the third readings of a bill
was not followed, except when there was
some vital reason for it.
Hon. Mr. Aseltine: I have no objection to
the order for third reading going over to
the next sitting.
The Hon. the

Hon.

Ross

Macdonald:

Honourable

senators, the order which has just been
called has been standing on our Order Paper
for a number of days, and, as it may not be
proceeded with further this session, may I
be permitted to refer to a relevant matter
of much importance?

I was very pleased to read in the press
that a six-member Royal Commission, headed
by the Honourable Senator Donald Cameron,
has been appointed by the Government of
Alberta to study elementary and secondary
education in that province. When the
honourable senator's inquiry on education
was initiated in the Senate it was received
with mixed feelings. Some honourable members thought the matter should not be discussed here, while others felt strongly that
it should. It was discussed, and we had some
excellent speeches on it.
I regard it as a compliment to not only
Senator Cameron, but to this house, that he
has been chosen by the Province of Alberta
to head this important Royal Commission.
The other members of the commission are:
Mrs. Wilma Hansen, of Calgary, past president of the Alberta Federation of Home and
School Associations; Mrs. W. C. Taylor, of
Wainwright, Alberta, past president of the
Farm Women's Union of Alberta; Professor
G. L. Mowat, of the University of Alberta;
Norman W. Douglas of Calgary, and John S.
Cormack, an Edmonton lawyer. I mention
these names so that the house will realize the
importance which the province of Alberta attaches to this problem of education.
The specific matters which the commission
will study are:
(1) The curricular program of the several school
levels.
(2) The attainment of school pupils and the procedure governing their classification and promotion.
(3) The extent to which various special services
are desirable and necessary and the nature of
those services which should be adopted as integral
parts of the educational system of the province.
(4) Types of school organization.
(5) Physical facilities.
(6) The quality and supply of teachers.
(7) Relationship of the education system to the
requirements
of
industry
and
the
modern
community.
(8) The economics of education.

Honourable senators will recall that many of
the subjects which the commission will study
were discussed in this house.
I bring the appointment of this commission to the notice of the house because, as I
have said, I feel that it is a compliment to
not only one of our senators but also to the
Senate.

Hon. W. Ross Macdonald: Honourable
senators, I have now had an opportunity of
reading the remarks of the honourable
senator who explained the bill (Hon. Mr.
Aseltine) and also those of the honourable
senator from Blaine Lake (Hon. Mr. Horner).
I think the legislation is very desirable. I
am in complete accord with it and intend to
support it.
The motion was agreed to, and the bill
was read the third time, and passed.
BUSINESS OF THE SENATE
Hon. Mr. Haig: Honourable senators,
move the adjournment of the house.

Hon. Mr. Macdonald: Is there any reason
why this house should meet on Monday?
There is no business on our Order Paper. The
House of Commons is considering estimates,
and I cannot conceive of any way in which
further legislation, other than for supply,
could come to us from the other place. I
wonder if the Leader of the Government
could take us into his confidence and tell
us whether he thinks we shall have business
to conduct on Monday.
Hon. Mr. Haig: I would think about the
14th of June.
There may be a Supplementary supply bill
coming that has not been passed yet by the
Commons, but whether it will be put through
or not I do not know.
Hon. Mr. Macdonald: What about the 14th
